Boeing Crisis,"Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “ continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max ”, but that “ out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public ” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing ’ s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane ’ s nose repeatedly pointing down. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max."
Brexit,"That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. Logic would suggest his only option now would be to agree a tweaked deal with the EU and bring it back to parliament in October. An NI-only arrangement does, however, allow the UK to pursue its own trade policy, unlike the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. Confused by the latest developments in the UK ’ s fraught departure from the European Union? The Democratic Unionist party, on which the government relies for its majority, also object, leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the House of Commons.That is why Theresa May, the prime minister, pulled the Commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre-Christmas, rescheduling it for 15 January in the hope she could persuade the EU to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents ( or enough of them ) over.Good question. It is not a cunning plan to get us to no deal by default. ” Asked whether he would vote for the deal if the DUP were happy with it, he said : “ Yes. Parliament will vote not to leave the EU without a deal next Wednesday."
Hong Kong Protests,"Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “ fanning the fire ” of unrest in the city. The protests, triggered by an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China, has turned into a broader pro-democracy movement.Hong Kong ’ s leader, Carrie Lam, has said that she will permanently withdraw the bill, but protesters have vowed to continue until all their demands are met. Bus lines to the area were shut, as riot police faced off against protesters who blocked roads and built barricades on the streets, paralysing traffic.Saturday marks the 15th consecutive weekend of mass protests in Hong Kong, where demonstrations against the government have deeply divided society. “ We have to keep it up. Some burned funeral offerings while others sang and chanted slogans.In the early hours of Sunday, police fired several rounds of tear gas from the police station in Tseung Kwan O- another out-of-town district- after dozens of protesters hurled projectiles at the station and set up makeshift barricades to block its exits. A water cannon truck was spotted near the airport."
Iran Sanctions,"He added : “ We will act, and currently are acting, against them, wherever it is necessary. ” A crisis between Iran and the US over a collapsing nuclear deal, hefty sanctions imposed by Washington, and Iran ’ s support for Shia militia in Iraq have raised fears of an escalating conflict in the Middle East. Britain raised the threat level for its forces in Iraq and the Gulf on Thursday, as the UK repaired a breach with the United States which had erupted earlier this week after a British general had contradicted claims made by the Trump administration.The heightened state of alert covers 400 forces personnel in Iraq, who provide training and support in the country, as well as soldiers and their families based in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar.Jeremy Hunt, the UK foreign secretary, declared that he and his US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, now shared “ the same assessment of the heightened threat posed by Iran. We have exercised maximum restraints, ” he said. Last week, Turkey began its long-planned attack on Kurdish forces in north-east Syria. For tens of millions of Kurds across the region, the PKK is a defender of their existence."
US China Trade War,"We can ’ t have that, ” said Trump.It is understood a day of talks with China ’ s vice-premier, Liu He, had made progress, but it was unclear whether the two sides were close to reaching an agreement.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump ’ s “ America first ” project to protect the US ’ position as the world ’ s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US ’ s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. Chinese imports to the US totalled $ 539.5bn last year, while $ 120.3bn was sold the other way – leaving a trade deficit of $ 419.2bn.The president has accused Beijing of “ unfair ” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies ’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where Trump is seeking changes to Beijing ’ s trade policy.Tariffs have been imposed by Washington on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year."
