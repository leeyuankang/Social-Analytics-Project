29,"Boeing’s profits more than halved in the last three months as the company struggled to recover from two fatal crashes of its top-selling 737 Max aircraft and current trade disputes took their toll.The company, which still expects the troubled 737 Max jet to return to service by the end of the year, also said it plans to cut production of its wide-bodied 787 Dreamliner, a move that reflects the effect of global trade tensions.The company said slowed production of the Max will cost an additional $900m on top of $2.7bn loss of income already anticipated. Overall revenue for the quarter dropped 20% – less than investors feared. Boeing shares, which have dropped 20% since the Max was grounded in March, rose 3%.The drop in profits comes as Boeing announced that Kevin McAllister, head of its commercial jetliner division, is leaving the company after just three years at the job.McAllister’s exit comes less than two weeks after chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is scheduled to testify before Congress next week, was stripped of the company’s chairmanship.Muilenburg’s demotion followed a further hit to Boeing’s reputation for safety last week when published messages between two test pilots showed that Boeing knew about problems with the 737 Max’s MCAS anti-stall system three years before the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killing 189 and 157 respectively.The exchanges contradict Boeing’s previous position that it had no idea the system was unsafe. In the messages from 2016, simulator pilot Mark Forkner complained MCAS was acting unpredictably. “It’s running rampant,” he said.Separately, aviation authorities in Indonesia have briefed family members on their findings about the crash of Lion Air flight 610 before the release of the final accident report on Friday.Investigators from the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee in Jakarta said systemic design flaws in the 737 Max were compounded by errors by the plane’s pilots, who had not been sufficiently instructed on how to handle MCAS malfunctions.",Boeing profits fall by more than half as 737 Max scandal swirls,2019-10-23/17:39:26,boeing s profits more than halved in the last three months as the company struggled to recover from two fatal crashes of its top selling  max aircraft and current trade disputes took their toll the company which still expects the troubled  max jet to return to service by the end of the year also said it plans to cut production of its wide bodied  dreamliner a move that reflects the effect of global trade tensions the company said slowed production of the max will cost an additional m on top of  bn loss of income already anticipated overall revenue for the quarter dropped  less than investors feared boeing shares which have dropped  since the max was grounded in march rose  the drop in profits comes as boeing announced that kevin mcallister head of its commercial jetliner division is leaving the company after just three years at the job mcallister s exit comes less than two weeks after chief executive dennis muilenburg who is scheduled to testify before congress next week was stripped of the company s chairmanship muilenburg s demotion followed a further hit to boeing s reputation for safety last week when published messages between two test pilots showed that boeing knew about problems with the  max s mcas anti stall system three years before the crashes in indonesia and ethiopia killing  and  respectively the exchanges contradict boeing s previous position that it had no idea the system was unsafe in the messages from  simulator pilot mark forkner complained mcas was acting unpredictably it s running rampant he said separately aviation authorities in indonesia have briefed family members on their findings about the crash of lion air flight  before the release of the final accident report on friday investigators from the indonesian national transportation safety committee in jakarta said systemic design flaws in the  max were compounded by errors by the plane s pilots who had not been sufficiently instructed on how to handle mcas malfunctions ,Boeing Crisis,0.4047439396381378
135,"They did the Macarena 10,972 metres above Las Vegas, dined on chilli- and lime-poached prawns and spicy “Jiangxi-style” cod and watched a fair few movies, including the Elton John biopic, Rocketman. Well, they had enough time: 19 hours and 16 minutes to be precise.Aviation history was made at 7.43am on Sunday when Qantas flight QF7879 touched down at Sydney airport, completing the world’s longest ever commercial flight. It had taken off from New York’s JFK airport at 9.27pm on Friday night. Along the way, it produced the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions of burning more than 700 barrels of oil.Just 49 people – including six pilots, six members of cabin crew including a chef, a handful of reporters, six frequent flyers and the airline’s chief executive, Alan Joyce – were on board the Boeing Dreamliner flight, designed to test whether passengers can endure the physical and mental effects of extremely long aeroplane journeys.The flight was restricted to such a small number of passengers in order to ensure that it was light enough to make it all the way to Australia on one tank of fuel. In order to reduce the weight, strict restrictions were put in place, including limiting passengers’ luggage and destocking most of the bar. All the passengers were in business class.🇺🇸 Touchdown! 🇦🇺19 hours, 15 minutesNew York to Sydneyhttps://t.co/v39ZrePTJR#QF7879 #ProjectSunrise pic.twitter.com/7A42JkgMyAThe plane was loaded with 101 tonnes of jet fuel, which made up almost half the total weight of the plane on takeoff. A Qantas spokesman was unable to explain how much carbon dioxide the flight created, but said all carbon emissions from the flight would be offset. The spokesman suggested that the carbon footprint of the direct flight would be less than that created by a two-leg journey because most energy used in flying is on takeoff.The International Civil Aviation Organization, which is part of the United Nations, estimates that 3.15 grams of carbon dioxide are produced for every gram of jet fuel burned. This would suggest that the flight created about 310 tonnes of carbon dioxide – the equivalent to the CO2 emitted by the use of four full tankers of petrol or that of about 718 barrels of oil, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.Britain’s Committee on Climate Change said any new flights that expanded the market for long-haul travel would hinder the legally binding commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.Won’t somebody please think of the carbon pic.twitter.com/srzuNJ3ZnTThe flight covered 16,200 kms (10,200 miles) – about 900km further than the current longest commercial flight between Singapore and New York.In an onboard interview in his Qantas-branded grey pyjamas, Joyce said: “This is the last frontier in aviation, being able to fly from the east coast of the United States to the east coast of Australia.”The flight, on a brand new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner named Kookaburra (a type of Australian kingfisher), was the first of three test flights exploring the practicalities of ultra-long -distance commercial aviation as part of Qantas’s Project Sunrise. Next month, Qantas will test a direct flight from Heathrow to Sydney, which will set a new distance record of 17,000km and take about 19.5 hours.Joyce said upon landing in Sydney: “This is a really significant first for aviation. Hopefully, it’s a preview of a regular service that will speed up how people travel from one side of the globe to the other.“We know ultra-long-haul flights pose some extra challenges, but that’s been true every time technology has allowed us to fly further. The research we’re doing should give us better strategies for improving comfort and wellbeing along the way.”The passengers boarding the flight at 9pm in New York were told to reset their watches to Sydney time as soon as they boarded, and were kept awake with the lights on for six hours and served a spicy soup and fish lunch designed to keep them up for longer to reduce jetlag. The chef said he had been preparing the meals on the flight for three days.As the flight flew over Las Vegas, passengers were led from their business class seats to the empty economy cabin in a rendition of La Macarena designed to get the blood pumping around their bodies. Pilots, passengers and crew were also subjected to a battery of health and wellbeing checks designed to test the effects of ultra-long-haul flying. All crew members wore activity monitors and completed sleep diaries and alertness logs during the flight, and in the two weeks leading up to it.Cameras were mounted in the cockpit to “record alertness cues and operational activities” and the pilots wore EEG (electroencephalogram) brain monitoring equipment to monitor them for alertness and sleep. With demand for air travel rapidly growing and aircraft performance improving, carriers are increasingly looking into ultra-long-haul travel. The International Air Transport Association expects the worldwide number of annual passengers to increase from 4.6 billion this year to 8.2 billion by 2037.Qantas captain Sean Golding said flying the plane was the highlight of his career. “The flight was very successful from two components,” he said. “The first one was research. And also the feat of distance – that flight last night was 16,200 kilometres. We were airborne for 19 hours and 16 minutes, and we landed here in Sydney with a comfortable 70 minutes of fuel.”The QF7879 flight landed in Sydney a few minutes before the airline’s regular New York to Sydney service QF12, which stops in Los Angeles.

182,"Two Nasa astronauts have embarked on the first all-female space walk in a historic first.Christina Koch and Jessica Meir floated feet-first out of the International Space Station’s (ISS) Quest airlock on Friday lunchtime UK time, tasked with replacing a failed power control unit.The spacewalk, known as an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) in astronaut jargon, took place seven months after the original planned date for an all-female outing, which had to be scrapped because the ISS had only one medium-sized spacesuit on board. The agency sent up a second medium spacesuit in October.“I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing,” Koch said ahead of the spacewalk. “In the past, women haven’t always been at the table. It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space program at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role. That can lead in turn to increased chance for success.”Koch, who has been on the ISS since March, was first out the hatch, followed by Meir, carrying a tool bag. During the five-and-a-half-hour spacewalk, the astronauts remained attached to handrails on the exterior of the ISS using harnesses and pairs of metal carabiners. These are sequentially clipped and unclipped to ensure that the astronauts cannot float off into space.Video footage from the astronauts’ helmet cameras, as they dangled 260 miles above Earth, provided a live stream of the painstaking operation to carry the new hardware, install it and then return the faulty battery to the airlock for a postmortem back on Earth into why it failed.Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a Nasa astronaut who completed three spacewalks as part of the Expedition 24 crew on the ISS in 2010, said: “This is significant … As much as it’s worth celebrating, many of us are looking forward to it just being normal.”During the spacewalk, the coordinator on the ground was Stephanie Wilson, also an astronaut.Koch, 40, is due to remain on the ISS until February, bringing her total time in space to 328 days, the longest single spaceflight by a woman and just short of Scott Kelly’s 340-day record. Researchers are collecting extensive biomedical data on the impact of spaceflight on Koch’s body.The majority of data available is on male astronauts, but there is some evidence that there are sex differences in responses to a space environment. One study found that women are more likely than men to experience faintness as a result of “orthostatic hypotension”, a cardiovascular issue. Men appear more prone to vision changes caused by spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (Sans).Previously, 14 women and 213 men have carried out spacewalks. The first woman was the Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who went outside the USSR’s Salyut 7 space station in 1984.On Tuesday, Nasa unveiled the prototype for a new spacesuit that could be worn by the next crew, expected to include a woman, to land on the moon. The suit is designed to give a customised fit to the individual astronaut, whatever their shape or size.﻿",Nasa astronauts complete first ever all-female spacewalk,2019-10-19/00:43:27,two nasa astronauts have embarked on the first all female space walk in a historic first christina koch and jessica meir floated feet first out of the international space station s iss quest airlock on friday lunchtime uk time tasked with replacing a failed power control unit the spacewalk known as an extra vehicular activity eva in astronaut jargon took place seven months after the original planned date for an all female outing which had to be scrapped because the iss had only one medium sized spacesuit on board the agency sent up a second medium spacesuit in october i think it s important because of the historical nature of what we re doing koch said ahead of the spacewalk in the past women haven t always been at the table it s wonderful to be contributing to the space program at a time when all contributions are being accepted when everyone has a role that can lead in turn to increased chance for success koch who has been on the iss since march was first out the hatch followed by meir carrying a tool bag during the five and a half hour spacewalk the astronauts remained attached to handrails on the exterior of the iss using harnesses and pairs of metal carabiners these are sequentially clipped and unclipped to ensure that the astronauts cannot float off into space video footage from the astronauts helmet cameras as they dangled  miles above earth provided a live stream of the painstaking operation to carry the new hardware install it and then return the faulty battery to the airlock for a postmortem back on earth into why it failed tracy caldwell dyson a nasa astronaut who completed three spacewalks as part of the expedition  crew on the iss in  said this is significant as much as it s worth celebrating many of us are looking forward to it just being normal during the spacewalk the coordinator on the ground was stephanie wilson also an astronaut koch  is due to remain on the iss until february bringing her total time in space to  days the longest single spaceflight by a woman and just short of scott kelly s  day record researchers are collecting extensive biomedical data on the impact of spaceflight on koch s body the majority of data available is on male astronauts but there is some evidence that there are sex differences in responses to a space environment one study found that women are more likely than men to experience faintness as a result of orthostatic hypotension a cardiovascular issue men appear more prone to vision changes caused by spaceflight associated neuro ocular syndrome sans previously  women and  men have carried out spacewalks the first woman was the russian cosmonaut svetlana savitskaya who went outside the ussr s salyut  space station in  on tuesday nasa unveiled the prototype for a new spacesuit that could be worn by the next crew expected to include a woman to land on the moon the suit is designed to give a customised fit to the individual astronaut whatever their shape or size ,Boeing Crisis,0.39630699157714844
220,"Consumer genetic tests could be giving false reassurance to those at heightened risk of cancers, according to findings presented at an international conference this week.The study, by clinical genetic testing company Invitae, revealed that tests for breast and bowel cancer risk by direct-to-consumer companies such as 23andMe give negative results to the vast majority of those carrying DNA mutations in the genes under investigation.“These tests should not be taken at face value at all, whether they are positive or negative,” said Edward Esplin from Invitae ahead of the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics in Houston, Texas.“The data really underscores that there needs to be increased awareness that results from this type of screening may not be wrong but they’re woefully incomplete.”The research also showed that those from Asian and African-American backgrounds were more likely to carry mutations that were not designed to be detected by the consumer tests.The research focused on DNA-based tests relating to breast, ovarian and bowel cancer that were recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.The tests operate by a subject sending a DNA swab in the post for analysis and then receiving results with information about how their genetics could influence their health.In the case of breast and ovarian cancer, the FDA has approved a screening test for three specific mutations on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. However, these mutations are rare in people from other backgrounds.Similarly, for bowel cancer, 23andMe offers FDA-authorised tests for two mutations, which are most common among individuals of northern European ancestry. The company explains the limitations of these tests to consumers and on its website.Esplin said that despite this, consumers could be wrongly reassured by a negative result.The study analysed the DNA of 270,806 patients who had been referred by healthcare providers for testing of the MUTYH gene, and 119,328 who had been referred for BRCA1/2 genetic testing.It showed that for both tests, the majority of those carrying mutations would not be spotted, which Invitae describes as a “clinical false-negative result”.For MUYTH, 40% of individuals with mutations in both copies of their MUTYH genes – consistent with an almost 100% lifetime risk of bowel cancer – had different mutations to those screened for in the FDA-approved test. This figure rose to 100% for those from Asian backgrounds and 75% for African-Americans.For BRCA genes, 94% of non-Ashkenazi Jewish individuals and 19% of those of Ashkenazi heritage had a mutation that would be missed. Again, the figures were highest for those of Asian (98%) and African-American (99%) ancestry. “It’s performing a disproportionate disservice to individuals of these underrepresented groups,” Esplin said.“A clinical false-negative result can be incorrectly reassuring, excluding a patient from receiving the preventive care they need based on their risk,” he added. “It could be the difference between preventing cancer and developing cancer.”In response to the findings, 23andMe said in a statement: “The claims made by a competitor that we are returning ‘clinical false negatives’ is incorrect and a false characterisation of 23andMe’s test. Our test is extremely accurate. As part of the FDA authorisation process we’ve demonstrated over 99% accuracy for the variants we test for in our health product.”The company said it makes clear to customers that it tests only for certain genetic variants and that customers should not forgo any recommended testing based on 23andMe results. “23andMe is not a diagnostic test,” the company said. “If an individual has a family history of cancer or other indications for clinical testing we always recommend consulting a healthcare provider first.”Prof Anneke Lucassen, a clinical geneticist at the University of Southampton, said that, in her experience, non-specialists would be likely to wrongly interpret negative results as an “all-clear”.“I do think the ‘false-negative’ rate is an issue, not necessarily through the companies’ fault but through low general awareness,” she said. “Most people who come to clinic ask: ‘Have I got the gene for breast cancer?’ and imagine it’s a single test, not that the test involves looking through around 20,000 letters of the genetic code to see if any one of them might be different.”",Genetic testing kits 'may wrongly reassure those at risk of

293,"Nasa has unveiled two spacesuits designed to be worn by the first woman to walk on the moon.The next-generation suits were made for the Artemis programme, which aims to land the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024.Speaking at Nasa’s headquarters, the administrator, Jim Bridenstine, and spacesuit engineers presented the first closeup look at the suits.A bulky, mostly white prototype with blue and red arms was demonstrated by Kristine Davis, a spacesuit engineer at the Johnson Space Center.The garment, known as the exploration extravehicular mobility unit (xEMU), is designed for exploring the lunar surface, specifically the south pole – the target for Nasa’s next crewed lunar landing.“Kristine is wearing a spacesuit that will fit all of our astronauts when we go to the moon,” Bridenstine said. “These are our spacesuits for the Artemis generation.”The suit is more flexible than previous generation suits, allowing astronauts to squat to pick up rocks and move more easily. The insulation is designed to withstand a temperature range of -150C to 120C.“If we remember the Apollo generation, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin bunny-hopped on the surface of the moon,” Bridenstine said. “Now we are actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different from our suits of the past.”A new orange pressure suit, the Orion crew survival system, was worn by the spacesuit engineer Dustin Gohmert. It will be used by astronauts when they launch into space on the Orion capsule and return to Earth.The focus on spacesuits designed to fit a more diverse crew comes after plans for the first all-female spacewalk had to be scrapped this year because there were not enough medium-size spacesuits.Christina Koch and Anne McClain had been scheduled to step outside the International Space Station to install batteries, but in the event only Koch was able to take part in the walk.Another attempt at an all-female spacewalk, involving Koch and Jessica Meir, is scheduled to take place on Thursday.

386,"The first interstellar comet to be tracked by astronomers as it hurtles through the solar system is unremarkable in every way apart from where it comes from, researchers have said.Scientists reached the conclusion after observing 2I/Borisov with two of the most powerful telescopes on Earth. They decided that it looked like any other comet except that it came from beyond the solar system and would soon leave for good.The unusual body was spotted in August by a Crimean amateur astronomer, Gennady Borisov. It was swiftly identified as an outcast from another star system and may have been wandering the Milky Way for millions if not billions of years.“This is the first comet known to science that arrived from outside the solar system, and it is completely similar to those we see inside the solar system,” said Michal Drahus, an astronomer at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland.The team, led by Piotr Guzik, gathered images of the comet after receiving an alert from a computer system that detects cosmic interlopers. Unlike comets and asteroids that formed in the solar system, the arrivals are on trajectories that do not swing around the sun.Pictures from the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma, Spain, and the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, revealed that 2I/Borisov has a coma – a billowing cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a comet’s nucleus – and a short, fat tail. Both are created when ices on the comet’s surface sublimate into gas and blast dust and vapour into space. Details are published in Nature Astronomy.The observations confirmed that the reddish body is a comet with a nucleus about 2km wide. It is only the second interstellar body to be spotted in the solar system, after the apparently more rocky and cigar-shaped Oumuamua, which was tracked in 2017 as it barrelled out of the solar system at 196,000mph.Comets are what is left over when a planetary system forms, and the similarity of 2I/Borisov to solar system comets suggests our own planetary system is not unusual in the Milky Way. “The first thing it tells us is that at least some other planetary systems around other stars are similar to ours,” said Guzik.Scientists are unsure where 2I/Borisov comes from, but another Polish research team has tentatively traced its trajectory back to a star system with twin red dwarves called Kruger 60, 13 light years from Earth.The new comet tore into the solar system several years ago from an angle of about 45 degrees north. In October 2015 it was as far away as Neptune, the outermost planet, and now it is between Mars and Jupiter. On 27 October it will cross the plane of Earth’s orbit. The early detection means astronomers will be able to observe the 71,500mph comet as it makes its closest approach to the sun on 8 December, when the extra heat will make the comet more active and its tail longer.Colin Snodgrass, an astronomer at Edinburgh University and a member of a team that has separate observations of 2I/Borisov coming out in Astrophysical Journal Letters, said: “This appears to be a completely unremarkable comet on a very remarkable orbit.”“It’s very interesting that this interstellar comet looks like our own ones,” he added. “It implies that some of the formation processes we are trying to figure out with detailed observation of comets and asteroids, or space missions like Rosetta, are common between stars.”A new mission being developed for the European Space Agency will send a robotic probe into space to intercept and study a passing comet. Geraint Jones, the head of planetary science at UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and the lead proposer of the Comet Interceptor mission, said the primary target would be a pristine, unaltered comet arriving fresh from the Oort cloud, a distant region of the solar system where comets reside. “But we on the proposing team made it clear that if an interstellar object could be reached instead, it would clearly make an extremely compelling target,” he said.

654,"European air safety regulators have told their US counterpart they want more testing on fixes to the troubled 737 Max flight-control systems before the plane is cleared to re-enter service.According to the Wall Street Journal, the EU’s Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) told the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) it was not satisfied with demonstrations of the reconfigured safety systems on the planes, which were involved in two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.Boeing had initially scheduled the plane to re-enter service at the end of August but disagreements over software details, centered on how the plane’s dual flight-control computers are now intended to start working together, have put that date back to at least the end of November.The aim, according to the Journal, is to add redundancy by having both computers work simultaneously to eliminate potential problems stemming from computer chip malfunctions.The issue is separate from changes to the aircraft’s faulty Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) but related to an emergency procedure that can be used by pilots to address the plane’s system malfunctions.Over the past months, Boeing and regulators have agreed on software revisions to MCAS designed to scale back the power, and reduce the likelihood of the system kicking in and forcing the plane’s nose down.Last week Boeing’s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, said test pilots had completed more than 700 Max flights.“We are very confident in that software solution, and we are now just marching through the final steps on certifying that, so that everybody’s confident in the safety of the airplane,” he said at a public appearance in New York.The new issue was identified during tests in June when a test pilot found that the procedure took more time than was acceptable to execute.A spokesman for the aircraft maker said: “We continue to work with regulators on addressing their concerns and working through the process for certifying the 737 Max software and training updates and safely returning the airplane to service.”The latest problems for Boeing come as pilots for Southwest Airlines, one of the largest operators of the troubled jet, sued the company, claiming the grounding of the 737 Max jets with the loss of 30,000 scheduled flights has cost them more than $100m in pay.In court papers, Southwest’s pilots association accusing Boeing of lying when it said the planes were just as safe as their predecessors.“Our pilots should not be expected to take a significant and ever-expanding financial loss as a result of Boeing’s negligence,” Jon Weaks, the union’s president, said in a statement. In total, 387 737 Max flown by 60 airlines are grounded.Boeing’s stock has dropped 11% since the 737 Max was grounded in March, costing the company $27bn in market capitalization. Before the crashes, the plane accounted for nearly 70% of Boeing’s overall commercial aircraft deliveries, and 30% of its total operating profit.",Boeing 737 Max: European regulators insist on more testing of troubled plane,2019-10-08/16:19:52,european air safety regulators have told their us counterpart they want more testing on fixes to the troubled  max flight control systems before the plane is cleared to re enter service according to the wall street journal the eu s aviation safety agency easa told the federal aviation authority faa it was not satisfied with demonstrations of the reconfigured safety systems on the planes which were involved in two crashes in indonesia and ethiopia that killed  people boeing had initially scheduled the plane to re enter service at the end of august but disagreements over software details centered on how the plane s dual flight control computers are now intended to start working together have put that date back to at least the end of november the aim according to the journal is to add redundancy by having both computers work simultaneously to eliminate potential problems stemming from computer chip malfunctions the issue is separate from changes to the aircraft s faulty maneuvering characteristics augmentation system mcas but related to an emergency procedure that can be used by pilots to address the plane s system malfunctions over the past months boeing and regulators have agreed on software revisions to mcas designed to scale back the power and reduce the likelihood of the system kicking in and forcing the plane s nose down last week boeing s ceo dennis muilenburg said test pilots had completed more than  max flights we are very confident in that software solution and we are now just marching through the final steps on certifying that so that everybody s confident in the safety of the airplane he said at a public appearance in new york the new issue was identified during tests in june when a test pilot found that the procedure took more time than was acceptable to execute a spokesman for the aircraft maker said we continue to work with regulators on addressing their concerns and working through the process for certifying the  max software and training updates and safely returning the airplane to service the latest problems for boeing come as pilots for southwest airlines one of the largest operators of the troubled jet sued the company claiming the grounding of the  max jets with the loss of   scheduled flights has cost them more than m in pay in court papers southwest s pilots association accusing boeing of lying when it said the planes were just as safe as their predecessors our pilots should not be expected to take a significant and ever expanding financial loss as a result of boeing s negligence jon weaks the union s president said in a statement in total   max flown by  airlines are grounded boeing s stock has dropped  since the  max was grounded in march costing the company bn in market capitalization before the crashes the plane accounted for nearly  of boeing s overall commercial aircraft deliveries and  of its total operating profit ,Boeing Crisis,0.5832186937332153
810,"Ryanair has saved millions of pounds in compensation payouts after quitting an industry-wide arbitration body and leaving travellers with an uphill battle to obtain any redress, according to the consumer group Which?The budget airline cut ties with Aviation ADR, one of two schemes that airlines use to arbitrate serious complaints, at the end of November last year. In the first 11 months of 2018 before Ryanair left the scheme, Aviation ADR received more than 14,000 complaints involving the airline and told it to pay out more than £2.6m to passengers, plus an administration fee of £75 for each complaint.After Ryanair cut ties with the scheme, only 553 passengers pursued claims through the only other avenue, the Civil Aviation Authority, in the following four months. Which? said this suggested “a huge saving in fees and compensation for Ryanair, which cannot be compelled to pay out even if the aviation regulator finds in a passenger’s favour”.The dispute goes back to earlier in 2018 when Ryanair sought to avoid claims made by passengers under EU regulations after it cancelled a number of flights due to strikes. After the European court of justice ruled that strikes were not an extraordinary circumstance, Aviation ADR started to find in favour of passengers making claims against Ryanair over the walkouts.Which? found that even when Ryanair was with Aviation ADR, some passengers complained of waiting as long as a year to receive compensation.The consumer group highlighted how one passenger, Kasia Nieduzak, made a complaint to Aviation ADR after her flight was cancelled in September 2017. She received a ruling from the arbitrator in July 2018 and her compensation was paid in November 2018. Nieduzak said the 14-month battle involved around 170 phone calls and 45 emails.Ryanair told Which?: “Our policy is to pay all valid claims within an industry-leading 10 days of receipt and while regrettably we fell short on this occasion [with Nieduzak], this is certainly not representative.”It said there was no reason for any of its customers to complain to Aviation ADR after it left the scheme, as they were all told to contact the CAA or the appropriate European authorities.",Ryanair saving millions in payouts after leaving arbitration body,2019-10-04/00:01:58,ryanair has saved millions of pounds in compensation payouts after quitting an industry wide arbitration body and leaving travellers with an uphill battle to obtain any redress according to the consumer group which the budget airline cut ties with aviation adr one of two schemes that airlines use to arbitrate serious complaints at the end of november last year in the first  months of  before ryanair left the scheme aviation adr received more than   complaints involving the airline and told it to pay out more than  m to passengers plus an administration fee of  for each complaint after ryanair cut ties with the scheme only  passengers pursued claims through the only other avenue the civil aviation authority in the following four months which said this suggested a huge saving in fees and compensation for ryanair which cannot be compelled to pay out even if the aviation regulator finds in a passenger s favour the dispute goes back to earlier in  when ryanair sought to avoid claims made by passengers under eu regulations after it cancelled a number of flights due to strikes after the european court of justice ruled that strikes were not an extraordinary circumstance aviation adr started to find in favour of passengers making claims against ryanair over the walkouts which found that even when ryanair was with aviation adr some passengers complained of waiting as long as a year to receive compensation the consumer group highlighted how one passenger kasia nieduzak made a complaint to aviation adr after her flight was cancelled in september  she received a ruling from the arbitrator in july  and her compensation was paid in november  nieduzak said the  month battle involved around  phone calls and  emails ryanair told which our policy is to pay all valid claims within an industry leading  days of receipt and while regrettably we fell short on this occasion with nieduzak this is certainly not representative it said there was no reason for any of its customers to complain to aviation adr after it left the scheme as they were all told to contact the caa or the appropriate european authorities ,Boeing Crisis,0.32078978419303894
858,"The US is set to impose $7.5bn (£6.1bn) of tariffs on exports from the EU including scotch whisky, French wine and cheese and aircraft in retaliation for subsidies given to the aerospace group Airbus after a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling.The tariffs announced on Wednesday could come into effect as early as 18 October and represent a significant widening of the Trump administration’s trade dispute with the EU, adding to growing tensions in the world economy.The US trade representative’s office (USTRO) released a list of hundreds of European agricultural products that will be subject to a 25% tariff, including British woollen jumpers and pullovers. Cookies, salami, butter and yogurt from some countries will be affected, along with olives from France, Germany and Spain, EU-produced pork sausage and other pork products other than ham, and German coffee.The USTRO said it would “continually re-evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the EU” and expects to enter talks in a bid to resolve the dispute.Still some Italian foods – Parmesan, Reggiano, Romano and provolone cheese – were hit with tariffs as were Italian fruits, clams and yogurt. Also seeing new tariffs are German and British camera parts, industrial microwave ovens, printed books, sweet biscuits and waffles.The US has also imposed a 10% levy on EU-made airplanes that could hurt US airlines that have ordered billions of dollars of Airbus aircraft.Food importers in the US were dismayed by the move and said the levies would hurt the upcoming crucial Christmas sales period.“It looks pretty bad. They hit cheese hard,” said Ralph Hoffman, a vice president of the Cheese Importers Association of America.It comes as the global economy is already struggling with the effects of a trade war against China launched by the Trump administration. Stock markets worldwide sold off on Wednesday amid signs of an economic slowdown and worsening trade relations.The EU said on Wednesday it would retaliate if the US imposed tariffs. Cecilia Malmström, the EU commissioner for trade, issued a statement saying the EU had shared proposals on settling the dispute in July. She said: “Our readiness to find a fair settlement remains unchanged. But if the US decides to impose WTO-authorised countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same.”The WTO ruling is the latest blow in a 15-year battle between the European manufacturer and its US rival, Boeing over state aid given to the companies. Next year, the WTO is preparing to rule on what tariffs the EU can impose in retaliation to US state aid given to Boeing.The case, first brought in 2004, involved aid given to Airbus by EU nations for the development of its A380 superjumbo jet and the smaller A350. The US alleged that Airbus illegally received loans on preferential terms and billions of euros in grants. The WTO, which is tasked with settling trade disputes, gave a mixed verdict in 2010, which was followed by years of appeals.Boeing issued a statement blaming Airbus’s non-compliance with WTO rulings as the reason for the possible tariffs.A spokesman said: “Unfortunately, Airbus’s non-compliance will negatively impact European member states, industries, and businesses completely unrelated to Airbus’s actions, as well as Airbus’s airline customers. Yet even today, Airbus could still completely avoid these tariffs by coming into full compliance with its obligations. We hope it will finally do that.”Airbus said the imposition of tariffs would create insecurity and disruption to the aerospace industry and the broader global economy. The company called for a negotiated settlement.Guillaume Faury, Airbus’s chief executive, said: “Airbus will continue working with its US partners, customers and suppliers, to address all potential consequences of such tariffs that would be a barrier against free trade and would have a negative impact on not only the US airlines but also US jobs, suppliers, and air travellers.“Airbus is therefore hopeful that the US and the EU will agree to find a negotiated solution before creating serious damage to the aviation industry as well as to trade relations and the global economy.”Airbus and Boeing vie every year for the top position in the aircraft manufacturing and sales leagues. Boeing last year delivered 806 planes to customers, six more than Airbus.Boeing has endured one of the most difficult years in its history, after two crashes involving its 737 Max jet that killed 346 people following the apparent malfunction of safety features.",Scotch whisky and French wine hit by $7.5bn US tariffs,2019-10-03/00:30:05,the us is set to impose  bn  bn of tariffs on exports from the eu including scotch whisky french wine and cheese and aircraft in retaliation for subsidies given to the aerospace group airbus after a world trade organization wto ruling the tariffs announced on wednesday could come into effect as early as  october and represent a significant widening of the trump administration s trade dispute with the eu adding to growing tensions in the world economy the us trade representative s office ustro released a list of hundreds of european agricultural products that will be subject to a  tariff including british woollen jumpers and pullovers cookies salami butter and yogurt from some countries will be affected along with olives from france germany and spain eu produced pork sausage and other pork products other than ham and german coffee the ustro said it would continually re evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the eu and expects to enter talks in a bid to resolve the dispute still some italian foods parmesan reggiano romano and provolone cheese were hit with tariffs as were italian fruits clams and yogurt also seeing new tariffs are german and british camera parts industrial microwave ovens printed books sweet biscuits and waffles the us has also imposed a  levy on eu made airplanes that could hurt us airlines that have ordered billions of dollars of airbus aircraft food importers in the us were dismayed by the move and said the levies would hurt the upcoming crucial christmas sales period it looks pretty bad they hit cheese hard said ralph hoffman a vice president of the cheese importers association of america it comes as the global economy is already struggling with the effects of a trade war against china launched by the trump administration stock markets worldwide sold off on wednesday amid signs of an economic slowdown and worsening trade relations the eu said on wednesday it would retaliate if the us imposed tariffs cecilia malmström the eu commissioner for trade issued a statement saying the eu had shared proposals on settling the dispute in july she said our readiness to find a fair settlement remains unchanged but if the us decides to impose wto authorised countermeasures it will be pushing the eu into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same the wto ruling is the latest blow in a  year battle between the european manufacturer and its us rival boeing over state aid given to the companies next year the wto is preparing to rule on what tariffs the eu can impose in retaliation to us state aid given to boeing the case first brought in  involved aid given to airbus by eu nations for the development of its a superjumbo jet and the smaller a the us alleged that airbus illegally received loans on preferential terms and billions of euros in grants the wto which is tasked with settling trade disputes gave a mixed verdict in  which was followed by years of appeals boeing issued a statement blaming airbus s non compliance with wto rulings as the reason for the possible tariffs a spokesman said unfortunately airbus s non compliance will negatively impact european member states industries and businesses completely unrelated to airbus s actions as well as airbus s airline customers yet even today airbus could still completely avoid these tariffs by coming into full compliance with its obligations we hope it will finally do that airbus said the imposition of tariffs would create insecurity and disruption to the aerospace industry and the broader global economy the company called for a negotiated settlement guillaume faury airbus s chief executive said airbus will continue working with its us partners customers and suppliers to address all potential consequences of such tariffs that would be a barrier against free trade and would have a negative impact on not only the us airlines but also us jobs suppliers and air travellers airbus is therefore hopeful that the us and the eu will agree to find a negotiated solution before creating serious damage to the aviation industry as well as to trade relations and the global economy airbus and boeing vie every year for the top position in the aircraft manufacturing and sales leagues boeing last year delivered  planes to customers six more than airbus boeing has endured one of the most difficult years in its history after two crashes involving its  max jet that killed  people following the apparent malfunction of safety features ,Boeing Crisis,0.16081704199314117

1130,"Ryanair has written to UK pilots asking them to take unpaid leave or transfer to other bases abroad, saying they could otherwise join the 9,000 job losses at Thomas Cook.The airline, which reported profits of €1bn (£886m) in May, told its pilots that a “significant surplus of pilots must be reduced” at UK bases including Stansted and Manchester, and that it was encouraging them to take up to 12 months of unpaid leave.It said that there were limited vacancies for full-time pilots at bases in Morocco, Romania and Hungary.The memo, sent on Tuesday, said: “With yesterday’s collapse of Thomas Cook with the loss of 9,000 jobs in the UK and potentially a further 13,000 jobs across Europe, we hope that there will be sufficient applications for unpaid leave/part time, so we do not have to resort to job losses at [your base] this winter.”It blamed the delay to Boeing 737 Max deliveries for the decision. Ryanair had ordered up to 135 of the aircraft for its expansion plans, with the first planes due this year. The model remains grounded, however, since the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes.The memo came a week after UK pilots called off the remainder of a series of strikes this month. The pilots union, Balpa, had complained about Ryanair’s “abysmal approach to industrial relations” and said the dispute over pay and conditions was driven by resentment over a range of cost-saving measures used by Ryanair.Ryanair had called the strikes pointless and managed to operate the majority of its UK schedules by bringing in more contractors and pilots from overseas bases.

1147,"Italian authorities have closed off roads and evacuated homes after experts warned that a portion of a Mont Blanc glacier is at risk of collapse.Stefano Miserocchi, the mayor of the town of Courmayeur, said “public safety is a priority” after experts from the Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountains Foundation) in the Aosta Valley said up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice was in danger of sliding off the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak.“This phenomenon once again testifies that the mountain is in a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,” Miserocchi said in a statement.Experts have been monitoring the glacier closely since 2013 to detect the speed at which the ice is melting, and Miserocchi said the rate had “significantly increased” recently. But they are unable to predict when the ice would break away.“There are currently no empirical models or methods that can enable quantitative predictions in the case of glaciers with sliding dynamics such as Planpincieux,” Miserocchi added.The warning comes as world leaders meet in New York for the UN climate action summit. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: “The news that part of Mont Blanc risks collapsing is a warning that should not leave us indifferent. It must shake us all and force us to mobilise.”In 2017, about 50 cubic metres of ice fell from Planpincieux, while in September last year a mass of ice broke away from the Glacier de la Charpoua, on the south-east side of the Aiguille Verte, on the French side of Mont Blanc.Miserocchi’s order came into force on Tuesday and includes the evacuation of homes and mountain refuges in the area. He said it was a precautionary measure and there was no threat to residential areas or tourist establishments. The zones affected are in the area of Val Ferret.Rising temperatures are causing glaciers to melt, with environmental activists in Switzerland holding their second “mourning ceremony” on the evaporating Pizol glacier in the country’s Glarus Alps on Monday. The glacier has lost up to 90% of its volume since 2006.

It is said to be the world’s largest single-building airport terminal. At 700,000 sq metres, with four runways, it is expected to be able to handle 72 million passengers a year by 2025. By 2040, the airport is expected to expand to eight runways and accommodate 100 million passengers a year.Officials have been showing off the sleek new airport for the past year, hosting tours of the space, which is to include customer-service robots to deliver flight information and facial recognition-enabled check-in.Critics have questioned the need for a second airport in the capital, especially one that is almost twice the distance from the city centre as the existing airport.Officials say Daxing will alleviate traffic pressure on the city’s existing international travel hub, Beijing Capital in the north-east, which had more than 100 million travellers last year, second in the world only to Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta, Georgia, in terms of passenger traffic.China is expected to surpass the US to become the world’s largest market for airport travel by 2022. But the aviation sector has a poor reputation for flight disruptions, the result of frequents delays caused by overcapacity and delays caused by the military, which controls most of the airspace. Officials hope the new airport will lessen those delays.Domestic and foreign airlines, including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Air China as well as British Airways and Finnair, have said they will move all or part of their operations to the new airport.",Zaha Hadid’s massive ‘starfish’ airport opens in Beijing,2019-09-25/11:18:03,china has opened a vast multibillion dollar airport in the country s capital in the run up to a major political anniversary less than five years after construction began the bn yuan bn daxing international airport was officially opened on wednesday in a ceremony attended by the chinese leader xi jinping china is preparing to celebrate its national day on  october marking  years since the founding of the people s republic of china against the backdrop of unrest in hong kong and a flagging economy the new mega airport the second in beijing was designed by the late architect zaha hadid in the shape of a starfish with five connected concourses it is said to be the world s largest single building airport terminal at   sq metres with four runways it is expected to be able to handle  million passengers a year by  by  the airport is expected to expand to eight runways and accommodate  million passengers a year officials have been showing off the sleek new airport for the past year hosting tours of the space which is to include customer service robots to deliver flight information and facial recognition enabled check in critics have questioned the need for a second airport in the capital especially one that is almost twice the distance from the city centre as the existing airport officials say daxing will alleviate traffic pressure on the city s existing international travel hub beijing capital in the north east which had more than  million travellers last year second in the world only to hartsfield jackson airport in atlanta georgia in terms of passenger traffic china is expected to surpass the us to become the world s largest market for airport travel by  but the aviation sector has a poor reputation for flight disruptions the result of frequents delays caused by overcapacity and delays caused by the military which controls most of the airspace officials hope the new airport will lessen those delays domestic and foreign airlines including china southern airlines china eastern airlines air china as well as british airways and finnair have said they will move all or part of their operations to the new airport ,Boeing Crisis,0.2469780147075653
1365,"Australia’s air safety regulator may refuse permission for Boeing 737 Max planes to fly even if its US counterpart revokes an order grounding the aircraft, which has crashed twice, leaving 346 people dead.A Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman said that the decision of the US Federal Aviation Administration would be an important factor in deciding whether to allow the Max to fly, but Casa would also take into account other information before making its decision.“As the certifying authority for the aircraft type, obviously the FAA is central to the decision as to whether the aircraft flies or not but in this case due to the nature of it there is focus on the aircraft from authorities around the world,” the spokesman said.He said Casa had been sharing information with other regulators including the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the Canadian regulator, Transport Canada, both of which have said they will do their own assessments of the Max.“Those views will form part of our thinking when we make a decision,” he said.He said there was no set timeframe in which Casa would make its call.National aviation safety bodies usually accept the decision of a manufacturer’s home regulator – in this case the FAA – but the deadly Max crashes have raised concerns the US authority failed to properly oversee Boeing.Global air safety authorities, including Casa, are due to meet on Monday in Montreal to discuss the Max issue at a meeting called by the FAA.No Australian airlines currently fly the Max, but Virgin has 48 on order and Qantas has also expressed interest in buying the plane. Until Casa banned the planes from flying on 13 March it was used by on flights in and out of Australia by two overseas airlines, Fiji Airways and Singapore’s SilkAir.The Max, which was Boeing’s fastest-selling model, was attractive to airlines because it has larger engines than the standard 737, giving it a longer range and greater capacity.But the planes were grounded in March after Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board.It was the second lethal Max crash in six months. In October 2018, a Lion Air flight from Jakarta to Bangka Island plummeted into the Java Sea, killing all 189 passengers and crew.The day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash the FAA defended the airworthiness of the Max, but within two days it was forced to ground the fleet  by Donald Trump.Investigations have focused on an automated system that under some circumstances can compensate for the extra lift generated by the bigger engines by pushing the nose of the plane down.The crashes have also raised concerns that engineering quality at Boeing may have suffered as the company pursued profits in competition with its European rival, Airbus.In early April, the FAA set up a joint technical review team with other aviation authorities, including Europe’s Easa and Australia’s Casa.A fortnight ago, the FAA said the team was “taking additional time to finish documenting its work”.“We expect the group to submit its observations, findings, and recommendations in the coming weeks,” it said.",Australia may ban Boeing 737 Max even if US gives it all-clear,2019-09-20/04:04:26,australia s air safety regulator may refuse permission for boeing  max planes to fly even if its us counterpart revokes an order grounding the aircraft which has crashed twice leaving  people dead a civil aviation safety authority spokesman said that the decision of the us federal aviation administration would be an important factor in deciding whether to allow the max to fly but casa would also take into account other information before making its decision as the certifying authority for the aircraft type obviously the faa is central to the decision as to whether the aircraft flies or not but in this case due to the nature of it there is focus on the aircraft from authorities around the world the spokesman said he said casa had been sharing information with other regulators including the european union aviation safety agency and the canadian regulator transport canada both of which have said they will do their own assessments of the max those views will form part of our thinking when we make a decision he said he said there was no set timeframe in which casa would make its call national aviation safety bodies usually accept the decision of a manufacturer s home regulator in this case the faa but the deadly max crashes have raised concerns the us authority failed to properly oversee boeing global air safety authorities including casa are due to meet on monday in montreal to discuss the max issue at a meeting called by the faa no australian airlines currently fly the max but virgin has  on order and qantas has also expressed interest in buying the plane until casa banned the planes from flying on  march it was used by on flights in and out of australia by two overseas airlines fiji airways and singapore s silkair the max which was boeing s fastest selling model was attractive to airlines because it has larger engines than the standard  giving it a longer range and greater capacity but the planes were grounded in march after ethiopian airlines flight  crashed in addis ababa killing all  people on board it was the second lethal max crash in six months in october  a lion air flight from jakarta to bangka island plummeted into the java sea killing all  passengers and crew the day after the ethiopian airlines crash the faa defended the airworthiness of the max but within two days it was forced to ground the fleet by donald trump investigations have focused on an automated system that under some circumstances can compensate for the extra lift generated by the bigger engines by pushing the nose of the plane down the crashes have also raised concerns that engineering quality at boeing may have suffered as the company pursued profits in competition with its european rival airbus in early april the faa set up a joint technical review team with other aviation authorities including europe s easa and australia s casa a fortnight ago the faa said the team was taking additional time to finish documenting its work we expect the group to submit its observations findings and recommendations in the coming weeks it said ,Boeing Crisis,0.38462382555007935

1420,"The US government has given the go-ahead to new rules to eliminate production line speed limits at pig slaughterhouses, deeming restrictions “unnecessary” despite fears that lifting them will worsen the already high number of serious injuries suffered by US meat plant workers.Amputations, fractured fingers, second-degree burns and head trauma are just some of the serious injuries suffered by US meat plant workers every week, according to an investigation last year by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.The investigation found that US meat workers are already three times more likely to suffer serious harm than the average American worker, with pork and beef workers nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries.However, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) said maximum line speeds were an “unnecessary regulatory obstacle to industry innovation” and that its new rules – the first reform to pork inspections for 50 years – were overdue. They would, the department said this week, allow companies to bring in new food safety measures while still protecting public health.The USDA rules will also allow state inspection officials at pig slaughterhouses to be replaced with company employees.The government agency said that by requiring the pork industry to use its own staff to sort and remove unfit animals, the USDA will be able to free up resources to be used elsewhere. It insisted that under the new swine slaughter inspection system, USDA staff would continue to inspect 100% of animals before slaughter and carcasses afterwards.The USDA has estimated that the new rules could potentially save it more than $6m (£4.8m) a year.“This regulatory change allows us to ensure food safety while eliminating outdated rules and allowing for companies to innovate,” said US agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue.Campaigners claimed the rule change amounted to a privatisation of pig-slaughter inspection. “The least Trump’s USDA could do is be honest with the American people about the new, harmful hog slaughter inspection rule,” said Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of Food & Water Watch.Hauter’s organisation said that, according to USDA data, there would be a reduction of 40% in the number of USDA inspectors assigned to slaughter lines in plants that switch to the new rules.“The implementation of the rule will result in the fox guarding the henhouse,” said Hauter. “With less government oversight over hog slaughter inspection, big meat companies will have the freedom to inspect themselves and push towards their goal of increasing line speeds. There’s no doubt about it: faster line speeds plus less inspection equals more food contamination.”The National Pork Producers Council said the new inspection system, which has already been piloted by the USDA, would incentivise investment in new technologies while ensuring a safe supply of American pork.The North American Meat Institute (NAMI) said providing safe pork to consumers and ensuring the safety of the workforce would remain the “highest priorities” under both the new and existing rules. It said that in the pilot program, pig slaughterhouses did not operate at line speeds that were significantly faster than the current maximum line speeds for market hogs.“Line speeds vary day to day, shift to shift. If someone calls in sick or equipment breaks, line speeds are adjusted. Plants would only run at speeds that maintain food safety, worker safety, animal welfare, and quality. [The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service] would constantly verify plants are maintaining food safety process control. If this new system allows for further innovation in this goal, it is a welcome option,” said NAMI spokesperson Sarah Little.Ted Genoways, author of The Chain: Farm, Factory, and the Fate of Our Food, an exposé of worker conditions inside US meat processing plants, said he believed the new rules would be disastrous.“By allowing companies to run their production lines as fast as possible, the USDA is giving the green light to dramatically expanding the volume of meat production within an already strained system. In their own study group, this increased animal abuse, environmental violations, and work safety violations.“And by giving yet another break to corporate interests, the USDA is also harming small farmers who are producing safer and healthier pork,” he said.",US moves to scrap speed limits on pig slaughter lines,2019-09-18/17:57:55,the us government has given the go ahead to new rules to eliminate production line speed limits at pig slaughterhouses deeming restrictions unnecessary despite fears that lifting them will worsen the already high number of serious injuries suffered by us meat plant workers amputations fractured fingers second degree burns and head trauma are just some of the serious injuries suffered by us meat plant workers every week according to an investigation last year by the guardian and the bureau of investigative journalism the investigation found that us meat workers are already three times more likely to suffer serious harm than the average american worker with pork and beef workers nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries however the united states department of agriculture usda said maximum line speeds were an unnecessary regulatory obstacle to industry innovation and that its new rules the first reform to pork inspections for  years were overdue they would the department said this week allow companies to bring in new food safety measures while still protecting public health the usda rules will also allow state inspection officials at pig slaughterhouses to be replaced with company employees the government agency said that by requiring the pork industry to use its own staff to sort and remove unfit animals the usda will be able to free up resources to be used elsewhere it insisted that under the new swine slaughter inspection system usda staff would continue to inspect  of animals before slaughter and carcasses afterwards the usda has estimated that the new rules could potentially save it more than m  m a year this regulatory change allows us to ensure food safety while eliminating outdated rules and allowing for companies to innovate said us agriculture secretary sonny perdue campaigners claimed the rule change amounted to a privatisation of pig slaughter inspection the least trump s usda could do is be honest with the american people about the new harmful hog slaughter inspection rule said wenonah hauter the executive director of food water watch hauter s organisation said that according to usda data there would be a reduction of  in the number of usda inspectors assigned to slaughter lines in plants that switch to the new rules the implementation of the rule will result in the fox guarding the henhouse said hauter with less government oversight over hog slaughter inspection big meat companies will have the freedom to inspect themselves and push towards their goal of increasing line speeds there s no doubt about it faster line speeds plus less inspection equals more food contamination the national pork producers council said the new inspection system which has already been piloted by the usda would incentivise investment in new technologies while ensuring a safe supply of american pork the north american meat institute nami said providing safe pork to consumers and ensuring the safety of the workforce would remain the highest priorities under both the new and existing rules it said that in the pilot program pig slaughterhouses did not operate at line speeds that were significantly faster than the current maximum line speeds for market hogs line speeds vary day to day shift to shift if someone calls in sick or equipment breaks line speeds are adjusted plants would only run at speeds that maintain food safety worker safety animal welfare and quality the usda s food safety and inspection service would constantly verify plants are maintaining food safety process control if this new system allows for further innovation in this goal it is a welcome option said nami spokesperson sarah little ted genoways author of the chain farm factory and the fate of our food an exposé of worker conditions inside us meat processing plants said he believed the new rules would be disastrous by allowing companies to run their production lines as fast as possible the usda is giving the green light to dramatically expanding the volume of meat production within an already strained system in their own study group this increased animal abuse environmental violations and work safety violations and by giving yet another break to corporate interests the usda is also harming small farmers who are producing safer and healthier pork he said ,Boeing Crisis,0.15002278983592987
1422,"The number of commercial aircraft in operation will more than double in the next 20 years to 48,000 planes worldwide, Airbus has forecast.The European aerospace company said that despite mounting concerns about the effects of aviation and the climate crisis, it believes air travel will continue to grow rapidly.Urbanisation and development will mean the emerging global middle class of air passengers could rise 50% by 2038 to almost 6 billion people.Most of the expected 4.3% annual growth in air traffic will occur in the Asia-Pacific region, where demand for new planes is set to surpass that of Europe and North America combined.Airbus executives said aviation growth had proved resilient in the face of economic and geopolitical shocks, such as war and oil price rises, and they expected it to continue.Last year, the growth in flying exceeded predictions, with the number of flights per year up by 280m. Christian Scherer, the chief commercial officer of Airbus, said: “It is as if every single inhabitant of the US took another trip.”The manufacturer expects about 60% of the global fleet of 22,680 passenger jets and freight aircraft to be replaced with new planes in the next two decades, which it said would “contribute to progressive decarbonisation of the air transport industry”.Asked if “flight-shaming” could affect Airbus’s forecasts, Scherer said: “It’s not a concern. We’d rather see it fundamentally as an opportunity. Airbus sees itself as a champion of bringing global emissions down and lowering fuel burn.”While newer models of plane are far lighter and consume much less fuel, aviation’s overall carbon emissions have grown due to the huge rise in passenger numbers. Airbus said that on average, fuel consumption by distance per passenger is 47% of what it was in 1990. However, the number of annual passenger flights worldwide has quadrupled to 4 billion during that period.The average aircraft has more seats and spends 2.3 more hours per day flying than 20 years ago - a trend that suggests even more air journeys could come from the 39,000 planes Airbus forecasts to be delivered by 2038.Bob Lange, the senior vice-president for business analysis at Airbus, said its forecast had not been tempered for potential flying restrictions, whether through government action or public pressure. He said: “Greta Thunberg says, listen to the scientists and be equitable. The growth we see is from routes that are developing.”Chinese domestic flights are due to triple and overtake US domestic flights as the biggest source of air traffic within the next two decades, according to the Airbus forecast. Indian people are expected to take five times as many flights as they do now by 2038.Lange said: “As we become more globalised there are more reasons to travel. The growth is largely coming from people who haven’t accessed air travel in the past. If the US decide to halve their travel, it’s not going to make a dent in people travelling for the first time.“In the notion of what we’re going to do to protect our planet there has to be a notion of equity.” He argued that it would be wrong to say other people shouldn’t aspire to travel as we do today.Scherer said the goal of halving aviation’s emissions by 2050 was “not talk”, but targets Airbus uses as anchors. As yet, no technology appears to exist that is compatible with continued growth in flying. Airbus is exploring sustainable fuels and alternative propulsion. It hopes to fly a test plane, the E-Fan X, in 2021, which could mean short-range hybrid-electric flights are feasible by the mid-2030s, Lange said. “We need to do more, it’s not enough but we can’t do it purely on our own.”",Airbus forecasts that number of planes in sky will double in 20 years,2019-09-18/17:54:16,the number of commercial aircraft in operation will more than double in the next  years to   planes worldwide airbus has forecast the european aerospace company said that despite mounting concerns about the effects of aviation and the climate crisis it believes air travel will continue to grow rapidly urbanisation and development will mean the emerging global middle class of air passengers could rise  by  to almost  billion people most of the expected   annual growth in air traffic will occur in the asia pacific region where demand for new planes is set to surpass that of europe and north america combined airbus executives said aviation growth had proved resilient in the face of economic and geopolitical shocks such as war and oil price rises and they expected it to continue last year the growth in flying exceeded predictions with the number of flights per year up by m christian scherer the chief commercial officer of airbus said it is as if every single inhabitant of the us took another trip the manufacturer expects about  of the global fleet of   passenger jets and freight aircraft to be replaced with new planes in the next two decades which it said would contribute to progressive decarbonisation of the air transport industry asked if flight shaming could affect airbus s forecasts scherer said it s not a concern we d rather see it fundamentally as an opportunity airbus sees itself as a champion of bringing global emissions down and lowering fuel burn while newer models of plane are far lighter and consume much less fuel aviation s overall carbon emissions have grown due to the huge rise in passenger numbers airbus said that on average fuel consumption by distance per passenger is  of what it was in  however the number of annual passenger flights worldwide has quadrupled to  billion during that period the average aircraft has more seats and spends   more hours per day flying than  years ago a trend that suggests even more air journeys could come from the   planes airbus forecasts to be delivered by  bob lange the senior vice president for business analysis at airbus said its forecast had not been tempered for potential flying restrictions whether through government action or public pressure he said greta thunberg says listen to the scientists and be equitable the growth we see is from routes that are developing chinese domestic flights are due to triple and overtake us domestic flights as the biggest source of air traffic within the next two decades according to the airbus forecast indian people are expected to take five times as many flights as they do now by  lange said as we become more globalised there are more reasons to travel the growth is largely coming from people who haven t accessed air travel in the past if the us decide to halve their travel it s not going to make a dent in people travelling for the first time in the notion of what we re going to do to protect our planet there has to be a notion of equity he argued that it would be wrong to say other people shouldn t aspire to travel as we do today scherer said the goal of halving aviation s emissions by  was not talk but targets airbus uses as anchors as yet no technology appears to exist that is compatible with continued growth in flying airbus is exploring sustainable fuels and alternative propulsion it hopes to fly a test plane the e fan x in  which could mean short range hybrid electric flights are feasible by the mid s lange said we need to do more it s not enough but we can t do it purely on our own ,Boeing Crisis,0.29385870695114136
1460,"Virgin Atlantic has laid out plans to boost its network of international routes by more than 400% and challenge the dominance of British Airways at an expanded Heathrow.The airline said its ambitious proposals would mean more choice and lower fares for passengers.However, Virgin acknowledged growth would depend on how the government chooses to allocate the hundreds of new daily slots available at the London airport after the third runway is built, possibly by 2026.Virgin currently flies to 19 long-haul destinations from Heathrow, but wants to serve 103 airports including European and domestic routes, and become a “second flag-carrier”.The airline said the government could put “an end to IAG’s [International Airlines Group] stranglehold over the UK’s only hub airport” by allowing a serious competitor to emerge. IAG, the parent company of BA, as well as Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, controls more than half of Heathrow’s slots.Research commissioned by Virgin found one in four Heathrow passengers can only fly with IAG, and could be paying 10% more in air fares as a result.The rules governing slot allocation at Heathrow are being reviewed by the government as part of its aviation strategy. Virgin said ministers should grasp a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to shake up the Heathrow market”.The airline proposes to compete on 26 of the 77 routes currently operated only by IAG from the airport, ranging from Bogotá and Buenos Aires to Budapest and Barcelona.Virgin would also add direct routes to new destinations including Kolkata, Jakarta and Panama City. Domestic routes would include Glasgow and Newcastle, likely served by the Flybe fleet acquired as part of the Connect Airways consortium, expected to soon be rebranded under a Virgin label.Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, said: “Never has the need for effective competition and choice at Heathrow airport been more evident than during this summer of disruption, which has brought misery for tens of thousands of travellers.“Britain, and those who travel to it, deserve better than this. Heathrow has been dominated by one airline group for far too long.”The airline hopes the additional capacity could be granted to airlines under similar principles to the “remedy slots” BA was forced to give up under competition rulings when it acquired BMI in 2012.Weiss said: “This would lower fares and give real choice to passengers, as well giving Britain a real opportunity to boost its trade and investment links around the world.”But IAG said Virgin’s minor presence at Heathrow was down to its corporate strategy and it had previously chosen not to acquire more slots. “The facts speak for themselves,” a spokeswoman said.“The airline has failed to create more competition at the airport – it closed Little Red on domestic routes, pulled off long-haul routes and rents out the slots it owns to other airlines to fly.”Virgin said it was temporarily leasing out two slots until 2021.Heathrow backed Virgin’s call for the government to change the slot allocation system. “One of the main benefits of expanding Heathrow is creating the capacity that will unlock competition among airlines, increasing choice and lowering air fares for passengers,” a spokesperson said.",Virgin Atlantic plans to take on British Airways for Heathrow flights,2019-09-17/17:47:08,virgin atlantic has laid out plans to boost its network of international routes by more than  and challenge the dominance of british airways at an expanded heathrow the airline said its ambitious proposals would mean more choice and lower fares for passengers however virgin acknowledged growth would depend on how the government chooses to allocate the hundreds of new daily slots available at the london airport after the third runway is built possibly by  virgin currently flies to  long haul destinations from heathrow but wants to serve  airports including european and domestic routes and become a second flag carrier the airline said the government could put an end to iag s international airlines group stranglehold over the uk s only hub airport by allowing a serious competitor to emerge iag the parent company of ba as well as aer lingus iberia and vueling controls more than half of heathrow s slots research commissioned by virgin found one in four heathrow passengers can only fly with iag and could be paying  more in air fares as a result the rules governing slot allocation at heathrow are being reviewed by the government as part of its aviation strategy virgin said ministers should grasp a once in a generation opportunity to shake up the heathrow market the airline proposes to compete on  of the  routes currently operated only by iag from the airport ranging from bogotá and buenos aires to budapest and barcelona virgin would also add direct routes to new destinations including kolkata jakarta and panama city domestic routes would include glasgow and newcastle likely served by the flybe fleet acquired as part of the connect airways consortium expected to soon be rebranded under a virgin label shai weiss virgin atlantic s chief executive said never has the need for effective competition and choice at heathrow airport been more evident than during this summer of disruption which has brought misery for tens of thousands of travellers britain and those who travel to it deserve better than this heathrow has been dominated by one airline group for far too long the airline hopes the additional capacity could be granted to airlines under similar principles to the remedy slots ba was forced to give up under competition rulings when it acquired bmi in  weiss said this would lower fares and give real choice to passengers as well giving britain a real opportunity to boost its trade and investment links around the world but iag said virgin s minor presence at heathrow was down to its corporate strategy and it had previously chosen not to acquire more slots the facts speak for themselves a spokeswoman said the airline has failed to create more competition at the airport it closed little red on domestic routes pulled off long haul routes and rents out the slots it owns to other airlines to fly virgin said it was temporarily leasing out two slots until  heathrow backed virgin s call for the government to change the slot allocation system one of the main benefits of expanding heathrow is creating the capacity that will unlock competition among airlines increasing choice and lowering air fares for passengers a spokesperson said ,Boeing Crisis,0.303550660610199
1475,"A new “flying taxi” has been unveiled by German start-up Lilium, which claims the vertical take-off craft could be the basis for an on-demand air service within six years.The electric jet-powered five-seater aircraft is designed to travel up to 300km, a journey that would take it an hour at top speed.While a smaller version of its novel plane flew in 2017, Lilium said that the maiden flight of a full-scale prototype earlier this month – a brief, remote-controlled test hover in Munich – was a “huge step”.The firm, which has attracted more than €100m (£87m) in investment since its founding in 2015, has set a target of offering Uber-style, app-based air taxis in multiple cities by 2025.The latest iteration, with room for a pilot and four passengers, will be the template for Lilium’s mass production model. With sufficient economy of scale, Lilium believes fares would be around $70 (£55) per head for a cross-city hop from, for example, JFK airport to Manhattan.Daniel Wiegand, co-founder and chief executive, said: “We are taking another huge step towards making urban air mobility a reality. The Lilium Jet itself is beautiful and we were thrilled to see it take to the skies for the first time.”According to Lilium, the relatively simple design, beyond the 36 electric jet engines needed for vertical take-off and landing, make it more safe and affordable than other planes. Once in the air, the power needed in cruise is little more than that of an electric car, Lilium says. The fixed wing design gives a longer range than competitors with drone-based aircraft, which consume much more energy keeping airborne.Lilium will now seek certification for its new plane through rigorous flight testing, the next landmark being to move the jet seamlessly from vertical to horizontal flight.Although many people might have reservations about Lilium’s stated ambition – “a world where anyone can fly wherever they want, whenever they want” – Wiegand said that the firm was trying to meet society’s demands for quiet, green urban air travel.Remo Gerber, chief commercial officer, said the jet made around 20% of the noise of a helicopter: “You could utilise this in cities where people live, it’s totally electric powered ... This is very different.”He said that the ambition for an app-based on demand service would not mean “landing in every garden... You’d be working with regulation around the world, integrating with public transport systems where they have them. We’re coming at a respectful way of thinking how people live, how we create corridors and not just fill the skies with these things.”For people in rural Britain, for example, Gerber said, any disruption would compare favourably to building HS2: “You don’t have to cut through their lovely countryside. You need a little take-off pad and you’re connected to the whole country.

1494,"American Airlines (AA) pilots angrily confronted a Boeing official about an anti-stall system suspected in two fatal crashes of the manufacturer’s 737 Max aircraft, according to a new recording.In audio obtained by CBS News, members of AA’s pilots’ union quizzed Boeing officials about the system – knowns as MCAS – in a tense meeting in November last year, weeks after a Lion Air Max crashed in Indonesia and four months before the loss of an Ethiopian Airlines Max. In total, 346 people died in the two crashes.Boeing has been criticized for not disclosing how the MCAS anti-stall system worked – a move that allowed the company to avoid costly retraining.“We flat-out deserve to know what is on our airplanes,” one pilot is heard saying in the recording.“These guys didn’t even know the damn system was on the airplane – nor did anybody else,” another said.The official, Boeing vice-president Mike Sinnett, claimed the Lion Air disaster was a once-in-a-lifetime accident.He said: “I don’t know that understanding this system would’ve changed the outcome on this. In a million miles, you’re going to maybe fly this airplane, maybe once you’re going to see this, ever. So we try not to overload the crews with information that’s unnecessary so they actually know the information we believe is important.”The pilots countered: “We’re the last line of defence to being in that smoking hole, and we need the knowledge.”Boeing said it would make software changes but did not want to “rush and do crappy job of fixing the right things”. The fix was still being developed when the Ethiopian Airlines jet went down.The release of the recording came as the House transportation committee opened a hearing into the role of Boeing’s regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in certifying the Max.Democrat Rick Larsen, a member of the committee and the chair of the aviation subcommittee, said: “The FAA has a credibility problem.” He cited a Wall Street Journal story that claimed an internal review had found that senior FAA officials did not participate in or monitor crucial safety assessments of MCAS.Larsen said: “If that is in fact true, the [designation] process is not working as Congress intended.”The acting FAA administrator, Daniel Elwell, said he was “not aware of an internal assessment that reaches that conclusion”.Elwell was criticized for the FAA’s decision to hold off on grounding the US’s Max fleet after the second crash. The FAA was the last major world regulator to ground the plane and did so only after Donald Trump announced that the plane would be grounded.Democratic congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton said: “Why did it take so long compared to other countries? The public wants to know: why did it take so long?”Elwell said the FAA was a “data-driven, risk based system” and acted after it had received sufficient data to link the two crashes.","Pilots confronted Boeing with 737 Max fears after first fatal crash, audio reveals",2019-05-15/17:44:03,american airlines aa pilots angrily confronted a boeing official about an anti stall system suspected in two fatal crashes of the manufacturer s  max aircraft according to a new recording in audio obtained by cbs news members of aa s pilots union quizzed boeing officials about the system knowns as mcas in a tense meeting in november last year weeks after a lion air max crashed in indonesia and four months before the loss of an ethiopian airlines max in total  people died in the two crashes boeing has been criticized for not disclosing how the mcas anti stall system worked a move that allowed the company to avoid costly retraining we flat out deserve to know what is on our airplanes one pilot is heard saying in the recording these guys didn t even know the damn system was on the airplane nor did anybody else another said the official boeing vice president mike sinnett claimed the lion air disaster was a once in a lifetime accident he said i don t know that understanding this system would ve changed the outcome on this in a million miles you re going to maybe fly this airplane maybe once you re going to see this ever so we try not to overload the crews with information that s unnecessary so they actually know the information we believe is important the pilots countered we re the last line of defence to being in that smoking hole and we need the knowledge boeing said it would make software changes but did not want to rush and do crappy job of fixing the right things the fix was still being developed when the ethiopian airlines jet went down the release of the recording came as the house transportation committee opened a hearing into the role of boeing s regulator the federal aviation administration faa in certifying the max democrat rick larsen a member of the committee and the chair of the aviation subcommittee said the faa has a credibility problem he cited a wall street journal story that claimed an internal review had found that senior faa officials did not participate in or monitor crucial safety assessments of mcas larsen said if that is in fact true the designation process is not working as congress intended the acting faa administrator daniel elwell said he was not aware of an internal assessment that reaches that conclusion elwell was criticized for the faa s decision to hold off on grounding the us s max fleet after the second crash the faa was the last major world regulator to ground the plane and did so only after donald trump announced that the plane would be grounded democratic congresswoman eleanor holmes norton said why did it take so long compared to other countries the public wants to know why did it take so long elwell said the faa was a data driven risk based system and acted after it had received sufficient data to link the two crashes ,Boeing Crisis,0.3085190951824188
1842,"Russian authorities have said the deadly fire onboard an Aeroflot passenger jet was probably caused by pilot error, a technical malfunction or “adverse weather conditions”, apparently referring to reports that lightning struck the plane after takeoff.Emergency workers said on Monday they had removed 41 bodies from the scorched tail section of the Russian-made Sukhoi Superjet 100, confirming Sunday’s fire at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport as Russia’s deadliest aviation accident in several years.The country’s transport minister has said there is no reason to ground the fleet of Sukhoi aircraft, which is the leading civilian passenger jet developed in Russia since the days of the Soviet Union. The jet makes up one-fifth of the fleet at Aeroflot, the national carrier.Regional carrier Yamal Airlines, the country’s second biggest operator of the Superjet after Aeroflot, said on Monday it was cancelling its planned purchase of 10 of the planes, but cited high servicing costs, not safety concerns.Two children were among the 41 killed on the plane, which was flying to the Arctic city of Murmansk when it released a distress call shortly after takeoff and turned back to Moscow. Fire engulfed the plane’s tail section during an emergency landing after the aircraft struck the runway several times, igniting its fuel reserves.Video taken from inside the plane showed panic as flames enveloped the right engine and wing and smoke began filling the cabin.Tatyana Kasatkina, a flight attendant who forcibly evacuated passengers, told the Russian news website Baza: “You could see the fire [outside]. People were yelling that we’re burning but there was no fire inside of the plane […] I pushed the door open with my leg and grabbed the passengers so that they didn’t delay during the evacuation. I grabbed them by the collar.”Some passengers were shown in footage of the evacuation carrying luggage, including large backpacks and rolling suitcases, that they had apparently retrieved from overhead cabins.The pictures raised questions in Russian media of whether the rush to retrieve hand luggage had put lives at risk by slowing the evacuation from the burning plane. Investigators have said they would review the behaviour of pilots and flight crew during the accident, but have not indicated that the evacuation was in any way mishandled.Crew members said it was hit by hail while flying through clouds near Sheremetyevo airport, before apparently being struck by lightning.“A bright flash and a clap,” the pilot Denis Yevdokimov said, describing the alleged lightning strike. The plane lost all communications and its electronic flight system failed, he said.Video of the landing showed the plane bouncing along the tarmac before bursting into flames. The tail section became consumed by fire, discharging thick, black smoke as passengers were evacuated using emergency slides. Fire engines sped towards the blaze as some passengers were seen fleeing across the tarmac in tears. Some were carrying luggage they had apparently retrieved from overhead cabins.The death toll was originally reported as one, but rose sharply as emergency workers painstakingly retrieved the dead from the smouldering wreckage.Reports have indicated most of those killed were in the tail section. A seating chart showed all but one of the passengers killed were seated behind row 10. It took firefighters more than an hour to reach passengers in the tail section.“There were 78 people including crew aboard the airliner,” said a government spokeswoman. The latest tally showed 37 had survived.According to the Flightradar24 tracking service, the plane circled twice over Moscow before making an emergency landing after just under 30 minutes in the air.The Interfax news agency cited a source as saying the plane succeeded in making an emergency landing on the second attempt and that some of the aircraft’s systems then failed.Aeroflot operates 50 Sukhoi Superjets in its fleet of 255 passenger aircraft.

1859,"A Russian passenger jet burst into flames on Sunday while attempting an emergency landing at a Moscow airport, leaving as many as 41 passengers dead and more injured.Video from Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport shows the plane bouncing along the tarmac before it suddenly burst into flames. The tail section of the Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100 became engulfed by fire, discharging thick, black smoke as crew members evacuated passengers using emergency slides. Fire engines sped toward the blaze while some passengers were seen fleeing across the tarmac in tears. Some were carrying luggage.The death toll, originally reported as 19, rose sharply as Russian emergency workers painstakingly retrieved the bodies of the dead from the smouldering wreckage.Early reports indicate that most of those killed were trapped in the tail section of the plane. Russia’s Investigative Committee said two of the victims were children.“There were 78 people including crew aboard the airliner,” said a government spokeswoman. The latest tally showed that 37 had survived.No official cause has been given for the disaster. The Investigative Committee said it had opened an inquiry and was looking into whether the pilots had breached air safety rules.Some passengers blamed bad weather and lightning.“We took off and then lightning struck the plane,” the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily cited one surviving passenger, Pyotr Egorov, as saying.“The plane turned back and there was a hard landing. We were so scared, we almost lost consciousness. The plane jumped down the landing strip like a grasshopper and then caught fire on the ground.”The plane was flying to Murmansk, a Russian city in the Arctic circle, when the pilots reported an emergency onboard and turned back. Aeroflot, the carrier managing the flight, said that the reason may have been an engine fire.While attempting to land, the plane struck the runway several times, damaging the fuel tanks and igniting the fire in the rear section of the fuselage.It took the firefighters battling the blaze more than an hour to reach passengers in the tail section.The Flightradar24 tracking service showed that the plane had circled twice over Moscow before making an emergency landing after just under 30 minutes in the air.Interfax cited a source as saying the plane had only succeeded making an emergency landing on the second attempt and that some of the aircraft’s systems had then failed.Aeroflot currently operates 50 Russia-made Sukhoi Superjets in its fleet of 255 passenger aircraft. The carrier has ordered another 100 Superjets from Sukhoi, which is slated to deliver the aircraft between 2019 and 2026.There have been concerns with the plane’s reliability before the incident.

2167,"Tesla’s latest and more affordable electric car, the Model 3, will finally be available to order in the UK from early May, according to the firm’s chief executive, Elon Musk.More than 18 months since deliveries of the smaller electric saloon car began in the US, Musk announced that UK orders could be placed from next week, on 1 or 2 May. Those with reservations, which require a £1,000 deposit, will have priority access.Deliveries of the Model 3 will begin in the second half of 2019, according to Tesla’s UK website.

2241,"The global grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jets will cost the company more than $1bn, the company said on Wednesday.The jets were grounded after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, triggering investigations into the accidents across the world and engulfing Boeing in one of the biggest crises in its history.In its first quarterly earnings report since the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines disasters, Boeing announced it had abandoned its 2019 financial outlook and halted share buy-backs in mid-March as it deals with the crisis.Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chairman and chief executive officer, said: “We have great sorrow for the families affected. This weighs heavily on us.”He said the company’s first priority was to get the 737 Max back in the air and that the company was working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulators to end the aircraft grounding.The announcement was a sharp reversal from Boeing’s last earnings report in January, when executives unveiled plans to deliver more than 900 jetliners this year alongside higher sales and profits.The world’s largest plane-maker reported first-quarter revenue and cashflow below sharply lowered Wall Street estimates, largely due to stopping deliveries of the 737 Max jets, which were grounded in March after the two crashes.The crashes caused regulators worldwide to ground the 737 Max and triggered investigations into the aircraft’s development by federal transportation authorities and the US Department of Justice.Although safety experts have raised some questions over crew performance in both crashes, the regulatory fallout has been dominated so far by questions over anti-stall software known as MCAS, which Boeing has acknowledged was a common link in the separate chains of events leading to both crashes.Boeing’s close relationship with the FAA and its role in the certification of the plane have come under scrutiny. Calvin Scovel, the Transportation Department’s inspector general, is conducting an audit of the FAA’s certification of the 737 Max.Muilenburg said he could not give further details about the ongoing investigations but denied that anything had “slipped through the certification process”. He said erroneous data from the planes’ systems plus “actions or actions not taken” had contributed to the crashes.This week shareholder advisory group Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) opposed Muilenburg’s re-election as chairman and chief executive officer. “No one individual should have unfettered powers of decision,” PIRC said.Boeing cut production of the jets following the crashes to 42 aircraft per month, down from 52, and its operating cash flow in the first quarter was about $350m lower than a year earlier.Boeing also said it booked unspecified charges related to developing a fix for MCAS and pilot training, and was making steady progress toward certification of the software after completing more than 135 test and production flights.The company said it would be issuing a new forecast in the future when it has more clarity around the issues surrounding the 737 Max.Last week, an expert panel of the FAA judged that a software fix to the Max would be “operationally suitable,” and that airline pilots familiar with previous versions of the 737 won’t need additional time in flight simulators to learn about the new software that is unique to the Max.Jim Corridore, an airline analyst for CFRA Research, said that while Boeing still has much work to do, the FAA panel’s determination “shows that the return of the plane to flying is now a ‘when’ question rather than ‘if’ ... we remain firm in our view that Boeing will survive this with its order book largely intact.”",Boeing: global grounding of 737 Max will cost company more than

2449,"Israel’s Beresheet lander has failed in its attempt to become the first privately funded mission to land on the moon. The 150kg spacecraft began its descent on 11 April but ran into difficulties about 14km above the lunar surface, when the main engine shut down unexpectedly. The spacecraft was still six minutes before the scheduled landing time. Telemetry signals received from the lander made it clear that although the engine restarted, the spacecraft hit the moon’s surface at a speed of 500km per hour. At this speed, the spacecraft would have been destroyed on impact.It was planned that the spacecraft would reach zero velocity at an altitude of five metres above the moon’s surface, then its engines would turn off and the gentle lunar gravity would pull it softly to the surface.

2707,"An Israeli spacecraft has crashed into the lunar surface, ending the first privately funded attempt to land on the moon.About the size of a washing machine, the 585kg (1,290lb) robotic lander experienced an engine and communication failure in the last seconds of touchdown.The mission ended Israel’s hopes of joining the ranks of Russia, the US and China as the only countries to have made controlled landings on Earth’s nearest neighbour.“We had a failure in the spacecraft. We unfortunately have not managed to land successfully,” said Opher Doron, the general manager of Israel Aerospace Industries’ space division.“It’s a tremendous achievement up to now,” he added, saying the probe had already made Israel the seventh country to orbit the moon and the fourth to reach the lunar surface.Don’t stop believing! We came close but unfortunately didn’t succeed with the landing process. More updates to follow.#SpaceIL #Beresheet pic.twitter.com/QnLAwEdKRvNamed Beresheet, the Hebrew word for genesis, the four-legged craft had intended to measure magnetic fields from its landing site on a lunar plain called Mare Serenitatis, the Sea of Serenity.Its frame held a time capsule of digital files the size of coins containing the Torah, children’s drawings, dictionaries in 27 languages, Israeli songs, as well as memories of a Holocaust survivor.Beresheet was launched in February aboard a Falcon 9 rocket, one of SpaceX’s private fleets run by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.While crewed lunar trips have taken around three days, the probe took a much more circuitous route for its four million-mile (6.5m km) journey. It has spent 47 days, gradually making ever-widening elliptical orbits around the Earth until it was “captured” by the moon’s gravitational pull and looped closer to its surface.On Wednesday, the lander made a manoeuvre to lower its altitude for a lunar orbit of between nine and 124 miles while preparing for the landing. It managed to take a photo of the moon minutes before communication was lost.Funded almost entirely by donations, Beresheet was built by SpaceIL, an Israeli non-profit set up for the mission, in partnership with the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries. It cost about £70m, a fraction of the cost of previous state-led missions.Morris Kahn, a South African-born Israeli billionaire, is the main backer but the US Republican party and pro-Israel funder Miriam Adelson and her casino-owning husband, Sheldon, also gave $24m.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was at mission control, said: “If at first you don’t succeed, try again.”US and European space agencies intend to use an expanding commercial space industry to send people back to the moon. A Nasa-led plan is already underway to build a small crewed space station orbiting the moon, and the private sector has been tasked with helping to build it.Russia was the first country to make a soft landing, rather than a plummeting crash, on the surface of the moon in 1966. Following the end of the space race in the 1970s, there was no return until China sent a lander in 2013.

2907,"America First nationalism, indulgent free market economics, Republican libertarianism and a political system in hock to corporate lobbying has just contributed to killing 356 innocent people. The more we know about the crashes of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia – after anti-stalling devices locked both aircraft into unrecoverable nose-dives – the more shocking the story becomes.It is not just Boeing, a once magnificent company, that is being condemned – it is the US’s wider economic, political and regulatory structures. What is not required is a short-term software fix on the faulty MCAS system that automatically adjusts the plane’s flight trajectory, along with an improved safety manual and training for pilots, which is Boeing’s response so far. What is needed is a root-and-branch overhaul of the intersection between capitalism and democracy in the US. The current set-up – and the accompanying libertarian, anti-state, anti-regulation philosophy – literally kills people.The story begins in 2011. Europe’s new Airbus 320neo, with its superb fuel efficiency and low operating costs, had picked up 667 orders at the Paris air show, a record for a commercial aircraft. Worse, American Airlines had done the unthinkable: it had ordered 130 of the new Airbus and 130 of the older one. Boeing’s relationship with American was foundational: it could always rely on the airline for its bedrock business, an insider, all-American affair. Now American had dared to buy European in unprecedented volumes: it was a competitive necessity to match rival airlines. Boeing had to respond. But instead of developing a whole new plane that could carry heavier, fuel-efficient engines, it made the fateful decision to bolt them on to a variant of its 737 series. Since the days of Orville and Wilbur Wright, the key to safe flying has been to organise the pitch of the plane so that its aerodynamics work to prevent stalling, a complex interrelationship between the angle and shape of wings, the distribution of weight and the power of the engines. If you intend to use a heavier, more fuel-efficient engine, it will throw everything out of kilter. Essentially, you have to design a new plane.Boeing’s initial and correct reaction had been to commit to just that, but the process is enormously expensive and takes up to 10 years. The company had to react faster and keep its share price up, so the Max 8 was born, going into service in 2017. The technical problem was obvious. With heavier engines, the pitch of a plane with wholly different dynamics could be disturbed in some flying conditions. Hence the sensor in the front of the plane that would recognise changes in pitch and automatically adjust the wings to keep the plane stable, not in principle a bad idea, but one that requires hyper-reliability and a way for pilots to override the system when necessary.In the world of aerospace, such judgment calls should have required an entire recertification process and verification by a third party. That did not happen. For decades, regulation in the US has been hamstrung by the libertarian charge that government is inefficient and always wrong, taxes are a coercive infringement of individual liberty, and regulation inhibits private sector dynamism. The Federal Aviation Authority has an enviable technical reputation, but over the past decade it has suffered from successive budget cuts and government shutdowns as the Republican party has waged war on federal spending and federal agencies. Donald Trump, before the crashes, said he wanted to privatise the agency and scale it back even more.In order to function at all, the FAA has had to delegate regulation to airlines and manufacturers – the fox looking after the chicken coop. Essentially, Boeing decided that the Max 8 did not need recertification and this decision was not challenged by the FAA. Moreover, Boeing undertook much of the safety work itself without any independent review, although as yet the outside world does not know to what degree. What we do know is that 1,000 Boeing employees are seconded to the FAA. Boeing then decided to market the Max 8 as part of the 737 family rather than as a plane with wholly different flight characteristics and a new automated software system that, crucially, did not allow pilots to override in an emergency using standard, practised techniques. Instead, they would need special training, which was not offered or provided.When the first crash happened, Boeing did not ground all Max 8s; the FAA also failed to act. American prestige was at stake, along with Boeing’s commercial interests. Tellingly, after the second crash, the US was the last to ground the aircraft. But then Boeing is one of the US’s top 10 corporate lobbyists, contributing to Democrats and Republicans alike: juicy defence contracts, government backing for trade fights with Airbus and organising benign regulation costs money. But on safety it has backfired spectacularly.Boeing is now enveloped in an existential crisis. The libertarian thinking the company exploited has caused a collapse in its reputation and reinforced a long-overdue reaction to the excesses of corporate America. In my Radio 4 documentary, Goliath, I report on the growing intellectual and political revolt against the US right’s attempt to muzzle US policy on challenging monopolies. No, the market will not automatically correct them, the doctrine that has held sway since the 1980s. Companies as disparate as Amazon, Boeing and Facebook need challengers, constraints on their power and tough independent regulators.The conventional wisdom is that Trump’s re-election may be hard to stop. But it neglects growing alarm in the US about abuses of corporate power. The refrain is: “Let Donald Trump and his transport secretary, Elaine Chao (whose chief qualification for office is that she is the partner of the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell), go on the first 300 test flights when the Max 8 goes back into service.” Leading British Brexiters, so in love with all things American and distrustful of anything European, can fly with them.

2929,"“This is not just an airport. It’s a monument to victory,” is how posters around the terminal describe Istanbul’s colossal new airport.That remains to be seen. After starting on Friday, Turkish Airlines will have a 45-hour window to complete one of the most complex logistical projects in history, as it switches its entire operation to the new Istanbul airport from its existing hub at Atatürk international airport.Planners are calling this weekend move “the Big Bang”: a total of 10,000 pieces of equipment, from planes to huge aircraft-towing vehicles to fragile security sensors, will be moved from Atatürk to the new airport’s location, 30km north on the Black Sea. In just two days’ time, all Turkish Airlines flights will be expected to arrive and depart from the new site.The stakes could not be higher. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s 16 years in office have been characterised by his fondness for infrastructure megaprojects: new highways, mosques, ports and bridges – built to showcase the greatness of both Turkey and the president himself – have transformed the country. Though supposedly the engine of the economy, these projects are often finished at enormous cost to the taxpayer.Erdoğan calls them his “crazy projects” and the new airport might be the biggest and craziest of all. When completed in 2027 at a projected cost of £6bn, it should be the busiest airport in the world by a large margin: six runways and four terminals will be able to accommodate 200 million passengers a year, dwarfing Turkey’s aviation hub rivals in the Gulf.The project has long frustrated Istanbullus, however, who accept that the existing airport is at capacity but fear the new one’s spiralling costs are helping to bankrupt a country already on the brink of financial collapse.It comes at a fraught time for Erdoğan, too. At the same time that the grandest of his projects is supposed to open its doors, last week voters for the first time looked to have rejected Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) in local elections, putting the president on the back foot in the city where he grew up and where as mayor he became a political star. The ruling party is appealing the result of the Istanbul poll, delaying the official outcome.The opening date has been pushed back three times, but authorities insist that the main terminal building and two runways will be fully operational by Sunday, in what critics say it is a rushed and dangerous attempt to stay on schedule.Originally, every airline at Atatürk was supposed to move this weekend, but authorities eventually decided to limit it to Turkish Airlines, the country’s national carrier, when the daunting scale of the operation became clear. The timetable for the other airlines to move is unknown, as is the date for the closure of the old airport, located on a prime piece of real estate that has been earmarked for a “people’s garden” and luxury retail and housing developments.The mammoth switchover is just the first of many challenges facing the new airport. A handful of routes already operate there, but several flights have been suspended or cancelled. Reports say cargo and catering services hangars are not finished. The airport has been built at 60 metres above sea level, rather than the recommended 105 metres, in what detractors say was an attempt to save time and money.At least 27 deaths during construction have been reported since 2015. Work was briefly halted at one point due to protests over unpaid wages, and accommodation with bedbugs.“The pressure to open on time sped up the work and caused a lapse in control and security measures,” said Özgür Karabulut, the head of a workers’ union active at the site.“An electric mains board exploded, and many people fell from heights during high winds we shouldn’t have been working in.”Neither Turkish Airlines nor IGA, the consortium building and operating Istanbul Airport, responded to requests for comment.Aside from the hurry to open its doors, many of the new airport’s problems can be attributed to an original sin: its location, on a wetland by the Black Sea.Ever since the project’s inception in 2009, aviation experts have insisted that the unstable ground, the local bird population and the Black Sea’s changeable weather – including strong winds and fog – pose a safety threat to air traffic.“I am afraid it is going to be chaos,” said a former Turkish Airlines pilot, on condition of anonymity. “There’s no one with previous experience landing there. Every pilot is going to be learning the winds for the first time.“The logic was: ‘We are going to build a new airport in this location’, rather than ‘Where should we build a new airport?’”Turkish Airlines has expanded rapidly in the last decade, helped by Istanbul’s location at the crossroads of Europe, Africa and the Middle East, which allows it to fly shorter-haul and more fuel-efficient planes than other carriers. But its success has stretched Atatürk to capacity, and there is no room to build more runways.The new Istanbul airport, together with a third bridge across the Bosphorus completed in 2016 (substantially over budget) and ambitious plans for an Istanbul canal to rival those in Panama and Suez, are supposed to kickstart development north of the existing city, which is already home to at least 15 million people.The cost so far has included 1.5m trees, as vast swathes of the region’s northern Bosphorus forest are cut down to make way for the new projects without proper environmental impact research, said Aisha Yikici, an urban planner who is part of a campaign to protect the forest.“The northern forest is essential for giving Istanbul clear air and water, and of course is home to a lot of wildlife,” she said. “There will be new thermal and carbon dioxide emissions. None of that has been accounted for. It’s the same story with so many of these big projects.”As with all of Turkey’s controversial megaprojects, the new airport is driven by the promise of profits generated through public-private partnerships. But government tenders have largely been given to a group of five companies whose foreign currency debt is spiralling thanks to the lira crash last year.Loans of at least £13.4bn to the consortium have been guaranteed by state banks, creating what Bahadır Özgür, an economist, described as a “black hole” in state finances – particularly worrying given that Turkey officially entered a recession in February.Projections are based on initially 150 million and then 200 million passengers a year, even though Istanbul has another airport (the smaller Sabiha Gökçen) and despite the fact that Turkish Airlines’ passenger count has dropped by 10% since the lira crash, making it unlikely that the estimates will soon be met.“Regardless of all the other issues, the math just doesn’t add up,” Bahadır Özgür said. “This airport is a perfect symbol of modern Turkey.”Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for

2967,"A Japanese spacecraft has “bombed” a speeding asteroid 187m miles (300m km) from Earth in an attempt to retrieve material that could offer scientists new clues about the origins of life on the planet.The Hayabusa 2 probe released the device – called a small carry-on impact – on Friday as it hovered 500 metres above the asteroid Ryugu, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa).The cone-shaped impactor, fitted with a copper explosive the size of a baseball, was programmed to detonate 40 minutes after it was released, gouging a crater into the asteroid’s surface.As Hayabusa 2 made a swift exit to avoid a collision with the asteroid or sustain damage from the blast, it released a camera above the site that should be able to capture images of the event.It is not clear when the camera will be able to transmit the images and allow Jaxa to determine if the mission was successful.The probe will return to the site after the dust and debris have settled to observe the asteroid’s surface from above and collect “fresh” samples from underground that have not been exposed to the sun or space rays.If successful, it would be the first time a spacecraft has collected such materials. In a 2005 “deep impact” mission to a comet, Nasa observed fragments after blasting the surface but did not collect them.A live webcast of the mission room on the southern island of Tanegashima showed Jaxa staff applauding as the probe successfully completed each stage of the most critical phase of its mission so far.“We are excited to see what will happen when the impactor collides with the asteroid,” Takashi Kubota, an engineering researcher at Jaxa, said before the detonation.Hayabusa 2’s Twitter account confirmed the spacecraft did not encounter any problems during the evacuation, adding in its most recent update that the mission was “steadily progressing”.The size of the crater will depend on the composition of the asteroid’s surface – as many as 10 metres in diameter if it is sandy, and about 3 metres across if it is rocky, according to the space agency.The asteroid is thought to contain relatively large amounts of organic matter and water from 4.6bn years ago when the solar system was born.In February, Hayabusa 2 touched down briefly on the asteroid after a journey of more than three-and-a-half-years and fired a bullet into the surface to puff up dust for collection, before blasting back to its holding position.The 30bn yen mission was launched in December 2014. Any underground samples that were dislodged during the crater’s creation will be stored onboard Hayabusa 2 until it reaches its landing site in South Australia in 2020.Last September, Hayabusa 2 deployed two robots on the surface of Ryugu – named after an undersea palace in a Japanese folktale – that sent back dramatic video and still images.",Japanese spacecraft 'bombs' asteroid in scientific mission,2019-04-05/07:43:11,a japanese spacecraft has bombed a speeding asteroid m miles m km from earth in an attempt to retrieve material that could offer scientists new clues about the origins of life on the planet the hayabusa  probe released the device called a small carry on impact on friday as it hovered  metres above the asteroid ryugu according to the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa the cone shaped impactor fitted with a copper explosive the size of a baseball was programmed to detonate  minutes after it was released gouging a crater into the asteroid s surface as hayabusa  made a swift exit to avoid a collision with the asteroid or sustain damage from the blast it released a camera above the site that should be able to capture images of the event it is not clear when the camera will be able to transmit the images and allow jaxa to determine if the mission was successful the probe will return to the site after the dust and debris have settled to observe the asteroid s surface from above and collect fresh samples from underground that have not been exposed to the sun or space rays if successful it would be the first time a spacecraft has collected such materials in a  deep impact mission to a comet nasa observed fragments after blasting the surface but did not collect them a live webcast of the mission room on the southern island of tanegashima showed jaxa staff applauding as the probe successfully completed each stage of the most critical phase of its mission so far we are excited to see what will happen when the impactor collides with the asteroid takashi kubota an engineering researcher at jaxa said before the detonation hayabusa  s twitter account confirmed the spacecraft did not encounter any problems during the evacuation adding in its most recent update that the mission was steadily progressing the size of the crater will depend on the composition of the asteroid s surface as many as  metres in diameter if it is sandy and about  metres across if it is rocky according to the space agency the asteroid is thought to contain relatively large amounts of organic matter and water from  bn years ago when the solar system was born in february hayabusa  touched down briefly on the asteroid after a journey of more than three and a half years and fired a bullet into the surface to puff up dust for collection before blasting back to its holding position the bn yen mission was launched in december  any underground samples that were dislodged during the crater s creation will be stored onboard hayabusa  until it reaches its landing site in south australia in  last september hayabusa  deployed two robots on the surface of ryugu named after an undersea palace in a japanese folktale that sent back dramatic video and still images ,Boeing Crisis,0.22164690494537354
2981,"The pilots of the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max that crashed last month killing 157 people correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down, investigators said.In the final seconds before the crash, pilots tried desperately to right the plane by switching its anti-stall software on and off but to no avail. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.The Ethiopian government said data from the plane’s recorders showed “repetitive uncommanded aircraft nose-down conditions” and said Boeing should review its aircraft control system.The country’s transport minister, Dagmawit Moges, did not cite the aircraft’s controversial anti-stall system by name, but said: “The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft.”The initial findings will intensify pressure on Boeing to explain and resolve the issues with its Max jets, the company’s newest airplanes, which have been grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes in five months.The Boeing jet crashed on 10 March shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. It was the second crash of a 737 Max after the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October, which killed 189 people.Ethiopian Airlines said the report clearly showed that the pilots had followed procedures. “Despite their hard work and full compliance with the emergency procedures, it was very unfortunate that they could not recover the plane from the persistence of nosediving,” it said.Ethiopian investigators said the full investigation to determine what other factors may have been involved could take up to a year.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down.

As Boeing reported 239 commercial plane deliveries in the first half of the year, a 37% fall, rival Airbus shipped 389 deliveries, up 28% on the same period last year.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.While air investigation reports do not apportion blame, the Ethiopian inquiry has again highlighted the 737 Max control system. Indonesian investigations into the Lion Air crash have focused on Boeing’s anti-stall system, Mcas, new on the Max model of 737 aircraft.After the news conference, Moges told the New York Times that the Ethiopian Airlines pilots “turned the Mcas on and off, but I can’t say how many times because we will find that out when we have the final report”.Pilots on the Lion Air flight, which also crashed within minutes of takeoff, battled to keep the plane pointing upwards as Mcas forced the nose down. After that crash, Boeing issued instructions to pilots on how to override the Mcas system, but the Ethiopian crash report suggests they may not have worked.On Thursday Boeing announced that new software would ensure that pilots will always have the authority to override the system if it is activated by faulty sensor data.“I’d like to reiterate our deepest sympathies are with the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in the accident,” said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive. “We thank Ethiopia’s Accident Investigation Bureau [AIB] for its hard work and continuing efforts. Understanding the circumstances that contributed to this accident is critical to ensuring safe flight. We will carefully review the AIB’s preliminary report, and will take any and all additional steps necessary to enhance the safety of our aircraft.”Boeing could be left liable for huge payouts to victims and airlines. Lawsuits relating to both disasters have already been filed in the US, and some pilots have complained that the new features in the Max were not the subject of more comprehensive retraining.The manufacturer also faces an investigation by the US Department of Justice, with FBI involvement, into its development process, and Senate hearings into how the Federal Aviation Administration allowed it to self-certify parts of its aircraft.The 737 is Boeing’s bestselling current model, with about 5,000 orders worth up to $600bn (£456bn), of which 300 planes have so far been delivered to airlines.

3063,"A satellite air traffic surveillance system capable of tracking aircraft anywhere around the planet has been launched.The system, which will start tracking planes over the north Atlantic, has been developed to fill the holes in radar coverage – some 70% of global airspace – that became apparent in the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.UK and Canadian air traffic control services will be the first to trial the system.“For the first time in history, we can surveil all ADS-B-equipped aircraft anywhere on earth,” said Don Thoma, chief executive of Aireon, the firm which has developed the new system.Automatic dependent surveillance broadcast (ADS-B), which is used in the US and other airspace, automatically determines a plane’s location by satellite and broadcasts it. Planes will now be able to update constantly anywhere on earth, by using the 66 satellites in the Iridium satellite constellation, enabling real-time tracking worldwide.Most modern passenger jets – including the Boeing 777 of flight MH370 – are fitted with the transponders. The planes have until now broadcast their position every 10 to 15 minutes via satellite when flying over the ocean, with a single, short data transmission.Thoma said it would “radically optimise flight safety and efficiency”.As well as improving safety, tracking planes through ocean airspace that was previously invisible to controllers will allow airlines to fly more efficiently, Aireon said. It claimed that could save airlines up to $300 (£230) and two tonnes of CO2 on every transatlantic flight.Air traffic controllers expect to fit more planes into the busy Atlantic corridors, where flights have had to follow set routes at set speeds and heights to ensure safety. Traffic is predicted to grow by more than 50% in the next decade from about 500,000 transatlantic flights per year. Some 95% of that traffic is already equipped with ADS-B technology, which will become mandatory in the US and Europe next year.Martin Rolfe, the chief executive of the UK’s air traffic control service, NATS – an investor in Aireon – said it was a “revolution in the skies”. He said: “We’ve gone from seeing aircraft positions every 14 minutes to every eight seconds.”The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization mandated in the wake of the MH370 disaster that all passenger jets should be fitted with transponders, functioning throughout the flight, by 2020.The Malaysia Airlines flight disappeared from radar on 8 March 2014 after taking off from Kuala Lumpur headed for Beijing with 239 people onboard, and has not been located.",UK and Canada launch satellite-based aircraft tracking system,2019-04-02/18:20:45,a satellite air traffic surveillance system capable of tracking aircraft anywhere around the planet has been launched the system which will start tracking planes over the north atlantic has been developed to fill the holes in radar coverage some  of global airspace that became apparent in the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight mh uk and canadian air traffic control services will be the first to trial the system for the first time in history we can surveil all ads b equipped aircraft anywhere on earth said don thoma chief executive of aireon the firm which has developed the new system automatic dependent surveillance broadcast ads b which is used in the us and other airspace automatically determines a plane s location by satellite and broadcasts it planes will now be able to update constantly anywhere on earth by using the  satellites in the iridium satellite constellation enabling real time tracking worldwide most modern passenger jets including the boeing  of flight mh are fitted with the transponders the planes have until now broadcast their position every  to  minutes via satellite when flying over the ocean with a single short data transmission thoma said it would radically optimise flight safety and efficiency as well as improving safety tracking planes through ocean airspace that was previously invisible to controllers will allow airlines to fly more efficiently aireon said it claimed that could save airlines up to   and two tonnes of co on every transatlantic flight air traffic controllers expect to fit more planes into the busy atlantic corridors where flights have had to follow set routes at set speeds and heights to ensure safety traffic is predicted to grow by more than  in the next decade from about   transatlantic flights per year some  of that traffic is already equipped with ads b technology which will become mandatory in the us and europe next year martin rolfe the chief executive of the uk s air traffic control service nats an investor in aireon said it was a revolution in the skies he said we ve gone from seeing aircraft positions every  minutes to every eight seconds the un s international civil aviation organization mandated in the wake of the mh disaster that all passenger jets should be fitted with transponders functioning throughout the flight by  the malaysia airlines flight disappeared from radar on  march  after taking off from kuala lumpur headed for beijing with  people onboard and has not been located ,Boeing Crisis,0.46246248483657837
3086,"India’s destruction of one of its satellites has been labelled a “terrible thing” by the head of Nasa, who said the missile test created 400 pieces of orbital debris and posed a threat to astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS).Jim Bridenstine was addressing employees five days after India shot down a low-orbiting satellite in a missile launch that it says elevated the country to the elite tier of space powers.The satellite shattered into pieces, many of which are dangerously large but too small to track, Bridenstine said. “What we are tracking right now, objects big enough to track – we’re talking about 10cm (four inches) or bigger – about 60 pieces have been tracked.”The Indian satellite was destroyed at a relatively low altitude of 180 miles (300km), well below the ISS and most satellites in orbit.But 24 of the pieces were going above the ISS, said Bridenstine. “That is a terrible, terrible thing to create an event that sends debris at an apogee that goes above the International Space Station,” he said, adding: “That kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight.”“It’s unacceptable and Nasa needs to be very clear about what its impact to us is.”The US military tracks objects in space to predict the collision risk for the ISS and for satellites. It is tracking 23,000 objects larger than 10cm. That includes about 10,000 pieces of space debris, of which nearly 3,000 were created by a single event: a Chinese anti-satellite test in 2007, 530 miles above the surface.As a result of the Indian test, the risk of collision with the ISS has increased by 44% over 10 days, Bridenstine said. But the risk will dissipate over time as much of the debris will burn up as it enters the atmosphere.India’s ministry of external affairs said at the time of the launch the test was done in the lower atmosphere to ensure that there was no space debris. “Whatever debris that is generated will decay and fall back on to the Earth within weeks,” it said.The missile test was celebrated in India but also drew criticism because it was announced by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, while the government is supposed to be in caretaker mode before elections starting this month.The latest fragments add to the growing problem of space debris orbiting the Earth. Experts warn that unless the amount of junk is kept in check, collisions will become more frequent and could eventually trigger an apocalyptic cascade, something along the lines of the one seen in the opening sequence of the film Gravity, where the Hubble Space Telescope, ISS, a space shuttle and the majority of its crew are all reduced to splinters.This kind of chain reaction between orbiting objects happens when one collision produces a cloud of debris and each of those fragments goes on to trigger further collisions. In real life, the cascade would occur over decades rather than suddenly, but each additional uncharted fragment makes further collisions more likely.There are estimated to be about 900,000 pieces of debris larger than a marble in orbit around the Earth, according to statistical models cited by the European Space Agency. There are about 34,000 objects circulating that are larger than 10cm.Even collisions with tiny objects can be catastrophic in space, largely due to the pace at which spacecraft are moving in orbit, a minimum of 7.8km per second.• This article was amended on 4 April 2019 to correct the conversion of 10cm, which is around four inches, rather than six inches as originally stated.

3199,"One of the world’s most common pesticides will soon be banned by the European Union after safety officials reported human health and environmental concerns.Chlorothalonil, a fungicide that prevents mildew and mould on crops, is the most used pesticide in the UK, applied to millions of hectares of fields, and is the most popular fungicide in the US. Farmers called the ban “overly precautionary”.But EU states voted for a ban after a review by the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) was unable to exclude the possibility that breakdown products of the chemical cause damage to DNA. Efsa also said “a high risk to amphibians and fish was identified for all representative uses”. Recent research further identified chlorothalonil and other fungicides as the strongest factor linked to steep declines in bumblebees.Regulators around the world have falsely assumed it is safe to use pesticides at industrial scales across landscapes, according to a chief scientific adviser to the UK government. Other research in 2017 showed farmers could slash their pesticide use without losses, while a UN report denounced the “myth” that pesticides are necessary to feed the world.A European commission spokeswoman said: “The [chlorothalonil ban] is based on Efsa’s scientific assessment which concluded that the approval criteria do not seem to be satisfied for a wide range of reasons. Great concerns are raised in relation to contamination of groundwater by metabolites of the substance.”Chlorothalonil has been used across the world since 1964 on barley and wheat, as well as potatoes, peas and beans. The ban will be passed formally in late April or early May and then enter into force three weeks later, the commission spokeswoman said.The link between chlorothalonil and bumblebee losses was revealed in December 2017 in research that surprised scientists. How fungicides harm bees is still being studied, but chlorothalonil in particular is likely to make them more susceptible to the deadly nosema parasite by killing beneficial gut microbes.Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of the conservation charity Buglife, said the fact that the link to bumblebee harm had not led to safety tests for wild bees showed the inadequacy of the EU’s regulatory system: “Instead the EU process failed to apply the Efsa guidance on assessing risk to bees, so there were no bumblebee safety tests. When will regulators learn the lessons, stop kowtowing to the demands of the pesticide manufacturers and start applying the Efsa guidance that was finalised in 2013?”A widespread loss of pollinating insects in recent decades was revealed on Tuesday by the first national survey in Britain. The analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species found the insects had been lost from a quarter of the places they were found in 1980.However, Chris Hartfield from the UK’s National Farmers Union, said chlorothalonil played a vital role in controlling fungal diseases: “We feel the European commission has been overly precautionary in making this decision and has failed to consider the particular importance of this [pesticide] in the control of critical fungal diseases and in managing disease resistance. As a result, we believe sectors of UK agricultural and horticultural production will be put at significant risk.”",EU bans UK's most-used pesticide over health and environment fears,2019-03-29/13:22:27+0000,one of the world s most common pesticides will soon be banned by the european union after safety officials reported human health and environmental concerns chlorothalonil a fungicide that prevents mildew and mould on crops is the most used pesticide in the uk applied to millions of hectares of fields and is the most popular fungicide in the us farmers called the ban overly precautionary but eu states voted for a ban after a review by the european food safety authority efsa was unable to exclude the possibility that breakdown products of the chemical cause damage to dna efsa also said a high risk to amphibians and fish was identified for all representative uses recent research further identified chlorothalonil and other fungicides as the strongest factor linked to steep declines in bumblebees regulators around the world have falsely assumed it is safe to use pesticides at industrial scales across landscapes according to a chief scientific adviser to the uk government other research in  showed farmers could slash their pesticide use without losses while a un report denounced the myth that pesticides are necessary to feed the world a european commission spokeswoman said the chlorothalonil ban is based on efsa s scientific assessment which concluded that the approval criteria do not seem to be satisfied for a wide range of reasons great concerns are raised in relation to contamination of groundwater by metabolites of the substance chlorothalonil has been used across the world since  on barley and wheat as well as potatoes peas and beans the ban will be passed formally in late april or early may and then enter into force three weeks later the commission spokeswoman said the link between chlorothalonil and bumblebee losses was revealed in december  in research that surprised scientists how fungicides harm bees is still being studied but chlorothalonil in particular is likely to make them more susceptible to the deadly nosema parasite by killing beneficial gut microbes matt shardlow the chief executive of the conservation charity buglife said the fact that the link to bumblebee harm had not led to safety tests for wild bees showed the inadequacy of the eu s regulatory system instead the eu process failed to apply the efsa guidance on assessing risk to bees so there were no bumblebee safety tests when will regulators learn the lessons stop kowtowing to the demands of the pesticide manufacturers and start applying the efsa guidance that was finalised in  a widespread loss of pollinating insects in recent decades was revealed on tuesday by the first national survey in britain the analysis of  wild bee and hoverfly species found the insects had been lost from a quarter of the places they were found in  however chris hartfield from the uk s national farmers union said chlorothalonil played a vital role in controlling fungal diseases we feel the european commission has been overly precautionary in making this decision and has failed to consider the particular importance of this pesticide in the control of critical fungal diseases and in managing disease resistance as a result we believe sectors of uk agricultural and horticultural production will be put at significant risk ,Boeing Crisis,0.16271089017391205
3201,"Investigators believe Boeing’s controversial anti-stall system on its 737 Max aircraft was activated before Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 crashed, killing all 157 people onboard, according to reports of a high-level safety briefing with US regulators.The apparent findings, reported in the Wall Street Journal, would be the strongest indication yet that the same software problem could have contributed to the crash and that of Lion Air flight 610, which killed 189 people in Indonesia in October.Investigators in the Lion Air case highlighted how pilots battled to keep the plane pointing upwards as the system automatically forced the nose down.Ethiopian Airlines officials and Ethiopia’s transport minister have already said their 737 jet appeared to fly in a similar pattern to the Lion Air plane, both of which displayed erratic altitude during their short time in the air after takeoff.A preliminary report into the latest crash could be released by Ethiopian authorities within days. US officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had been briefed, Reuters said, on the contents of the black box recorders, which are being analysed in Paris by French air crash investigators.Boeing also faces legal action from relatives of those who died when the Nairobi-bound plane crashed on 10 March soon after taking off from Addis Ababa.The family of Jackson Musoni, a Rwandan citizen, filed in Chicago what appeared to be the first lawsuit related to the crash. It claims Boeing had defectively designed the automated flight control system and failed to warn the public, airlines and pilots of the plane’s allegedly erroneous sensors.Boeing said it could not comment on the lawsuit. Similar claims have already been brought in relation to the Lion Air crash.More legal action is expected to follow, with relatives considering a class action.Antonis Mavropoulos, who narrowly missed the flight, said: “I know that many of them are in contact with lawyers. I think that most of them will want to take this further.”The Greek engineer, who was turned away at the departure gate two minutes after it closed, is now spearheading a campaign to uncover why the plane went down. He said it was vital European authorities also became involved in the investigation.“This should be a turning point for the aviation industry,” Mavropoulos said. “The European parliament must also play a role. Everything points to fatal safety flaws and the problem lying with Boeing, deregulation of the industry and the way the 737 Max got approved by the FAA.”Mavropoulos, 53, said he had been deluged with thousands of messages, many from retired pilots and aviation experts, who he said expressed concerns that market competition was downgrading safety. He said he felt a moral obligation to find out why the plane crashed, adding: “Yes, I was lucky, but I now know I was not the only one. Thousands who have travelled with the plane were lucky too.”Boeing outlined this week steps it would take to restore its bestselling latest model to the air, including a planned software fix that would prevent the anti-stall system, known as Mcas, from repeatedly operating.Cockpit alerts to warn of potentially incorrect data from sensors will also be fitted as standard. While investigators found sensors had given wrong information about the angle of the plane before the Lion Air crash, neither the Indonesian nor Ethiopian planes displayed warnings, a safety feature sold as an optional extra.Boeing said it had also developed a mandatory training package for 737 Max pilots to undergo before the worldwide ban on flying the model is lifted. But it still proposes that qualified 737 pilots would not need time on flight simulators to safely operate the aircraft.The US Department of Justice is investigating Boeing’s development process, while the government is to review how the FAA certifies new aircraft, with questions being asked about the extent of self-certification by manufacturers.It appears US and European regulators were aware at least two years before the first 737 Max crash that the method for controlling the plane’s nose angle might not work in certain conditions.According to Reuters, European Aviation Safety Agency documents from 2016 certified the plane as safe, partly because training would “clearly explain” to pilots the “unusual” situations in which they would need use a manual wheel on the flight deck to adjust the angle. But those situations were not listed in the flight manual used by American Airlines, Reuters said.",Investigators 'believe Ethiopian 737 Max's anti-stall system activated',2019-03-29/13:09:27+0000,investigators believe boeing s controversial anti stall system on its  max aircraft was activated before ethiopian airlines flight et crashed killing all  people onboard according to reports of a high level safety briefing with us regulators the apparent findings reported in the wall street journal would be the strongest indication yet that the same software problem could have contributed to the crash and that of lion air flight  which killed  people in indonesia in october investigators in the lion air case highlighted how pilots battled to keep the plane pointing upwards as the system automatically forced the nose down ethiopian airlines officials and ethiopia s transport minister have already said their  jet appeared to fly in a similar pattern to the lion air plane both of which displayed erratic altitude during their short time in the air after takeoff a preliminary report into the latest crash could be released by ethiopian authorities within days us officials at the federal aviation administration faa had been briefed  said on the contents of the black box recorders which are being analysed in paris by french air crash investigators boeing also faces legal action from relatives of those who died when the nairobi bound plane crashed on  march soon after taking off from addis ababa the family of jackson musoni a rwandan citizen filed in chicago what appeared to be the first lawsuit related to the crash it claims boeing had defectively designed the automated flight control system and failed to warn the public airlines and pilots of the plane s allegedly erroneous sensors boeing said it could not comment on the lawsuit similar claims have already been brought in relation to the lion air crash more legal action is expected to follow with relatives considering a class action antonis mavropoulos who narrowly missed the flight said i know that many of them are in contact with lawyers i think that most of them will want to take this further the greek engineer who was turned away at the departure gate two minutes after it closed is now spearheading a campaign to uncover why the plane went down he said it was vital european authorities also became involved in the investigation this should be a turning point for the aviation industry mavropoulos said the european parliament must also play a role everything points to fatal safety flaws and the problem lying with boeing deregulation of the industry and the way the  max got approved by the faa mavropoulos  said he had been deluged with thousands of messages many from retired pilots and aviation experts who he said expressed concerns that market competition was downgrading safety he said he felt a moral obligation to find out why the plane crashed adding yes i was lucky but i now know i was not the only one thousands who have travelled with the plane were lucky too boeing outlined this week steps it would take to restore its bestselling latest model to the air including a planned software fix that would prevent the anti stall system known as mcas from repeatedly operating cockpit alerts to warn of potentially incorrect data from sensors will also be fitted as standard while investigators found sensors had given wrong information about the angle of the plane before the lion air crash neither the indonesian nor ethiopian planes displayed warnings a safety feature sold as an optional extra boeing said it had also developed a mandatory training package for  max pilots to undergo before the worldwide ban on flying the model is lifted but it still proposes that qualified  pilots would not need time on flight simulators to safely operate the aircraft the us department of justice is investigating boeing s development process while the government is to review how the faa certifies new aircraft with questions being asked about the extent of self certification by manufacturers it appears us and european regulators were aware at least two years before the first  max crash that the method for controlling the plane s nose angle might not work in certain conditions according to  european aviation safety agency documents from  certified the plane as safe partly because training would clearly explain to pilots the unusual situations in which they would need use a manual wheel on the flight deck to adjust the angle but those situations were not listed in the flight manual used by american airlines  said ,Boeing Crisis,0.4050702154636383

3231,"An independent financial information company has warned that 46% of travel insurance policies do not include protection against airline failure, which means many Wow Air passengers will not be covered for cancelled flights as a result of the airline’s closure on Thursday.Defaqto, which rates products including travel policies, has said that travellers are often left unprotected by policies that don’t cover against airlines getting into financial difficulty. Only 48% of annual and 47% of single-trip policies include this as standard, often describing it as “scheduled airline failure” cover. A small number of insurers also offer this as an optional extra (in 6% of annual and 7% of single-trip policies). Fine print may also include cover for “travel disruption”, when a passenger can’t reclaim the costs from another source.“With flights and holidays cancelled as a result of the Wow Air collapse, a lot of people’s holidays will be ruined over the coming months,” said Brian Brown, head of insight at Defaqto. “Airline failure is not covered as standard on over two-fifths of travel policies as the risk is usually relatively small.”Defacto analyses the 1,103 single-trip and 1,125 annual policies available in the UK, and its website also includes ratings for cruise, gap-year and winter sports insurance.The research highlights the importance of understanding what situations travellers are protected from and the get-out clauses that allow insurers not to pay out.“This is the second budget airline to collapse this year, so scheduled airline failure is a useful feature to have,” said Brown. “Another thing to be aware of is that if the airline collapses while you’re abroad, you may not get the payment for the return immediately, so always make sure you have access to some emergency funds in case the worst happens. You should always read the policy. It is the most boring half hour of your holiday, but probably the most important.”Passengers not covered by their travel insurance who booked Wow Air flights as part of a package holiday will be covered by Atol, and should be offered alternative flights. Those who booked directly using a credit card are advised to contact providers to seek a refund. Passengers may also have similar cover if they paid by Visa debit card and should contact their bank.

3236,"Eurotunnel has declared itself ready for a no-deal Brexit as it unveiled £13m of new infrastructure, including passport controls and additional border inspection posts in Calais.After two years of preparations, often in the absence of any government direction, and the millions of pounds spent on plans that may never be implemented, its parent company Getlink said it was “ready no matter what”.At the launch of the additions to its 650-hectare (1,606-acre) commercial fortress in Calais, the company said it believed it would be able to guarantee no extra delays on traffic going through the tunnel into the UK.And it hopes its new infrastructure combined with more staff will mean the mandatory animal health checks needed by the EU can be easily accommodated.“We do not expect any delays. We are ready. This preparation is for the worst case of no deal so that in that instance the traffic continues to flow through at the same rate as it does now,” said John Keefe, the director of public affairs at Getlink.Under a £20m no-deal contingency plan implemented by the French government in January, the Eurotunnel site in Calais has been designated the official EU border inspection post for horses and other large animals.It is part of a jigsaw of checks on the French side of the Channel, with British fish due to being examined in nearby Boulogne and other fresh food a few kilometres away at a third inspection post near Calais port.At the moment horses can travel freely between the three racing nations of France, Britain and Ireland as long as they have a passport and an intra-trade animal health certificate.In the event of a no-deal Brexit a newly built border inspection post awaits for all racehorses and bloodstock to be physically checked in at Calais. Stables for queues of up to 20 horses are expected to be completed in the coming days.The checks will be mandatory to guard against the spread of disease such as the recent outbreak of equine flu, which caused the cancellation of horse races in Britain.The French authorities have been performing dry runs for customs declarations and on Thursday security staff were out in force stamping specimen customs declarations forms.As the British government has already said it will not be conducting any checks on goods coming into the UK, these rehearsals remain academic, but part of the meticulous planning in motion for a no-deal Brexit in France.In the event all runs smoothly in Dover, the key risk for British business is expected to centre on animal and food exports, which will be subject to mandatory controls for disease and pests. This means 100% documentary checks on animals and physical checks for 20% of beef, pork and lamb, and 50% of poultry.As well as the new infrastructure, Eurotunnel also unveiled “green and orange” routes for entry into France and the EU.Those requiring checks will be directed on the orange route towards a border control zone involving customs, sanitary and phytosanitary checks featuring nine bays, where a truck can be fully unloaded in secure and temperature-controlled warehousing.“We have space for 100 trucks to be parked, 50% of our hourly traffic, and that’s way more than the authorities say they need,” said Keefe. “We’ve spent €15m on new buildings, warehousing, e-gates for passport checks, cameras, scanners, roads and signage.”Thursday was not a typical day for Eurotunnel traffic flow, with a French customs work-to-rule protest causing 23 miles of queues from Calais to the Belgian border.The work to rule strike has been disrupting traffic for three weeks, causing delays of up to six hours. Tempers were frayed as drivers waited for security checks.“Brexit will be the death of the UK,” declared one French driver as he waited at the “pit stop”, where 20 heavy goods vehicles at a time were stopped to be checked by dogs straining at their leashes as they sniffed for stowaways.Although the delays are not related to Brexit, they illustrate the potential impact of disruption and the risk posed by a no-deal scenario if all does not go as smoothly as everyone on the French side of the border intends.",'We're ready no matter what': Eurotunnel all set for no-deal Brexit,2019-03-28/14:17:03+0000,eurotunnel has declared itself ready for a no deal brexit as it unveiled m of new infrastructure including passport controls and additional border inspection posts in calais after two years of preparations often in the absence of any government direction and the millions of pounds spent on plans that may never be implemented its parent company getlink said it was ready no matter what at the launch of the additions to its  hectare   acre commercial fortress in calais the company said it believed it would be able to guarantee no extra delays on traffic going through the tunnel into the uk and it hopes its new infrastructure combined with more staff will mean the mandatory animal health checks needed by the eu can be easily accommodated we do not expect any delays we are ready this preparation is for the worst case of no deal so that in that instance the traffic continues to flow through at the same rate as it does now said john keefe the director of public affairs at getlink under a m no deal contingency plan implemented by the french government in january the eurotunnel site in calais has been designated the official eu border inspection post for horses and other large animals it is part of a jigsaw of checks on the french side of the channel with british fish due to being examined in nearby boulogne and other fresh food a few kilometres away at a third inspection post near calais port at the moment horses can travel freely between the three racing nations of france britain and ireland as long as they have a passport and an intra trade animal health certificate in the event of a no deal brexit a newly built border inspection post awaits for all racehorses and bloodstock to be physically checked in at calais stables for queues of up to  horses are expected to be completed in the coming days the checks will be mandatory to guard against the spread of disease such as the recent outbreak of equine flu which caused the cancellation of horse races in britain the french authorities have been performing dry runs for customs declarations and on thursday security staff were out in force stamping specimen customs declarations forms as the british government has already said it will not be conducting any checks on goods coming into the uk these rehearsals remain academic but part of the meticulous planning in motion for a no deal brexit in france in the event all runs smoothly in dover the key risk for british business is expected to centre on animal and food exports which will be subject to mandatory controls for disease and pests this means  documentary checks on animals and physical checks for  of beef pork and lamb and  of poultry as well as the new infrastructure eurotunnel also unveiled green and orange routes for entry into france and the eu those requiring checks will be directed on the orange route towards a border control zone involving customs sanitary and phytosanitary checks featuring nine bays where a truck can be fully unloaded in secure and temperature controlled warehousing we have space for  trucks to be parked  of our hourly traffic and that s way more than the authorities say they need said keefe we ve spent m on new buildings warehousing e gates for passport checks cameras scanners roads and signage thursday was not a typical day for eurotunnel traffic flow with a french customs work to rule protest causing  miles of queues from calais to the belgian border the work to rule strike has been disrupting traffic for three weeks causing delays of up to six hours tempers were frayed as drivers waited for security checks brexit will be the death of the uk declared one french driver as he waited at the pit stop where  heavy goods vehicles at a time were stopped to be checked by dogs straining at their leashes as they sniffed for stowaways although the delays are not related to brexit they illustrate the potential impact of disruption and the risk posed by a no deal scenario if all does not go as smoothly as everyone on the french side of the border intends ,Boeing Crisis,0.14310872554779053
3245,"Transport bosses need little prodding in public to utter the words “safety is our number one priority” – a mantra so widespread that, as with an English person inquiring “How do you do?” the inherent insincerity is barely noted.Clearly, the main objective of rail companies, airlines or carmakers is moving people or things, for profit, with all the risk that entails. What those industries have excelled at is vastly reducing that risk. In Britain, more than 11 years have elapsed since a passenger was killed in a train crash. Fatality rates in car accidents are declining, particularly for drivers; yesterday the European commission announced that extra safety features, including automatic speed limiters, would soon be mandatory.Aviation in particular has long enjoyed the statistical claim to be the safest form of transport. Worldwide, modern passenger jets appeared to have reached a point where they never crashed without the deliberate, malign intervention of terrorists or suicidal pilots. But the fate of the two Boeing 737 Max planes, which both crashed soon after takeoff, has perhaps done more to undermine faith in the industry’s own processes than any preceding incidents in recent history.Questions have been asked of the regulator, the US Federal Aviation Administration, and the scope it gave Boeing to verify its own plane’s safety. Boeing has convened pilots, regulators and technical experts today to explain their work and try to restore confidence – shaken again this week by the emergency landing in Florida of a 737 Max that was being moved for storage purposes while banned from passenger service.No airline would ever want to believe it was flying a plane that might crash. But some suggest that the cumulative commercial pressures that airlines feel have ways of resurfacing throughout an industry, with potentially nefarious effects. Airlines vie to offer cheaper fares; costs per seat can be offered via newer, more fuel-efficient planes. A new model is even more cost-effective if it does not require highly paid pilots – trainers and trainees – to be taken off active duty to spend time at bases in simulators.We now know that at least some US 737 pilots were appalled to discover that only short “differences training”, self-taught in a short session on an iPad, was deemed necessary to learn to fly the updated 737 Max, whose design was different enough for Boeing to decide new anti-stall software was needed. It’s difficult to read even the cold, formal, occasionally broken English of the preliminary report into the first 737 Max crash in Indonesia without feeling the horror: two young Lion Air pilots, thousands of feet up in the air, clueless how to battle an onboard computer that was repeatedly, erroneously, pushing the nose of the plane down. The software countermanded the pilots’ instructions 26 times in a row, and finally took 189 people into the sea. Subsequent reports of cockpit voice recordings show that the pilots were desperately leafing through the manual.We now also know that Boeing had designed safety features and warning lights for the 737 Max as an optional extra purchase – money that airlines in the US decided was worth spending, though carriers in the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes did not. Those will now be standard.Neither are safety regulators immune from financial pressures. Indeed, the firms they regulate are the ones often paying for their services – in other words, customers who can in some circumstances shop around. Cost-cutting at Britain’s own air safety regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, led to a large exodus of experienced staff, and whistleblowers afterwards leaked a highly critical internal report claiming passenger safety was at risk. Today light-touch regulation – assessing airlines’ competency to certify their own safety, rather than employing inspectors to actually do the checks – is broadly accepted in the industry. But it coincided with the Shoreham crash, the worst airshow disaster in 60 years; investigators turned their fire on the CAA’s licensing regime, which had inspected just eight of 281 shows approved.In the US, politicians have long queried the closeness of the FAA to Boeing, the manufacturer it regulates – but to which it also delegates aspects of aircraft safety certification. Yesterday again the FAA defended that practice in a Senate hearing on cost grounds.The idea that cutting corners or costs risks such loss of human life feels obscene. Yet arguably those are choices made any time someone opts to buy a car faster and less reinforced than a square and solid Volvo. In government accounting, the value of a prevented fatality has a number. But honest conversations about the amount of risk we are prepared to tolerate are rare.One answer the Department for Transport came up with to drive down the spiralling costs of rail travel was to cut guards on trains. This week, the rail accident investigation board reported how, for the third time recently, dozens of angry passengers trapped in a stuck train with no guard decided to disembark on to the tracks, at high risk of electrocution or being hit by other trains. Nonetheless, many rail operators – and doubtless passengers when questioned on fare levels – regard cutting guards as a sensible trade-off.Disasters tend to shift that perception of acceptable risk. As Amy Fraher, author of The Next Crash: How Short-Term Profit Seeking Trumps Airline Safety, observed in her 2014 book, few in finance saw the risks developing before banks imploded in 2008, and aviation processes could be under similar strain. According to her research, a majority of US pilots believed a combination of fatigued staff and commercial pressures would soon lead to another crash. To take for granted increases in safety – the result of many years of often expensive, laborious rule-making and regulation – could again prove a fatal mistake.• Gwyn Topham is the Guardian’s

3365,"A British Airways plane scheduled to travel from London for Düsseldorf mistakenly flew its passengers to Edinburgh instead.Rather than head east from City airport across the North Sea into Europe, the plane flew due north to the Scottish capital. But the mistake was only spotted while landing, when passengers were welcomed to Edinburgh.According to one account, the pilot then took a show of hands from passengers to see who had expected to land in Germany.BA said the fault with the path of BA3271, which went 500 miles in the wrong direction after takeoff on Monday morning, lay with its German operator.The flight was run by a German company, WDL Aviation, under a “wet-lease” arrangement where the plane and crew are hired under BA CityFlyer branding.BA said a paperwork error was to blame, with the pilot following orders from Germany, where WDL’s head office had filed the incorrect flight plan.Startled passengers who left London at 7.30am reported at first believing that the pilot was joking, when the “welcome to Edinburgh” announcement was made from the cockpit.Sophie Cooke, a 24-year-old management consultant who travels from London to Düsseldorf weekly, told the BBC she asked the cabin crew if they were serious.The passengers were asked to raise their hands if they wanted to go to Düsseldorf. All did.Cooke said: “The pilot said he had no idea how it had happened. He said it had never happened before and that the crew was trying to work out what we could do.”She said the unplanned stopover grew increasingly frustrating, on a “really stuffy” plane. “The toilets were blocked and they ran out of snacks,” she said.After two and a half hours on the tarmac at Edinburgh airport, the refuelled passenger jet – a BAe 146 aircraft that can carry 80-100 passengers – took off again for Düsseldorf.Another passenger, Son Tran, tweeted to BA: “While an interesting concept, I don’t think anyone onboard has signed up for this mystery travel lottery.”As well as the bonus trip to Edinburgh, passengers should be receiving at least €250 (£215) in compensation under EU flight delay regulation 261, after landing five hours and 20 minutes behind schedule on what should have been an hour-long hop.An investigation has been launched by BA and WDL.

3370,"The anti-stall system that pilots battled before the crash of a Lion Air-operated Boeing 737 Max in October was also likely to have been activated before 157 people were killed this month on a flight of the same model leaving Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian Airlines chief executive has said.The new feature of the 737 Max, the manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system (MCAS), has been highlighted by an investigation into the previous crash, in which 189 people were killed when their plane went down in the Java Sea off Indonesia 12 minutes after takeoff.Ethiopian’s boss, Tewolde GebreMariam, told the Wall Street Journal he believed MCAS was also “to the best of our knowledge” in play for the brief duration of flight 302 from Addis Ababa.MCAS automatically forces the nose of the plane down to prevent stalling, and was introduced to compensate for the new position of engines on the 737 Max model. A preliminary report into the Lion Air crash has suggested the combination of incorrect sensor readings and MCAS contributed to the plane diving into the sea.GebreMariam’s reported remarks are the first from a senior official close to the flight to confirm that MCAS was operating, although he said that only the investigation would provide conclusive evidence. The black boxes are in Paris being analysed by France’s air crash investigation bureau, the BEA.In an official statement released by Ethiopian on Monday morning, GebreMariam said he did “not want to speculate as to the cause” but “many questions on the 737 Max airplane remain without answers”.He again stressed the modernity of the airline’s safety and training systems, which include a dedicated simulator for the 737 Max, adding: “Contrary to some media reports, our pilots who fly the new model were trained on all appropriate simulators. The crews were well trained on this aircraft.”Despite the crash, he said: “Let me be clear: Ethiopian Airlines believes in Boeing.”The vote of confidence is likely to be welcomed by Boeing, whose stock has been battered since the two crashes. The company will brief more than 200 global airline pilots, technical experts and regulators this week on software and training updates for the 737 Max. It is expected to build enhanced warning devices as standard into every plane. A cockpit light to notify of faulty sensors had been installed in many planes – including the American Airlines fleet – but was not purchased by Lion Air or Ethiopian.On Friday, the Indonesian carrier Garuda became the first airline to scrap its order for the model, blaming a lack of public trust. It has taken just one of 50 737 Max planes it has on order, worth up to $6bn on listed prices.The current global fleet of 387 planes remains grounded as investigations continue.

If the software detects the nose is pointing up at a dangerous angle it has the ability to automatically push the nose down in an attempt to stop the plane stalling.One of the optional extras – the angle of attack indicator – displays the readings of the two sensors, and the other – the disagree light – is an alert that activates if those sensors do not agree.Boeing has told airlines that it expects to have new software ready by the end of the month, and it is understood that the disagree light will become a standard feature on all new 737 Max planes.The angle of attack indicator will remain an optional extra that airlines can buy, according to the New York Times report.“They’re critical, and cost almost nothing for the airlines to install,” Bjorn Fehrm, an analyst at the aviation consultancy Leeham, told the newspaper. “Boeing charges for them because it can. But they’re vital for safety.”The Guardian has approached Boeing for comment.Voice recordings from Lion Air flight 610, yet to be officially released, suggest the pilots looked through the flight manual as the jet incorrectly alerted them it was stalling and automatically pushed the nose down.

3546,"The pilots of the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max that crashed in Indonesia were searching a flight manual to try to find why the plane kept lurching downwards against their commands, according to reports of the cockpit voice recording.The investigation into the crash, which killed all 189 people on board last October, has become even more significant for Boeing and airlines due to its suspected links with the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, where 157 died on the same model of plane.The Ethiopian government and French accident investigators have said flight data shows clear similarities between the two 737 Max crashes.According to sources who spoke to Reuters, the voice recordings from Lion Air – yet to be officially released – show that the captain asked the first officer to check the flight manual within minutes of takeoff as they struggled to control the aircraft.The captain was at the controls of Lion Air flight JT610 when the 737 Max took off from Jakarta. Two minutes into the journey, the first officer reported a “flight control problem” to air traffic control. The sources said airspeed was mentioned on the cockpit voice recording, and that an indicator showed a problem on the captain’s display but not the first officer’s.The pilots looked through the handbook containing checklists for abnormal events, as the jet incorrectly alerted pilots it was in a stall, pushing the nose down – an automated response built into the software as part of the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS) anti-stall program in the 737 Max.As the captain fought to climb, the computer continued to push the nose down. “They didn’t seem to know the trim was moving down,” the third source said. “They thought only about airspeed and altitude. That was the only thing they talked about.”The sources told Reuters that the pilots remained calm for most of the flight. Near the end, the captain asked the first officer to fly while he checked the manual. The Indian-born captain, 31, was silent at the end, while the Indonesian first officer, 41, said “Allahu Akbar”, the Arabic expression meaning “God is greatest”.The plane crashed shortly after, killing everyone on board.Lion Air said all data and information had been given to investigators and declined to comment further.Regulators around the world grounded the 737 Max model last week after a crash in Ethiopia, the second fatal disaster in five months. The black box recorders from Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 are being examined by French air accident investigators in Paris, who have yet to release an official report. However, the fact the pilot also reported flight control problems in the same new plane, which climbed erratically and crashed soon after takeoff, has left the safety of the plane in doubt.More than 300 737 Max planes have been taken out of service and deliveries suspended for another 5,000 on order. Boeing has told airlines it expects to have new software ready by the end of the month.Following the second fatal accident, US authorities are reviewing whether enough was done to ensure the plane was safe to fly. Federal prosecutors and regulators have opened an inquiry into the 737 Max’s development, with scrutiny mounting over how the US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing certified the aircraft.Questions have also been asked about the training of the Lion Air crew. Although pilots in the US have said the manufacturer did not highlight modifications to the plane’s behaviour, Boeing has said existing safety procedures would allow pilots to override the plane’s computer, should it erroneously attempt to force it down.The preliminary report into the Lion Air crash showed that a different crew flying the same plane the previous evening had encountered the same problem but solved it after running through three checklists. However, they did not pass on that experience to the next crew, the report said.According to a report from Bloomberg, disaster may have been averted on the previous flight only due to the presence of a third, off-duty pilot in the cockpit, a captain at Lion Air’s sister carrier, Batik Air, who knew how to solve the flight control problems.The final report into the Lion Air crash could be released by July, Indonesian investigators said. The cause has not been determined, but the preliminary report highlighted Boeing’s MCAS system, faulty sensors, and the airline’s maintenance and training.

3666,"A meteor explosion over the Bering Sea late last year unleashed 10 times as much energy as the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, scientists have revealed.The fireball tore across the sky off Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula on 18 December and released energy equivalent to 173 kilotons of TNT. It was the largest air blast since another meteor hurtled into the atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, in Russia’s south-west, six years ago, and the second largest in the past 30 years.Unlike the Chelyabinsk meteor, which was captured on CCTV, mobile phones and car dashboard cameras, the December arrival from outer space went largely unnoticed at the time because it exploded in such a remote location.Nasa received information about the blast from the US air force after military satellites detected visible and infrared light from the fireball in December. Lindley Johnson, a planetary defence officer at Nasa, told BBC News that blasts of this size were expected only two or three times a century.The space agency’s analysis shows that the meteor, probably a few metres wide, barrelled into Earth’s atmosphere at 72,000mph and exploded at an altitude of 16 miles. The blast released about 40% of the energy of the meteor explosion over Chelyabinsk, according to Kelly Fast, Nasa’s near-Earth objects observations programme manager, who spoke at the 50th Lunar and Planetary Science conference near Houston.Since the event came to light, meteor researchers have been asking airlines for any sightings of the fireball, which came in close to routes used by commercial carriers flying between North America and Asia.Peter Brown, a meteor specialist at Western University in Canada, spotted the blast independently in measurements made by global monitoring stations. The explosion left its mark in data recorded by a network of sensors that detect infrasound, which has a frequency too low for the human ear to pick up. The network was set up to detect covert nuclear bomb tests.The Bering Sea event is another reminder that despite efforts to identify and track space rocks that could pose a threat to Earth, sizeable meteors can still arrive without warning. Nasa is working to identify 90% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 140 metres by 2020, but the task could take another 30 years to complete.The 20m-wide meteor that detonated over Chelyabinsk lit up the morning sky on 15 February 2013. At its most intense, the fireball burned 30 times brighter than the sun. The flash quickly gave way to a shockwave that knocked people off their feet and shattered windows in thousands of apartments.

3683,"A young whale that washed up in the Philippines died from “gastric shock” after ingesting 40kg of plastic bags.Marine biologists and volunteers from the D’Bone Collector Museum in Davao City, in the Philippine island of Mindanao, were shocked to discover the brutal cause of death for the young Cuvier’s beaked whale, which washed ashore on Saturday.In a damning statement on their Facebook page, the museum said they uncovered “40 kilos of plastic bags, including 16 rice sacks. 4 banana plantation style bags and multiple shopping bags” in the whale’s stomach after conducting an autopsy.Images from the autopsy showed endless piles of rubbish being extracted from the inside of the animal, which was said to have died from “gastric shock” after ingesting all the plastic.The D’ Bone Collector Museum biologists who conducted the autopsy said it was “the most plastic we have ever seen in a whale”.“It’s disgusting,” they added. “Action must be taken by the government against those who continue to treat the waterways and ocean as dumpsters.”The use of single-use plastic is rampant in south-east Asia. A 2017 report by Ocean Conservancy stated that China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam have been dumping more plastic into the ocean than the rest of the world combined.Marine biologist Darrell Blatchley, who also owns the D’Bone Collector Museum, said that in the 10 years they have examined dead whales and dolphins, 57 of them were found to have died due to accumulated rubbish and plastic in their stomachs.In June last year, a whale died in southern Thailand after swallowing more than 80 plastic bags, which weighed up to 8kg (18lb) in the creature’s stomach, and marine biologists estimate around300 marine animals including pilot whales, sea turtles and dolphins, perished each year in Thai waters after ingesting plastic.",Dead whale washed up in Philippines had 40kg of plastic bags in its stomach,2019-03-18/05:27:39+0000,a young whale that washed up in the philippines died from gastric shock after ingesting kg of plastic bags marine biologists and volunteers from the d bone collector museum in davao city in the philippine island of mindanao were shocked to discover the brutal cause of death for the young cuvier s beaked whale which washed ashore on saturday in a damning statement on their facebook page the museum said they uncovered  kilos of plastic bags including  rice sacks  banana plantation style bags and multiple shopping bags in the whale s stomach after conducting an autopsy images from the autopsy showed endless piles of rubbish being extracted from the inside of the animal which was said to have died from gastric shock after ingesting all the plastic the d bone collector museum biologists who conducted the autopsy said it was the most plastic we have ever seen in a whale it s disgusting they added action must be taken by the government against those who continue to treat the waterways and ocean as dumpsters the use of single use plastic is rampant in south east asia a  report by ocean conservancy stated that china indonesia the philippines thailand and vietnam have been dumping more plastic into the ocean than the rest of the world combined marine biologist darrell blatchley who also owns the d bone collector museum said that in the  years they have examined dead whales and dolphins  of them were found to have died due to accumulated rubbish and plastic in their stomachs in june last year a whale died in southern thailand after swallowing more than  plastic bags which weighed up to kg lb in the creature s stomach and marine biologists estimate around marine animals including pilot whales sea turtles and dolphins perished each year in thai waters after ingesting plastic ,Boeing Crisis,0.14734314382076263
3731,"Within three minutes of takeoff, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 had accelerated to unusually high speeds. Captain Yared Getachew knew something was wrong as the aircraft, a Boeing 737 Max 8, erratically dipped and climbed by hundreds of feet. He radioed air traffic control, requesting a return to Addis Ababa airport.He was cleared to return and the aircraft began to turn right, climbing even higher. A minute later, flight 302 disappeared from the radar.All 157 people on board were killed as the plane crashed 30 miles south-east of the airport, approximately six minutes into its two-hour flight to Nairobi. It was the second fatal accident involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in five months, following the crash last October of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia with the loss of 189 lives.Suspicion over the cause of both crashes is centred on the plane’s new flight control system – MCAS, or Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System – which can intervene to push the plane’s nose down automatically when it rises.On Wednesday, Boeing said it was suspending operations of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft, after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a temporary ban on the model. Dozens of countries had already imposed bans earlier in the week. The fleet will be grounded until Boeing installs a software update for the jet’s flight systems, which could happen before the end of the month, according to one report last week. As Boeing scrambles to fix one of its most significant products, there are questions now over the impact on the world’s most renowned aerospace group. The crashes are devastating for Boeing because the 737 has been a staple of its roster for more than 50 years. It is the company’s bestseller and a short-haul workhorse. The new version, the Max, is more fuel-efficient than previous models and has clocked up $600bn (£450bn) worth of orders. “It’s a very important aircraft to Boeing, with 5,000 orders placed,” said John Strickland, an aviation analyst.It’s likely to be a tough few months for the Chicago-based manufacturer, with regulatory issues, legal claims and the threat of cancelled orders piling up. Last Sunday’s crash hit shares hard as soon as markets opened on Monday, and wiped $25bn from its value over the course of last week.Boeing now faces a struggle to maintain that huge order book: several big customers have threatened to cancel in the wake of the crash. VietJet, which doubled its order to about $25bn last month, said it would decide on its plans once the cause of the tragedy had been found. Others putting the squeeze on Boeing are Utair of Russia and Kenya Airways, which could switch to Airbus’s short-haul rival, the A320. Lion Air is also said to be reviewing a $22bn order for the 737.A source said: “The commercial reality is that Boeing will be offering all sorts of incentives to customers in order to persuade them to stay. If I know Boeing, it will be in company meltdown trying to sort this out. You can see what it’s doing to the share price and to passenger confidence in the 737 Max. This is tough stuff.” But crucially, its three big US customers – American, Southwest and United – are standing behind the Max.Despite the scale of the reputational and commercial crisis facing the company, many experts believe Boeing will recover, because technical problems – albeit none as fatal as the one apparently facing the 737 Max – have been overcome before. The FAA grounded the company’s 787 Dreamliner in 2013 because of a problem with its batteries catching fire, which was subsequently fixed. “That didn’t have any long-term impact on customer confidence and it has become a very successful aircraft,” Strickland noted.Regulators around the world grounded the 737 Max after concluding there were too many similarities between the Addis Ababa disaster and the crash of Lion Air flight 610. That also plummeted from the skies shortly after takeoff: a preliminary investigation shows the pilots struggled to get control of the plane after the nose was forced down by the flight control system.The seeds of Boeing’s misery were sown back in the winter of 2010. Airbus, its big European rival, caught it off guard with the news that it was relaunching its short-haul workhorse with new engines as the A320neo.Airlines had pressured the two manufacturers for a more fuel-efficient plane following a jump in the cost of oil in 2008, when a price of $147 per barrel forced dozens of carriers into bankruptcy.The A320neo forced Boeing to retaliate by creating a revamped 737 – one with engines that could deliver the fuel-efficiency now demanded by their customers.The 737 Max would do that, but not without some engineering witchcraft to help fit its big new engines under the wings. The American manufacturer had to extend the nose landing gear, add aerodynamic winglets and push the technology to make it more efficient and cheaper to operate.The engines may have solved one problem, but they created another. Testing showed that in certain conditions the plane was prone to entering a nose-up aerodynamic stall – where the aircraft cannot create enough lift from the airflow over its wings.Boeing attempted to fix the issue by installing the MCAS, which would stabilise the aircraft by bringing the nose down. This system is now at the centre of the investigation into the Lion Air crash and appears to be implicated in the Ethiopian Airlines disaster.In December, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive to all owners of the 737 Max. It warned of an issue where the automated anti-stall system would engage if “an erroneously high single AOA [angle of attack] sensor input is received by the flight control system”. The system would then automatically attempt repeated nose-down commands. “This condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain,” it said.Automation has increased in order to eradicate human error, which has traditionally been the biggest cause of air accidents. David Gleave, a safety expert, said: “Very few airplanes fall out of the sky because the wings fall off. Most of the time it’s related to human error. Automation can go too far, but this is an extra security system that was brought in to cure something and has caused a problem elsewhere … There’s a history of problems with the introduction of new technology. But people are not going to stop flying in 737s because of this.”Boeing’s executives will be pleading with customers and investors for patience. But they need to come up with a fix, and soon.","After two deadly disasters in five months, can Boeing survive?",2019-03-16/16:00:07+0000,within three minutes of takeoff ethiopian airlines flight  had

3732,"The history of aircraft development is marked by technological breakthroughs – from more fuel-efficient engines to the use of carbon-fibre materials – that have spurred the creation of better, safer aircraft. However, fatal accidents have also forced design changes that have improved subsequent aircraft and prevented further loss of life. Here are some examples.10 January 1954A De Havilland Comet operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation crashed after suffering a catastrophic decompression in mid-flight. The Comet fell into the sea near Elba, off the Italian coast: all 35 people on board died.It was the second in a series of three Comet accidents in less than a year, all from similar causes. Investigators found that structural cracking had started in the roof of the cabin: a window had become detached and struck control structures at the back of the aircraft, and the rear fuselage had then torn away.The cause was metal fatigue, arising from the constant pressurisation and depressurisation of the aircraft’s fuselage during everyday use. Also, supports around the windows had been riveted, not glued, in a process which is thought to have caused cracks.The fuselage was also experiencing considerably higher stresses than had been anticipated, particularly around the sharp corners of the Comet’s square windows. As a result, future jetliners would feature windows with rounded corners.2 August 1985The Lockheed TriStar operated by US carrier Delta encountered a thunderstorm while approaching Dallas-Fort Worth to land. The aircraft struck the ground far short of the runway and disintegrated, killing 137 people and injuring 28 others. Investigators found that the crash had resulted from the flight crew’s decision to fly through a thunderstorm; the lack of procedures or training to cope with “microbursts” (small but intense downdraughts that occur in storms); and the lack of advance warning on the sharp changes in wind speed or direction known as wind shear.After the investigation, an onboard weather radar was developed by Nasa. The resultant airborne detection and alert system was installed on many airliners after the US regulator insisted all commercial aircraft must have onboard means of detecting wind shear.22 August 1985A Boeing 737 caught fire before takeoff at Manchester airport, with the loss of 55 lives. It was on its way to Corfu, in Greece. Before takeoff, one of the engines failed, causing the fire, and the captain instructed the crew to evacuate the plane. There were 82 survivors: most of the deaths were caused by smoke inhalation.The accident brought about industry-wide action on plane design, including changes to the seating layout near exits; fire-resistant seat covers; floor-level emergency lighting; fire-resistant wall and ceiling panels; increased numbers of extinguishers; and clearer rules on evacuation procedures.31 August 1986Two planes collided in mid-air over the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos. The tail of Aeroméxico flight 498, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, was hit by a small private plane – a Piper PA-28-181 Archer – while descending towards Los Angeles International Airport. All 67 people on both aircraft were killed, as well as an additional 15 on the ground.After that, all jets in US airspace were required to carry air avoidance collision systems. Another mid-air crash near New Delhi in 1996 – between a Boeing 747 and a Soviet-designed Ilyushin Il-76 – killed 349 people: that triggered the implementation of crash avoidance systems around the world.8 September 1994A Boeing 737 flying from Chicago crashed while approaching Pittsburgh International Airport. Investigators said the probable cause was that the aircraft’s rudder had malfunctioned and turned hard in the direction opposite to that commanded by the pilot, causing a loss of control from which the flight crew could not recover. All 132 people on board were killed.Boeing subsequently agreed to design and pay for a new rudder control system for the entire worldwide 737 fleet.1 June 2009The crash of AF 447 raised concerns about the level of automation in aircraft, and those fears have been exacerbated by the 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The Airbus A330, operated by Air France and on its way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, stalled and did not recover, crashing into the Atlantic with the loss of all 228 passengers and crew.The initial investigation concluded that the aircraft crashed after the airspeed sensors iced over, causing the autopilot to disconnect in the middle of stormy weather. This sparked an unexpected handover of control to the pilots, one of whom was not used to hand-flying at altitude and who reacted incorrectly by pulling the nose of the aircraft upwards.The pilot errors ultimately caused the aircraft to enter an aerodynamic stall – where the plane’s weight is no longer supported by the air flowing under the wings – and drop from the sky catastrophically at 11,000 feet per minute.Following the disaster, regulators urged airlines to encourage more hand-flying to prevent the erosion of basic piloting skills.",Midair collisions to metal fatigue: tragedies

3753,"Air crash investigators have begun analysing the black box data recorder from Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, amid reports that the plane wreckage suggested similarities with a previous disaster involving the Boeing 737 Max jet.Accounts have also emerged of communications between the plane and air traffic control, in which the pilot is said to have asked in panicked tones to turn back three minutes into the flight, as the 737 Max dipped and climbed.The black box recorder, which arrived in Paris showing some external damage, is being reviewed by French aviation experts at the request of Ethiopian Airlines. French authorities have said it was unclear what data could be retrieved to shed light on Sunday’s crash, which killed 157 people outside Addis Ababa.It is likely to be several days before any interim findings are released, according to Ethiopian Airlines chief executive Tewolde Gebremariam.Evidence gathered by investigators at the scene of the crash, according to two sources cited by Reuters, includes a piece of the plane’s stabiliser, which was set in an unusual position – potentially suggesting similarities with the Lion Air crash off Jakarta in October. Gebremariam said there was a “clear similarity between our crash and the Lion Air crash.”Inquiries in Indonesia have focused on how an automated system used the stabiliser to pitch the nose down, against the pilots’ commands. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing declined to comment on the claims.The captain of Ethiopian flight 302, Yared Getachew, reported a “flight control” problem in a calm voice, before then asking to return in panicked tones three minutes after takeoff, according to the New York Times. The newspaper, citing a source who had reviewed the communications from flight 302, said the pilot told controllers: “Break break, request back to home.”The 737 Max jet initially dipped below the safe flight path, and then, after climbing, flew at erratic height and speed. Controllers noticed the plane was moving up and down by hundreds of feet.When grounding the 737 Max model on Wednesday, the FAA said new data from satellite-based tracking showed similarities between the planes’ erratic movements in both crashes. Boeing has reiterated its “full confidence” in the safety of the plane, although its engineers are making changes to the software in question in the Lion Air crash.Ethiopian Airlines said its pilots had been trained on procedures to deal with the 737 Max’s anti-stall system, which was the subject of an emergency notification by regulators after the Lion Air crash. Pilots in the US have expressed fury that Boeing had not already highlighted system changes that could affect the plane’s behaviour.Delivery of the new plane, with almost 5,000 models still on order, has been paused, although Boeing is continuing production. Russian carrier Aeroflot said on Friday it may cancel its order for 20 planes. Air Canada, which planned to expand from 24 to 36 737 Max planes in its fleet this year, told investors it was suspending its financial forecasts without the more fuel-efficient jets.In Ethiopia, officials have started taking DNA samples from families of the victims to assist in identifying remains. The 157 people who died came from 35 countries, including nine from the UK. At the crash site in Hejere, about 30 miles from Addis Ababa, search teams continued to pick through the debris, with the plane’s wreckage covered by blue plastic sheeting.Relatives were still waiting for news on when identification of remains would begin, and subsequent repatriation. Faysal Hussein, an Ethiopian citizen whose cousin was killed, told the Associated Press: “We are not told what they have found so far. We were taken to the crash site on Wednesday but not allowed to get a closer look.”Pauline Gathu, a Kenyan who lost her brother, said: “We were expecting that we will have our body well-kept but we are amazed to hear that there is nothing, totally nothing … We don’t have words, we don’t know what to do.”",Ethiopian air crash investigators begin black box analysis,2019-03-15/17:59:20+0000,air crash investigators have begun analysing the black box data recorder from ethiopian airlines flight  amid reports that the plane wreckage suggested similarities with a previous disaster involving the boeing  max jet accounts have also emerged of communications between the plane and air traffic control in which the pilot is said to have asked in panicked tones to turn back three minutes into the flight as the  max dipped and climbed the black box recorder which arrived in paris showing some external damage is being reviewed by french aviation experts at the request of ethiopian airlines french authorities have said it was unclear what data could be retrieved to shed light on sunday s crash which killed  people outside addis ababa it is likely to be several days before any interim findings are released according to ethiopian airlines chief executive tewolde gebremariam evidence gathered by investigators at the scene of the crash according to two sources cited by  includes a piece of the plane s stabiliser which was set in an unusual position potentially suggesting similarities with the lion air crash off jakarta in october gebremariam said there was a clear similarity between our crash and the lion air crash inquiries in indonesia have focused on how an automated system used the stabiliser to pitch the nose down against the pilots commands the us federal aviation administration faa and boeing declined to comment on the claims the captain of ethiopian flight  yared getachew reported a flight control problem in a calm voice before then asking to return in panicked tones three minutes after takeoff according to the new york times the newspaper citing a source who had reviewed the communications from flight  said the pilot told controllers break break request back to home the  max jet initially dipped below the safe flight path and then after climbing flew at erratic height and speed controllers noticed the plane was moving up and down by hundreds of feet when grounding the  max model on wednesday the faa said new data from satellite based tracking showed similarities between the planes erratic movements in both crashes boeing has reiterated its full confidence in the safety of the plane although its engineers are making changes to the software in question in the lion air crash ethiopian airlines said its pilots had been trained on procedures to deal with the  max s anti stall system which was the subject of an emergency notification by regulators after the lion air crash pilots in the us have expressed fury that boeing had not already highlighted system changes that could affect the plane s behaviour delivery of the new plane with almost   models still on order has been paused although boeing is continuing production russian carrier aeroflot said on friday it may cancel its order for  planes air canada which planned to expand from  to   max planes in its fleet this year told investors it was suspending its financial forecasts without the more fuel efficient jets in ethiopia officials have started taking dna samples from families of the victims to assist in identifying remains the  people who died came from  countries including nine from the uk at the crash site in hejere about  miles from addis ababa search teams continued to pick through the debris with the plane s wreckage covered by blue plastic sheeting relatives were still waiting for news on when identification of remains would begin and subsequent repatriation faysal hussein an ethiopian citizen whose cousin was killed told the associated press we are not told what they have found so far we were taken to the crash site on wednesday but not allowed to get a closer look pauline gathu a kenyan who lost her brother said we were expecting that we will have our body well kept but we are amazed to hear that there is nothing totally nothing we don t have words we don t know what to do ,Boeing Crisis,0.4154684841632843

I’ve found it very difficult to sleep since.”Five days after the Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 Max 8 jet crashed within minutes of takeoff from Addis Ababa, the Greek chemical engineer says he feels he has a moral obligation to uncover why the plane went down, killing all 157 people onboard.“As the guy who was saved just by luck I want to say something very clear,” he says. “The souls of these people, the people who I saw and all those who died, can never be relieved unless there are concrete answers and the truth is uncovered.”The latest news alluding to design faults had especially unsettled him. “I have been reading a lot of reports about potential problematic designs, that the pilot asked soon after takeoff to go back, and to be honest it has freaked me out. I fly between 100 and 120 times a year. I very much hope this is not a case of criminal ignorance or of design issues being intentionally hidden,” he tells the Guardian during a phone interview from Beirut where he works much of the time as the head of an Athens-based waste management company.The 53-year old, who also presides over the International Solid Waste Association, an NGO headquartered in Vienna, was on his way to Nairobi via Addis Abada last weekend to attend the UN environment assembly.

3807,"Boeing’s 737 Max 8 and 9 planes will remain grounded for weeks at a minimum, US politicians said on Thursday, as flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane arrived in France.After a briefing with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), congressman Rick Larsen said the planes, which have been involved in two fatal crashes in the last five months, would be banned from flying “at least through April” while new software is installed and investigations continue.Investigators will begin analysing flight recorders from the Ethiopian Airlines plane wreckage on Friday, in an attempt to establish what caused the crash that has grounded Boeing’s 737 Max fleet worldwide.In a photo of the data recorder released by France’s bureau of civil aviation safety (BEA) the central part of the recorder appears intact, though the edge appears somewhat mangled. A BEA spokesman said it was unclear whether the data was retrievable.There is mounting anger in Ethiopia over the handling of the crash. In Addis Ababa, about 200 family members of crash victims left a briefing with Ethiopian Airlines officials, saying the carrier has not given them adequate information.Officials said they had opened a call-in centre that is open 18 hours a day to respond to questions, but relatives said they were not getting the answers they needed.Relatives arrived at the crash scene in Hejere, about 31 miles (50km) from Addis Ababa, some wailing or beating their chests as a bulldozer navigated piles of debris. Blue plastic sheeting covered the wreckage of the plane.The crash on Sunday, in which 157 people were killed minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa, was the second such calamity involving Boeing’s 737 Max in less than six months. A Lion Air jet crashed in Indonesia in October, also shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board.Citing newly refined satellite data and evidence from the scene of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the FAA has suggested the possibility of a shared cause for the two crashes. After assessing that data, “it became clear to all parties that the track of the Ethiopian flight was very close and behaved very similarly to the Lion Air flight”, FAA administrator Daniel Elwell told reporters.But aviation experts cautioned that it was still too early to draw conclusions. “To my mind people are drawing optical conclusions at the moment,” said Robert Mann, aviation consultant and former airline executive. “We need to wait for the hard data from these readers.”One central question investigators will address is whether software known as MCAS used by the 737 Max to prevent stalling was central to the accident. Lion Air officials have said sensors on their crashed plane produced erroneous information on its last four flights, triggering an automatic nose-down command that the pilots were unable to overcome on its final flight.Ethiopian Airlines’ chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, said its pilots had received special training on how to deal with that problem. “In addition to the basic trainings given for 737 aircraft types, an additional training was given for the Max version,” Tewolde said. “After the Lion Air crash, questions were raised, so Boeing sent further instructions that it said pilots should know.”The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air.

The US president told reporters: “They [Boeing] have to find the problem … and they will find it.”A software fix for the 737 Max that Boeing has been working on since the Lion Air crash will take months to complete, the FAA said on Wednesday.

3816,"Donald Trump grounded Boeing’s 737 Max fleet on Wednesday, days after the second fatal crash involving the plane in five months led to governments around the world – but initially not the US – suspending their use of the plane. Boeing then decided to pull its entire fleet of 737 Maxes worldwide. What do we know about the crisis so far?There are fears the 737 Max model contains a potentially fatal safety flaw after it was involved in two crashes in the last five months that killed 346 people. On Sunday 10 March an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 model of the 737 aircraft was involved in a crash near Addis Ababa that killed all 157 people on board. In October a Max 8, operated by Lion Air, crashed into the sea near Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. On Wednesday 13 March, Boeing said it would suspend its entire global fleet of all 371 models of the aircraft currently in operation, after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a temporary ban on the model. Dozens of countries had already imposed bans earlier in the week.Announcing the bans, both the American and Canadian regulators cited new evidence to suggest a link between the two fatal crashes. Both crashes are still under investigation but preliminary satellite tracking data suggests they were caused by a faulty automated system designed to prevent the plane from stalling, known as MCAS.Marc Garneau, Canada’s transport minister, said the new data revealed “vertical variations” in the Ethiopian Airlines flight similar to those seen before the crash of the Lion Air flight.We still don’t know, but the data suggests it may have been activated on both flights. Experts speculate that malfunctioning sensor readings pushed the nose of the Lion Air flight downward. The pilots appeared to be struggling with the system as their repeated attempts to right the jet by pulling the nose up again appeared to be overridden by MCAS. The limited data so far available about the Ethiopian Airlines flight suggested a similar pattern of variations of altitude in 15 to 20 second bursts.The black box recorder has been recovered from the wreckage, which should reveal technical flight data as well as the cockpit voice recordings. Until that evidence is analysed and released, the only available data has come from tracking websites such as Flightradar24.Flight ET302 took off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, at 8.38am local time (5.38am GMT) and crashed approximately six minutes later, on its way to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in rural land near the town of Bishoftu.According to the airline, the captain of the plane had reported difficulties and requested permission to turn back.Flight radar data shows that the aircraft was climbing erratically, with an unstable “vertical airspeed”, or height.Conflicting witness reports from locals on the ground have been given to TV crews. One man told the BBC that the plane had dropped straight from the sky, with no visible flames before impact; another told CNN that he had seen smoke coming from the back of the aircraft before it crashed.The undisputed similarity is that both planes that were the same model of Boeing 737: a new iteration, the Max 8, that first flew in 2017 and had only been in service a matter of months for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines; and in both cases, the pilots reported difficulties immediately after takeoff.While the investigation is still continuing into the Lion Air crash, the plane showed sharp changes of altitude, which suggested the pilots may have been effectively trying to wrestle against in-flight control systems designed to prevent a stall.The plane has become the fastest selling in history: more than 5,000 orders placed, and more than 350 in service. At its officially listed price ($121m per plane), that amounts to more than $600bn worth of planes sold already and being manufactured, though most airlines will have bought them at a substantial discount.Boeing’s 737 was already the most common plane in the sky, a short-haul workhorse. The latest iteration promised significantly greater fuel efficiency, more seats on a similar-sized plane, and a longer range – a promise that has seen airlines all around the world clamour to buy them. Ryanair alone has signed up for 150.Ethiopian has been regarded as a standard bearer among African airlines, on a continent where aviation safety has lagged behind the rest of the world. Despite Ethiopian Airlines’ mostly good record, a notable exemption was a crash in 2010 off Lebanon that killed 90 people and was ascribed to pilot error by investigators, although the airline disputed the findings.But it has not had great fortune as an early adopter of Boeing planes: an electrical fault saw a 787 Dreamliner catch fire at Heathrow in 2013.Despite initial claims from the US that the plane was safe, dozens of countries suspended operations of the aircraft in and out of their airports, and many airlines have said they are grounding their fleets.The European Union followed the UK, France, Austria, Germany, Ireland and Malaysia have suspended the operation of all 737 Max models in their airspace. Singapore, Australia and New Zealand’s regulators have suspended the operation of 737 Max planes flying into and out of the country. China’s regulator has ordered domestic airlines to suspend 737 Max 8 flights. India, Indonesia, South Korea and Oman have grounded their airlines’ 737 Max 8 jets for inspections.",Why has Boeing pulled its 737 Max fleet – and what took it so

3843,"Toyota is to build a self-driving lunar rover that will enable astronauts to travel on the surface of the moon without space suits, as Japan raises the stakes amid renewed international interest in lunar exploration.The Japanese carmaker and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) hope the vehicle will be included in a mission to the moon between 2029 and 2034, according to Kyodo news agency.The six-wheeled rover, which is still in the conceptual stage, will be powered by a fuel cell and be able to accommodate two people – or four in an emergency – for several weeks at a time, Toyota said, adding it would have a cruising range of more than 6,200 miles (10,000km).“As an engineer, there is no greater joy than being able to participate in such a lunar project by way of Toyota’s car-making,” said Toyota’s executive vice-president, Shigeki Terashi. “I am filled with excitement.”The space agency’s president, Hiroshi Yamakawa, said: “Having Toyota join us in the challenge of international space exploration greatly strengthens our confidence. Manned rovers with pressurised cabins are an element that will play an important role in fully fledged exploration and use of the lunar surface.”Japan is one of several countries investing heavily in making the 239,000-mile journey from Earth to the lunar surface.China recently became the first nation to land an unmanned probe on the far side of the moon, and last month Israel began its maiden mission to the moon with the launch of the privately funded Beresheet spacecraft.

3857,"Jaguar Land Rover has been forced to recall more than 44,000 cars for repairs after UK regulators found some models were emitting more carbon dioxide than previously thought.The Vehicle Certification Agency found 10 models for the Land Rover and Jaguar brands were emitting more greenhouse gases than had been certified initially. JLR then informed the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, which handles recalls, of the findings.Britain’s largest carmaker will have to carry out free repairs on the models.JLR’s cars “may emit excessive levels of CO2 and may not conform with the certified condition”, according to the European commission’s rapid alert system.Recalls of cars to fix safety defects happen fairly often, but full product recalls because of exhaust emissions are rare. It is thought to be the first carbon dioxide-related recall for JLR.It will affect versions of the Land Rover Discovery, Discovery Sport, Range Rover Sport, Velar and Evoque made between 2016 and 2019. Jaguar models affected include the E-Pace, F-Pace, F-Type, XE and XF. Petrol and some diesel models will be part of the recall.The repairs could include software updates as well as physical alterations, and some Range Rover Evoque models will need new tyres, a JLR spokesperson said.Vehicle emissions have come under increased scrutiny in recent years following Volkswagen’s diesel scandal, in which it was found to have installed software to trick emissions tests.At the same time, international agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions has prompted multiple governments to announce plans to ban the sale of new fossil fuel-powered cars, with the UK to do so from 2040.European manufacturers are under pressure to reduce the average emissions of their new cars from 118.5g of CO2 per kilometre to less than 95g by 2021.Neil Barlow, DVSA’s head of vehicle engineering, said: “DVSA’s priority is to protect everyone from unsafe drivers and vehicles. This includes vehicles that are damaging our environment.”JLR’s recall is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s finances, but comes at a challenging time for the carmaker. JLR posted a record quarterly loss in February and announced about 4,500 job cuts the previous month.In a statement, JLR said: “Affected vehicles are being rectified to ensure the correct CO2 performance is dependably achieved. The modifications made to affected vehicles will be made free of charge and every effort will be made to minimise inconvenience to the customer during the short time required for the work to be carried out.”","Jaguar Land Rover recalls 44,000 cars over carbon dioxide levels",2019-03-13/15:05:02+0000,jaguar land rover has been forced to recall more than   cars for repairs after uk regulators found some models were emitting more carbon dioxide than previously thought the vehicle certification agency found  models for the land rover and jaguar brands were emitting more greenhouse gases than had been certified initially jlr then informed the driver and vehicle standards agency which handles recalls of the findings britain s largest carmaker will have to carry out free repairs on the models jlr s cars may emit excessive levels of co and may not conform with the certified condition according to the european commission s rapid alert system recalls of cars to fix safety defects happen fairly often but full product recalls because of exhaust emissions are rare it is thought to be the first carbon dioxide related recall for jlr it will affect versions of the land rover discovery discovery sport range rover sport velar and evoque made between  and  jaguar models affected include the e pace f pace f type xe and xf petrol and some diesel models will be part of the recall the repairs could include software updates as well as physical alterations and some range rover evoque models will need new tyres a jlr spokesperson said vehicle emissions have come under increased scrutiny in recent years following volkswagen s diesel scandal in which it was found to have installed software to trick emissions tests at the same time international agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions has prompted multiple governments to announce plans to ban the sale of new fossil fuel powered cars with the uk to do so from  european manufacturers are under pressure to reduce the average emissions of their new cars from  g of co per kilometre to less than g by  neil barlow dvsa s head of vehicle engineering said dvsa s priority is to protect everyone from unsafe drivers and vehicles this includes vehicles that are damaging our environment jlr s recall is not expected to have a material impact on the company s finances but comes at a challenging time for the carmaker jlr posted a record quarterly loss in february and announced about   job cuts the previous month in a statement jlr said affected vehicles are being rectified to ensure the correct co performance is dependably achieved the modifications made to affected vehicles will be made free of charge and every effort will be made to minimise inconvenience to the customer during the short time required for the work to be carried out ,Boeing Crisis,0.20274172723293304
3863,"The pilot of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 told controllers he was having control problems before the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet crashed, according to an account of cockpit voice recordings from the airline’s chief executive.The pilot did not mention bird strikes or external problems, but requested permission to return to Bole airport in Addis Ababa within minutes of takeoff. The pilot “reported back to air traffic controllers that he was having flight control problems”, but cited no other issues, Tewolde GebreMariam told the Wall Street Journal.The airline is planning to send the plane’s flight data recorder to Europe rather than the US for analysis, he said.Flight 302 was bound for Nairobi when it plunged to the ground shortly after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 people onboard. It was the second crash involving the 737 Max 8 model in less than five months, after the Lion Air disaster off Indonesia, in which 189 people died in October.No evidence has yet linked the crashes, but pilots on both planes reported problems moments after takeoff and asked to make emergency landings.Canada’s transport minister announced on Wednesday that it would bar commercial 737 Max flights from its airspace, leaving the US virtually isolated in allowing the model to fly. Canada lost 18 of its citizens in the Ethiopia crash, the second highest number after Kenya.European regulators have already grounded the 737 Max, along with China, Australia, India and others around the world. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Boeing and US airlines continue to maintain the 737 Max is safe to fly.The decision by Canada, where Air Canada, WestJet and Sunwing Airlines operate 41 of the 737s, will further fuel pressure in the US on regulators to act.In response to public fears expressed about the plane, some travel booking websites such as Kayak are allowing customers to exclude the aircraft types from searches, as nervous passengers seek alternative flights.It has emerged pilots on at least two US flights last year filed safety concerns about the aircraft after its nose tilted down suddenly when they engaged the autopilot.The pilots’ reports were filed in a database compiled by Nasa that does not reveal the airlines or locations.On one flight, the co-pilot said the nose pitched downward and the plane began descending at 1,200 to 1,500ft a minute before the captain disconnected the autopilot.Another pilot complained Boeing had not explained changes to the plane’s automatic functions, describing the flight manual as “inadequate and almost criminally insufficient”.The FAA said it was continuing to review all data from operators and pilots, but the review so far showed “no systematic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft. Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action.”In the US, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines operate the Max 8, and United Airlines flies a slightly larger version, the Max 9. All three carriers vouched for the safety of Max aircraft on Wednesday.US crew unions, however, have called for the planes to be grounded, and politicians at the highest level, including the president, Donald Trump, have aired doubts.Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are........needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!The Republican senator Ted Cruz, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees aviation, said it would be prudent for the US to temporarily ground the aircraft “until the FAA confirms the safety of these aircraft and their passengers”.Boeing said: “We understand that regulatory agencies and customers have made decisions that they believe are most appropriate for their home markets. We’ll continue to engage with them to ensure they have the information needed to have confidence in operating their fleets.”The manufacturer is to face a slew of compensation claims from airlines around the world whose 737 Max fleets have been grounded.Norwegian said it would be pursuing the US manufacturer for costs and lost revenue after being forced to take 18 planes out of service, as the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK and the European Aviation Safety Agency banned the Max 8. Dozens of flights have been cancelled at the airline, which is already in a precarious financial situation. Norwegian told Reuters: “We expect Boeing to take this bill.”The airline, which has been operating low-cost transatlantic flights as well as short-haul using the single-aisle Max 8, has orders that will quadruple its fleet of the planes by 2021. Norwegian’s share price fell 10% this week following the crash.Analysts said the situation would become serious for Norwegian if it persisted into the peak Easter season, when demand would mean there was no spare capacity. Many other airlines have schedules planned around deliveries of the 737 Max, which could be affected by a prolonged grounding. Ryanair expects the first of 135 Max 200s to be delivered in the spring, with more than 50 due in service by summer 2020.Meanwhile, Germany’s Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation said it would not analyse the black box from the Ethiopian Airlines jet.“This is a new type of aircraft with a new black box, with new software.

3872,"Boeing and the US aviation authorities have come under increasing pressure to ground the 737 Max despite repeated reassurances as the European Union and numerous other countries halted flights and Donald Trump weighed in following a second fatal crash involving the plane in less than five months.US regulators, airlines and the manufacturer have become increasingly isolated in maintaining that the plane is safe. On Wednesday, India’s aviation ministry said the planes would be grounded immediately and New Zealand suspended operation of the plane due to the “level of uncertainty” about the cause of the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash. Malaysia also temporarily banned the plane from their airspace, and Fiji Airways became the latest carrier to stop using the aircraft.Norwegian Air said it expected compensation from Boeing for being forced to ground its planes, Reuters reported on Wednesday morning.Daniel K Elwell, the acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, said on Tuesday it “continues to review extensively all available data and aggregate safety performance from operators and pilots of the Boing 737 Max. Thus far, our review shows no systematic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft. Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action.”Boeing, meanwhile, reiterated its support for the 737 Max, saying it had “full confidence” in its safety.However, the global reaction to Sunday’s fatal crash involving an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max is adding pressure on the company and the Federal Aviation Administration to act.At least 27 airlines have grounded the Max and more than half of the 350 aircraft in service have been withdrawn from use.Pilots of at least two US flights have complained that their new Boeing jet pointed its nose down automatically.Trump said on Tuesday that modern planes were “becoming far too complex to fly”.The Association of Professional Flight Attendants called on American Airlines to ground its 737 Max fleet pending further investigation.The EU’s aviation safety agency, EASA, suspended all flights by Boeing’s 737-8 and 737-9 models after the UK, Ireland, Germany, France and other countries made similar moves.Explaining the UK’s decision to ban the planes, a spokesman for the British Civil Aviation Authority said: “As we do not currently have sufficient information from the flight data recorder we have, as a precautionary measure, issued instructions to stop any commercial passenger flights from any operator arriving, departing or overflying UK airspace.”The British pilots’ union, Balpa, welcomed the decision, saying: “Safety must come first.”Boeing said: “We understand that regulatory agencies and customers have made decisions that they believe are most appropriate for their home markets. We’ll continue to engage with them to ensure they have the information needed to have confidence in operating their fleets.”Boeing plans to update the Max’s software and change flight controls and training guidelines.There are five 737 Max aircraft registered and operational in the UK, all belonging to TUI. Norwegian has also grounded all its 18 737 Max 8 planes, registered across Europe, including several which it uses to operate transatlantic flights from Edinburgh and Ireland to the US.Turkish Airlines also operates 737 Max 8 planes. Two of its flights bound for Britain appear to have been forced to turn back to Istanbul in midair, according to FlightRadar24.TUI, the world’s largest travel and tourism company, said it would stop using the 737 Max across all six airlines in its group.Earlier on Tuesday, Australia and Singapore suspended operations of all Boeing 737 Max aircraft in and out of their airports, after Indonesia and China grounded their fleets of the Max 8. Oman and South Korea have also followed suit. Nearly 40% of the in-service fleet of 371 Max jets globally have been grounded, according to the industry publication Flightglobal, including 97 jets in the biggest market, China.In the US, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines operate the Max 8, and United Airlines flies a slightly larger version, the Max 9. All three carriers vouched for the safety of Max aircraft on Wednesday.Two US airline pilots filed voluntary safety reports last year to a database compiled by Nasa, saying an automated system seemed to cause their 737 Max planes to tilt down suddenly.The pilots said that soon after engaging the autopilot on Max 8 planes, the nose tilted down sharply. In both cases, they recovered quickly after disconnecting the autopilot.The problem did not appear related to the automated anti-stall system that is suspected of contributing to a deadly October crash in Indonesia.The voluntary safety reports do not publicly reveal the names of pilots, the airlines or the location of the incidents. It was also unclear whether the accounts led to any actions by the FAA or the pilots’ airlines. The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.In the wake of Boeing’s troubles, Airbus seems set to overtake it as the world's biggest planemaker. As Boeing reported 239 commercial plane deliveries in the first half of the year, a 37% fall, rival Airbus shipped 389 deliveries, up 28% on the same period last year.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.An Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet plunged to the ground shortly after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 people onboard. The same model was involved in the Lion Air crash off Indonesia that killed 189 people in October. No evidence has emerged to link the two incidents, but in both cases pilots reported problems with the plane and requested permission to make an emergency landing before losing contact with ground control.The plane’s black box recorders, containing flight data and cockpit voice recordings, have been recovered and could potentially provide some indication of the causes within days, depending on their condition.The scare has wiped billions of dollars off the market value of the world’s biggest plane-maker.Boeing’s stock fell further on Tuesday as international regulators moved against the 737 Max, and is unlikely to have been boosted by Trump’s intervention on Twitter.The president said manufacturers were “always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain.”He added: “I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!”Following his tweet, Trump met Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, in the first known conversation between them since the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash.Airlines using the Max 8 have been inundated with questions from concerned passengers since Sunday’s crash, many demanding to know which type of aircraft they will be taking – and their right to cancel based on that.“It’s not 100% clear, but if you were at the airport and there were other flights not on a Max, a customer is likely to be accommodated asking to switch to another flight even though it’s not clearly provided for in published rules,” said John Cox, the founder and chief executive of Safety Operating Systems.The Association of Professional Flight Attendants president, Lori Bassani, said the Max should be grounded. “The safety of our crews and passengers is paramount. Our flight attendants will not be forced to fly if they feel unsafe,” she said.On Monday, the FAA noted that external reports were drawing similarities between the crashes in Ethiopia and off Indonesia. It said the Boeing 737 Max 8 was airworthy but that it had demanded design changes to the aircraft by April.The US transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said regulators would not hesitate to act if they found a safety issue. Boeing’s top executive told employees on Monday he was confident in the safety of the 737 Max, its top-selling aircraft. Industry analysts said some disruption was inevitable from airlines grounding their 737 Max 8s, even though most of those who have done so have a small number of the planes in operation compared with their overall fleet size.The aviation consultant John Strickland said cancellations were likely, adding that while there could be more planes on standby in quieter midweek or off-season periods, an ongoing grounding would cause headaches for airlines awaiting deliveries of 737 Max planes from Boeing: “Ryanair, for example, is expecting 50 in the next few months.”Reuters contributed to this

3889,"Why do airlines love the Boeing 737 Max? In a word: money.This is a plane that promised to cut fuel and maintenance bills, fly further and cram in more passengers – manna to airline executives and shareholders.More than 5,000 of the new Max planes have been ordered, mostly the Max 8 iteration, allowing Boeing to maintain the 737’s historic chart-topping sales in the face of competition from the Airbus A320 family’s latest “neo” planes.While both manufacturers have launched more daring ventures with greater fanfare and mixed fortunes – Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and the A380 superjumbo from Airbus – the Max was something else: a plane that didn’t rip up the model, but more or less matched the familiar, shorthaul workhorse. It replicated what airlines had already got, only better, lighter, and cheaper to fuel and maintain.Buyers queued from every continent. In the UK, even the doomed Monarch ordered dozens, though the airline couldn’t quite hang on long enough to reap the forecasted annual savings of up to £3m a plane.At a relatively affordable price, the Max – a single-aisle plane – had a flying range that opened up the possibility of using it on long-haul corridors traditionally the preserve of wide-body jetliners – an opportunity taken by Norwegian to fly new routes across the Atlantic.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard.

The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.In the wake of Boeing’s troubles, Airbus seems set to overtake it as the world's biggest planemaker. As Boeing reported 239 commercial plane deliveries in the first half of the year, a 37% fall, rival Airbus shipped 389 deliveries, up 28% on the same period last year.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.For most, though, the ambition was purely economic. Speculation long surrounded Ryanair’s next move when it grabbed a deal as the launch customer for another Max version, the 200, which it dubbed the “game-changer”. It ruled out long-haul, but added more seats to the cabin. The Irish airline has 130 planes on order, the first 50 due to arrive between May and the summer. Michael O’Leary said the Max would cut his rock-bottom costs another 5%. And passengers could still be promised more comfort, legroom and nicer interiors.The stakes are now highest of course for Boeing, with a Max order book worth a nominal $600bn (£460bn). Airlines will have options elsewhere, but have planned growth and schedules on the delivery of this more fuel-efficient plane. The spectre of jet fuel prices that were twice as high a decade ago still lingers, and Boeing claim the Max runs on 14-20% less than the newest “next generation” 737s available before.Should the 737 Max be grounded for long, conceivably more airlines could struggle and fares could rise.

3902,"An Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday near Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. Here’s what we know about the crash.The black box recorder has been recovered from the wreckage, which should reveal technical flight data as well as the cockpit voice recordings. Until that evidence is analysed and released, the only available data has come from tracking websites such as Flightradar24.Flight ET302 took off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, at 8.38am local time (5.38am GMT) and crashed approximately six minutes later, on its way to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in rural land near the town of Bishoftu.According to the airline, the captain of the plane had reported difficulties and requested permission to turn back.Flight radar data shows that the aircraft was climbing erratically, with an unstable vertical airspeed.Conflicting witness reports from locals on the ground have been given to TV crews. One man told the BBC that the plane had dropped straight from the sky, with no visible flames before impact; another told CNN that he had seen smoke coming from the back of the aircraft before it crashed.The disaster was the second involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in the past four months. In October, a Lion Air plane crashed into the sea off the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, killing all 189 people onboard.The undisputed similarity is that both planes that were the same model of Boeing 737: a new iteration, the Max 8, that first flew in 2017 and had only been in service a matter of months for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines; and in both cases, the pilots reported difficulties immediately after takeoff.While the investigation is still continuing into the Lion Air crash, the plane showed sharp changes of altitude, which suggested the pilots may have been effectively trying to wrestle against in-flight control systems designed to prevent a stall.However, the publicity around that crash and immediate warnings to airlines and pilots from Boeing and aviation regulators, highlighting the software changes in the 737 Max autopilot and reminding pilots of operational procedures, would appear to make it unlikely that crew would be unaware if the same issue arose.The plane has become the fastest selling in history: more than 5,000 orders placed, and more than 350 in service. At its officially listed price ($121m per plane), that amounts to more than $600bn worth of planes sold already and being manufactured, though most airlines will have bought them at a substantial discount.Boeing’s 737 was already the most common plane in the sky, a short-haul workhorse. The latest iteration promised significantly greater fuel efficiency, more seats on a similar-sized plane, and a longer range – a promise that has seen airlines all around the world clamour to buy them.

3916,"A Malaysia-bound plane had to turn back to Saudi Arabia after a passenger realised she had left her baby in the terminal.The pilot, en route to Kuala Lumpur, made the unusual request to return to the airport in Jeddah shortly after takeoff when the passenger told cabin crew she had forgotten her child.A video of the pilot calling into air traffic control reveals the unusual exchange between him and the operators, as he asks for permission to go back to King Abdulaziz airport.“May God be with us. Can we come back?” the pilot asks. The scenario, seemingly a first for the air traffic controllers, leaves the operator confounded and he can be heard conferring with others over the appropriate action.“This flight is requesting to come back,” he tells another colleague. “A passenger forgot her baby in the waiting area, the poor thing.”The pilot can be heard repeating to the air traffic operator: “I told you, a passenger has left her baby in the terminal and she is refusing to continue the flight.”After a brief pause, the flight was given permission to return to the hub. “OK, head back to the gate,” the air traffic controllers said. “This is totally a new one for us.”It is rare for planes to turn around or divert midair for anything other than technical or passenger health reasons.In 2013, an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to New York diverted to Kansas City because of a “very unruly passenger” who refused to stop singing Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You.In New York the following year, a taxiing plane heading to Seoul returned to the gate after the South Korean airline heiress Cho Hyun-ah forced a senior crew member to disembark because she had been served macadamia nuts from a packet instead of a bowl.",Saudi plane turns around after mother forgets baby at airport,2019-03-12/07:59:49+0000,a malaysia bound plane had to turn back to saudi arabia after a passenger realised she had left her baby in the terminal the pilot en route to kuala lumpur made the unusual request to return to the airport in jeddah shortly after takeoff when the passenger told cabin crew she had forgotten her child a video of the pilot calling into air traffic control reveals the unusual exchange between him and the operators as he asks for permission to go back to king abdulaziz airport may god be with us can we come back the pilot asks the scenario seemingly a first for the air traffic controllers leaves the operator confounded and he can be heard conferring with others over the appropriate action this flight is requesting to come back he tells another colleague a passenger forgot her baby in the waiting area the poor thing the pilot can be heard repeating to the air traffic operator i told you a passenger has left her baby in the terminal and she is refusing to continue the flight after a brief pause the flight was given permission to return to the hub ok head back to the gate the air traffic controllers said this is totally a new one for us it is rare for planes to turn around or divert midair for anything other than technical or passenger health reasons in  an american airlines flight from los angeles to new york diverted to kansas city because of a very unruly passenger who refused to stop singing whitney houston s i will always love you in new york the following year a taxiing plane heading to seoul returned to the gate after the south korean airline heiress cho hyun ah forced a senior crew member to disembark because she had been served macadamia nuts from a packet instead of a bowl ,Boeing Crisis,0.31798216700553894
3949,"The aircraft manufacturer Boeing faces further questions over the safety of its 737 Max 8 jets as Ethiopian Airlines joined carriers in China and elsewhere in grounding the planes after their second fatal crash in months.The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder have been recovered from the wreckage of Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302, which crashed on Sunday killing all 157 people onboard.Investigators will hope the black box evidence can explain why the plane crashed six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa en route to Nairobi, ploughing into a field near Tulu Fara village outside the town of Bishoftu, 40 miles (65km) south-east of the Ethiopian capital.Witnesses on the ground have given conflicting accounts of the plane’s final moments. One man who spoke to the BBC said the aircraft fell sharply with no apparent damage prior to impact. However, Malka Galato, a farmer on whose land the plane crashed, told Reuters he saw “papers falling off” and “smoke and sparks coming from the back” as it turned close to the ground.Boeing’s shares fell 13% within minutes of Wall Street opening on Monday morning and ended the day down just over 5%.The US Federal Aviation Administration issued a “continued airworthiness notification” for the Max on Monday evening. However, it later issued a notice to international carriers saying it would mandate forthcoming “design changes” to the aircraft from Boeing by April. More than 300 Boeing 737 Max planes are in operation and more than 5,000 have been ordered worldwide since 2017.The disaster was the second involving the 737 Max 8 in the past five months. In October a Lion Air plane crashed into the sea off the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, killing all 189 people onboard.On Monday the UK Foreign Office said at least nine Britons were among the dead in Ethiopia. Officials had originally put the British death toll at seven, but later learned at least two more dual nationals than previously thought were travelling on their non-UK passports.“Our staff at the British embassy in Addis Ababa are continuing to work with the relevant authorities in Ethiopia to obtain further information. We extend our deepest condolences to all those who have lost loved ones and those affected by this tragic event,” a spokesman said.Aviation experts, Chinese regulators, and concerned passengers highlighted the fact the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes involved models that had been in service for only a short time.Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the US transportation department, told CNN the latest disaster was “highly suspicious” and “rings alarm bells in the aviation industry, because that just doesn’t happen”. She said Boeing should “take the lead” in telling airlines to ground the plane.US carriers that operate the aircraft, including Southwest and American Airlines, attempted to reassure customers worried by the crash.Provisional flight data from the tracking website FlightRadar24 suggested ET302 climbed erratically in the short time it was in the air. The pilot of the plane, as in the Lion Air case, reported difficulties to air traffic controllers quickly after takeoff and requested permission to turn back, Ethiopian Airlines said.The airline, Africa’s largest carrier, announced it would be taking its 737 Max planes out of service. Earlier on Monday, China’s civil aviation administration ordered the country’s airlines to ground the jets “in view of the fact that the two air crashes were newly delivered Boeing 737 [Max] 8 aircraft” and had “certain similarities”.Approximately 60 of the 737 Max planes have been delivered to about a dozen Chinese airlines since the aircraft was released. Indonesia’s aviation authorities said all 737 Max jets would be temporarily grounded. Indonesia’s main carrier, Garuda, as well as Lion Air, operates the new model.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia.

3976,"Aviation authorities have begun investigating how a new Boeing plane with an experienced pilot crashed minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board.The destruction of Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302, which was on its way to Nairobi, is the second calamity involving a Boeing 737 Max 8, a new model that experienced a similar accident in Indonesia in October.The largest number of the victims were Kenyans. At least seven Britons were on the flight, which left Bole airport at 8.38am local time (5.38am GMT).At least 19 people affiliated with the United Nations were among those killed, according to the UN migration agency chief. Many were delegates on their way to the UN environment assembly, which starts in Nairobi on Monday. Eighteen Canadians also died.The pilot said he was experiencing technical problems and asked to return to the airport. The control tower lost contact with the aircraft at 8.44am. Wreckage was later discovered near the town of Bishoftu, 39 miles (62km) south-east of the Ethiopian capital.The flight tracking website Flightradar24 tweeted that the plane had unstable vertical speed after takeoff.The cause of the accident is not yet known. The Ethiopian Airlines chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, said routine maintenance had revealed no problems with the plane, and the captain Yared Getachew had flown more than 8,000 hours with an “excellent flying record”. The airline took delivery of the plane in November.“As I said, it is a brand new airplane with no technical remarks, flown by a senior pilot and there is no cause that we can attribute at this time,” he told reporters.Questions have been raised about the safety of the Boeing 737 Max 8, which has been in commercial operation since 2016. The same model was involved in the Lion Air crash, where a jet plunged into the Java Sea soon after takeoff last year, killing 189 people.More than 300 of these planes are in operation with different airlines. Ethiopian has six more. Asked whether they would be grounded, GebreMariam said no because “we don’t know the cause of the accident”.Several airlines around the world fly the 737 Max 8. On Sunday night reports said China had asked its local airlines to temporarily ground the planes.In a statement, the airline said it would conduct a forensic investigation in conjunction with officials from Boeing, the Ethiopian civil aviation authority, the Ethiopian transport authority other international bodies.The plane was carrying passengers from more than 30 nationalities. According to the airline, Kenya had 32, Canada 18, Ethiopia nine, Italy, China and the US eight each, the UK and France seven each, Egypt six, the Netherlands five, India and Slovakia four each, Sweden and Russia three each and other countries one or two.Sebastiano Tusa, 66, a renowned Italian archaeologist, was among those killed, the Italian government said. He had been flying to Kenya for a project with Unesco.A Slovakian MP, Anton Hrnko, wrote on Facebook that his wife, son and daughter had all been killed in the crash. “It is with deep sorrow that I announce that my dear wife, Blanka, son Martin and daughter Michala, died in the air disaster in Addis Ababa this morning.”Kenyan authorities offered support to families and friends waiting at Nairobi airport. The transport secretary, James Macharia, said they would be transported to an emergency centre at a nearby hotel. “It is a very sensitive emotional matter,” he said. Earlier many people had been waiting at the arrival gate with no information.“We’re just waiting for my mum. We’re just hoping she took a different flight or was delayed. She’s not picking up her phone,” said Wendy Otieno.Robert Mudanta, 46, was waiting for his brother-in-law coming from Canada. “We haven’t seen anyone from the airline or the airport,” he told Reuters more than three hours after the flight was lost. “Nobody has told us anything. We are just standing here hoping for the best.”Four of those on board were travelling on UN passports. . “Early indications are that 19 staff members of UN affiliated organizations perished,” said International Organization for Migration head Antonio Vitorino.“Numerous other staff members from at least five UN and affiliated organizations are understood to have also perished,” he said.Inger Anderson, the incoming head of UN environment, told the Guardian: “We’re devastated by what transpired. Obviously many of our partners and colleagues are deeply impacted. This is a house in mourning but a house that doesn’t yet know all the facts.” The assembly’s organisers have shared details of emergency hotlines with delegates.Several prominent humanitarian workers were among the victims, including International Committee for the Development of Peoples founder Paolo Dieci; three members of Italian humanitarian organisation Africa Tremila, including the president Carlo Spini, his wife, and treasurer Matteo Ravasio; and Save the Children child protection in emergencies adviser Tamirat Mulu Demessie.The Ethiopian prime minister’s office sent condolences via Twitter to the families of those lost in the crash.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said the crash was “devastating”.Under international rules, responsibility for leading the crash investigation lies with Ethiopia but the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will also participate because the plane was designed and built in the United States.Representatives of Boeing and Cincinnati-based engine-maker CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and the French company Safran, will advise the NTSB.The aircraft had shattered into many pieces and was severely burnt, a Reuters reporter at the scene of the crash said. Clothing and personal effects were scattered widely over the field where the plane came down.An eyewitness told AFP the plane came down in flames. “The plane was already on fire when it crashed to the ground. The crash caused a big explosion,” Tegegn Dechasa recounted at the site. “I was near the river near the crash site. Shortly after the crash police and a fire crew from a nearby air force camp came and extinguished the plane’s flames on the ground.”He added: “The plane was in flames in its rear side shortly before the crash. The plane was swerving erratically before the crash.”The cause of the earlier crash involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia is still under investigation. A preliminary report focused on airline maintenance and training, as well as the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor, but did not give a reason for the crash. Since then, the cockpit voice recorder was recovered and a final report is due later this year.State-owned Ethiopian is one of the biggest carriers in Africa by fleet size. It said previously that it expected to carry 10.6 million passengers last year. Its last major crash was in January 2010, when a flight from Beirut went down shortly after takeoff.The airline is in the middle of an expansion, aiming to double its fleet to 120 and become Africa’s biggest airline by 2025. It has tripled its passenger numbers over the past decade. A new terminal recently opened at Bole, tripling the airport’s size.Additional reporting by Lorenzo Tondo",Ethiopian Airlines crash: inquiry to explore how 'excellent' pilot was unable to avert

3986,"The crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi is a tragedy that threatens to leave fresh questions hanging over the aircraft manufacturer Boeing.Few details about the crash are yet available, but according to Ethiopian Airlines the pilot, who was experienced with an excellent flying record, reported difficulties and asked to turn back.Africa’s aviation safety record has never been good, though Ethiopian has been regarded as an exception. Technical experts from Boeing are standing by for an international investigation into a crash that involved passengers from at least 32 countries.The Boeing 737 MAX 8, a brand new plane only registered in November, disappeared from the radar six minutes into the flight. Immediate comparisons have been drawn with Lion Air flight 610, which crashed just over four months ago, killing 189 people. Flight data showed erratic climbs and descents before the plane, also a MAX 8, came down 12 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta.More than 300 Boeing 737-MAX planes are in operation and more than 5,000 have been ordered worldwide since 2017. It is the latest iteration of the 737, the world’s bestselling plane, ever more capable of flying autonomously.Autonomy, however, can bring problems. It is notable that insurers considering driverless cars worry most about the period when highly autonomous vehicles will coexist with human drivers, the uncertain interface between human and artificial intelligence.Pilots worldwide were angered after the Lion Air crash that subtle software modifications to the MAX 8’s autopilot had not been fully communicated. Nor were they made the subject of mandatory pilot retraining.The new plane automatically compensates if it believes its angle puts it at a risk of stalling, a safety feature that worked in a slightly different way to that which 737 pilots were used to. Lion Air’s black box suggested the pilots of flight 610 had been wrestling with this issue.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down.

Past crashes, however, and most famously the AirFrance flight 447 disaster in the south Atlantic, have shown that the sensors on which aircraft computer systems rely can malfunction, and that pilots who have grown to trust the technology can become rapidly bewildered when things go wrong. All too human reactions led to disaster.The aviation industry has boasted that it is safer than ever in recent years, and the International Air Transport Association reported no accidents involving a modern commercial passenger jet over several years this decade. Turboprops and old cargo planes might fail, but the worst disasters were ascribed to deliberate acts - terrorist attacks, pilot suicide, Russian missiles – or, in the case of MH370, left unexplained.Emerging details from Ethiopia may quickly show a specific cause that is completely unrelated to any issues at Lion Air or to the new 737. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Authority, which regulates the company, will hope so.

4118,"On 8 March 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 left Kuala Lumpur for Beijing and never landed.Since then, the most expensive underwater search in history has failed to find it, and authorities are no closer to figuring out why, 40 minutes into what should have been a six hour flight, MH370 diverted and flew towards the southern Indian Ocean with 239 people on board.Theories abound about why the plane disappeared, and where it can be found. Some have changed, some have been discredited, and new theories have emerged, as search after search has failed to end one of aviation’s greatest mysteries.In the immediate, confused aftermath, an early theory suggested MH370 had been taken, not south into the sea, but north into central Asia.This (now-discredited) theory initially had some basis in fact, based on the different ways in which MH370 was tracked.MH370 first “disappeared” when it turned off its transponder, causing it to vanish from civilian flight tracking after 40 minutes of flying. However, investigators could still track it using military radar, which gives a precise, physical location.Through radar, we know MH370 started on a north-east route to Beijing, then turned and flew south-west, and then turned again, heading north-west, up towards India. But then radar coverage cut out.After that, investigators had to use satellite data for the rest of MH370’s journey. Satellite data cannot pinpoint a plane’s position, but places it in a range that forms a circle, with the satellite at the centre. The satellite data showed MH370 was travelling further and further away from the satellite – but it was unknown whether it was moving south towards the sea near Australia (which required another turn), or was moving north and inland into Asia.However, this northern landing idea was debunked by the company that owned the satellite, Inmarsat, and further refuted in 2015 by the discovery of debris off the coast of Africa.In 2015, debris confirmed to be from MH370 washed up on a series of beaches across east Africa.Not only did this confirm the plane was not intact, but modelling of ocean currents concluded that MH370 crashed in the southern Indian Ocean near Western Australia, and ocean currents then transported debris to Africa a year later.MH370 could not have crashed in Africa, investigators said, because the satellite data was consistent only with a journey south-east into the southern Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, authorities and experts speculated that some kind of fire, accident or malfunction broke out on board which caused the plane to divert in search of an emergency landing.Then, the theory goes, the accident caused a “mass hypoxia event” (i.e: a loss of oxygen) which knocked out the crew and passengers before they could land. Once they were unconscious, the plane kept flying on autopilot over the Indian Ocean until it ran out of fuel.The hypoxia theory – which concludes that the pilot, captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was unconscious at the end of the journey – is still the current official theory of the Malaysian government and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB).In 2016, US investigators and the ATSB discovered that the personal flight simulator in Captain Zaharie’s home had been used to draft a route into the southern Indian Ocean, similar to the route believed to be taken that fateful day.But the ATSB immediately denied that this was proof Zaharie diverted the plane on purpose, or as part of a planned murder-suicide.It has never been confirmed whether Zaharie himself plotted the route, or whether someone else did. His family also said he “loved life”, had an unblemished flying record and would never crash the plane deliberately.In the years since, the Malaysian government has continued to refute the “rogue pilot” theory, and re-advance the theory that Zaharie was unconscious and the victim of an accident.In 2017, the ATSB released its most comprehensive report into the mystery. The Australian government body had been searching since 2014, and covered 120,000 sq km.The ATSB’s final report failed to find the plane, but put forward two theories.The first was the same unconscious pilot theory. However, the ATSB provided new evidence. They said the plane entered the water at a “high and increasing rate of descent”, meaning it was free-falling and the pilot was unconscious.The second theory was that a small new area – called the “priority zone” – located just north of their failed search, was probably the final location of MH370.While the ATSB had not actually searched the “priority zone”, they said a re-analysis of evidence meant they were more confident than ever that MH370 lay there – and urged future searchers to explore it.In 2018, the 25,000sq km “priority zone” was searched – to no avail.US company Ocean Infinity searched the area for months on a no-find, no-fee contract with the Malaysian government. Though hopes were initially high, they found nothing. They moved on even further north, then even further – all with no success.The failure of the 2018 search sparked a re-thinking of the accepted wisdom.The “priority zone” was based on the assumption that when MH370 ran out of fuel, Zaharie was unconscious, and the plane sharply fell into the sea. Thus the search area was located very close to where the fuel ran out (which we know via satellite data).But the failure to find MH370 close to the fuel exhaustion point led some to argue the plane did not drop so steeply. A theory, put forward by former pilot Simon Hardy and others, said Zaharie was awake and guided the plane in a long glide or “controlled ditching” once it ran out of fuel.If MH370 glided, it could have travelled up to 200km further than had been assumed – which would explain why no search has been able to find it.On an episode of Australia’s 60 Minutes, former pilots said Zaharie could have purposely depressurised the plane to knock out its passengers and crew, used his own personal air supply to stay conscious, and then re-pressurised the plane so he could have enacted this plan uninterrupted.At an appearance before the Australian senate, a top ATSB official rejected this. Peter Foley said Zaharie, who was “53 and overweight” would have been knocked out if he tried this, and any attempt to knock his crew out would give himself decompression sickness.The plane also could not have been in a “controlled ditching”, he said, because the ATSB data from 2017 already proved the plane was in a “high and increasing rate of descent” in its final moments.At the five-year anniversary of MH370’s disappearance, with a combined 200,000sq km covered without success, there is still no conclusive evidence of where it crashed, and even less evidence about what caused it.The most recent Malaysian government report revealed essentially nothing new. Tabled in 2018, it was initially billed as a “final report”, until its lack of information and outrage from families caused the government to backtrack on this.Also in 2018, a branch of the French police force – the Gendarmerie Air Transport – announced they would launch an investigation into the way the satellite data was collected. The investigation is still ongoing – with no updates as yet.In 2019, the Malaysian transport minister, Anthony Loke, said he was open to re-starting the search if he receives a good offer, and Ocean Infinity, when they reluctantly called off their search in 2018, said they were willing to start again.",MH370: five years of theories about one of aviation's greatest

4143,"Racing at Santa Anita in Los Angeles, one of world racing’s most iconic venues and the host track for this year’s Breeders’ Cup, has been suspended indefinitely after the death of a four-year-old filly during training at the course on Tuesday, the 21st fatality there since 26 December.Training on its dirt track has also been suspended, and the valuable and significant cards for this weekend, including two Grade One events and an important trial for the Kentucky Derby in May, have been cancelled. The halt to activities on the dirt will allow officials to carry out extensive testing to “confirm the soundness of the track”, according to Tim Ritvo, its chief operating officer, who announced the suspension on Wednesday morning.The rate of fatal injuries at Santa Anita, which stages around 125 days’ racing each year, is around twice the level for the same period last year, when there were 10 fatalities. A year earlier only eight horses suffered fatal injuries in the same period. The most high-profile name to be lost during the current spate is Battle Of Midway, who took the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile at Churchill Downs last November.Let’s Light The Way, the most recent casualty, injured her right front leg while training on Tuesday morning and was put down shortly afterwards. She was the ninth horse to die while exercising on the dirt. Seven more have sustained fatal injuries while racing on the dirt track and five have been put down after races on its turf track.Santa Anita said in a statement that Dennis Moore, its track superintendent from 2014 to December 2018, has been retained as a consultant to assist with the investigation of the track’s condition. Moore oversaw the latest significant change to the racing surface in the summer of 2014, when the previous dirt course, a mixture of sand and clay, was replaced with El Segundo sand, a single‑source material.Gloucestershire Police said on Wednesday that anyone attempting to fly an unauthorised drone over Cheltenham racecourse during next week's Festival could face prosecution. Drones have been spotted flying during races at several tracks in recent weeks, apparently being used by punters seeking to gain an advantage when betting in-running. In a statement, Gloucestershire Police said that ""a restricted air space is in operation above the racecourse, and anyone flying an aircraft without the necessary permission will be committing an offence."" A single drone to provide aerial shots for ITV Racing's Festival coverage will be allowed to fly during racing.The one-mile main track at Santa Anita has had a troubled time over the last dozen years. California’s racing industry led the way on the introduction of artificial surfaces in the US in 2007 when Santa Anita installed a Cushion Track circuit, but that was replaced a year later with Pro-Ride after drainage problems with the previous surface.The Breeders’ Cup meeting was staged on Pro-Ride in 2008 and 2009 but the surface proved controversial with local trainers, whose stables largely held dirt-bred horses. The synthetic track encouraged European‑trained horses to enter Breeders’ Cup events on the main track as well as the turf circuit, and runners from Britain, Ireland and France all enjoyed significant successes, including the victory of Raven’s Pass for John Gosden and Frankie Dettori in the 2008 Breeders’ Cup Classic.Wincanton 1.40 Pemberley 2.10 Myplaceatmidnight (nap) 2.40 Len Brennan 3.15 Miranda 3.45 Vis A Vis 4.20 Trevelyn’s Corn 4.55 Fearsome Fred 5.30 Saint De ReveCarlisle 2.20 The Lady Rules 2.50 Chambard (nb) 3.25 Thomas Do 3.55 Christmas In Usa 4.30 Molly Carew 5.05 Rintulla 5.35 Road To RichesSouthwell 3.00 Dolly Dupree 3.35 Rajapur 4.05 Break The Silence 4.40 Dories Delight 5.10 Tellovoi 5.40 SamovarChelmsford City 5.25 Amor Fati 5.55 Enthaar 6.25 Aircraft Carrier 6.55 Pattie 7.25 Frisella 7.55 Laqab 8.25 Lady WolfSince its return to a dirt surface the rate of fatal injuries during races at Santa Anita has jumped from 0.59 per 1,000 starts on the synthetic track in 2010 to a high of 3.13 per 1,000 starts on dirt in 2016.

4240,"Volvo will limit the top speed of its cars to 112mph from 2020 in an attempt to reduce the number of accidents. The cap will prevent drivers from accelerating to the top speeds of up to 155mph many Volvos can reach.The Swedish brand, which was acquired in 2010 by the Chinese firm Zhejiang Geely, has long had a reputation for prioritising road safety and aims to eliminate fatalities where speed is a factor.It said the electronic restriction focused on driver behaviour because mechanical solutions alone could not ensure safety. The limit will apply to all cars made from mid-2020 onwards.Volvo is believed to be the first carmaker to install the cap across its entire range. Police vehicles will be exempt.Similar technology has been installed on several high-performance cars in Germany, but at a much higher speed limit.The general speed limit for motorways in EU member states is 75-80mph (120-130km/h). Germany does not have a general cap for motorways but recommends a speed of up to 80mph.Speeding remained one of the main contributors to road deaths, Volvo said, along with drug and drink intoxication and mobile phone use.Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo’s president and chief executive, said: “While a speed limitation is not a cure-all, it’s worth doing if we can even save one life. We want to start a conversation about whether carmakers have the right or maybe even an obligation to install technology in cars that changes their driver’s behaviour.”Volvo is also exploring how geofencing – a virtual geographic boundary defined by GPS technology – can be used to automatically limit speeds around schools and hospitals.About a quarter of road deaths in the UK and the US in 2017 were caused by speeding, according to the latest available data from the Department for Transport and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration.",Volvo to impose 112mph speed limit on all new cars from 2020,2019-03-04/13:37:09+0000,volvo will limit the top speed of its cars to mph from  in an attempt to reduce the number of accidents the cap will prevent drivers from accelerating to the top speeds of up to mph many volvos can reach the swedish brand which was acquired in  by the chinese firm zhejiang geely has long had a reputation for prioritising road safety and aims to eliminate fatalities where speed is a factor it said the electronic restriction focused on driver behaviour because mechanical solutions alone could not ensure safety the limit will apply to all cars made from mid  onwards volvo is believed to be the first carmaker to install the cap across its entire range police vehicles will be exempt similar technology has been installed on several high performance cars in germany but at a much higher speed limit the general speed limit for motorways in eu member states is  mph  km h germany does not have a general cap for motorways but recommends a speed of up to mph speeding remained one of the main contributors to road deaths volvo said along with drug and drink intoxication and mobile phone use håkan samuelsson volvo s president and chief executive said while a speed limitation is not a cure all it s worth doing if we can even save one life we want to start a conversation about whether carmakers have the right or maybe even an obligation to install technology in cars that changes their driver s behaviour volvo is also exploring how geofencing a virtual geographic boundary defined by gps technology can be used to automatically limit speeds around schools and hospitals about a quarter of road deaths in the uk and the us in  were caused by speeding according to the latest available data from the department for transport and the national highway and traffic safety administration ,Boeing Crisis,0.22542792558670044
4243,"Virgin Atlantic has told female cabin crew they will no longer have to wear makeup in the air.The airline will also provide female crew with trousers as part of their standard uniform, rather than only providing them on request.Virgin said it was a “significant change” in an industry where female crew are often expected to spend considerable effort on their appearance, adding to the costs and unpaid labour for low-paid employees.Although low-cost carriers, such as easyJet and Ryanair, have relatively relaxed rules on crew presentation, most full-service international airlines prescribe what makeup must be bought and worn.Virgin said cabin crew could now work without makeup, but were welcome to follow the palette of lipstick and foundation set out in its guidelines.Mark Anderson, the airline’s executive vice-president of customer, said it had been “listening to the views of our people” and the new guidelines would “provide our team with more choice on how they want to express themselves at work”.The airline has not always been regarded as a champion of gender equality, although its founder, Sir Richard Branson, once wore crew attire and makeup in the air to settle a bet.The move is the latest apparent reorientation among aviation’s less obviously progressive airlines. Last week, Akbar Al Baker, the chief executive of Qatar Airways, which used to fire pregnant cabin crew, launched the International Air Transport Association diversity and inclusion awards to encourage more women into the industry.Baker, who has previously derided cabin crew on rival airlines as “grandmothers” and last year said only a man could do his job, said Qatar would sponsor awards for outstanding women as it “recognises the need for wider diversity in the workplace, not just in our airline but across the industry as a whole”.British Airways, which was recently revealed to have maternity pay policies that resulted in a 90% pay cut for pilots despite recording profits of more than £2bn in 2018, requires female crew to wear makeup, but in 2016 dropped its rule that women could not wear trousers.According to uniform guidelines from 2015, all BA female crew are expected, as a minimum, to wear lipstick and blusher, to “groom and maintain” their eyebrows and conceal “obvious blemishes … wherever possible”.BA has been approached for comment.",Virgin Atlantic drops mandatory makeup for female cabin crew,2019-03-04/11:38:06+0000,virgin atlantic has told female cabin crew they will no longer have to wear makeup in the air the airline will also provide female crew with trousers as part of their standard uniform rather than only providing them on request virgin said it was a significant change in an industry where female crew are often expected to spend considerable effort on their appearance adding to the costs and unpaid labour for low paid employees although low cost carriers such as easyjet and ryanair have relatively relaxed rules on crew presentation most full service international airlines prescribe what makeup must be bought and worn virgin said cabin crew could now work without makeup but were welcome to follow the palette of lipstick and foundation set out in its guidelines mark anderson the airline s executive vice president of customer said it had been listening to the views of our people and the new guidelines would provide our team with more choice on how they want to express themselves at work the airline has not always been regarded as a champion of gender equality although its founder sir richard branson once wore crew attire and makeup in the air to settle a bet the move is the latest apparent reorientation among aviation s less obviously progressive airlines last week akbar al baker the chief executive of qatar airways which used to fire pregnant cabin crew launched the international air transport association diversity and inclusion awards to encourage more women into the industry baker who has previously derided cabin crew on rival airlines as grandmothers and last year said only a man could do his job said qatar would sponsor awards for outstanding women as it recognises the need for wider diversity in the workplace not just in our airline but across the industry as a whole british airways which was recently revealed to have maternity pay policies that resulted in a  pay cut for pilots despite recording profits of more than bn in  requires female crew to wear makeup but in  dropped its rule that women could not wear trousers according to uniform guidelines from  all ba female crew are expected as a minimum to wear lipstick and blusher to groom and maintain their eyebrows and conceal obvious blemishes wherever possible ba has been approached for comment ,Boeing Crisis,0.22117038071155548
4471,"British tourists to Spain could face airport queues of five hours or more after a no-deal Brexit, according to analysis by Which?, and the consumer group suggests travellers should take food, water and even nappies to survive prolonged delays.Alicante airport, which serves Benidorm and other Costa Blanca resorts, is likely to be the worst-affected airport, and Which? said visitors to Tenerife, Lanzarote and Málaga were also facing “life in the slow lane”.It calculated that if airports spent only 90 seconds making extra checks on each UK passport, it would take a single passport lane in an EU airport five hours longer to process a Ryanair flight with 189 UK passengers on board.Alicante is likely to be worst hit because 43% of its arrivals are from the UK. Even in February, the airport processes as many as 10 planes from the UK in a single hour. In total, 2.9 million British passport holders go through the airport each year.Portugal plans special UK lanes at Faro airport in the Algarve and Funchal, the capital of Madeira, to provide fast-track access for British passport holders, irrespective of a Brexit deal or no deal, but Spain has yet to formally reveal its position. Rory Boland, the travel editor of Which?, said: “Airports can be chaotic at the best of times but if additional checks at passport control are implemented in the event of a no-deal, it seems that very long queues are going to be an unwanted side effect.“Until there is a deal or these airports announce simpler arrangements, you should consider what you may need if you have to fly to them, as it is very likely that you’ll be in a queue for several hours. Make sure you have food, water and essentials for kids like nappies to hand.”The Which? analysis of queues and processing time was based on data from the European Tourism Association (ETOA).The official UK government advice in the event of no deal is that British tourists will have no right to use the separate lanes for EU, EEA and Swiss nationals, may be asked to show a return or onward ticket and may face checks to ensure they have sufficient funds for the duration of their visit.Aena, Spain’s biggest airport operator, said it did not envisage chaos at airports this summer because too much was at stake.

4476,"The plane that crashed in the Channel carrying the Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala fell thousands of feet in the space of 20 seconds after making a 180-degree turn, minutes after the pilot requested a descent, air accident investigators have found.The wreckage of the Piper Malibu light aircraft was found on the seabed 30 metres from where final radar readings located it at an altitude of 1,600ft (488 metres), suggesting it dropped almost vertically in its final moments, according to an interim report from the Air Accident Investigations Board.Investigators have not concluded what caused the plane to crash, but the pilot requested a descent four minutes earlier, apparently to avoid cloud and maintain vision. Unconfirmed radar readings indicate the plane may have climbed rapidly before its final descent.The AAIB said its ongoing investigation would focus on trying to understand the radar readings from the last moments of the flight, as well as analysing the possible contribution of bad weather.Investigators have also queried the legal status of the flight and the pilot’s licence to carry Sala. Cardiff City FC said: “We have grave concerns that questions still remain over the validity of the pilot’s licence and rating to undertake such a journey, as identified [by the AAIB report].“We are also concerned to discover that the trip involved an aircraft which did not conform to either UK Civil Aviation Authority or US Federal Aviation Administration requirements for commercial activity and therefore may have been operating unlawfully. We welcome further investigation into the accident.” Sala, 28, died of head and trunk injuries, according to a postmortem examination, when the aircraft crashed at 8.16pm on 21 January on its way from Nantes to Cardiff.The missing pilot, David Ibbotson, 59, has yet to be located. The wreckage of the fuselage – in three pieces, with wings and tailfin missing – was found on the seabed, 68 metres below the surface, off Guernsey in the Channel Islands on 3 February. Sala’s body was recovered and identified three days later.Challenging weather conditions made it too difficult to recover the plane wreckage from the sea, and instead the AAIB obtained evidence from extensive video captured by a remotely operated underwater vehicle.

4522,"Lime e-scooters have been temporarily suspended from two New Zealand cities after a technical glitch caused the front wheel of some scooters to lock, throwing riders onto the pavement.Last week Auckland council gave the company until noon on Friday to present evidence that the scooters were safe, after some riders suffered serious injuries such as broken jaws and collarbones when the scooters malfunctioned.Auckland council chief operating officer Dean Kimpton said Lime had informed him there had been 155 “irregular braking” incidents, 92 of which were in Auckland, and 30 of which resulted in injury.Lime scooters launched in Auckland, the country’s largest city, in October last year, and since then the Accident Compensation Corporation has recorded more than 1,200 injuries from riders around the country, most in Auckland, at a cost of NZ$566,000 to the taxpayer.Kimpton, said the company had failed to reassure the council that the scooters were safe and a temporary suspension had been ordered.“The safety of people using e-scooters and those that share the environment with them is our number one priority,” Kimpton said.“While we appreciate the amenity that e-scooters offer as an innovative transport solution, safety is not negotiable.”Auckland council has commissioned an independent reviewer to assess the safety of Lime scooters, and a report and further decision on the suspension would be made early this week.Following Auckland’s decision to pull the scooters the South Island city of Dunedin immediately followed suit. According to ACC data, 91 people have been injured in Lime scooter accidents there following their roll-out in January.Lime has been contacted for comment, but told the New Zealand Herald that “less than a fraction of a per cent” of all Lime trips in New Zealand had been impacted by the unexpected braking issue, and the company hoped to be back on Auckland and Dunedin streets soon.“We have deployed a firmware update to resolve the wheel locking issue, and have seen a material reduction in the number of incidents reported of this nature in New Zealand since the update rollout, ” Lime’s regional general manager for APAC, Anthony Fleo, told the paper.A similar problem occurred with some of the company’s scooters in Switzerland, forcing them to withdraw the entire fleet earlier this year.",Lime e-scooters temporarily banned in two New Zealand cities,2019-02-25/00:24:27+0000,lime e scooters have been temporarily suspended from two new zealand cities after a technical glitch caused the front wheel of some scooters to lock throwing riders onto the pavement last week auckland council gave the company until noon on friday to present evidence that the scooters were safe after some riders suffered serious injuries such as broken jaws and collarbones when the scooters malfunctioned auckland council chief operating officer dean kimpton said lime had informed him there had been  irregular braking incidents  of which were in auckland and  of which resulted in injury lime scooters launched in auckland the country s largest city in october last year and since then the accident compensation corporation has recorded more than   injuries from riders around the country most in auckland at a cost of nz   to the taxpayer kimpton said the company had failed to reassure the council that the scooters were safe and a temporary suspension had been ordered the safety of people using e scooters and those that share the environment with them is our number one priority kimpton said while we appreciate the amenity that e scooters offer as an innovative transport solution safety is not negotiable auckland council has commissioned an independent reviewer to assess the safety of lime scooters and a report and further decision on the suspension would be made early this week following auckland s decision to pull the scooters the south island city of dunedin immediately followed suit according to acc data  people have been injured in lime scooter accidents there following their roll out in january lime has been contacted for comment but told the new zealand herald that less than a fraction of a per cent of all lime trips in new zealand had been impacted by the unexpected braking issue and the company hoped to be back on auckland and dunedin streets soon we have deployed a firmware update to resolve the wheel locking issue and have seen a material reduction in the number of incidents reported of this nature in new zealand since the update rollout lime s regional general manager for apac anthony fleo told the paper a similar problem occurred with some of the company s scooters in switzerland forcing them to withdraw the entire fleet earlier this year ,Boeing Crisis,0.23413914442062378
4607,"An Israeli spacecraft aboard a SpaceX rocket has launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida, beginning a two-month journey to land on the Moon.If successful, Israel, a state with fewer than 9 million citizens, will join Russia, the US and China as the only countries to have made a controlled landing on the surface of earth’s nearest neighbour.Funded almost entirely by donations, the project is also the first privately backed lunar lander mission.About the size of a washing machine, the 585kg (1,290lb) robotic lander named Beresheet, the Hebrew word for Genesis, took off at 8.45pm on Thursday local time. It was placed on top a Falcon 9 rocket, one of SpaceX’s private fleets run by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.“We thought it’s about time for a change, and we want to get little Israel all the way to the moon,” said Yonatan Winetraub, co-founder of SpaceIL, the nonprofit organisation behind the effort. “We’ll keep analyzing the data, but bottom line is we entered the very exclusive group of countries that have launched a spacecraft to the moon,” said Yigal Harel, head of SpaceIL’s spacecraft program. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, watched the launch from the control centre in Yehud, Israel.“This is a very proud moment,” Netanyahu’s office quoted him as saying. “While this is a great step for Israel, it is a huge step for Israeli technology.”Apollo 11’s Buzz Aldrin congratulated the team on their journey “to my old stomping ground ... the moon”.Crewed lunar trips have taken around three days, but the probe will take a circuitous route.Beresheet was jettisoned into Earth orbit 34 minutes after blasting off and successfully deployed its landing legs. However, it will not use them for some time – the lander will speed in ever-widening elliptical orbits around the Earth until it intercepts the moon’s gravitational pull in several weeks. Its creators have estimated it will land on 11 April after a 4m-mile (6.5m-km) journey.Following an automated touchdown, the four-legged craft will photograph its landing site – a dark spot in a lunar plain called the Sea of Serenity – and measure magnetic fields. It will only be operational for about two days, before shutting down.Its frame houses a time capsule of digital files the size of coins containing the Bible, children’s drawings, Israel’s national anthem and blue and white flag, as well as memories of a Holocaust survivor.Built by SpaceIL in partnership with the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Beresheet cost about £70m, a fraction of the cost of missions led by the Russian, US, and Chinese governments.Morris Kahn, a South African-born Israeli billionaire, is the main backer but the US Republican party and pro-Israel funder Miriam Adelson and her casino-owning husband, Sheldon, also gave $24m.US and European space agencies intend to use an expanding private space industry to send people back to the moon. The administrator of Nasa, Jim Bridenstine, called the Beresheet mission “a historic step for all nations and commercial space as we look to extend our collaborations”.Beresheet was launched alongside two other payloads – a telecommunications satellite for Indonesia and an experimental satellite for the US air force.SpaceX says the rocket will be reused, after the main-stage booster separated and flew back to earth, landing safely on a drone ship in the Atlantic ocean.",Israeli company sends world's first privately funded mission to moon,2019-02-22/04:55:41+0000,an israeli spacecraft aboard a spacex rocket has launched from cape canaveral in florida beginning a two month journey to land on the moon if successful israel a state with fewer than  million citizens will join russia the us and china as the only countries to have made a controlled landing on the surface of earth s nearest neighbour funded almost entirely by donations the project is also the first privately backed lunar lander mission about the size of a washing machine the kg  lb robotic lander named beresheet the hebrew word for genesis took off at  pm on thursday local time it was placed on top a falcon  rocket one of spacex s private fleets run by the billionaire entrepreneur elon musk we thought it s about time for a change and we want to get little israel all the way to the moon said yonatan winetraub co founder of spaceil the nonprofit organisation behind the effort we ll keep analyzing the data but bottom line is we entered the very exclusive group of countries that have launched a spacecraft to the moon said yigal harel head of spaceil s spacecraft program the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu watched the launch from the control centre in yehud israel this is a very proud moment netanyahu s office quoted him as saying while this is a great step for israel it is a huge step for israeli technology apollo  s buzz aldrin congratulated the team on their journey to my old stomping ground the moon crewed lunar trips have taken around three days but the probe will take a circuitous route beresheet was jettisoned into earth orbit  minutes after blasting off and successfully deployed its landing legs however it will not use them for some time the lander will speed in ever widening elliptical orbits around the earth until it intercepts the moon s gravitational pull in several weeks its creators have estimated it will land on  april after a m mile  m km journey following an automated touchdown the four legged craft will photograph its landing site a dark spot in a lunar plain called the sea of serenity and measure magnetic fields it will only be operational for about two days before shutting down its frame houses a time capsule of digital files the size of coins containing the bible children s drawings israel s national anthem and blue and white flag as well as memories of a holocaust survivor built by spaceil in partnership with the state owned israel aerospace industries iai beresheet cost about m a fraction of the cost of missions led by the russian us and chinese governments morris kahn a south african born israeli billionaire is the main backer but the us republican party and pro israel funder miriam adelson and her casino owning husband sheldon also gave m us and european space agencies intend to use an expanding private space industry to send people back to the moon the administrator of nasa jim bridenstine called the beresheet mission a historic step for all nations and commercial space as we look to extend our collaborations beresheet was launched alongside two other payloads a telecommunications satellite for indonesia and an experimental satellite for the us air force spacex says the rocket will be reused after the main stage booster separated and flew back to earth landing safely on a drone ship in the atlantic ocean ,Boeing Crisis,0.21140360832214355
4609,"A Japanese spacecraft has successfully touched down on a speeding asteroid 300 million kilometres from the Earth as it attempts an audacious manoeuvre to collect samples and bring them back for scientists to study.The Hayabusa 2 probe touched down on the asteroid Ryugu at around 11:30pm GMT on Thursday. Data from the probe showed changes in speed and direction, indicating it had reached the asteroid’s surface, according to officials from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).A live webcast of the control room showed dozens of JAXA staff members nervously monitoring data ahead of the touchdown before exploding into applause after receiving a signal from Hayabusa2 that it had landed.“We made a successful touchdown, including firing a bullet” into the Ryugu asteroid, Yuichi Tsuda, Hayabusa 2 project manager, told reporters.“We made the ideal touchdown in the best conditions,” he said.JAXA spokeswoman Chisato Ikuta said the control centre had “received data that shows that the probe is working normally and is healthy.”Scientists are continuing to gather and analyse data from the probe, she said.The probe was due to fire a bullet at the Ryugu asteroid, to stir up surface matter, which it will then collect for analysis back on Earth. The asteroid is thought to contain relatively large amounts of organic matter and water from some 4.6 billion years ago when the solar system was born.The complicated procedure took less time than expected and appeared to go without a hitch, said Hayabusa 2 mission manager Makoto Yoshikawa.“I’m really relieved now. It felt very long until the moment the touchdown happened,” he said.He said the firing of the bullet - the first of three planned in this mission - “will lead to a leap, or new discoveries, in planetary science.”The spacecraft is seeking to gather 10g of the dislodged debris with an instrument named the Sampler Horn that hangs from its underbelly. Whatever material is collected by the spacecraft will be stored onboard until Hayabusa 2 reaches its landing site in Woomera, South Australia, in 2020 after a journey of more than three billion miles.The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency published live updates of the landing on Thursday night, and spirits were high.In footage broadcast from the control room, presenters repeatedly described the smiles on the faces of team members. When Doppler data came through showing “behaviour as expected” after the spacecraft landed, the official Twitter account for the mission reported “cheers went up with a clap!”But there was no rest for the team, with the Hayabusa 2 account tweeting: “A group photograph was taken in the control room. Now everyone is back to work again.”Hayabusa 2 caught up with Ryugu in June last year after a three-and-a-half-year journey to intercept it. Mission controllers at the Japanese space agency had planned to touch down in October, but delayed the attempt after cameras revealed the surface to be far rockier than expected.The asteroid belongs to a family of space rocks that are the most primitive building blocks of the solar system. “This is the material that didn’t get swept up into planets, it got left behind,” said John Bridges, a professor of planetary science at the University of Leicester. “The reason we want to study it is that this is what material was like at year zero.”Similar material falls to Earth as meteorites, but it is battered and burned as it tears through the atmosphere and quickly becomes contaminated when it thumps into the ground. The asteroid material from Hayabusa 2 will show scientists what meteorite material is like before it plunges to Earth.",Japan’s Hayabusa 2 successfully touches down on Ryugu asteroid,2019-02-22/01:07:08+0000,a japanese spacecraft has successfully touched down on a speeding asteroid  million kilometres from the earth as it attempts an audacious manoeuvre to collect samples and bring them back for scientists to study the hayabusa  probe touched down on the asteroid ryugu at around  pm gmt on thursday data from the probe showed changes in speed and direction indicating it had reached the asteroid s surface according to officials from the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa a live webcast of the control room showed dozens of jaxa staff members nervously monitoring data ahead of the touchdown before exploding into applause after receiving a signal from hayabusa that it had landed we made a successful touchdown including firing a bullet into the ryugu asteroid yuichi tsuda hayabusa  project manager told reporters we made the ideal touchdown in the best conditions he said jaxa spokeswoman chisato ikuta said the control centre had received data that shows that the probe is working normally and is healthy scientists are continuing to gather and analyse data from the probe she said the probe was due to fire a bullet at the ryugu asteroid to stir up surface matter which it will then collect for analysis back on earth the asteroid is thought to contain relatively large amounts of organic matter and water from some   billion years ago when the solar system was born the complicated procedure took less time than expected and appeared to go without a hitch said hayabusa  mission manager makoto yoshikawa i m really relieved now it felt very long until the moment the touchdown happened he said he said the firing of the bullet the first of three planned in this mission will lead to a leap or new discoveries in planetary science the spacecraft is seeking to gather g of the dislodged debris with an instrument named the sampler horn that hangs from its underbelly whatever material is collected by the spacecraft will be stored onboard until hayabusa  reaches its landing site in woomera south australia in  after a journey of more than three billion miles the japanese aerospace exploration agency published live updates of the landing on thursday night and spirits were high in footage broadcast from the control room presenters repeatedly described the smiles on the faces of team members when doppler data came through showing behaviour as expected after the spacecraft landed the official twitter account for the mission reported cheers went up with a clap but there was no rest for the team with the hayabusa  account tweeting a group photograph was taken in the control room now everyone is back to work again hayabusa  caught up with ryugu in june last year after a three and a half year journey to intercept it mission controllers at the japanese space agency had planned to touch down in october but delayed the attempt after cameras revealed the surface to be far rockier than expected the asteroid belongs to a family of space rocks that are the most primitive building blocks of the solar system this is the material that didn t get swept up into planets it got left behind said john bridges a professor of planetary science at the university of leicester the reason we want to study it is that this is what material was like at year zero similar material falls to earth as meteorites but it is battered and burned as it tears through the atmosphere and quickly becomes contaminated when it thumps into the ground the asteroid material from hayabusa  will show scientists what meteorite material is like before it plunges to earth ,Boeing Crisis,0.20951290428638458
4668,"A team of Israeli scientists is to launch what will be the first privately funded mission to land on the moon this week, sending a spacecraft to collect data from the lunar surface.Named Beresheet, the Hebrew word for Genesis, the 585kg (1,290lb) robotic lander will blast off from Florida at 01.45 GMT on Friday, propelled by one of Elon Musk’s SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets. Once it touches down, in several weeks, it will measure the magnetic field of the moon to help understand how it formed.Beresheet will also deposit a “time capsule” of digital files the size of coins containing the Bible, children’s drawings, Israel’s national anthem and blue and white flag, as well as memories of a Holocaust survivor.“It’s going to be on the moon forever,” said Yonatan Weintraub, the co-founder of SpaceIL, the non-profit organisation leading the project.While it is not a government-led initiative, the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) corporation joined as a partner. If the mission is successful, Israel will become the fourth country, after Russia, the US and China, to reach the moon.“This is the lowest-budget spacecraft to ever undertake such a mission,” an IAI statement said of the £77m project. “The superpowers who managed to land a spacecraft on the moon have spent hundreds of millions.” It added that although it was a private venture, Beresheet was a “national and historic achievement”.Crewed trips to the moon in the late 1960s and early 70s took around three days, but the probe will take a less direct route. It will first move in ever-growing elliptical orbits around the Earth until it intercepts the moon’s gravitational pull. Its creators have estimated it will land on 11 April.SpaceIL was established in 2011 with the goal of winning the Google Lunar XPrize, which put up a $30m (£23m) reward for a privately funded team to land an automated spacecraft on the moon, “hop” 500 metres and transmit images back to Earth.Although the contest closed without a winner, SpaceIL decided to continue and gather funds elsewhere. Morris Kahn, a South African-born Israeli billionaire, is the main backer but SpaceIL said US Republican party and pro-Israel funder Miriam Adelson and her casino-owning husband, Sheldon, gave $24m.Russia was the first country to make a soft landing, rather than a plummeting crash, on the surface of the moon in 1966. But following the end of the space race in the 1970s, there was no return until China sent a lander in 2013. In January this year, Beijing made history by landing a spacecraft on the far side of the moon.With Mars remaining a distant and challenging prospect, there has been a revival of interest in lunar visits.

4732,"Nearly 400 employees at Flybmi have lost their jobs following the collapse of the regional British airline at the weekend.Flybmi formally appointed the restructuring firm BDO as administrators on Monday after ceasing to trade on Saturday. BDO announced that 376 employees in the UK, Germany, Sweden and Belgium have been made redundant, although some will assist with the administration.The airline’s immediate owner, British Midland Regional, operated 17 regional jet aircraft on routes to 25 European cities but cancelled hundreds of flights at short notice over the weekend, leaving passengers stranded.Thousands of passengers have been left out of pocket after the collapse of the airline, which operated more than 600 flights a week from regional airports including Bristol, Newcastle, Aberdeen and east Midlands.Tony Nygate, BDO business restructuring partner and joint administrator, said: “As joint administrators, we are taking all necessary steps to ensure customers, staff and suppliers are supported through the administration process. Our job is to maximise recoveries and minimise distress for all parties, acting as smoothly and swiftly as possible.“Customers can find information on the flybmi website regarding the steps they need to take to apply for a refund from their payment provider or travel company. We are also working with the company’s employees to provide them with guidance on how to make a claim for monies which may be due to them. In addition, we are contacting suppliers to explain how to apply for monies owed to them.”Administrators will now evaluate Flybmi’s assets, including its former headquarters at Castle Donington, to work out how much it can return to creditors, including suppliers of fuel and food. It is thought to be highly unlikely that people who bought tickets for cancelled flights, who rank as unsecured creditors, will recover any money.Some passengers are able to rebook via partner airlines Lufthansa, Brussels Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Loganair, Air France and Air Dolomiti, which have “shared ticket” flights with Flybmi. Ryanair and easyJet are also offering cheap rescue flights on some routes.The group’s ultimate parent company, Airline Investments, which is owned by brothers Stephen and Peter Bond, is continuing to trade, as is its sister firm, Loganair, which has said it will step in and take over five of Flybmi’s routes from next month.Loganair, which is headquartered in Glasgow and operates routes including around the Scottish Highlands and Islands, said it was in a strong financial position and would be flying from Aberdeen to Bristol, Oslo and Esbjerg, as well as from Newcastle to Brussels and to Stavanger in Norway. It was also “evaluating Flybmi’s wider network”.The collapse of Flybmi threatened the continued operation of flights between Derry, in Northern Ireland, and London’s Stansted airport. Before Flybmi’s collapse the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said the government would continue to subsidise the route, which is seen as economically important for Derry, until 2021.The operator of City of Derry airport said on Monday a number of airlines, including Loganair, had expressed interest in running the route.Flybmi is the latest of a series of European airlines to struggle in recent months. Fellow British regional carrier Flybe was taken over in a cut-price deal led by Virgin Atlantic in January, while low-cost carrier Norwegian launched an emergency £270m fundraising at the end of the month when a possible takeover by British Airways owner International Airlines Group fell through.The airline said its trading and future prospects had been “seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process”.

4802,"Airlines are cracking down on a ticketing loophole that can knock thousands of pounds off the cost of travel – but the fight back is only giving more publicity to the advantages of “hidden city” travel.At its most simplistic, hidden city ticketing is when a passenger purchases a ticket to less popular and thus cheaper destination that happens to be routed through a more popular, and thus pricier hub destination, and gets off there, skipping the last leg of their journey. Anyone can do it, providing you travel only with carry-on luggage.It’s a dodge people have done for years but thanks to renewed publicity – and websites that take the leg work out of finding the best fares – airlines have called in their lawyers.Proof of the industry’s new willingness to act against the long-established practice came in an Berlin court last week where Lufthansa is redoubling its efforts to sue a European business class traveller who used a hidden city ticket to save thousands on a transatlantic flight.According to a court document, an unnamed male passenger booked a return flight from Oslo to Seattle, which had a layover in Frankfurt. He skipped the final, Frankfurt to Oslo return flight, flying to Berlin on a separate ticket.The switch, which sounds innocuous enough, cost Lufthansa around €2,112 (around £1,864 or $2,385), the amount the airline is now seeking to reclaim from the customer. Whether the scheme was illegal or not is up for debate. Lufthansa’s case – was thrown out of a Berlin court in December and is now under appeal. But the airline’s action reveals the industry’s determination to close the loophole.Once a practice offered by knowing travel agents, it’s since been now automated through sites like Skiplagged – to the evident annoyance of airlines who claim they are in effect being deprived both of revenue from travel to the passenger’s intended destination and the ability to sell the seat that’s been skipped.If previous attempts to challenge “hidden city ticketing” in the US are anything to go by, the German carrier may find the benefit of identifying and pursuing passengers who fail to complete their journeys under the terms of their ticket hardly worth the costs.According to airline industry analyst Robert Mann, the issue of hidden city ticketing has always been out there but it was only when websites including the US-based Skiplagged began to commercialize the system that the industry took notice.“Airlines pricing is arcane to say the least, especially when pricing can vary by a factor of 10 for almost the same product, but if a customer chooses to use the ticket or a portion of it that’s inconsistent with the terms of sale, it becomes an issue. If the practice becomes common knowledge, and attempts to use it increase, it goes from being a tiny hole in a big bucket to a huge hole spilling out revenue.”In 2015 the booking firm Orbitz and carriers in the US sued Skiplagged, which at the time was claiming one million visitors a month, citing 22-year-old founder Aktarer Zaman for “unfair competition” and “deceptive behavior”, and alleging that the site promoted “strictly prohibited” travel. The case against Zaman was ultimately thrown out over issues of jurisdiction.Mann believes the Lufthansa’s decision to take action may be one of scale. Gaming the system within the US may cost airlines a few hundred dollars, based on the company’s ability to re-sell the seat that wasn’t used, but with international fares running into the thousands, the stakes for the airlines are significantly raised.“This is a highly competitive industry so when it comes to international ticketing the numbers become big enough not to ignore very quickly,” Mann says.The practice of hidden city ticketing also holds dangers for passengers. An airline may not notice that a ticket holder has not shown up for a part of flight, but if the practice is repeated or obvious, customers may find themselves stranded in the wrong city, find that the return portion of their trip has been voided, or that they’ve been removed from loyalty programs.In some instances, passengers have found themselves met at the gate by airline attorneys and challenged with a demand for additional fees. The law is as yet unclear on these cases.“It’s a calculated risk,” said Mann, “but the numbers are big enough to make it a felony in some cases.”As Lufthansa’s decision to appeal the case makes clear, airlines are now willing to put those dueling positions to test again, this time in a Berlin court.",'Hidden city' travel: why airlines are cracking down on a discount trick,2019-02-17/05:01:30+0000,airlines are cracking down on a ticketing loophole that can knock thousands of pounds off the cost of travel but the fight back is only giving more publicity to the advantages of hidden city travel at its most simplistic hidden city ticketing is when a passenger purchases a ticket to less popular and thus cheaper destination that happens to be routed through a more popular and thus pricier hub destination and gets off there skipping the last leg of their journey anyone can do it providing you travel only with carry on luggage it s a dodge people have done for years but thanks to renewed publicity and websites that take the leg work out of finding the best fares airlines have called in their lawyers proof of the industry s new willingness to act against the long established practice came in an berlin court last week where lufthansa is redoubling its efforts to sue a european business class traveller who used a hidden city ticket to save thousands on a transatlantic flight according to a court document an unnamed male passenger booked a return flight from oslo to seattle which had a layover in frankfurt he skipped the final frankfurt to oslo return flight flying to berlin on a separate ticket the switch which sounds innocuous enough cost lufthansa around   around   or   the amount the airline is now seeking to reclaim from the customer whether the scheme was illegal or not is up for debate lufthansa s case was thrown out of a berlin court in december and is now under appeal but the airline s action reveals the industry s determination to close the loophole once a practice offered by knowing travel agents it s since been now automated through sites like skiplagged to the evident annoyance of airlines who claim they are in effect being deprived both of revenue from travel to the passenger s intended destination and the ability to sell the seat that s been skipped if previous attempts to challenge hidden city ticketing in the us are anything to go by the german carrier may find the benefit of identifying and pursuing passengers who fail to complete their journeys under the terms of their ticket hardly worth the costs according to airline industry analyst robert mann the issue of hidden city ticketing has always been out there but it was only when websites including the us based skiplagged began to commercialize the system that the industry took notice airlines pricing is arcane to say the least especially when pricing can vary by a factor of  for almost the same product but if a customer chooses to use the ticket or a portion of it that s inconsistent with the terms of sale it becomes an issue if the practice becomes common knowledge and attempts to use it increase it goes from being a tiny hole in a big bucket to a huge hole spilling out revenue in  the booking firm orbitz and carriers in the us sued skiplagged which at the time was claiming one million visitors a month citing  year old founder aktarer zaman for unfair competition and deceptive behavior and alleging that the site promoted strictly prohibited travel the case against zaman was ultimately thrown out over issues of jurisdiction mann believes the lufthansa s decision to take action may be one of scale gaming the system within the us may cost airlines a few hundred dollars based on the company s ability to re sell the seat that wasn t used but with international fares running into the thousands the stakes for the airlines are significantly raised this is a highly competitive industry so when it comes to international ticketing the numbers become big enough not to ignore very quickly mann says the practice of hidden city ticketing also holds dangers for passengers an airline may not notice that a ticket holder has not shown up for a part of flight but if the practice is repeated or obvious customers may find themselves stranded in the wrong city find that the return portion of their trip has been voided or that they ve been removed from loyalty programs in some instances passengers have found themselves met at the gate by airline attorneys and challenged with a demand for additional fees the law is as yet unclear on these cases it s a calculated risk said mann but the numbers are big enough to make it a felony in some cases as lufthansa s decision to appeal the case makes clear airlines are now willing to put those dueling positions to test again this time in a berlin court ,Boeing Crisis,0.16645893454551697

The situation for diesel exhausts is similar. Last week, the European court of auditors found diesel cars had been designed to pass ever tighter exhaust tests, but caused much more air pollution on our roads.Some produced 50% more carbon dioxide (CO2) and more than 10 times as many nitrogen oxides (NOx). Extra CO2 affects the climate, but avoids climate taxes, and the extra NOX harms our health. Enforcement is down to each country, but we are still waiting. The EU has launched legal action against Spain, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK for not prosecuting Volkswagen for selling cars with cheat software.Seven different companies have recalled more than 10m vehicles, but the limited data available on these fixes suggests the impact on NOx is small. The court voiced fears that manufacturers would find new ways to “optimise” vehicles to beat tighter tests on new cars. Sales of new diesels have plummeted along with the secondhand market.

4906,"Airbus has announced it will end production of its A380 superjumbo passenger jet after failing to secure orders – a move that puts UK jobs at risk.The European aerospace group said it had made the “painful” decision to stop making the world’s largest superjumbo in 2021 after Emirates, the A380’s biggest customer, reduced an outstanding order for 53 planes to only 14.Emirates will instead order 70 of the smaller A330 and A350 aircraft, underlining the trend towards smaller, more efficient aircraft that made the A380 unsustainable.The cancellation of the A380 will affect the jobs of as many as 3,500 Airbus staff, including about 300 at its factory in Broughton, north Wales, which constructs the model’s wings.The Broughton site has about 6,000 employees, while there are another 3,000 in Filton, near Bristol; some of whom work on landing gear and fuel systems for the A380. However, Airbus said a “significant number” of staff will move to production of other, more popular models and major job losses in the UK are not expected as a result of the announcement.Rhys McCarthy, the national officer for aerospace at Unite, said the union is seeking assurances from Airbus that there will be no job losses. He added that companies in the A380 supply chain, including Redditch-based GKN, are a “key concern”.Tom Enders, Airbus’s outgoing chief executive, said the cancellation was “painful for us”. He said: “We have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years.”Speaking at Airbus’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, Enders said the effect on jobs in the UK “needs to be evaluated”. He said: “Hopefully we can reuse and redeploy a significant number of employees there.“What we’re seeing here is the end of the large, four-engine aircraft,” said Enders, who admitted that the company was a decade late in developing the superjumbo. Boeing, Airbus’s American arch-rival, this month celebrated 50 years of production of its 747.Engines for the A380 are produced in Derby by Rolls-Royce, another major British aerospace employer, although it is thought that the effect on UK jobs numbers will be small.In a statement, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace president, said: “The A380 is a world-class feat of engineering, much loved by passengers, and we are obviously saddened that deliveries will come to an end.”Airbus said that more than 190 million passengers have flown in the A380 since the first plane rolled off the assembly line in Toulouse, France, in 2007. However, the plane, which can theoretically carry as many as 800 passengers, has struggled for profitability as demand for mid-sized jets boomed.Airbus, which on Thursday also announced stronger than expected profits for 2018, is planning to ramp up production of its smaller models even as the A380 winds down. It is targeting between 880 and 890 deliveries of aircraft to its customers during 2019, a 10% increase from its record haul of 800 in 2018.However, the A380 cancellation will add another element of uncertainty for the future of UK operations already threatened by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Enders last month decried “Brexiteers’ madness”, saying that future investment decisions would be influenced if Brexit led to significant trade frictions.Enders on Thursday said he believed the “voices of reason” would prevail, avoiding a no-deal Brexit. In June last year Airbus said there would be a cost of €1bn (about £880m) for every week of delay in production. The company and its suppliers have built up buffer stocks of about €1bn, in line with estimates made in June.Enders said: “Looking at the situation as it is I’m still optimistic that a solution can be found that avoids a fall from a cliff.”The end of the A380 may free up space at Airbus’s Toulouse and Hamburg facilities, where final assembly is currently carried out, giving them a boost in the competition for business with the UK. However, Enders denied reports that Spain had made a formal offer to take wing production from the UK after Brexit.The end of the A380 comes at a crucial time for Airbus as it takes on a new leadership team after losing out to Boeing in the aircraft deliveries race in 2018. Guillaume Faury, a former helicopter engineer who became the president of Airbus’s commercial aircraft business in February 2018, will take over from Enders as chief executive in April.Faury said the risks from Brexit were “enormous” in both the short and long term, with the principal risk to Airbus coming in delays at the UK’s border with the rest of the EU.",A380: Airbus to stop making superjumbo as orders dry up,2019-02-14/11:49:05+0000,airbus has announced it will end production of its a superjumbo passenger jet after failing to secure orders a move that puts uk jobs at risk the european aerospace group said it had made the painful decision to stop making the world s largest superjumbo in  after emirates the a s biggest customer reduced an outstanding order for  planes to only  emirates will instead order  of the smaller a and a aircraft underlining the trend towards smaller more efficient aircraft that made the a unsustainable the cancellation of the a will affect the jobs of as many as   airbus staff including about  at its factory in broughton north wales which constructs the model s wings the broughton site has about   employees while there are another   in filton near bristol some of whom work on landing gear and fuel systems for the a however airbus said a significant number of staff will move to production of other more popular models and major job losses in the uk are not expected as a result of the announcement rhys mccarthy the national officer for aerospace at unite said the union is seeking assurances from airbus that there will be no job losses he added that companies in the a supply chain including redditch based gkn are a key concern tom enders airbus s outgoing chief executive said the cancellation was painful for us he said we have no substantial a backlog and hence no basis to sustain production despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years speaking at airbus s headquarters in toulouse france enders said the effect on jobs in the uk needs to be evaluated he said hopefully we can reuse and redeploy a significant number of employees there what we re seeing here is the end of the large four engine aircraft said enders who admitted that the company was a decade late in developing the superjumbo boeing airbus s american arch rival this month celebrated  years of production of its  engines for the a are produced in derby by rolls royce another major british aerospace employer although it is thought that the effect on uk jobs numbers will be small in a statement chris cholerton rolls royce s civil aerospace president said the a is a world class feat of engineering much loved by passengers and we are obviously saddened that deliveries will come to an end airbus said that more than  million passengers have flown in the a since the first plane rolled off the assembly line in toulouse france in  however the plane which can theoretically carry as many as  passengers has struggled for profitability as demand for mid sized jets boomed airbus which on thursday also announced stronger than expected profits for  is planning to ramp up production of its smaller models even as the a winds down it is targeting between  and  deliveries of aircraft to its customers during  a  increase from its record haul of  in  however the a cancellation will add another element of uncertainty for the future of uk operations already threatened by the prospect of a no deal brexit enders last month decried brexiteers madness saying that future investment decisions would be influenced if brexit led to significant trade frictions enders on thursday said he believed the voices of reason would prevail avoiding a no deal brexit in june last year airbus said there would be a cost of bn about m for every week of delay in production the company and its suppliers have built up buffer stocks of about bn in line with estimates made in june enders said looking at the situation as it is i m still optimistic that a solution can be found that avoids a fall from a cliff the end of the a may free up space at airbus s toulouse and hamburg facilities where final assembly is currently carried out giving them a boost in the competition for business with the uk however enders denied reports that spain had made a formal offer to take wing production from the uk after brexit the end of the a comes at a crucial time for airbus as it takes on a new leadership team after losing out to boeing in the aircraft deliveries race in  guillaume faury a former helicopter engineer who became the president of airbus s commercial aircraft business in february  will take over from enders as chief executive in april faury said the risks from brexit were enormous in both the short and long term with the principal risk to airbus coming in delays at the uk s border with the rest of the eu ,Boeing Crisis,0.23430991172790527
4916,"Looking at a plane this enormous, it felt a miracle that it could fly. And not only fly but soar so quietly, especially compared with the Boeing 747 it was designed to supersede and outclass. Passengers love it, but the A380 never completely took off among the airline buyers.The announcement from Airbus that the final curtain will come down on the A380’s pan-European production line comes after years of speculation that the superjumbo was doomed. Orders had dried up in a risk-averse airline industry, whose economics and route networks were altered just at the wrong moment for the A380.Airbus had nosed ahead of the pack in producing a plane that was built with lighter materials and was much more fuel-efficient, and potentially offered big savings and profits on routes where airlines could guarantee to load hundreds of passengers on every flight. It looked an ideal solution for the packed transatlantic corridors, where airlines would compete for scarce and expensive slots at intercontinental hubs such as Heathrow.Even as the first A380 entered service in 2007, however, orders were piling up for a different plane still in the pipeline from rival Boeing. The 787 Dreamliner could fly a similar range on only two engines. This upstart took the use of lightweight composite materials a leap further and would need roughly half the number of passengers, 250 to 300 rather than the typical 550 on an A380, to make long-haul flights economically viable.The hub and spokes model of aviation, in which airlines feed in passengers from connecting flights, and the bigger the long-haul plane the better, was being challenged. Low-cost aviation had given secondary airports fresh life, and passengers were increasingly used to direct, point-to-point flying. The need for Airbus’s expensive double-decker, its wings so wide that airport stands and equipment had to be remodelled to accommodate it, was fading.The doubts escalated when so few customers were willing to take a punt on a plane whose future was in question. Only one airline, Emirates, appeared fully enamoured, placing giant orders that single-handedly sustained the A380 manufacturing programme. Few others had the deep pockets of the booming Gulf carrier, or customers rich enough to merit turning part of the plane’s spacious interior into a shower spa suite.British Airways talked up the plane’s qualities but talked down the price. The Australian carrier, Qantas, was stung by teething problems as an early adopter, stalled on an order made in 2006 and finally cancelled it last week. Even Air France cut back on the plane assembled by its compatriots in Toulouse.The most ominous sign was the news that two of the first A380s, still in their infancy in aircraft years, were being parked in the Pyrenees and stripped for parts. The aircraft had gone from great birds of the sky to mere organ donors in a decade. It was a more economical solution for their owner, the German leasing firm Dr Peters, than trying to hire them out to unwilling airlines.When Emirates finally decided enough was enough, seeking to convert its order to newer, smaller models, it was game over. Few can blame Airbus for wanting to cling on and push this incredible plane, whose virtues are unquestioned.

4961,"The freight industry has warned of the potential for a fresh Brexit ferry fiasco after it emerged all British truckers will be required to have counter-terrorism safety security certificates to enter the European Union in the event of no deal.The EU rule was introduced after the 9/11 attack on New York’s twin towers but only applies to third country freight entering the EU.But if the UK crashes out of the bloc it will be classified as a third country like Ukraine or China and all freight operators will be required to fill out a 38-point safety and security form.Irish drivers using the UK as a land bridge to the continent would also have to comply, sources said.Not only would this be necessary for every consignment, but it would be required hours before transit, fuelling fears that trucks could face delays not just because of customs and public health checks but also safety.James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the Freight Transport Association, said it was a serious issue particularly because the certificates were required for each consignment in a truck, affecting small- to medium-sized businesses which have multiple pickups before they head to the continent.“It is not fiscal like customs and tariffs, but it is more serious for ferries and Eurotunnel because it involves security issues because the vessel or train could be endangered if there is a truck without the security certificate on it,” he said.The concerns have been raised amid reports that truckers could face fines of up to £1,000 if they do not have a similar clearance certificate on their way back into the UK.And to add to the freight industry’s problems, the Department for Transport (DfT) only has 9% of the 11,000 driver permits requested by British hauliers to operate legally in the EU in the event of no deal.The government confirmed the need for safety and security clearance certificates in a 37-page “partnership pack” it has prepared for importers and exporters.“For imports into the UK a separate safety and security declaration needs to be made by the carrier of the goods (this is usually the haulier, airline, freight train operator or shipping line, depending on the mode of transport used to import goods),” the pack says.Hookham said the safety certificates were not as big an issue for ports such as Felixstowe that deal with sea containers, because goods from countries such as China have weeks of transit in which to deal with paperwork.But the just-in-time systems used in British manufacturing rely heavily on the “turn-up-and-go” arrangement that operates at ports and Eurotunnel.Under the EU rules ferry companies would need paperwork two hours in advance while Eurotunnel would need it one hour before transit.An HM Revenue and Customs spokesperson said: “HMRC have written several times to traders to advise them how to prepare for a no deal and will continue to set out further detail over the coming weeks.”The concern over safety certificates comes amid mounting worries among the freight industry of a no-deal Brexit.In the event of no deal all heavy goods vehicle operators would be required to have a European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) permit, of which only 984 have been allocated to the UK for 2019 and just 60 for Northern Ireland.Last week the DfT confirmed it had received 11,000 applications for permits from 2,000 truck operators.Had another example yesterday of a company that applied for 60 and got 14... the EU contingency measure - if & when approved, will hopefully remove the need for permits in certain cases, but companies that rely on cross trade a lot will need permits anywaySeamus Leheny, the policy manager for the FTA in Northern Ireland, tweeted that he received a call on Tuesday from a haulier who operates to and from the continent who had applied for 35 ECMT permits but had been “told they get 2”. Leheny said: “You don’t need to explain the consequences of this.”Pauline Bastidon from the FTA tweeted that she had been told of another company that “applied for 60 permits and got just 14”.",Anti-terror checks deliver fresh Brexit threat for UK hauliers,2019-02-13/11:41:38+0000,the freight industry has warned of the potential for a fresh brexit ferry fiasco after it emerged all british truckers will be required to have counter terrorism safety security certificates to enter the european union in the event of no deal the eu rule was introduced after the   attack on new york s twin towers but only applies to third country freight entering the eu but if the uk crashes out of the bloc it will be classified as a third country like ukraine or china and all freight operators will be required to fill out a  point safety and security form irish drivers using the uk as a land bridge to the continent would also have to comply sources said not only would this be necessary for every consignment but it would be required hours before transit fuelling fears that trucks could face delays not just because of customs and public health checks but also safety james hookham the deputy chief executive of the freight transport association said it was a serious issue particularly because the certificates were required for each consignment in a truck affecting small to medium sized businesses which have multiple pickups before they head to the continent it is not fiscal like customs and tariffs but it is more serious for ferries and eurotunnel because it involves security issues because the vessel or train could be endangered if there is a truck without the security certificate on it he said the concerns have been raised amid reports that truckers could face fines of up to   if they do not have a similar clearance certificate on their way back into the uk and to add to the freight industry s problems the department for transport dft only has  of the   driver permits requested by british hauliers to operate legally in the eu in the event of no deal the government confirmed the need for safety and security clearance certificates in a  page partnership pack it has prepared for importers and exporters for imports into the uk a separate safety and security declaration needs to be made by the carrier of the goods this is usually the haulier airline freight train operator or shipping line depending on the mode of transport used to import goods the pack says hookham said the safety certificates were not as big an issue for ports such as felixstowe that deal with sea containers because goods from countries such as china have weeks of transit in which to deal with paperwork but the just in time systems used in british manufacturing rely heavily on the turn up and go arrangement that operates at ports and eurotunnel under the eu rules ferry companies would need paperwork two hours in advance while eurotunnel would need it one hour before transit an hm revenue and customs spokesperson said hmrc have written several times to traders to advise them how to prepare for a no deal and will continue to set out further detail over the coming weeks the concern over safety certificates comes amid mounting worries among the freight industry of a no deal brexit in the event of no deal all heavy goods vehicle operators would be required to have a european conference of ministers of transport ecmt permit of which only  have been allocated to the uk for  and just  for northern ireland last week the dft confirmed it had received   applications for permits from   truck operators had another example yesterday of a company that applied for  and got  the eu contingency measure if when approved will hopefully remove the need for permits in certain cases but companies that rely on cross trade a lot will need permits anywayseamus leheny the policy manager for the fta in northern ireland tweeted that he received a call on tuesday from a haulier who operates to and from the continent who had applied for  ecmt permits but had been told they get  leheny said you don t need to explain the consequences of this pauline bastidon from the fta tweeted that she had been told of another company that applied for  permits and got just  ,Boeing Crisis,0.129693865776062

5303,"The bodies of four skiers who went missing after an avalanche in the Italian ski resort of Courmayeur have been found.They were discovered on Monday under two metres of snow in Val Veny, to the south of Courmayeur in the Aosta valley region bordering France.The skiers were identified by Italian rescuers as Matthew Ziegler, 43, a British national with a Swiss passport, Katherine Clarke, 39, born in New Zealand and living in London, Nicolas Bruno Vergez, 36, French, and Wespazjan Wisla, 38, a Pole living in France. The four had been missing since about midday on Sunday. The alarm was raised by friends of the two UK residents, who were reportedly on the final day of their ski trip after they failed to arrive at a meeting point. The four skiers had gone off-piste, according to Italian news reports. Rescue operations were made more difficult on Sunday due to the height of the avalanche, preventing rescuers from undertaking the search by foot, and the risk of another.In total, eight people were killed by avalanches in Italy over the weekend. Earlier on Sunday, two bodies were found in Aosta, while another skier died in the Lombardy region and an 18-year-old was killed in South Tyrol.The regional authority in Aosta, where the avalanche risk is very high – at level 3 out of 5 – warned people in the mountains to heed weather warnings. “The conditions are very different depending on the areas; the most critical are in the north and north-west of the region,” it said.In January, seven people were killed when a tourist plane and helicopter collided in midair over the Rutor glacier in Aosta.

5305,"The family of the footballer Emiliano Sala are desperate for the plane he was travelling in to be recovered from the seabed after it emerged that a body had been spotted in the wreckage.The Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) has not said if it believes the body is that of Argentinian striker or the pilot, David Ibbotson, and are consulting both men’s families and the police before deciding whether to try to raise the plane.Air accident investigators are planning their next steps after the plane was found in 63 metres of water north of the Channel island of Guernsey.Experts have said that they believe it will be possible to lift the aircraft though any operation is likely to be hampered by rough seas and poor weather.Marine scientist and shipwreck hunter David Mearns, who led a private search for the plane backed by Sala’s family and thousands of people who donated money in a crowdfunding exercise, said he remained in close contact with the player’s relatives.He said: “We are informing them every step of the way what’s going on and they are making it clear to us what their priorities are at all times. There’s a much greater chance they will get answers if [the plane is] recovered.”The plane was found on Sunday within hours of the start of the search, which involved the UK government’s AAIB working alongside Mearns’s team.It is now up to the AAIB to decide the next step but Mearns added: “I think it’s imperative that the plane is recovered, and even more so now we know someone is down there.”He said a salvage vessel equipped for working in the North Sea and a properly equipped dive support vessel would be able to lift the plane within a matter of days.When asked if the body would be recovered before the wreck itself, he said: “That’s down to the AAIB and their operational people about how they do that. The body will be the most sensitive of objects that they are picking up so they will be very careful about that.”Mearns also said the operation would need to be carried out in “slack water” – the point at which the tide is turning.The Argentinian government thanked the UK for locating the plane and called on the British authorities to continue their efforts to find the cause of the accident. Sala’s father, Horacio, spoke of his anguish at the discovery, telling a television channel in Argentina: “I cannot believe it. This is a dream. A bad dream.”Until the plane was discovered, Sala’s family were still holding out hope that he could have survived.But their worst fears were realised after two vessels began a search of the seabed at the last known location of the plane on Sunday morning. The AAIB commissioned a vessel called Geo Ocean III while Mearns’s team used a boat called FPV Morven.The AAIB said: “Early in the search, the Morven identified an object of interest on the seabed using its side-scan sonar equipment. It cleared the immediate area for the Geo Ocean III to use its underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to survey the area of the seabed in which the object was located.“Based on analysis of ROV video footage, the AAIB investigators onboard the vessel concluded that the object is wreckage from the missing Piper Malibu aircraft. Tragically, in video footage from the ROV, one occupant is visible amidst the wreckage. The AAIB is now considering the next steps, in consultation with the families of the pilot and passenger, and the police.”The searchers were surprised the plane was so intact. Ross Taylor of A-2-Sea Solutions, which provided the FPV Morven, said: “In terms of the search, you have set lines of the seabed and they are set up at a distance depending on the resolution you want to achieve.”He compared the search process to mowing a lawn, and said the wreck was found using a combination of sonar equipment, including one device towed about five metres from the seabed.The plane had been taking Sala to Cardiff from Nantes in France on 21 January, shortly after the 28-year-old signed for the Premiership club Cardiff City.Ibbotson, the 59-year-old pilot, had requested to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control.",Emiliano Sala: family desperate for plane to be lifted from seabed,2019-02-04/18:21:59+0000,the family of the footballer emiliano sala are desperate for the plane he was travelling in to be recovered from the seabed after it emerged that a body had been spotted in the wreckage the air accident investigation branch aaib has not said if it believes the body is that of argentinian striker or the pilot david ibbotson and are consulting both men s families and the police before deciding whether to try to raise the plane air accident investigators are planning their next steps after the plane was found in  metres of water north of the channel island of guernsey experts have said that they believe it will be possible to lift the aircraft though any operation is likely to be hampered by rough seas and poor weather marine scientist and shipwreck hunter david mearns who led a private search for the plane backed by sala s family and thousands of people who donated money in a crowdfunding exercise said he remained in close contact with the player s relatives he said we are informing them every step of the way what s going on and they are making it clear to us what their priorities are at all times there s a much greater chance they will get answers if the plane is recovered the plane was found on sunday within hours of the start of the search which involved the uk government s aaib working alongside mearns s team it is now up to the aaib to decide the next step but mearns added i think it s imperative that the plane is recovered and even more so now we know someone is down there he said a salvage vessel equipped for working in the north sea and a properly equipped dive support vessel would be able to lift the plane within a matter of days when asked if the body would be recovered before the wreck itself he said that s down to the aaib and their operational people about how they do that the body will be the most sensitive of objects that they are picking up so they will be very careful about that mearns also said the operation would need to be carried out in slack water the point at which the tide is turning the argentinian government thanked the uk for locating the plane and called on the british authorities to continue their efforts to find the cause of the accident sala s father horacio spoke of his anguish at the discovery telling a television channel in argentina i cannot believe it this is a dream a bad dream until the plane was discovered sala s family were still holding out hope that he could have survived but their worst fears were realised after two vessels began a search of the seabed at the last known location of the plane on sunday morning the aaib commissioned a vessel called geo ocean iii while mearns s team used a boat called fpv morven the aaib said early in the search the morven identified an object of interest on the seabed using its side scan sonar equipment it cleared the immediate area for the geo ocean iii to use its underwater remotely operated vehicle rov to survey the area of the seabed in which the object was located based on analysis of rov video footage the aaib investigators onboard the vessel concluded that the object is wreckage from the missing piper malibu aircraft tragically in video footage from the rov one occupant is visible amidst the wreckage the aaib is now considering the next steps in consultation with the families of the pilot and passenger and the police the searchers were surprised the plane was so intact ross taylor of a  sea solutions which provided the fpv morven said in terms of the search you have set lines of the seabed and they are set up at a distance depending on the resolution you want to achieve he compared the search process to mowing a lawn and said the wreck was found using a combination of sonar equipment including one device towed about five metres from the seabed the plane had been taking sala to cardiff from nantes in france on  january shortly after the  year old signed for the premiership club cardiff city ibbotson the  year old pilot had requested to descend before losing contact with jersey air traffic control ,Boeing Crisis,0.22894617915153503
5390,"A privately funded search for the plane that was carrying the missing Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala will begin on Sunday.The enterprise is being led by the marine scientist David Mearns on behalf of the Sala family.Mearns said on Saturday: “Tomorrow the weather will be good. We will be able to operate tomorrow.”The plane, a Piper Malibu, registration N264DB , carrying 28-year-old Sala and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, disappeared over the Channel on 21 January after leaving Nantes, France, for Cardiff.The plane had requested to descend, then lost contact with Jersey air traffic control.Mearns, the director of Blue Water Recoveries, will lead a team of seven on the vessel FPV Morven, operating around the clock. Mearns says he has located 24 major shipwrecks during his career.The private search is being carried out in close co-ordination with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). Last week, British military investigators announced they would be carrying out an underwater search for the plane after the Argentinian government asked the UK to extend the hunt.Two seat cushions, which are likely to have come from the plane, were found earlier this week.There will be two vessels, including one commissioned by the AAIB, searching an area of about four square nautical miles north of Guernsey. Mearns said the AAIB had a high level of confidence that the plane could be in that zone but it could have moved once on the seabed.An official search operation was called off on 24 January as Guernsey’s harbour master, David Barker, said the chances of survival after such a long period were extremely remote.

5670,"The pilot who flew the plane carrying Emiliano Sala used a loophole to allow him to take paying passengers, it has emerged, as friends expressed shock that he decided to fly across the Channel at night.On Friday, Sala’s relatives were investigating the possibility of launching a privately funded search after the authorities in Guernsey halted their hunt for the missing footballer, the pilot Dave Ibbotson and his plane.Sala’s parents were understood to be flying to the UK to join his sister, Romina, in Cardiff. Her call for the Guernsey harbourmaster, Capt David Barker, to resume the search was backed by several footballers including Sala’s fellow Argentinians Lionel Messi, Diego Maradona and Sergio Agüero.Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, has also spoken out over the issue. In a statement on Friday, the president’s office said he had instructed the foreign minister, Jorge Faurie, to make a formal request to both France and the UK to resume the search.A petition launched in France – where Sala played for Nantes until his transfer to Cardiff City this month – and signed by more than 50,000 people also called for the search to restart, and a demonstration was held in Sala’s home town of Progreso.Since the plane disappeared, it has emerged that Ibbotson, 59, of Crowle, Lincolnshire, held a private pilot’s licence with the Federal Aviation Authority in the US.The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority said the aircraft was registered in the US and so fell under American regulations. US law states that private pilots cannot make a profit by carrying passengers. The nature of the arrangement between Ibbotson and Sala is unclear.Ibbotson is understood to have been using a loophole that allowed him to fly passengers between airports as long as he did not profit from any journey. He could claim “reasonable expenses” for fuel and other outgoings. This is perfectly legal. He was also a registered pilot with the British Parachute Association (BPA) and would not have required a commercial licence if he was flying as a volunteer.Ian Marshall, who sat with Ibbotson on the BPA council, told the Guardian this was common practice among private pilots. The loophole has led to the rise of websites similar to Uber that connect passengers with pilots, considerably reducing the price of private flights. The most popular of these sites is Wingly.Marshall said: “Most of the pilots who have these private licences are semi-commercial. You’re not meant to fly for any financial reward, but that’s not to say you can’t fly for reasonable expenses. That’s how many of them get around it.”He said many pilots chose to obtain a licence from the FAA in the US as the process was said to be less stringent than that in the UK. The UK Air Accident Investigation Branch has confirmed that it will look at all operational aspects of the flight, including licensing and whether it was a private or commercial operation.Marshall added: “I am quite surprised that he decided to fly from Nantes to Cardiff in that plane at night. I thought there were restrictions in place that would have meant he couldn’t fly. There are lots of unanswered questions.”It is understood that part of the investigation will look into whether Ibbotson had the instrument qualifications to fly “blind at night” and in bad weather, and whether he was properly insured.At the weekend Ibbotson sent a message via social media to a friend suggesting he was “a bit rusty with the ILS” – the instrument landing system. There have been reports that he made more than one attempt to take off on the fateful flight and that the plane was turning back towards northern France when it vanished.On Thursday the Guernsey harbourmaster, Capt David Barker, said rescuers would no longer actively look for the missing pair, whose plane vanished from radar screens on Monday, because they believed their chances of survival were “extremely remote”.However, Sala’s sister pleaded for the search to continue. Speaking at the Cardiff City stadium on Friday, she said: “We really are thankful for the support of all the players in the way they have said that we should not stop our efforts. We will find a way to restart the search. We will find Emiliano and the pilot. He is a fighter and we feel he is still out there.”The plane left Nantes for Cardiff at 7.15pm on Monday. After the pilot asked for permission to descend, the plane lost contact with Jersey air traffic control. Barker acknowledged on Thursday that Sala’s family were unhappy with the decision to stop searching, but said he was “absolutely confident” that no more could be done.He said rescue teams had scanned about 1,700 sq miles and examined mobile phone data and satellite imagery and had found no trace of the plane. He said he was not surprised by the outcome because the waters were in flood tide, with up to 12 knots of current running through the area, meaning the search zone had grown by the hour.Barker said it was suspected that the final position of the plane was close to Hurd’s Deep, an underwater valley used as a dumping ground for radioactive waste, but it was not possible to say if this was where the plane ended up.Although the active search had ended, he said, ships and planes were still being asked to look out for any signs of the men or their plane. A missing persons investigation remains live.The lifeboat charity the RNLI said its volunteers “gave their utmost” in challenging conditions during the three-day search. Channel Island rescue workers faced “rough seas, heavy hail showers and squalls” on shifts lasting 10 hours or more.Alderney Lifeboat Station’s deputy second coxswain, Mark Gaudion, said there was always “an overwhelming desire to have a positive outcome” among rescue workers.

emiliano sala used a loophole to allow him to take paying passengers it has emerged as friends expressed shock that he decided to fly across the channel at night on friday sala s relatives were investigating the possibility of launching a privately funded search after the authorities in guernsey halted their hunt for the missing footballer the pilot dave ibbotson and his plane sala s parents were understood to be flying to the uk to join his sister romina in cardiff her call for the guernsey harbourmaster capt david barker to resume the search was backed by several footballers including sala s fellow argentinians lionel messi diego maradona and sergio agüero argentina s president mauricio macri has also spoken out over the issue in a statement on friday the president s office said he had instructed the foreign minister jorge faurie to make a formal request to both france and the uk to resume the search a petition launched in france where sala played for nantes until his transfer to cardiff city this month and signed by more than   people also called for the search to restart and a demonstration was held in sala s home town of progreso since the plane disappeared it has emerged that ibbotson  of crowle lincolnshire held a private pilot s licence with the federal aviation authority in the us the uk s civil aviation authority said the aircraft was registered in the us and so fell under american regulations us law states that private pilots cannot make a profit by carrying passengers the nature of the arrangement between ibbotson and sala is unclear ibbotson is understood to have been using a loophole that allowed him to fly passengers between airports as long as he did not profit from any journey he could claim reasonable expenses for fuel and other outgoings this is perfectly legal he was also a registered pilot with the british parachute association bpa and would not have required a commercial licence if he was flying as a volunteer ian marshall who sat with ibbotson on the bpa council told the guardian this was common practice among private pilots the loophole has led to the rise of websites similar to uber that connect passengers with pilots considerably reducing the price of private flights the most popular of these sites is wingly marshall said most of the pilots who have these private licences are semi commercial you re not meant to fly for any financial reward but that s not to say you can t fly for reasonable expenses that s how many of them get around it he said many pilots chose to obtain a licence from the faa in the us as the process was said to be less stringent than that in the uk the uk air accident investigation branch has confirmed that it will look at all operational aspects of the flight including licensing and whether it was a private or commercial operation marshall added i am quite surprised that he decided to fly from nantes to cardiff in that plane at night i thought there were restrictions in place that would have meant he couldn t fly there are lots of unanswered questions it is understood that part of the investigation will look into whether ibbotson had the instrument qualifications to fly blind at night and in bad weather and whether he was properly insured at the weekend ibbotson sent a message via social media to a friend suggesting he was a bit rusty with the ils the instrument landing system there have been reports that he made more than one attempt to take off on the fateful flight and that the plane was turning back towards northern france when it vanished on thursday the guernsey harbourmaster capt david barker said rescuers would no longer actively look for the missing pair whose plane vanished from radar screens on monday because they believed their chances of survival were extremely remote however sala s sister pleaded for the search to continue speaking at the cardiff city stadium on friday she said we really are thankful for the support of all the players in the way they have said that we should not stop our efforts we will find a way to restart the search we will find emiliano and the pilot he is a fighter and we feel he is

5885,"As Apollo 11 sailed above the moon, mission control in Houston suggested the astronauts should keep an eye out for a “beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-o”, who, according to legend, had ascended to the moon thousands of years previously, taking along a large rabbit as a companion.“I’ll look out for the bunny girl then,” Buzz Aldrin joked in reply, shortly ahead of his and Neil Armstrong’s historic touchdown at the lunar surface.Nearly 50 years on, an astronaut gazing down from orbit might glimpse a hi-tech homage to the ancient folk tale. China’s Chang’e 4 probe this month became the first to land on the lunar far side, and nearby, hibernating during the lunar night, the Jade Rabbit rover is exploring this uncharted territory.The mission showcases China’s ambition to become one of the world’s major powers in space exploration. The country has made the moon exciting again by beaming back the first close-up images of its mysterious far side. Beijing does not disclose how much is spent on its space programme, but aims to build a space station and a base on the moon, as well as send a probe to Mars by 2020 and carry out a mission to Jupiter by 2029.Possibly spurred on by China’s plans, other space agencies are showing a renewed interest in the moon, and landers from the US, India, Japan and Russia are planned over the next decade. So what is driving the renaissance of lunar exploration?James Carpenter, a project scientist on the European Space Agency’s lunar exploration team, believes that the latest interest goes beyond purely scientific goals. “There is a long-term motivation which is about sustained human presence in space,” he said. “If we ever want to live and work in a permanent, economically sustainable way off Earth, this requires that we learn to use the resources we find there.”The motivations for heading into space for longer periods include extracting valuable resources from the moon or asteroids, as well as a preparing for a “lifeboat scenario” where the world becomes uninhabitable.At a press conference, officials said there would be three more missions after Chang’e 5, a mission to return samples from the moon. By Chang’e 8, China hopes to lay the foundation for a research base, including possibly building houses on lunar soil using 3D printing.Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the Chang’e mission, told China’s state broadcaster CCTV: “It is human nature to explore the unknown world. China is on the road to becoming a strong space nation.”Preparing for living in space is a large element of the Chinese programme. Chang’e 4’s payload included experiments to investigate the presence of water in the lunar soil, as well as a miniature greenhouse to test the ability of plants and insects to survive in weak gravity.Back on Earth, students at Beihang University in Beijing ran a year-long experiment, Lunar Palace 1, in which students were housed in lunar-like conditions. Inside a module they grew potatoes, wheat and vegetables, and relied on oxygen and water that were recycled within the “bioregenerative life support system”.China is not alone in its ambitions on the moon. A Russian lander, scheduled for 2022, will attempt to drill into the south pole region and look at the potential for resource extraction, while ESA is planning experiments to harvest water and oxygen. Nasa is planning its first crewed mission around the moon in half a century for 2023.The prospect of China, the US and Europe competing to establish outposts and exploit the moon’s resources has led to talk of a new space race, with some suggesting that China is now ahead.However, John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said that many have overstated China’s recent accomplishments. He describes them as relatively modest when compared to Nasa’s New Horizons mission, the first to perform a fly-by of a Kuiper Belt object, or Japan’s Hayabusa 2 mission, set to land on an asteroid next month and return samples to Earth. “China’s achievement is impressive, but it is not something fundamental or different from what other countries are doing,” he said.For Logsdon, the key question in how the next phase of space exploration plays out is whether China becomes a collaborator with other countries or continues to compete. “It’s really a broader question of Chinese-US relationships overall,” he said. “Will the two countries become peer competitors in military, economic and technical terms, or will they find ways of working together? What happens in space just dramatises that.”Experts say other countries are likely to remain cautious about collaborating with China, despite some positive steps such as the inclusion of instruments aboard Chang’e 4 developed by teams in Sweden and Germany.“China’s reputation for stealing technology hurts chances for cooperation,” said James Lewis, senior vice-president and director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “China sees itself as competing – when they drone on about the need for win-win, it’s a sign that they think we are in a zero-sum game, where there can be only one winner.”Because the Chinese military, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), oversees the majority of what China does in space, there are also concerns about China’s goal to deploy space systems to more effectively gather information than their adversaries – or block their adversaries’ ability to do the same.Whichever way diplomatic relations in space play out, Carpenter said that nations and commercial players should be working to establish ground rules for the exploration of the moon and beyond.He added: “Something we’ve learned from working on Earth is that we have to learn how to manage resources in a sustainable and ethical way. This is something that is certainly going to be part of the discussion – how we do this in a way that is responsible in the future, and how we create the rules and governance and legal framework to ensure we do that.”",Battlefield moon: how China plans to win the lunar space race,2019-01-21/06:00:10+0000,as apollo  sailed above the moon mission control in houston suggested the astronauts should

6027,"The appearance of a single green leaf hinted at a future in which astronauts would grow their own food in space, potentially setting up residence at outposts on the moon or other planets. Now, barely after it had sprouted, the cotton plant onboard China’s lunar rover has died.The plant relied on sunlight at the moon’s surface, but as night arrived at the lunar far side and temperatures plunged as low as -170C, its short life came to an end.Prof Xie Gengxin of Chongqing University, who led the design of the experiment, said its short lifespan had been anticipated. “Life in the canister would not survive the lunar night,” Xie said.The Chang’e-4 probe entered “sleep mode” on Sunday as the first lunar night after the probe’s landing fell. Nighttime on the moon lasts for approximately two weeks, after which the probe would wake up again. Its rover, Yutu-2, has also been required to take a midday nap to avoid overheating while the sun was directly overhead and temperatures could reach more than 120C. Unlike Earth, the moon has no atmosphere to buffer extreme temperature variations.The plants and seeds would gradually decompose in the totally enclosed canister, and would not affect the lunar environment, according to the China National Space Administration.Although astronauts have cultivated plants on the International Space Station, this was the first time any have grown on the moon.“We had no such experience before. And we could not simulate the lunar environment, such as microgravity and cosmic radiation, on earth,” Xie said.The experiment also included potato seeds, yeast and Arabidopsis, or rockcress, a small, flowering plant of the mustard family, but none of these showed signs of having sprouted.Fruit fly eggs were also placed in the canister. The hope was that a micro-ecosystem would form, in which the plants would provide oxygen to the fruit flies, which would feed on the yeast and produce the carbon dioxide required for photosynthesis.The space agency did not confirm whether the fruit fly eggs had hatched.“Fruit flies are relatively lazy animals. They might not come out,” Xie told the Chinese news website, Inkstone, on Tuesday. If they failed to hatch, they have probably now missed their window of opportunity.",First green leaf on moon dies as temperatures plummet,2019-01-16/15:42:48+0000,the appearance of a single green leaf hinted at a future in which astronauts would grow their own food in space potentially setting up residence at outposts on the moon or other planets now barely after it had sprouted the cotton plant onboard china s lunar rover has died the plant relied on sunlight at the moon s surface but as night arrived at the lunar far side and temperatures plunged as low as c its short life came to an end prof xie gengxin of chongqing university who led the design of the experiment said its short lifespan had been anticipated life in the canister would not survive the lunar night xie said the chang e  probe entered sleep mode on sunday as the first lunar night after the probe s landing fell nighttime on the moon lasts for approximately two weeks after which the probe would wake up again its rover yutu  has also been required to take a midday nap to avoid overheating while the sun was directly overhead and temperatures could reach more than c unlike earth the moon has no atmosphere to buffer extreme temperature variations the plants and seeds would gradually decompose in the totally enclosed canister and would not affect the lunar environment according to the china national space administration although astronauts have cultivated plants on the international space station this was the first time any have grown on the moon we had no such experience before and we could not simulate the lunar environment such as microgravity and cosmic radiation on earth xie said the experiment also included potato seeds yeast and arabidopsis or rockcress a small flowering plant of the mustard family but none of these showed signs of having sprouted fruit fly eggs were also placed in the canister the hope was that a micro ecosystem would form in which the plants would provide oxygen to the fruit flies which would feed on the yeast and produce the carbon dioxide required for photosynthesis the space agency did not confirm whether the fruit fly eggs had hatched fruit flies are relatively lazy animals they might not come out xie told the chinese news website inkstone on tuesday if they failed to hatch they have probably now missed their window of opportunity ,Boeing Crisis,0.25890281796455383
6083," A small green shoot is growing on the moon after a cotton seed germinated onboard a Chinese lunar lander, scientists said.The sprout has emerged from a lattice-like structure inside a canister after the Chang’e 4 lander touched down earlier this month, according to a series of photos released by the Advanced Technology Research Institute at Chongqing University.“This is the first time humans have done biological growth experiments on the lunar surface,” said Xie Gengxin, who led the design of the experiment, on Tuesday.Plants have been grown previously on the International Space Station, but this is the first time a seed has sprouted on the moon. The ability to grow plants in space is seen as crucial for long-term space missions and establishing human outposts elsewhere in the solar system, such as Mars.Harvesting food in space, ideally using locally extracted water, would mean astronauts could survive for far longer without returning to Earth for supplies.The Chang’e 4 probe – named after the Chinese moon goddess – made the world’s first soft landing on the far side of the moon on 3 January, a major step in China’s ambitions to become a space superpower.Scientists from Chongqing University, who designed the “mini lunar biosphere” experiment, sent an 18cm bucket-like container holding air, water and soil.Inside are cotton, arabidopsis – a small, flowering plant of the mustard family – and potato seeds, as well as fruit-fly eggs and yeast.Images sent back by the probe show a cotton plant has grown well, but so far none of the other plants had sprouted, the university said.Chang’e 4 is also equipped with instruments developed by scientists from Sweden, Germany and China to study the lunar environment, cosmic radiation and the interaction between solar wind and the moon’s surface.The lander released a rover, nicknamed Yutu 2 (Jade Rabbit), that will perform experiments in the Von Kármán crater.The agency said four more lunar missions are planned, confirming the launch of Chang’e 5 by the end of the year, which will be the first probe to return samples of the moon to Earth since the 1970s.“Experts are still discussing and verifying the feasibility of subsequent projects, but it’s confirmed that there will be another three missions after Chang’e 5,” said Wu Yanhua, deputy head of the China National Space Administration (CNSA), at a press conference.According to Wu, the Chang’e 6 mission will be designed to bring samples back from the south pole of the moon and this will be followed by probes that will conduct comprehensive surveys of the area. The series of missions will also lay the groundwork for the construction of a lunar research base, possibly using 3D printing technology to build facilities.Wu also revealed that China will send a probe to Mars around 2020.",Giant leaf for mankind?

6255,"Say cheese, America. No, seriously, please start saying cheese at the grocery store. The country’s dairy farmers are depending on you.Americans eat an awful lot of cheese: almost 37lb per person, per year. Yet apparently that’s still not enough. Demand for American-made cheese is seriously falling behind supply. According to recent data from the Department of Agriculture, we’re currently experiencing a 1.4bn-pound cheese surplus.Lucas Fuess, director of dairy market intelligence at HighGround Dairy, a consulting firm, explains that cheese is literally sitting in cold storage facilities waiting for some aspiring pizza-maker to give it a home.“It’s normal to have some cheese in warehouses, to make sure there’s enough in the pipeline,” Fuess said. “The amount that’s in there currently is, if not a record, very close to record high.”In part this can be linked to lower dairy consumption and the growing popularity of veganism. Plant-based products such as almond-milk have experienced rapid sales growth.Since 2008, milk production has surged by 13%, but domestic demand for milk has dropped sharply. As demand decreases, the price of milk drops, and farmers receive less per gallon produced. This appears to have pushed farmers to produce even more milk to make up the shortfalls in their income, exacerbating the problem.Producing American cheese helps farmers to use up milk they can’t sell and that would otherwise go off. At the end of November 2018, US cheese production had grown yet again for the 67th consecutive month.But the problem is Americans are eating less cheese, too.American diets are moving away from processed cheeses like Velveeta and Kraft, and many of the nation’s leading fast and casual restaurants are trying new things. Panera, like others, has replaced American cheese in their sandwiches with a four-cheese combo made up of fontina, cheddar, monteau and smoked gouda.According to Euromonitor International, sales of processed cheese are projected to drop 1.6% this year, the fourth year in a row.In part, that’s because many Americans now think processed cheese is gross, but also because they’re au fait with quality cheese from around the world. It’s hard to turn back to an indestructible fluorescent orange mess once you’ve tried brie de meaux.“We’re seeing increased sales of more exotic, specialty, European-style cheeses. Some of those are made in the US; a lot of them aren’t,” Andrew Novakovic, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University told NPR this week. Since imported cheese costs more than domestic, a few blocks of the good stuff might not leave much left in the old cheese budget for anything else.The cheese mountain is crushing farmers. “We’ve seen record numbers of dairy farms close because milk prices are so low that dairy farms aren’t profitable any more,” Feueff added. “This cheese that is hanging over the market is preventing prices from raising higher and it’s reaching a critical level.”Trump’s trade policy has also played a role in the cheesepocalypse. In response to his tariffs, three top importers of US milk and cheese products – Mexico, Canada and China – have instituted retaliatory tariffs that will have a significant impact on American dairy farmers’ bottom line, according to a study from Texas A&M University.“As long as the tariffs are still on in Mexico, it remains a challenge to move cheese out of the country and move those stocks lower,” Fuess explained.It’s not the end of the line. Analysts have noted large buyers of cheese increasing offerings or finding new ways to use it. McDonald’s recently launched a breakfast sandwich with two slices of American cheese. “Fast-food companies are taking this opportunity with low cheese prices to increase cheese on their dishes,” says Fuess.For now though, American dairy farmers are going to continue to look for ways to offload their cheese supplies. “I was just reading stories of cheese tea in China that have kind of gone viral,” Fuess said. “Maybe we need to look into that.”",The big cheese mountain: America's stockpile nears record high,2019-01-10/13:50:47+0000,say cheese america no seriously please start saying cheese at the grocery store the country s dairy farmers are depending on you americans eat an awful lot of cheese almost lb per person per year yet apparently that s still not enough demand for american made cheese is seriously falling behind supply according to recent data from the department of agriculture we re currently experiencing a  bn pound cheese surplus lucas fuess director of dairy market intelligence at highground dairy a consulting firm explains that cheese is literally sitting in cold storage facilities waiting for some aspiring pizza maker to give it a home it s normal to have some cheese in warehouses to make sure there s enough in the pipeline fuess said the amount that s in there currently is if not a record very close to record high in part this can be linked to lower dairy consumption and the growing popularity of veganism plant based products such as almond milk have experienced rapid sales growth since  milk production has surged by  but domestic demand for milk has dropped sharply as demand decreases the price of milk drops and farmers receive less per gallon produced this appears to have pushed farmers to produce even more milk to make up the shortfalls in their income exacerbating the problem producing american cheese helps farmers to use up milk they can t sell and that would otherwise go off at the end of november  us cheese production had grown yet again for the th consecutive month but the problem is americans are eating less cheese too american diets are moving away from processed cheeses like velveeta and kraft and many of the nation s leading fast and casual restaurants are trying new things panera like others has replaced american cheese in their sandwiches with a four cheese combo made up of fontina cheddar monteau and smoked gouda according to euromonitor international sales of processed cheese are projected to drop   this year the fourth year in a row in part that s because many americans now think processed cheese is gross but also because they re au fait with quality cheese from around the world it s hard to turn back to an indestructible fluorescent orange mess once you ve tried brie de meaux we re seeing increased sales of more exotic specialty european style cheeses some of those are made in the us a lot of them aren t andrew novakovic a professor of agricultural economics at cornell university told npr this week since imported cheese costs more than domestic a few blocks of the good stuff might not leave much left in the old cheese budget for anything else the cheese mountain is crushing farmers we ve seen record numbers of dairy farms close because milk prices are so low that dairy farms aren t profitable any more feueff added this cheese that is hanging over the market is preventing prices from raising higher and it s reaching a critical level trump s trade policy has also played a role in the cheesepocalypse in response to his tariffs three top importers of us milk and cheese products mexico canada and china have instituted retaliatory tariffs that will have a significant impact on american dairy farmers bottom line according to a study from texas a m university as long as the tariffs are still on in mexico it remains a challenge to move cheese out of the country and move those stocks lower fuess explained it s not the end of the line analysts have noted large buyers of cheese increasing offerings or finding new ways to use it mcdonald s recently launched a breakfast sandwich with two slices of american cheese fast food companies are taking this opportunity with low cheese prices to increase cheese on their dishes says fuess for now though american dairy farmers are going to continue to look for ways to offload their cheese supplies i was just reading stories of cheese tea in china that have kind of gone viral fuess said maybe we need to look into that ,Boeing Crisis,0.19463758170604706
6264,"Russia has confirmed a fireball that streaked through the sky above New Zealand on Saturday was one of its early warning satellites burning up as it re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere.The satellite’s dramatic descent was captured by TV cameras covering a cricket match between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Mount Maunganui, New Zealand. The match commentator suggested it was a “meteor shower”.Russia’s Aerospace Forces said the Kosmos 2430 missile early warning satellite, designed to detect intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches, was guided out of orbit as part of a planned operation on Saturday.“The satellite burned up completely in the dense atmosphere above the Atlantic Ocean at a height of around 100km,” Aerospace Forces said, adding that its re-entry had been under control at all times. It said the early warning satellite had been non-operational since 2012.

6345,"An extra 25,000 flights a year could come through Heathrow before the third runway is built, in plans revealed by the airport as it launched a fresh consultation over its airspace and operations.Planes could come in to land on both runways at the same time during busy periods, Heathrow has proposed, to help maximise its capacity ahead of expansion.The plans, requiring planning approval but tacitly backed through government support for increased aircraft capacity, would involve lifting the current cap to more than 500,000 flights a year. New areas of London would be brought under Heathrow flight paths for the first time.The airport will also start to sketch out where planes will fill the skies after the third runway opens, potentially as early as 2026.In a separate consultation last year, most respondents rejected the idea of concentrating more planes over the same area and asked the airport to vary flight paths, which is likely to affect thousands more homes.However, more distant areas under flight paths, such as parts of south-east London, could get some respite.John Stewart, of the Heathrow noise reduction campaigning group Hacan, said: “Although a third runway will clearly bring many losers, one long-lasting impact of these proposed changes is that a break from aircraft noise would be guaranteed to many more people than who currently enjoy it, as Heathrow would make the biggest changes to its flight paths since opening in 1946.”The consultation will ask how to alternate runways to best manage respite from noise, including on night flights.Heathrow has agreed to a six-and-a-half hour night flight ban, which could mean the first planes touch down as late as 5.30am, if it was to use two runways, or 5.15am if using just one.Emma Gilthorpe, Heathrow’s executive director for expansion, said the airport was committed to delivering the third runway scheme responsibly and urged local residents to have their say. She said: “It is crucial that our plans maximise the benefits of expansion across the country, including for the communities closest to us.”Councils for neighbouring communities are joined in a legal challenge to the third runway, one of five applications for judicial review of the decision to expand Heathrow that are due to be heard in the high court in March.","Heathrow may add 25,000 flights a year before third runway",2019-01-08/08:00:04+0000,an extra   flights a year could come through heathrow before the third runway is built in plans revealed by the airport as it launched a fresh consultation over its airspace and operations planes could come in to land on both runways at the same time during busy periods heathrow has proposed to help maximise its capacity ahead of expansion the plans requiring planning approval but tacitly backed through government support for increased aircraft capacity would involve lifting the current cap to more than   flights a year new areas of london would be brought under heathrow flight paths for the first time the airport will also start to sketch out where planes will fill the skies after the third runway opens potentially as early as  in a separate consultation last year most respondents rejected the idea of concentrating more planes over the same area and asked the airport to vary flight paths which is likely to affect thousands more homes however more distant areas under flight paths such as parts of south east london could get some respite john stewart of the heathrow noise reduction campaigning group hacan said although a third runway will clearly bring many losers one long lasting impact of these proposed changes is that a break from aircraft noise would be guaranteed to many more people than who currently enjoy it as heathrow would make the biggest changes to its flight paths since opening in  the consultation will ask how to alternate runways to best manage respite from noise including on night flights heathrow has agreed to a six and a half hour night flight ban which could mean the first planes touch down as late as  am if it was to use two runways or  am if using just one emma gilthorpe heathrow s executive director for expansion said the airport was committed to delivering the third runway scheme responsibly and urged local residents to have their say she said it is crucial that our plans maximise the benefits of expansion across the country including for the communities closest to us councils for neighbouring communities are joined in a legal challenge to the third runway one of five applications for judicial review of the decision to expand heathrow that are due to be heard in the high court in march ,Boeing Crisis,0.22681474685668945
6413,"Nasa rejected it as too difficult and costly an undertaking. Last week, China declared “mission accomplished” after landing a spacecraft, Chang’e-4, on the far side of the moon.It was a remarkable endeavour. As the far side of the moon never faces the Earth, mission control cannot communicate directly with the spacecraft, but only via an orbiting satellite. The terrain is more broken and cratered than the near side, so landing a craft is that much more difficult. Even Nasa was impressed: “a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment!”, the administrator tweeted.Yet mixed with admiration was trepidation. China, a latecomer to the space race, is now beginning to threaten the supremacy of America and Russia. Almost every report on Chang’e-4’s mission declared it a “propaganda coup” for China. That it certainly is and one that Beijing will fully exploit. But then Russia and America have long played their space exploration programmes for propaganda purposes.“The Soviet Union has made this a test of the system,” President Kennedy told a meeting on Nasa funding in 1962. “So that’s why we’re doing it… Everything that we do ought to really be tied into getting on to the moon ahead of the Russians.”Space exploration has long been fuelled by a mixture of humanistic dreams, technological leaps and tawdry politicsFrom the beginning, the space race was intimately bound up with the needs of the cold war. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first human craft to orbit the Earth. Four years later, Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space. It was, Nikita Khrushchev claimed, “the greatest triumph of the immortal Lenin’s ideas”.Where Russians exulted, Americans despaired. The New York Times was terrified that “neutral nations may come to believe the wave of the future is Russian”. “Continued Soviet superiority in space might undermine US prestige,” reported the National Security Council. As news filtered through of Gagarin’s flight, Kennedy sent a memo to Vice-president Lyndon B Johnson. “Is there any… space programme which promises dramatic results in which we could win?” it plaintively asked.The answer, the two men decided, was a manned moon landing. The following month, Kennedy demanded of Congress that it provided funds to enable “this nation [to] commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon”.Eight years later, on 21 July 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to tread on the moon. Their journey may have been fuelled in part by cold war desperation, but it was also an extraordinary triumph of knowledge and will, an act of the technological sublime.Once America was satisfied that the Soviet Union had been put in its place, space exploration became politically less important. Manned moon missions ended in 1972. Nasa was normalised into a regular government technology programme.As America downgraded its space ambitions, Chinese aspirations took flight. In 1992, the Chinese government approved the Shenzhou manned spaceflight programme. Eleven years later, Yang Liwei became the first Chinese astronaut in space.America barred China from participating in the International Space Station (ISS). In 2011, China launched the first of two prototypes of its own space station. It plans to launch the core module of a permanent space station, Tianhe, by 2020. The ISS is due to be retired by 2028; China may then have the only functioning orbiting station. By the end of that decade, Beijing aims to be the dominant force in space exploration. There will be many more “propaganda coups”.Fears about Chinese ambitions have been heightened by the changing context of the space race. In the 1960s, America was willing to throw whatever resources were necessary to achieve its cold war goals. Today, Nasa is unsure of its purpose and America less committed to funding it. During the cold war, America feared the Soviet Union, but was determined to thwart Moscow’s aims. Today, American apprehension stems from the worry that China’s emergence as the dominant global force cannot be checked, nor Beijing’s brutal despotism challenged. As liberal democracy frays in the west and authoritarian capitalism becomes entrenched in the east, self-doubt shapes US attitudes to China.Space exploration has long been fuelled by a mixture of humanistic dreams, technological leaps and tawdry politics. The Chang’e-4 mission is no different. How the space race will play out over the next decade, and what role China will adopt in global politics, remains uncertain. In the meantime, let us celebrate our new perspective of the dark side of the moon.• Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist.",Power politics always drives space conquest.

6445,"Herb Kelleher, the co-founder of Southwest Airlines and pioneer of low-cost aviation, “without whom there would be no Ryanair”, has died aged 87.Kelleher set up his budget carrier in Texas more than 50 years ago and changed the face of flying, stripping back costs and inflight services, opening up air travel to a wider range of people.His biggest legacy for Europe may have been as a mentor for Michael O’Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, who flew to Dallas, where Southwest is based, in the 1980s to learn how to run a no-frills airline.Following news of Kelleher’s death on Friday, O’Leary credited the extraordinary growth of the Dublin-based carrier to the lessons of his mentor.“Herb was the grand master Yoda of the low-fare airlines. He was the leader, the visionary and the teacher: without Herb, there would be no Ryanair, and no low-fares airlines anywhere,” he said.“His passing is a sad day for low-fare airlines and sales of Wild Turkey bourbon.”Kelleher had gained publicity from the beginning by promising the lowest fares to customers, or compensating them with a bottle of whiskey if they believed they had paid more than a rival would have charged.Southwest became an industry powerhouse, a brand infused with the colourful, unconventional personality of its boss. The airline’s first flight was in June 1971, and it grew to fly more passengers around the US than any other carrier, spawning a host of imitators at home and worldwide.In a statement announcing his death, Southwest said Kelleher had “revolutionised commercial aviation and democratised the skies”.The company added: “Herb’s passion, zest for life and insatiable investment in relationships made lasting and immeasurable impressions on all who knew him, and will forever be the bedrock and esprit de corps of Southwest Airlines.”As well as his business nous, Kelleher was known for his extrovert antics and flair for a memorable marketing ploy. When executives of other airlines dismissed Southwest as cattle class for the cheap traveller, Kelleher responded with a TV advert featuring his head covered by a paper bag that he promised to give to any potential customer too embarrassed to be seen flying on his airline.On another occasion, when Southwest and a rival company were battling to use the same slogan, Kelleher challenged its chief executive to arm-wrestle for the rights. Kelleher turned up in red shorts, lost, but kept using the slogan, with his rival grateful for the publicity Kelleher hadgenerated for both airlines.Southwest’s current chief executive, Gary Kelly, described working alongside Kelleher as “one of the greatest joys of my life … He challenged people and he kept us laughing all the way”.Southwest, like the budget carriers that came to emulate it, focused on short-haul flights from point to point, rather than connecting flights and building hub-and-spoke networks as its rivals did.It pared back inflight service, in the days when airlines promoted the glamour and luxury of cabin life, and used a single model of aircraft, the Boeing 737, to cut costs. Southwest ripped up the blueprint by getting rid of assigned seats, and flew from smaller, secondary airports to minimise costs and delays.While rivals derided its model, Southwest was making a profit by 1973 and has stayed in the black ever since, an unparalleled streak in an industry known for losses and bankruptcies.Kelleher became Southwest’s chairman in 1978 and chief executive in 1982, eventually taking a back seat as emeritus chairman in 2001, two years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. But he remained on the payroll and went to the office regularly.A law graduate from New York, Kelleher’s low-cost mantra apparently did not extend to stinting on his employees’ wages. He said his people were crucial to the company’s success, to ensure friendly customer service whether the flight was budget or not.In a 2011 interview, Kelleher said his proudest achievement was that, in an industry where tens of thousands of jobs were lost after September 11, Southwest never made its workers redundant.Fly one type of planeWhile manufacturers led by Boeing and Airbus tout models for every range and route, potentially maximising the efficiency per passenger, Kelleher decided it was far simpler and more cost-effective to pick one plane and build a network around it, keeping down engineering, maintenance and pilot training costs. He chose the Boeing 737 – as did Ryanair. EasyJet went for the Airbus A320 family.Drive down costs every yearA laser-like focus on the bottom line put Southwest in pole position, and Ryanair has continued that obsession – although as both have become more established and dominant in their respective markets, Scrooge-ish excess has been downplayed.Turn around aircraft as quickly as possibleSweating the assets is crucial when a new plane costs $50m-$100m. The longer the plane is in the sky, the more it earns. Low-cost carriers will now routinely spend as little as 25 minutes on the tarmac between flights – with easyJet executives sometimes seen carrying a bin bag down the plane aisle before landing to help cut cleaning time.Concentrate on selling seats firstThe science of dynamic pricing has evolved, with fares starting as low as needed to fill the planes.

6491,"A Chinese spacecraft could shortly become the first ever to land on the “far side” of the moon, in a milestone for human space exploration. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) is aiming to land the craft in the unexplored South Pole-Aitken basin, the largest, oldest, deepest, crater on the moon’s surface.Early reports of a successful landing by the robotic probe, Chang’e 4, ended in confusion after state-run media China Daily and CGTN deleted tweets celebrating a successful mission. China Daily’s tweet said: '“China’s Chang’e 4 landed on the moon’s far side, inaugurating a new chapter in mankind’s lunar exploration history.” At the weekend, the probe entered an elliptical path around the moon, drawing as close as 15km (9 miles) from the surface. China’s mission control has not confirmed a time for the touchdown attempt but reports in state-run media suggested it would be early Thursday morning UK time.Spacecraft have taken pictures of the moon’s far side before, but no lander has ever touched down there. If successful, Chang’e will mark a step towards China’s ambition to become a leading power in space exploration alongside the US and Russia.One technological hurdle in targeting the side of the moon that constantly faces away from Earth is that direct communication with the spacecraft is not possible. Instead messages to and from Chang’e 4 are being relayed by the Queqiao (Magpie Bridge) satellite, which is in a “halo orbit” on the other side of the moon.The mission is aiming to take detailed measurements of the moon’s terrain and mineral composition. The Aitken basin is thought to have been formed during a gigantic collision very early in the moon’s history. The collision is likely to have thrown up material from the moon’s interior, meaning that Chang’e could provide new clues as to how the natural satellite was formed.The far side of the moon is also viewed as an attractive site for radio astronomy. A telescope situated there would be shielded from human radio activity, potentially making it more sensitive to radio bursts coming from the sun or to faint signals from deep space. Chang’e 4 is carrying an instrument to judge the “electromagnetic cleanliness” of the location as a first step to assessing the possibility of placing a telescope there.Lucie Green, a space scientist at University College London, said: “You’re completely shielded from all the emissions that we produce on Earth so you can get data that we couldn’t get elsewhere,. There’s been a lot of talk over the years of the potential of having a telescope on the far side. This mission could pave the way for more serious development on that side.”Since the moon’s revolution cycle is the same as its rotation cycle, the same side of the planetary body always faces Earth. The other face, most of which cannot be seen from Earth, is called the far side or “dark side” of the moon, not because it is dark but because most of it is uncharted.",China holds breath as probe prepares to land on far side of moon,2019-01-03/03:53:42+0000,a chinese spacecraft could shortly become the first ever to land on the far side of the moon in a milestone for human space exploration the china national space administration cnsa is aiming to land the craft in the unexplored south pole aitken basin the largest oldest deepest crater on the moon s surface early reports of a successful landing by the robotic probe chang e  ended in confusion after state run media china daily and cgtn deleted tweets celebrating a successful mission china daily s tweet said china s chang e  landed on the moon s far side inaugurating a new chapter in mankind s lunar exploration history at the weekend the probe entered an elliptical path around the moon drawing as close as km  miles from the surface china s mission control has not confirmed a time for the touchdown attempt but reports in state run media suggested it would be early thursday morning uk time spacecraft have taken pictures of the moon s far side before but no lander has ever touched down there if successful chang e will mark a step towards china s ambition to become a leading power in space exploration alongside the us and russia one technological hurdle in targeting the side of the moon that constantly faces away from earth is that direct communication with the spacecraft is not possible instead messages to and from chang e  are being relayed by the queqiao magpie bridge satellite which is in a halo orbit on the other side of the moon the mission is aiming to take detailed measurements of the moon s terrain and mineral composition the aitken basin is thought to have been formed during a gigantic collision very early in the moon s history the collision is likely to have thrown up material from the moon s interior meaning that chang e could provide new clues as to how the natural satellite was formed the far side of the moon is also viewed as an attractive site for radio astronomy a telescope situated there would be shielded from human radio activity potentially making it more sensitive to radio bursts coming from the sun or to faint signals from deep space chang e  is carrying an instrument to judge the electromagnetic cleanliness of the location as a first step to assessing the possibility of placing a telescope there lucie green a space scientist at university college london said you re completely shielded from all the emissions that we produce on earth so you can get data that we couldn t get elsewhere there s been a lot of talk over the years of the potential of having a telescope on the far side this mission could pave the way for more serious development on that side since the moon s revolution cycle is the same as its rotation cycle the same side of the planetary body always faces earth the other face most of which cannot be seen from earth is called the far side or dark side of the moon not because it is dark but because most of it is uncharted ,Boeing Crisis,0.24863554537296295
6563,"A new generation of autonomous weapons or “killer robots” could accidentally start a war or cause mass atrocities, a former top Google software engineer has warned.Laura Nolan, who resigned from Google last year in protest at being sent to work on a project to dramatically enhance US military drone technology, has called for all AI killing machines not operated by humans to be banned.Nolan said killer robots not guided by human remote control should be outlawed by the same type of international treaty that bans chemical weapons.Unlike drones, which are controlled by military teams often thousands of miles away from where the flying weapon is being deployed, Nolan said killer robots have the potential to do “calamitous things that they were not originally programmed for”.There is no suggestion that Google is involved in the development of autonomous weapons systems. Last month a UN panel of government experts debated autonomous weapons and found Google to be eschewing AI for use in weapons systems and engaging in best practice.Nolan, who has joined the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and has briefed UN diplomats in New York and Geneva over the dangers posed by autonomous weapons, said: “The likelihood of a disaster is in proportion to how many of these machines will be in a particular area at once. What you are looking at are possible atrocities and unlawful killings even under laws of warfare, especially if hundreds or thousands of these machines are deployed.“There could be large-scale accidents because these things will start to behave in unexpected ways. Which is why any advanced weapons systems should be subject to meaningful human control, otherwise they have to be banned because they are far too unpredictable and dangerous.”Google recruited Nolan, a computer science graduate from Trinity College Dublin, to work on Project Maven in 2017 after she had been employed by the tech giant for four years, becoming one of its top software engineers in Ireland.She said she became “increasingly ethically concerned” over her role in the Maven programme, which was devised to help the US Department of Defense drastically speed up drone video recognition technology.Instead of using large numbers of military operatives to spool through hours and hours of drone video footage of potential enemy targets, Nolan and others were asked to build a system where AI machines could differentiate people and objects at an infinitely faster rate.Google allowed the Project Maven contract to lapse in March this year after more than 3,000 of its employees signed a petition in protest against the company’s involvement.“As a site reliability engineer my expertise at Google was to ensure that our systems and infrastructures were kept running, and this is what I was supposed to help Maven with. Although I was not directly involved in speeding up the video footage recognition I realised that I was still part of the kill chain; that this would ultimately lead to more people being targeted and killed by the US military in places like Afghanistan.”Although she resigned over Project Maven, Nolan has predicted that autonomous weapons being developed pose a far greater risk to the human race than remote-controlled drones.She outlined how external forces ranging from changing weather systems to machines being unable to work out complex human behaviour might throw killer robots off course, with possibly fatal consequences.“You could have a scenario where autonomous weapons that have been sent out to do a job confront unexpected radar signals in an area they are searching; there could be weather that was not factored into its software or they come across a group of armed men who appear to be insurgent enemies but in fact are out with guns hunting for food. The machine doesn’t have the discernment or common sense that the human touch has.“The other scary thing about these autonomous war systems is that you can only really test them by deploying them in a real combat zone. Maybe that’s happening with the Russians at present in Syria, who knows? What we do know is that at the UN Russia has opposed any treaty let alone ban on these weapons by the way.“If you are testing a machine that is making its own decisions about the world around it then it has to be in real time. Besides, how do you train a system that runs solely on software how to detect subtle human behaviour or discern the difference between hunters and insurgents? How does the killing machine out there on its own flying about distinguish between the 18-year-old combatant and the 18-year-old who is hunting for rabbits?”The ability to convert military drones, for instance into autonomous non-human guided weapons, “is just a software problem these days and one that can be relatively easily solved”, said Nolan.She said she wanted the Irish government to take a more robust line in supporting a ban on such weapons.“I am not saying that missile-guided systems or anti-missile defence systems should be banned. They are after all under full human control and someone is ultimately accountable. These autonomous weapons however are an ethical as well as a technological step change in warfare. Very few people are talking about this but if we are not careful one or more of these weapons, these killer robots, could accidentally start a flash war, destroy a nuclear power station and cause mass atrocities.” Some of the autonomous weapons being developed by military powers around the world include:The US navy’s AN-2 Anaconda gunboat, which is being developed as a “completely autonomous watercraft equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities” and can “loiter in an area for long periods of time without human intervention”.Russia’s T-14 Armata tank, which is being worked on to make it completely unmanned and autonomous. It is being designed to respond to incoming fire independent of any tank crew inside.The US Pentagon has hailed the Sea Hunter autonomous warship as a major advance in robotic warfare.

nolan who resigned from google last year in protest at being sent to work on a project to dramatically enhance us military drone technology has called for all ai killing machines not operated by humans to be banned nolan said killer robots not guided by human remote control should be outlawed by the same type of international treaty that bans chemical weapons unlike drones which are controlled by military teams often thousands of miles away from where the flying weapon is being deployed nolan said killer robots have the potential to do calamitous things that they were not originally programmed for there is no suggestion that google is involved in the development of autonomous weapons systems last month a un panel of government experts debated autonomous weapons and found google to be eschewing ai for use in weapons systems and engaging in best practice nolan who has joined the campaign to stop killer robots and has briefed un diplomats in new york and geneva over the dangers posed by autonomous weapons said the likelihood of a disaster is in proportion to how many of these machines will be in a particular area at once what you are looking at are possible atrocities and unlawful killings even under laws of warfare especially if hundreds or thousands of these machines are deployed there could be large scale accidents because these things will start to behave in unexpected ways which is why any advanced weapons systems should be subject to meaningful human control otherwise they have to be banned because they are far too unpredictable and dangerous google recruited nolan a computer science graduate from trinity college dublin to work on project maven in  after she had been employed by the tech giant for four years becoming one of its top software engineers in ireland she said she became increasingly ethically concerned over her role in the maven programme which was devised to help the us department of defense drastically speed up drone video recognition technology instead of using large numbers of military operatives to spool through hours and hours of drone video footage of potential enemy targets nolan and others were asked to build a system where ai machines could differentiate people and objects at an infinitely faster rate google allowed the project maven contract to lapse in march this year after more than   of its employees signed a petition in protest against the company s involvement as a site reliability engineer my expertise at google was to ensure that our systems and infrastructures were kept running and this is what i was supposed to help maven with although i was not directly involved in speeding up the video footage recognition i realised that i was still part of the kill chain that this would ultimately lead to more people being targeted and killed by the us military in places like afghanistan although she resigned over project maven nolan has predicted that autonomous weapons being developed pose a far greater risk to the human race than remote controlled drones she outlined how external forces ranging from changing weather systems to machines being unable to work out complex human behaviour might throw killer robots off course with possibly fatal consequences you could have a scenario where autonomous weapons that have been sent out to do a job confront unexpected radar signals in an area they are searching there could be weather that was not factored into its software or they come across a group of armed men who appear to be insurgent enemies but in fact are out with guns hunting for food the machine doesn t have the discernment or common sense that the human touch has the other scary thing about these autonomous war systems is that you can only really test them by deploying them in a real combat zone maybe that s happening with the russians at present in syria who knows what we do know is that at the un russia has opposed any treaty let alone ban on these weapons by the way if you are testing a machine that is making its own decisions about the world around it then it has to be in real time besides how do you train a system that runs solely on software how to detect subtle human behaviour or discern the difference between hunters and insurgents how does the killing machine out there on its own flying about distinguish between the  year old combatant and the  year old who is hunting for rabbits the ability to convert military drones for instance into autonomous non human guided weapons is just a software problem these days and one that can be relatively easily solved said nolan she said she wanted the irish government to take a more robust line in supporting a ban on such weapons i am not saying that missile guided systems or anti missile defence systems should be banned they are after all under full human control and someone is ultimately accountable these autonomous weapons however are an ethical as well as a technological step change in warfare very few people are talking about this but if we are not careful one or more of these weapons these killer robots could accidentally start a flash war destroy a nuclear power station and cause mass atrocities some of the autonomous weapons being developed by military powers around the world include the us navy s an  anaconda gunboat which is being developed as a completely autonomous watercraft equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities and can loiter in an area for long periods of time without human intervention russia s t  armata tank which is being worked on to make it completely unmanned and autonomous it is being designed to respond to incoming fire independent of any tank crew inside the us pentagon has hailed the sea hunter autonomous warship as a

6791,"The New York-area helicopter company involved in a March 2018 crash that left five dead has allowed passengers’ dogs on to its controversial “doors-off” flights, spurring criticism from two area US senators, who derided it as “repugnant” and “cruel”.FlyNYON, the helicopter charter company, was engaging in a “brazen marketing campaign to bait more customers aboard by including new incentives to strap in your dog” on helicopter flights with the doors removed or opened, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said on Sunday.Flights above Manhattan in open-door helicopters have become popular with people excited by posting daring pictures on social media, including so-called “shoe selfies”, images of their feet over the edge of the helicopter with parts of the famous city skyline beneath. It was a similar “doors-off” flight that killed all the passengers aboard last year. Initial reports suggested a bag strap had activated the fuel shut-off to the engine.Schumer said: “It is outrageous that despite the death of five innocent people in a dangerous doors-off chopper flight and two active federal investigations into lapsed safety that FlyNYON is still operating those same flights at desperate discounts.”He continued: “But now, it is a sheer jaw-drop to know that the same company is strapping in dogs for people to snap pictures of while the animals all but dangle high above New York skies, experiencing the sound of the rotors and who knows what other cruel things.”FlyNYON does operate some trips. However, the fatal flight in March 2018 was operated by another company that FlyNYON had booked.Schumer said: “Strapping in dogs for dangerous doors-off flights over New York is just totally repugnant; another disaster in waiting.”New Jersey’s Democratic senator Bob Menendez also weighed in. He said: “These helicopter flights are not just a worry on the ground, but, after a series of deadly crashes, they’re a potential death trap in the sky.”He said: “The idea that passengers and their pets are being strapped in and dangled out of open doors hundreds of feet above ground without strong safeguards in place is astonishing.”The senators said FlyNYON was benefiting from a safety “loophole” by saying it flies “aerial photography” helicopter flights. Because “aerial photography” flights are for industry, not tourists, FlyNYON can continue with doors-off flights amid the federal investigation, they said.Schumer and Menendez said FlyNYON social media posts relating to “flying dogs” show that the company’s customers are normal people – not professionals who need aerial photographs.“We’ve teamed up with our friends over at Pilots N Paws [a pet rescue non-profit] to help pups find new homes! We’re offering 40% off all our flights with a portion of the proceeds going towards their organization!” said one recent Facebook post by FlyNYON flagged by the senators. “Use code PILOTSNPAWS at checkout to save 40%!”A 42-second promotional video that no longer appears to be available online shows a dog riding above New York City in an open-door FlyNYON helicopter flight. The video ends with the FlyNYON and Pilots N Paws logo.Since about summer 2018, photos and video of at least two other dogs on FlyNYON flights have appeared on social media.FlyNYON released a statement on Twitter, saying it was focused on fundraising.It said: “The facts are simple. Today, we are focused on raising money to help these animals and their human partners that are on the frontline of supporting recovery efforts like those of Hurricane Dorian, not trying to score political points.“FlyNyon is fully compliant with all FAA operating and safety standards. We appreciate and stand ready to support smart actions that allow for enhanced helicopter safety in New York and New Jersey.”",New York: senators condemn company's doors-off helicopter rides for dogs,2019-09-09/13:15:29,the new york area helicopter company involved in a march  crash that left five dead has allowed passengers dogs on to its controversial doors off flights spurring criticism from two area us senators who derided it as repugnant and cruel flynyon the helicopter charter company was engaging in a brazen marketing campaign to bait more customers aboard by including new incentives to strap in your dog on helicopter flights with the doors removed or opened the senate minority leader chuck schumer said on sunday flights above manhattan in open door helicopters have become popular with people excited by posting daring pictures on social media including so called shoe selfies images of their feet over the edge of the helicopter with parts of the famous city skyline beneath it was a similar doors off flight that killed all the passengers aboard last year initial reports suggested a bag strap had activated the fuel shut off to the engine schumer said it is outrageous that despite the death of five innocent people in a dangerous doors off chopper flight and two active federal investigations into lapsed safety that flynyon is still operating those same flights at desperate discounts he continued but now it is a sheer jaw drop to know that the same company is strapping in dogs for people to snap pictures of while the animals all but dangle high above new york skies experiencing the sound of the rotors and who knows what other cruel things flynyon does operate some trips however the fatal flight in march  was operated by another company that flynyon had booked schumer said strapping in dogs for dangerous doors off flights over new york is just totally repugnant another disaster in waiting new jersey s democratic senator bob menendez also weighed in he said these helicopter flights are not just a worry on the ground but after a series of deadly crashes they re a potential death trap in the sky he said the idea that passengers and their pets are being strapped in and dangled out of open doors hundreds of feet above ground without strong safeguards in place is astonishing the senators said flynyon was benefiting from a safety loophole by saying it flies aerial photography helicopter flights because aerial photography flights are for industry not tourists flynyon can continue with doors off flights amid the federal investigation they said schumer and menendez said flynyon social media posts relating to flying dogs show that the company s customers are normal people not professionals who need aerial photographs we ve teamed up with our friends over at pilots n paws a pet rescue non profit to help pups find new homes we re offering  off all our flights with a portion of the proceeds going towards their organization said one recent facebook post by flynyon flagged by the senators use code pilotsnpaws at checkout to save  a  second promotional video that no longer appears to be available online shows a dog riding above new york city in an open door flynyon helicopter flight the video ends with the flynyon and pilots n paws logo since about summer  photos and video of at least two other dogs on flynyon flights have appeared on social media flynyon released a statement on twitter saying it was focused on fundraising it said the facts are simple today we are focused on raising money to help these animals and their human partners that are on the frontline of supporting recovery efforts like those of hurricane dorian not trying to score political points flynyon is fully compliant with all faa operating and safety standards we appreciate and stand ready to support smart actions that allow for enhanced helicopter safety in new york and new jersey ,Boeing Crisis,0.26062873005867004

She takes the horse to the movies, grocery shopping and even to her doctor’s appointments.Flirty, who has a popular Instagram page and Twitter account, is described by his human handler as a “psych & mobility service horse”, and according to American Airlines is in fact a trained service animal. Hensley suffers from a variety of ailments including: depression, severe anxiety, panic disorder and PTSD.But not everyone is friendly to Flirty. Hensley told the news station that she had been kicked out of stores twice and was “treated so poorly” by the managers. She said she was looking into pursuing legal action against the businesses.Besides dogs, miniature horses who have been “individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities” are the only other service animals the Department of Justice deems protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

7205,"Evidence recovered from beneath the bitter cold of Canada’s Arctic Ocean will shed new light on the final days the ill-fated expedition of the British polar explorer Sir John Franklin, who disappeared with his crew in 1845.Parks Canada and Inuit researchers announced on Wednesday the results of a study of the HMS Terror – including “groundbreaking” new images from within the incredibly well-preserved ship – and raised the possibility that logs and maps have remained intact and legible after nearly 170 years underwater.Over several weeks in early August, the researchers launched 3D-mapping technology to survey the wreck site off the the coast of King William Island in Nunavut.For the first time ever, the team was also able to make seven trips inside the ship by piloting a remotely operated vehicle through the ship. Nearly 90% of the ship’s lower deck – including the areas where the crew ate and slept – were accessible to the vehicle. In total, the expedition was able to study 20 separate rooms.“The impression we witnessed when exploring the HMS Terror is of a ship only recently deserted by its crew, seemingly forgotten by the passage of time,” said Ryan Harris, a senior archeologist for Parks Canada, in a statement.In 1845, the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror departed England in search of the coveted Northwest Passage. But the famed and closely watched expedition ended in disaster, with all 129 crew members succumbing to the hostile elements of the Arctic.Recent excavations on nearby islands suggest a combination of scurvy, hypothermia – and potentially cannibalism – killed the crew after they abandoned the two stranded vessels. Multiple expeditions to recover the ships and the remains of the crew proved futile.For generations, Inuit oral history has told of the two wrecked ships and stranded sailors. Long ignored by western archaeologists, the history was vindicated when Inuit historians helped uncover the final resting sites of the Erebus in 2014, and the Terror in 2016.Since the monumental discovery, Parks Canada has set about studying both ships in detail, with the aim of better understanding the lives of those aboard – and the final months of the voyage.From within the wreck, Capt Francis Crozier’s cabin remains the most intact. Only his sleeping quarters, which are behind a shut door, are inaccessible.The location itself, beneath the frigid Arctic waters, has been critical to preserving much of the ship. The water temperature, and lack of natural light, has prevented the degradation many of the items, including crockery and and navigation too. Most exciting for the researchers is the prospect that thick sediment, low in oxygen, has preserved documentation within the ship, including logbooks and maps.“Not only are the furniture and cabinets in place, drawers are closed and many are buried in silt, encapsulating objects and documents in the best possible conditions for their survival,” said Marc-André Bernier, the head of Parks Canada’s underwater archaeology department, in a statement. “Each drawer and other enclosed space will be a treasure trove of unprecedented information on the fate of the Franklin Expedition.”Any items retrieved from the expedition will be shared between the governments of Canada and Inuit, the result of a recent agreement between the two groups. Before publicly announcing the most recent discovered, community members of Gjoa Haven, including young students, were the first to view images of the wreck.Parks Canada plans has set up devices to monitor the flow of the water nearby to the Terror, and is now studying the Erebus. The team hopes their survey of the site until early September before the annual formation of autumn sea ice.",'Frozen in time' wreck sheds new light on Franklin's ill-fated 1845 Arctic quest,2019-08-28/19:34:57,evidence recovered from beneath the bitter cold of canada s arctic ocean will shed new light on the final days the ill fated expedition of the british polar explorer sir john franklin who disappeared with his crew in  parks canada and inuit researchers announced on wednesday the results of a study of the hms terror including groundbreaking new images from within the incredibly well preserved ship and raised the possibility that logs and maps have remained intact and legible after nearly  years underwater over several weeks in early august the researchers launched d mapping technology to survey the wreck site off the the coast of king william island in nunavut for the first time ever the team was also able to make seven trips inside the ship by piloting a remotely operated vehicle through the ship nearly  of the ship s lower deck including the areas where the crew ate and slept were accessible to the vehicle in total the expedition was able to study  separate rooms the impression we witnessed when exploring the hms terror is of a ship only recently deserted by its crew seemingly forgotten by the passage of time said ryan harris a senior archeologist for parks canada in a statement in  the hms erebus and hms terror departed england in search of the coveted northwest passage but the famed and closely watched expedition ended in disaster with all  crew members succumbing to the hostile elements of the arctic recent excavations on nearby islands suggest a combination of scurvy hypothermia and potentially cannibalism killed the crew after they abandoned the two stranded vessels multiple expeditions to recover the ships and the remains of the crew proved futile for generations inuit oral history has told of the two wrecked ships and stranded sailors long ignored by western archaeologists the history was vindicated when inuit historians helped uncover the final resting sites of the erebus in  and the terror in  since the monumental discovery parks canada has set about studying both ships in detail with the aim of better understanding the lives of those aboard and the final months of the voyage from within the wreck capt francis crozier s cabin remains the most intact only his sleeping quarters which are behind a shut door are inaccessible the location itself beneath the frigid arctic waters has been critical to preserving much of the ship the water temperature and lack of natural light has prevented the degradation many of the items including crockery and and navigation too most exciting for the researchers is the prospect that thick sediment low in oxygen has preserved documentation within the ship including logbooks and maps not only are the furniture and cabinets in place drawers are closed and many are buried in silt encapsulating objects and documents in the best possible conditions for their survival said marc andré bernier the head of parks canada s underwater archaeology department in a statement each drawer and other enclosed space will be a treasure trove of unprecedented information on the fate of the franklin expedition any items retrieved from the expedition will be shared between the governments of canada and inuit the result of a recent agreement between the two groups before publicly announcing the most recent discovered community members of gjoa haven including young students were the first to view images of the wreck parks canada plans has set up devices to monitor the flow of the water nearby to the terror and is now studying the erebus the team hopes their survey of the site until early september before the annual formation of autumn sea ice ,Boeing Crisis,0.13415078818798065

7308,"Airline punctuality at Britain’s airports has plummeted, with the number of hour-long delays on Ryanair and Easyjet flights doubling in the last five years, according to research by Which?.It named Stansted as the UK’s worst airport for delays, with 10% of all flights taking off an hour or more late, while Heathrow was best, at 4%. Ryanair saw the worst deterioration in punctuality of any major airline in the Which? survey, with 7.8% of its flights suffering a delay of one hour or more in 2018, compared with 3% in 2014.Thomas Cook Airlines was worst overall, with 11.5% of its flights delayed, while Dutch carrier KLM was the best.The budget airlines rejected the findings, saying they were the victims of air traffic control delays, extreme weather conditions and strikes.But Which? said both airports and airlines had failed to match the rapid growth in the number of flights with the resources needed to handle an increase in traffic.It analysed 10m flights, and estimated that last year alone 17 million passengers were affected by delays, but most passengers were not entitled to compensation because this is only payable after a three-hour delay.Naomi Leach from Which? Travel said: “It is unacceptable for passengers to be regularly inconvenienced with delays that can leave them hundreds of pounds out of pocket when they miss connections or transfers, are fined for picking up their hire car late or miss their train or cab home.”In a robust response, Ryanair rejected the findings. In a statement, it said: “These Which? figures are inflated and inaccurate. They refer to 2018, which was the worst year on record for ATC delays in Europe.”EasyJet and Thomas Cook both claimed factors beyond their control were to blame for the delays, such as airspace, weather and strikes.Stansted said it had posted significantly improved results in the first quarter of 2019, in part because Ryanair had invested in additional resourcing and equipment to support ground operation.While delays at British Airways improved over the five-year period, over the weekend furious customers attacked the airline for its handling of the pilots’ strike planned for September.Customers swamped BA helplines, and many passengers reported calling every hour but never getting through. Others messaged the company on Twitter with their frustrations, some complaining they would miss weddings and honeymoons.Scott Kishere, a filmmaker and police community officer, said: “My wife and I have been told that our flight to Toronto has been cancelled. This was a full package we booked through BA for our 10-year wedding anniversary. I have made over 100 attempts to contact them for a refund and they’re not answering.”BA said it was receiving nine times its normal call volumes and that 500 staff worked over the weekend to help sort out customer issues. But the airline admitted to adding to the chaos, after it sent some customers an email to say their flight had been cancelled, even though the flight was on a non-strike day and was scheduled to go ahead.After it realised the error, BA emailed customers again but by that time many had rebooked with other airlines.In a statement, it said: “We are sorry for any confusion and inconvenience this has caused. We would encourage anyone who has incurred any expenses as a direct result to get in touch, and we will deal with each case on an individual basis.”","Airline punctuality at UK airports nosedives, finds Which?",2019-08-26/00:01:22,airline punctuality at britain s airports has plummeted with the number of hour long delays on ryanair and easyjet flights doubling in the last five years according to research by which it named stansted as the uk s worst airport for delays with  of all flights taking off an hour or more late while heathrow was best at  ryanair saw the worst deterioration in punctuality of any major airline in the which survey with   of its flights suffering a delay of one hour or more in  compared with  in  thomas cook airlines was worst overall with   of its flights delayed while dutch carrier klm was the best the budget airlines rejected the findings saying they were the victims of air traffic control delays extreme weather conditions and strikes but which said both airports and airlines had failed to match the rapid growth in the number of flights with the resources needed to handle an increase in traffic it analysed m flights and estimated that last year alone  million passengers were affected by delays but most passengers were not entitled to compensation because this is only payable after a three hour delay naomi leach from which travel said it is unacceptable for passengers to be regularly inconvenienced with delays that can leave them hundreds of pounds out of pocket when they miss connections or transfers are fined for picking up their hire car late or miss their train or cab home in a robust response ryanair rejected the findings in a statement it said these which figures are inflated and inaccurate they refer to  which was the worst year on record for atc delays in europe easyjet and thomas cook both claimed factors beyond their control were to blame for the delays such as airspace weather and strikes stansted said it had posted significantly improved results in the first quarter of  in part because ryanair had invested in additional resourcing and equipment to support ground operation while delays at british airways improved over the five year period over the weekend furious customers attacked the airline for its handling of the pilots strike planned for september customers swamped ba helplines and many passengers reported calling every hour but never getting through others messaged the company on twitter with their frustrations some complaining they would miss weddings and honeymoons scott kishere a filmmaker and police community officer said my wife and i have been told that our flight to toronto has been cancelled this was a full package we booked through ba for our  year wedding anniversary i have made over  attempts to contact them for a refund and they re not answering ba said it was receiving nine times its normal call volumes and that  staff worked over the weekend to help sort out customer issues but the airline admitted to adding to the chaos after it sent some customers an email to say their flight had been cancelled even though the flight was on a non strike day and was scheduled to go ahead after it realised the error ba emailed customers again but by that time many had rebooked with other airlines in a statement it said we are sorry for any confusion and inconvenience this has caused we would encourage anyone who has incurred any expenses as a direct result to get in touch and we will deal with each case on an individual basis ,Boeing Crisis,0.4016452729701996

The number of aircraft delivered in the year to date has now reached 716 but that is more than 11% lower than in 2018.The ADS recently slashed its forecast for 2019 global aircraft deliveries from 1,789 to 1,489.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air.

The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard.

Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.In the wake of Boeing’s troubles, Airbus seems set to overtake it as the world's biggest planemaker.

7427,"Qantas is to test non-stop direct flights from London to Sydney to see whether passengers and crew can tolerate what would be the world’s longest commercial flight at 19 hours.The Australian airline will carry 40 passengers and crew on two flights from New York to Sydney and another from London to Sydney.The test passengers on the flights this autumn will mainly be Qantas employees, as well as scientists, with no seats sold on the flights. Passengers and crew will be fitted with wearable technology devices to monitor sleep patterns and food and drink consumption, and to see how lighting, physical movement and inflight entertainment impact their health.Qantas aims to operate regular, non-stop flights to London and New York from Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as soon as 2022. The airline will make a decision on whether to introduce the ultra-long routes commercially by the end 2019.The airline, last year, launched direct flights between London and Perth, on the west coast of Australia, a 17-hour journey. However, the three most populous cities in Australia are all on the country’s east coast, and Melbourne is more than 10,300 miles from New York. London to Sydney is 10,500 miles.The test flights will use new Boeing 787-9 planes, with fewer passengers and less luggage than usual to extend the range. However, successful test flights would fire the starting gun on a race between the US firm Boeing and its European rival, Airbus, to sell Qantas their new ultra-long-range aircraft, the 777X and the A350 respectively.The A350 is currently in service on the world’s longest passenger flight: Singapore Airlines’s New York to Singapore slog, which covers 9,500 miles, taking 18 hours and 25 minutes.The proposed new routes reflect a trend in the airline industry to increase direct, long-distance flights, which are generally preferred by passengers. Alan Joyce, Qantas’s chief executive, said that flying a commercial airliner non-stop from New York to Sydney was “truly the final frontier in aviation”, reflecting the immense distances involved.Joyce said the start of the commercial flights on the routes was not a “foregone conclusion”, with questions remaining as to whether the routes would be profitable.“This is ultimately a business decision and the economics have to stack up,” Joyce said.No commercial airline has ever flown direct from New York to Australia, according to Qantas. It said it flew non-stop from London to Sydney in 1989 to mark the entry into service of the Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, but with only 23 people on board in order to preserve fuel.The working patterns and health of crew will be a key determinant of the viability of the routes. Other ultra-long-haul services currently carry multiple crews who operate on four-hour shifts.Pilots will wear an electroencephalogram (EEG) device to track their brain activity and monitor alertness, so the airline can study the most effective rest pattern. Researchers from Melbourne’s Monash University will also record levels of melatonin – a chemical determining travellers’ experience of jet lag – before, during and after the flights.Qantas has already used its Perth to London route to test shift patterns. The airline will also test variations on food choices, separate areas for stretching and different entertainment options.Qantas, Australia’s flag carrier, has operated a service to Britain since 1938, using flying boats made by the UK company Short Brothers. In 1959, Qantas became the first non-American airline to take delivery of jet aircraft that enabled it to reach the US direct. However, until the Perth flight, travellers between the UK and Australia had to stop in airports such as Singapore or, more recently, Dubai.Aircraft manufacturers are getting better at making cabins habitable for extended periods of time, according to Dr Richard Dawood, a specialist in travel medicine at the Fleet Street Clinic.Modern planes using carbon-fibre construction can withstand higher air pressure inside the cabin, reducing the uncomfortable feeling of altitude that makes flyers’ ears pop. Humidity can be higher with fewer metal parts, reducing some of the discomfort associated with flying.Long-haul travel still takes its toll on the body, however. Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), blood clots that can form particularly in the legs, is one peril. Although it is rare in otherwise healthy people, it has led some airlines to consider allowing more space for passengers to move.“Sitting in any seat for 19 hours is something that carries an increased risk of thrombosis,” said Dawood. “It would be even more important than normal to get up, move around, stretch.”There is some evidence that irregular sleeping patterns have a negative effect on the health of shift workers, he added, making monitoring crew health even more important.There’s also jet lag, but no amount of clever design can prevent changing time zones from disrupting the body’s internal clock. Flying from west to east is worse because the body finds it harder to adapt to a shorter day than a longer one. Scientists are divided as to the effectiveness of melatonin supplements in fighting jet lag, while exposure to bright lights can help the body to adapt.• This article was amended on 23 August 2019. An earlier version said that modern planes using carbon-fibre construction “can withstand higher air pressure”. This has been clarified to refer to higher air pressure inside the cabin.

7487,"Russia has told international nuclear test ban monitors that it does not have to share information on the blast that caused a brief spike in radiation levels in Arkhangelsk region, bolstering speculation that Russia may have tampered with monitoring stations that failed to transmit scientific data after the accident.Two Russian-operated monitoring stations for the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ceased transmitting data two days after the 8 August blast, when a projected radioactive plume from the deadly accident would be expected to reach them.The data could have given additional information on the amount and kind of nuclear materials being used in the Russian military tests, indicating the level of danger to local residents and the nature of the Russian testing, including whether a small nuclear reactor was involved.The treaty’s mandate “does not cover development of any types of weapons”, said the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, on Tuesday when asked about why the stations had suddenly gone silent. The decision to transmit data is “strictly voluntary”, he added.On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported another two monitoring stations had also suddenly gone offline, bringing the total to four.Lassina Zerbo, the executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), wrote earlier this week that the agency was analysing the “potential plume from the explosion” and was “addressing technical problems experienced at two neighbouring stations”. A spokesperson for the CTBTO said that the organisation “started experiencing problems with two radionuclide stations – Dubna and Kirov – on the morning of 10 August.” The stations reported “communication and network issues” and apparently had not been restored to full functionality as of Tuesday evening.The spokesperson also confirmed problems at the Bilibino and Zalesovo radionuclide stations beginning on 13 August.Russia’s atomic agency has said that five of its employees were killed during a test involving a liquid-fuelled rocket and “isotope power sources” at a military testing range.Some analysts have said Russia could have been testing an experimental cruise missile that carries a nuclear reactor on board, although other theories have been suggested. They include a nuclear-powered cooling system for liquid-fuelled rockets or other hypersonic or nuclear-powered missile projects.The Burevestnik (Storm Petrel) experimental cruise missile – called ""Skyfall"" by Nato – is an ambitious nuclear-powered cruise missile in development by Russia's armed forces.The concept builds on an idea originally examined by the US in the late 1950s: a nuclear-powered missile able to fly vast distances powered by an on-board reactor, tracing a complex flight path to outflank enemy defences.Essentially the idea has been to develop a missile with effectively no limitation of conventional fuel range, which could fly around the globe multiple times or trace a flight path – for instance – over the Pacific and through South America to target the US via Mexican airspace, making conventional anti-missile defences, as they are currently deployed, redundant.The US air defence network is configured on the assumption any air attack would come from the north, west, or east, but not the south. By comparison the US Tomahawk cruise missile has a range of 1500 miles.Dismissed by the US decades ago because of the dangers and technical problems involved, the missile has been pursued by Russia in the last few years along with other vehicles designed to outfox conventional defences  including high-speed underwater drones and hypersonic glide vehicles.According to what little is known about the project, the missile is designed to be launched using a traditional jet propulsion motor before the nuclear power plant takes over in the air.While it would be a formidable weapon if successfully deployed, leapfrogging US missile capabilities, doubts remain among researchers as to whether its core technology is viable. Peter BeaumontThe comprehensive test ban treaty, signed in 1996, prohibits civilian and military experiments involving nuclear explosions. It is not in force because it has not been signed or ratified by a number of countries, including the US, but Russia has set up monitoring stations that transmit data to the organisation headed by Zerbo in Vienna, Austria.This month’s blast is not believed to have been caused by a nuclear reaction, but by the ignition of rocket fuel being used in the experiment.The CTBTO receives information from approximately 300 stations around the world that identify nuclear testing by providing seismic, hydroacoustic and other data. The monitoring stations at Dubna and Kirov, which ceased transmitting data on 10 August, monitor radionuclide particles in the air.On Tuesday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said that president Vladimir Putin, was receiving updates about the situation in Severodvinsk, where gamma radiation exceeded the normal level by 16 times after the explosion on 8 August.But Peskov said of the test stations: “I don’t know what those stations are, and what data they transmit,” he said. “It is outside of our purview.”",Russia refuses to share data on blast that caused radiation

7615,"The head of Cathay Pacific has quit after protests in Hong Kong led to a plunge in the airline’s share price and it came under pressure from Chinese authorities to rein in employees who were supporting the pro-democracy demonstrators.Rupert Hogg, the company’s British chief executive, and Paul Loo, the chief customer and commercial officer, tendered their resignations to the board on Friday.The news of their departures broke on Chinese state media rather than on Hong Kong business channels, fuelling suspicions that the move was dictated by anger in Beijing.The airline’s chairman and former chief executive, John Slosar, said: “Recent events have called into question Cathay Pacific’s commitment to flight safety and security and put our reputation and brand under pressure. This is regrettable as we have always made safety and security our highest priority.“We therefore think it is time to put a new management team in place who can reset confidence and lead the airline to new heights.”Hogg has become the most high profile corporate casualty of the standoff between Hong Kong’s government and its increasingly impassioned residents, after the airline was drawn into the dispute when a pilot was arrested in July.As China increased the pressure, banks downgraded Cathay’s rating for investors, and the aviation regulator told the airline it would have to submit the names of its crews for checks before flying over the mainland, and remove any staff who had been involved in protests.A number of Chinese firms effectively boycotted the airline, telling staff not to fly with Cathay for safety reasons. Although Cathay is a major international carrier, more than a fifth of its flights go to the Chinese mainland.The airline, a long-term partner of British Airways and others in the One World alliance, initially refused to censure any of its 27,000 employees for taking part in the pro-democracy protests. Slosar said he “certainly wouldn’t dream of telling staff what to think”.But on Monday Hogg emailed staff to say the airline had “a zero-tolerance approach to illegal activities” and that they could be fired if they supported or participated in the protests.Cathay has dismissed a number of its employees and acceded to the Chinese regulator’s request, saying “overly radical” staff would be suspended from mainland duties.Pressure on the airline escalated dramatically this week after protests by thousands of people in the main terminal of Cathay’s home hub, Hong Kong international airport, halted all passenger travel, eventually forcing the airline to cancel more than 200 flights.On Tuesday, Cathay said it was “deeply concerned by the ongoing violence and disruption impacting Hong Kong”. It added: “We resolutely support the Hong Kong SAR government, the chief executive and the police in their efforts to restore law and order … We must act now to stop the violence and preserve the stability, peace and prosperity of Hong Kong.”Announcing Hogg’s departure on Friday, Slosar said: “Cathay Pacific is fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of one country, two systems, as enshrined in the basic law.”Shares in the carrier fell on Tuesday to their lowest point in a decade, before recovering slightly by the end of the week.

7666,"Footballer Emiliano Sala and the pilot flying the plane he was in when it crashed into the Channel were probably exposed to “potentially fatal” levels of carbon monoxide, investigators have announced.Toxicology tests on the Cardiff City footballer found levels of carboxyhaemoglobin – formed in the blood when exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) – above the point doctors consider to be fatal.Inspectors at the Air Accident Investigations Board (AAIB) said that as the cockpit of the Piper Malibu light aircraft was not separated from the cabin when it crashed in January, it was likely that the pilot, David Ibbotson, would also have been affected.The report reveals that Sala had CO saturation levels of 58% in his blood. Levels in excess of 50% are “generally considered to be potentially fatal”, doctors said.The AAIB said the gas can “reduce or inhibit a pilot’s ability to fly an aircraft depending on the level of that exposure”. The body of Ibbotson, from Lincolnshire, has still not been found.Lawyers for the Sala family called for the plane to be recovered from the sea for further investigation, saying the carbon monoxide levels “raised many questions”.Daniel Machover, of Hickman & Rose solicitors, said: “The family believe that detailed technical examination of the plane is necessary. Future air safety rests on knowing as much as possible.”The symptoms of poisoning by carbon monoxide range from impaired judgment and drowsiness to confusion, blurred vision and loss of coordination, with seizures, unconsciousness and heart attacks likely at the level of exposure recorded in Sala’s blood.The colourless, odourless gas is produced in high concentrations in piston engine planes, but should be extracted by the exhaust system. Leaks into the heating and ventilation system could bring the gas into the plane cabin.Although investigators have not published conclusions, the special bulletin issued by the AAIB could explain why the plane carrying Sala fell thousands of feet in seconds after making a 180-degree turn. The pilot had requested a descent minutes earlier after encountering bad weather on the journey from Nantes to Cardiff on 21 January. Previous reports said unconfirmed radar readings showed the plane may have also climbed rapidly before its final descent.Questions remain around the legal status of the flight and the pilot’s licence to carry Sala.The Argentinian footballer signed for Cardiff City from French club Nantes for a record £15m on 18 January. The plane crashed 22 miles off Guernsey on 21 January while travelling from Nantes to Cardiff. Sala’s body was found in the wreckage 220ft down on the seabed near the Channel’s most perilous underwater valley, known as Hurd’s Deep.A Cardiff City spokesperson said: “CCFC is concerned at the AAIB’s latest report, which once again highlights that the aircraft used for Emiliano Sala was not appropriate. We continue to believe that those who were instrumental in arranging its usage are held to account for this tragedy.”Football agent Willie McKay arranged the flight but said previously he was not involved in choosing the plane or selecting the pilot, and claimed the club had left Sala to organise his own travel. Cardiff City “strongly rejected” the allegation and said they had offered to book a commercial flight for the footballer.The body of the 28-year-old Argentinian was recovered in February but that of Ibbotson, 59, has not been found. The wreckage of the fuselage was found on the seabed off Guernsey in the Channel Islands but the aircraft remains underwater after an attempt to recover it was hampered by adverse weather conditions.Nora Ibbotson, the pilot’s widow, said recovering the aircraft from the seabed could help investigators. But she added: “It’s not going to change my situation, I’ve lost a husband, a father, a grandfather,” she told Sky News. “Nothing can repay that, and change it.” Sala’s family called for the plane to be salvaged “without delay”, but the AAIB said it would “not add significantly to the investigation” and that it was continuing to investigate operational, technical, organisational and human factors that may have contributed to the accident.“The reasons for our decision not to recover the aircraft wreckage have been explained in detail to both families concerned,” a spokesperson for the AAIB said. “In February our underwater search operation successfully located the wreckage, recovered the passenger’s body and captured substantial video evidence from the scene using a remotely operated vehicle.“It was not possible at the time to recover the wreckage. We have carefully considered the feasibility and merits of returning to attempt to recover the wreckage. In this case, we consider that it will not add significantly to the investigation and we will identify the correct safety issues through other means.“In making our decision, we took into account the high cost of underwater recovery, the evidence we collected in February and the risk that, after a violent impact with the sea, the wreckage would not yield definitive evidence.”Investigators issued the special bulletin to warn other pilots and operators of small aircraft of the possibility of CO poisoning. Although alarms are not mandatory, the AAIB said pilots should consider buying CO indicators that could alert them to a potentially deadly threat.A full accident report is not expected to be published until early 2020, and the investigation is ongoing.",Emiliano Sala and crash pilot 'probably poisoned by fumes',2019-08-14/19:20:49,footballer emiliano sala and the pilot flying the plane he was in

7667,"All climbers seeking a permit for Everest must have prior high altitude mountaineering experience and demonstrable training, a high-level commission for the Nepalese government has ruled.The recommendation was issued by the body charged with looking at the issue of high-altitude safety after one of the deadliest seasons in recent years on Everest, which was blamed on inexperience and crowding near the summit.Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the 8,850-metre (29,035 ft) mountain in May, nine on the Nepalese side and two on the Tibetan side.The Nepalese panel - made up of government officials, climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community - was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials for allowing anyone who paid $11,000 (£9,000) to attempt to climb Everest. Some veteran guiding companies had long warned of the dangerous consequences of inexperience and crowds on the summit slopes.“Climbers to [Everest] and other 8,000-metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training,” the panel said in the report it submitted to the government.It said that those hoping to climb Everest must have climbed at least one Nepalese peak of more than 6,500-metres21,325 ft) before getting a permit. Climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness and be accompanied by a trained Nepalese guide.Mira Acharya, a member of the panel, said: “Climbers died due to altitude sickness, heart attack, exhaustion or weaknesses, and not due to traffic jams”. She said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts, which put lives at risk.Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the poor nation.The numbers attempting the climb in May led to bottlenecks in the “death zone”, where very low oxygen levels put lives at risk. Oxygen cylinders ran out while as many as 100 people waited in the queue.The issues were underlined by Simon Lowe, the managing director of UK-based Jagged Globe, who said this year’s crowding had aggravated an underlying issue of lack of experience.“That is incompetent climbers being led by incompetent teams,” Lowe said. “If you go up with a bare minimum bottles of supplementary oxygen and stand in a queue for ages that is going to cause problems.”Without reforms such as those suggested by the panel, Lowe said guiding on the mountain by responsible companies could become untenable.Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year’s climbing season, which tends to culminate in May, when the daylight and weather are the most forgiving.Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior tourism ministry official, said the recommendations would be implemented. “The government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing,” he told Reuters.",Nepal sets new rules for Everest climbers after deadly season,2019-08-14/18:39:15,all climbers seeking a permit for everest must have prior high altitude mountaineering experience and demonstrable training a high level commission for the nepalese government has ruled the recommendation was issued by the body charged with looking at the issue of high altitude safety after one of the deadliest seasons in recent years on everest which was blamed on inexperience and crowding near the summit eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the   metre   ft mountain in may nine on the nepalese side and two on the tibetan side the nepalese panel made up of government officials climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials for allowing anyone who paid     to attempt to climb everest some veteran guiding companies had long warned of the dangerous consequences of inexperience and crowds on the summit slopes climbers to everest and other   metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training the panel said in the report it submitted to the government it said that those hoping to climb everest must have climbed at least one nepalese peak of more than   metres  ft before getting a permit climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness and be accompanied by a trained nepalese guide mira acharya a member of the panel said climbers died due to altitude sickness heart attack exhaustion or weaknesses and not due to traffic jams she said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts which put lives at risk nepal is home to eight of the world s  highest mountains and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the poor nation the numbers attempting the climb in may led to bottlenecks in the death zone where very low oxygen levels put lives at risk oxygen cylinders ran out while as many as  people waited in the queue the issues were underlined by simon lowe the managing director of uk based jagged globe who said this year s crowding had aggravated an underlying issue of lack of experience that is incompetent climbers being led by incompetent teams lowe said if you go up with a bare minimum bottles of supplementary oxygen and stand in a queue for ages that is going to cause problems without reforms such as those suggested by the panel lowe said guiding on the mountain by responsible companies could become untenable nepal issued  permits for everest for this year s climbing season which tends to culminate in may when the daylight and weather are the most forgiving ghanshyam upadhyaya a senior tourism ministry official said the recommendations would be implemented the government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing he told  ,Boeing Crisis,0.19909082353115082
7757,"The closure of Hong Kong international airport has shone a fresh global spotlight on the city’s protest movement.The airport was forced to cancel all remaining passenger flights on Monday – more than 100 – after thousands of demonstrators flooded into the main terminal during the afternoon. The disruption will be felt worldwide, with cancellations including long-haul departures to the US, Australia and the UK.Hong Kong international serves over 220 destinations, the bulk of which are Asia-Pacific, the most frequent flights being to mainland China, primarily Beijing and Shanghai. But it is a significant hub for the rest of the globe: one in seven arrivals are from Europe and the US. It is the base of Cathay Pacific, which partners and codeshares with airlines including British Airways, American Airlines and Qantas.Hong Kong is also hugely important for cargo, funnelling more freight by volume, about 5m tonnes in 2018, than any other airport. Air freighters were continuing to take off on Monday night, but a large proportion of cargo is normally carried in the hold of passenger planes.According to a study by the International Air Transport Association, the aviation sector dependent on the airport added £27bn to Hong Kong’s GDP in 2014. It roughly matches London Heathrow in size, operating on two runways and in the process of constructing a third, serving 75 million passengers in 2018 and employing 73,000 staff.Built on the island of Chek Lap Kok and land reclaimed from the sea around it, the airport opened in 1998, soon after the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China. It replaced the notorious airport at Kai Tak, whose flight paths through the built-up island’s mountains and skyscrapers were legendary among pilots and a source of considerable noise disturbance to inhabitants. The new £17bn airport, constructed by British engineers, allowed planes to land 24 hours a day – and inspired the idea of a Thames estuary airport, instead of an expanded Heathrow, that was championed by Boris Johnson when London mayor.Monday’s closure is the biggest blow struck on the third occasion that the protests have crossed the water to the airport. Thousands of demonstrators held a sit-in protest to raise international travellers’ awareness in late July – a protest joined by some airline staff, attracting the ire of Beijing. Last week, as part of a strike across Hong Kong, more than 200 flights were cancelled. Cathay Pacific, drawn in to a balancing act between angry staff and warding off Chinese government threats, saw its share price slide by another 5% on Monday, down to its lowest value in a decade.",Closure of Hong Kong airport shines fresh light on protest movement,2019-08-12/16:16:26,the closure of hong kong international airport has shone a fresh global spotlight on the city s protest movement the airport was forced to cancel all remaining passenger flights on monday more than  after thousands of demonstrators flooded into the main terminal during the afternoon the disruption will be felt worldwide with cancellations including long haul departures to the us australia and the uk hong kong international serves over  destinations the bulk of which are asia pacific the most frequent flights being to mainland china primarily beijing and shanghai but it is a significant hub for the rest of the globe one in seven arrivals are from europe and the us it is the base of cathay pacific which partners and codeshares with airlines including british airways american airlines and qantas hong kong is also hugely important for cargo funnelling more freight by volume about m tonnes in  than any other airport air freighters were continuing to take off on monday night but a large proportion of cargo is normally carried in the hold of passenger planes according to a study by the international air transport association the aviation sector dependent on the airport added bn to hong kong s gdp in  it roughly matches london heathrow in size operating on two runways and in the process of constructing a third serving  million passengers in  and employing   staff built on the island of chek lap kok and land reclaimed from the sea around it the airport opened in  soon after the transfer of sovereignty from britain to china it replaced the notorious airport at kai tak whose flight paths through the built up island s mountains and skyscrapers were legendary among pilots and a source of considerable noise disturbance to inhabitants the new bn airport constructed by british engineers allowed planes to land  hours a day and inspired the idea of a thames estuary airport instead of an expanded heathrow that was championed by boris johnson when london mayor monday s closure is the biggest blow struck on the third occasion that the protests have crossed the water to the airport thousands of demonstrators held a sit in protest to raise international travellers awareness in late july a protest joined by some airline staff attracting the ire of beijing last week as part of a strike across hong kong more than  flights were cancelled cathay pacific drawn in to a balancing act between angry staff and warding off chinese government threats saw its share price slide by another  on monday down to its lowest value in a decade ,Boeing Crisis,0.2046247124671936
7760,"Russian scientists have indicated that they were working on miniaturised sources of nuclear energy when a rocket engine exploded last week, increasing scrutiny of the possibility that the accident occurred while testing an experimental cruise missile powered by a small reactor.The explosion last Thursday at a military testing ground in Russia’s Arkhangelsk region killed at least five people and caused radiation readings in neighbouring cities to spike to 20 times their normal level for half an hour.Russia’s defence ministry said the explosion had taken place during testing of a rocket engine, but the country’s nuclear agency, Rosatom, later confirmed that several of its employees had been killed during testing of an “isotope power source in a liquid propulsion system”.David Cullen, the director of the Nuclear Information Service in the UK, said on Monday that the view among independent experts was that the explosion appeared to have been caused by the failure of an experimental nuclear-powered cruise missile known in Russia as the 9M730 Burevestnik and by Nato as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall.The Burevestnik (Storm Petrel) experimental cruise missile – called ""Skyfall"" by Nato – is an ambitious nuclear-powered cruise missile in development by Russia's armed forces.The concept builds on an idea originally examined by the US in the late 1950s: a nuclear-powered missile able to fly vast distances powered by an on-board reactor, tracing a complex flight path to outflank enemy defences.Essentially the idea has been to develop a missile with effectively no limitation of conventional fuel range, which could fly around the globe multiple times or trace a flight path – for instance – over the Pacific and through South America to target the US via Mexican airspace, making conventional anti-missile defences, as they are currently deployed, redundant.The US air defence network is configured on the assumption any air attack would come from the north, west, or east, but not the south. By comparison the US Tomahawk cruise missile has a range of 1500 miles.Dismissed by the US decades ago because of the dangers and technical problems involved, the missile has been pursued by Russia in the last few years along with other vehicles designed to outfox conventional defences  including high-speed underwater drones and hypersonic glide vehicles.According to what little is known about the project, the missile is designed to be launched using a traditional jet propulsion motor before the nuclear power plant takes over in the air.While it would be a formidable weapon if successfully deployed, leapfrogging US missile capabilities, doubts remain among researchers as to whether its core technology is viable. Peter BeaumontAnnounced by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in 2018, the missile is theoretically able to use an onboard source of nuclear fuel to heat fast-moving air and fly for indefinite periods. Moscow has touted the missile’s unlimited range and potential ability to penetrate US missile defences, but doubts remain among researchers as to whether its core technology is viable.Experts in Russia’s nuclear programme have also spotted the nuclear fuel carrier ship Serebryanka near the site of last week’s explosion, where it is believed to have been taking part in a recovery effort. The vessel had previously been spotted in the waters near Novaya Zemlya, where Russia reportedly tested the Burevestnik missile in 2017. “Our suspicion is that something went wrong during or after a Russian test of its nuclear-powered cruise missile,” wrote Jeffrey Lewis, a US arms control specialist with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. Russia was believed to have moved Burevestnik testing to the current Nenoksa site earlier this year.In a video statement released on Sunday evening, an official from the Russian Federal Nuclear Centre, where five employees were killed in the explosion, said the agency was working on a number of experimental technologies, including “miniaturised sources of energy using [fissile] materials”.Vyacheslav Solovyov, the centre’s scientific director, said similar work on “small-scale nuclear reactors” is also taking place in the US. He did not say how much fissile material had been involved in the accident, or what role it may have played in the explosion.“We are now trying to understand, we are working closely with a government commission, analysing the entire chain of events to assess the scale of the accident and to understand its causes,” Solovyov said.The slow release of information has heightened concerns that a major incident took place offshore from the Nenoksa missile testing site. Residents of Severodvinsk and other northern cities had reportedly stocked up on iodine, which reduces the effects of exposure to radiation. Russia has also closed a bay in the White Sea near where the accident took place for a month, indicating possible contamination or a continuing search operation.The development of an experimental weapon such as the Burevestnik would also help to explain the secrecy around the incident, despite public concerns over radiation levels.The US tried and failed to develop ground-hugging nuclear-powered cruise missile technology during the cold war, and questions remain as to whether the Burevestnik has a meaningful purpose, given the existence of high flying intercontinental ballistic missiles as an alternative.Such experimental long-range cruise missiles would not have been covered by the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty between the US and Russia that lapsed last month, because it only banned land-based cruise missiles with a range of between 500 and 5,500km (300 and 3,400 miles).Cullen said, however, that the test failure was “symptomatic of a wider escalation in nuclear tensions stemming from a gradual breakdown in US-Russia relations” partly because “Russia is trying to rectify what it believes is a strategic disadvantage it has against the US by developing non-conventional capabilities”.",Russia indicates rocket engine exploded in test of mini nuclear reactor,2019-08-12/13:29:06,russian scientists have indicated that they were working on

7871,"The engineer Chris Kraft, who has died aged 95, was Nasa’s first flight director, the man who shaped the team – and the control centre – at Cape Canaveral in Florida and, from 1963, in Houston, Texas. Kraft’s work spanned the era from Nasa’s first faltering manned missions during the space race of the 1960s to the space shuttle in the 80s.He was director of flight operations at Nasa when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their moon landing in Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969, and signed off with the Apollo 12 mission that November. He returned in 1970 to chair the crisis meeting as the crippled Apollo 13 limped back to Earth.As director of the Johnson Space Center – originally known as the Manned Space Center – in Houston from 1972 to 1982, he oversaw Skylab, America’s first space station, the Apollo-Soyuz docking in 1975 and the arrival of the space shuttle. “To err is human,” Kraft would tell a generation of ground controllers, “but to do so more than once is contrary to flight operations division’s policy.”Kraft was born in Phoebus, Virginia, the son of Vanda (nee Suddreth) and Christopher Kraft. He was of Bavarian immigrant stock – his grandmother was a bar-keeper whose business was wrecked by prohibition. His father’s first world war US army service ended with a nervous breakdown; after the war Kraft Sr worked for a while in the finance department of a local veterans’ hospital. He was a “joiner”, his son recalled, a member of the local American Legion and the fire department. Yet Kraft Sr’s life was dogged by mental illness. His son wrote that his father’s influence had been more shadow than substance.Chris was educated at the local high school, where he excelled at baseball and bugle playing. Turned down by the US navy because of a childhood burns injury, he took a two-year wartime course at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (1942-44), graduating with a degree in aeronautical engineering.In January 1945 Kraft was accepted at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (Naca) at Langley, Virginia. There he worked in the stability and control branch under Chuck Mathews, researching aircraft design problems. In 1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite, and as part of the US response it was decided to integrate Naca into Nasa. So, the following autumn, Kraft became one of the 45 members of Nasa’s Space Task Group, assigned to the flight operations division.Jet pilots had brushed space, but no human had yet ventured out of the Earth’s atmosphere. The world’s first spaceman, Yuri Gagarin, of the Soviet Union, would not go into orbit until 1961. Indeed, in the unfolding mythology of space, not only was David Bowie’s Major Tom absent, so was ground control. “There needs to be somebody in charge of the flights while they’re actually going on,” Mathews recalled Kraft telling him. “And I’d like to be that person.” Thus Kraft became Nasa’s first flight director.His earliest experience in the role came on 5 May 1961, when Alan Shepard became the first American in space, with a sub-orbital loop in the Mercury capsule Freedom 7. On 20 February 1962, for the third manned Mercury mission, John Glenn went into orbit – and provided a defining moment in Kraft’s relationship with Nasa. During the astronaut’s second orbit there was an indication that the space capsule’s heat shield was unlatched. “My gut told me instantly it was a faulty signal,” Kraft wrote; and he would be proved right. But senior management overruled him about the correct response. “From now on, I swore, they’d play hell before they overruled any decision I made.”Thirteen weeks later Glenn was followed into orbit by Scott Carpenter, on a mission still dogged by controversy. Kraft considered that the astronaut had disregarded his instructions, accusations that Carpenter vehemently denied until his death in 2013. “I swore an oath that Scott Carpenter would never fly again,” wrote Kraft. “He didn’t.”On 25 May 1961 President John F Kennedy pledged that Americans would land on, and return from, the moon before the end of the decade. The space race was “deadly damn serious”, wrote Kraft, a red-blooded patriot, in his combative memoir Flight: My Life in Mission Control (2001), “and the future of our American way of life was at stake”.There would be three stages on the way to the moon. Project Mercury, which ended in 1963, put solo astronauts into orbit, and the two-man Gemini programme (1962-66) developed the technology for a lunar landing. Apollo was about landing on the moon.On 3 June 1965 Ed White became the first American to walk in space – and enjoyed it too much. It took a demanding “the mission director says to get back in” to get the astronaut to return to Gemini IV. Two months later, on 27 August – even as Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad, on board Gemini V, were establishing a record for longest flight – Time magazine was making Kraft the subject of that week’s cover feature. This did not endear him to all his colleagues in the unfolding Apollo programme, but it did establish Kraft’s place in the American public imagination.With the first manned rendezvous in orbit that December, of Gemini VII and VI-A, Kraft was focused on his remoter role as director of flight operations. “The entire flight control team … ” he wrote, “was probably the best systems engineering organisation in the world.” Day-to-day ground control was being delegated to others, but Kraft had become a charismatic figure within Nasa, and ultimately, as Charles Murray and Catherine Cox observed in Apollo: The Race to the Moon (1989), “the embodiment of mission control”.After leaving Houston in 1982 Kraft worked as a consultant, and chaired a panel in the 1990s that produced a controversial report into the space shuttle which was accused of playing down safety issues. He received many honours, including Nasa’s outstanding leadership medal, four Nasa distinguished service medals, the National Space Trophy and Nasa’s ambassador of exploration award. In 2011 the Johnson Space Center named its mission control centre the Christopher C Kraft Jr Control Center.In 1950 Kraft married Betty Turnbull.

7950,"Aviation unions have praised British Airway pilots and cabin crew for landing their plane safely and evacuating all passengers after their aircraft filled with smoke.One of the unions called for an inquiry into the incident in which nearly 200 people had to be evacuated from a British Airways flight after smoke poured into the cabin minutes before it was due to land in Valencia on Monday. Three people were taken to hospital after the incident and each was later discharged.One passenger, Gayle Fitzpatrick, described anxiety among passengers as the incident unfolded. “It was very scary,” she said. “The flight was just ending, and with 10 minutes to go, it started descending rapidly as smoke started to fill the cabin.“There were no communications from the crew, who started to wear full oxygen masks and protective fire wear.”“Eventually they managed to open the emergency doors and told us to go down the chutes. There were fire engines waiting and then we were all ushered into a bus to the airport.”Unite, the UK and Ireland’s largest union, has called for an inquiry into toxic cabin air and fume events on board jet airliners following Monday’s incident.Describing the event as the tip of the iceberg, Unite called on the airline industry to “come clean” over toxic cabin air and “clean up” its act by using safer oil to lubricate jet engines and fitting cabin air filters on board planes.Howard Beckett, Unite’s assistant general secretary for legal affairs, said: “This latest fume event is deeply alarming. British Airways has some serious questions to answer regarding the safety of the aircraft, in addition to providing health and safety guarantees for our cabin crew members.Unite said it is currently supporting 51 high court actions against five UK airlines after they said they found evidence that the air in most commercial airline cabins can cause irreversible neurological damage and chronic illness among susceptible individuals.Beckett added: “Far too often fume events like these go unreported and are brushed under the carpet by the airline industry. This latest fume event only came to light because members of the media were on board the flight. The airline industry cannot continue to hide from the issue of toxic cabin air whilst placing the health and safety of aircrew at risk.”Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots’ Association, said the aircraft clearly suffered a technical problem, the cause of which will need to be investigated.Strutton praised the pilot and crew for their “excellent and highly professional job of getting this aircraft safely on to the ground in very difficult circumstances, and safely evacuating all the passengers with no reported serious injuries.“We will await the accident report, but this looks to have been a very well-managed emergency situation, and overall a good outcome, and I pay tribute to the pilots and crew for a job very well done.”A spokesperson for the Professional Pilots Union said: “All the crew on that aircraft did what they’re trained for brilliantly, and they’re a credit to all of us in the industry. Pilots and crew are the face of the company in these situations, and airlines would do well to remember that when negotiating with the unions representing these fantastic people.”",BA crew praised by unions for landing smoke-filled plane safely,2019-08-06/16:59:28,aviation unions have praised british airway pilots and cabin crew for landing their plane safely and evacuating all passengers after their aircraft filled with smoke one of the unions called for an inquiry into the incident in which nearly  people had to be evacuated from a british airways flight after smoke poured into the cabin minutes before it was due to land in valencia on monday three people were taken to hospital after the incident and each was later discharged one passenger gayle fitzpatrick described anxiety among passengers as the incident unfolded it was very scary she said the flight was just ending and with  minutes to go it started descending rapidly as smoke started to fill the cabin there were no communications from the crew who started to wear full oxygen masks and protective fire wear eventually they managed to open the emergency doors and told us to go down the chutes there were fire engines waiting and then we were all ushered into a bus to the airport unite the uk and ireland s largest union has called for an inquiry into toxic cabin air and fume events on board jet airliners following monday s incident describing the event as the tip of the iceberg unite called on the airline industry to come clean over toxic cabin air and clean up its act by using safer oil to lubricate jet engines and fitting cabin air filters on board planes howard beckett unite s assistant general secretary for legal affairs said this latest fume event is deeply alarming british airways has some serious questions to answer regarding the safety of the aircraft in addition to providing health and safety guarantees for our cabin crew members unite said it is currently supporting  high court actions against five uk airlines after they said they found evidence that the air in most commercial airline cabins can cause irreversible neurological damage and chronic illness among susceptible individuals beckett added far too often fume events like these go unreported and are brushed under the carpet by the airline industry this latest fume event only came to light because members of the media were on board the flight the airline industry cannot continue to hide from the issue of toxic cabin air whilst placing the health and safety of aircrew at risk brian strutton the general secretary of the british airline pilots association said the aircraft clearly suffered a technical problem the cause of which will need to be investigated strutton praised the pilot and crew for their excellent and highly professional job of getting this aircraft safely on to the ground in very difficult circumstances and safely evacuating all the passengers with no reported serious injuries we will await the accident report but this looks to have been a very well managed emergency situation and overall a good outcome and i pay tribute to the pilots and crew for a job very well done a spokesperson for the professional pilots union said all the crew on that aircraft did what they re trained for brilliantly and they re a credit to all of us in the industry pilots and crew are the face of the company in these situations and airlines would do well to remember that when negotiating with the unions representing these fantastic people ,Boeing Crisis,0.3957507610321045
7969,"Nearly 200 people had to be evacuated from a British Airways flight after smoke poured into the cabin minutes before it was due to land in Valencia.Three people were taken to hospital after the incident on Monday, and each was later discharged.One passenger on the flight from London’s Heathrow airport tweeted videos that appeared to show the smoke-filled cabin and claimed that a fire had broken out. The passenger, a Spanish sports journalist called Dani Meroño Bori, said he and others had been forced to leave the plane using the emergency slides.Intentamos salir pero no funciona nada!!! atrapados pero van a abrir la puerta!!!Hemos aterrizado en Manises @British_Airways pic.twitter.com/917WOKL4yO“PANIC!!! FEAR – have never been through anything like that before,” he tweeted. “What a miracle. The plane we were on from London to Valencia caught fire. We’ve just landed.”In a later tweet, he said: “We’re trying to get out but nothing’s working!!! We’re trapped but they’re going to open the door!!! We’ve landed in Manises aiport [in Valencia].”After he got off the plane, Meroño tweeted: “Everyone’s OK but there were people who had a really rough time. It was a big shock when smoke started to appear when we were flying. Luckily we were close and everything turned out OK. We took a deep breath when we landed.”The journalist complained about a lack of information from staff and said some passengers had been left to reassure others.Gayle Fitzpatrick, from Glasgow, Scotland, who was on holiday with her husband, Stephen, described the moment smoke entered the cabin.She told PA Media: “It was very scary. The flight was just ending, and with 10 minutes to go, it started descending rapidly as smoke started to fill the cabin.“A detector was going off saying the cabin was filling with smoke … There were no communications from the crew, who started to wear full oxygen masks and protective fire wear.“Eventually they managed to open the emergency doors and told us to go down the chutes. There were fire engines waiting and then we were all ushered into a bus to the airport.”Fitzpatrick claimed passengers had been stuck at the airport for hours “without any information at all”.Stephen Fitzpatrick added: “The pilot made a very sharp downward trajectory , landed the thing, pulled into a sideway and stopped quite suddenly.“We could see the fire engines scrambling, but were surprised they weren’t already there given the warning time. There was zero communication at any time from the crew.”Once the passengers were clear of the aircraft, Fitzpatrick said it was up to them to organise themselves and they spent nearly five hours in the baggage area.“There was some very basic presence from the airport, but essentially the passengers were left entirely to their own devices.”He said he was “surprised at how utterly unprepared they were for an emergency”, calling it a “real eye-opener”. In a statement, British Airways said: “Flight BA422 from Heathrow to Valencia experienced a technical issue on its landing approach into Valencia. All our customers were evacuated safely by our crew and met by the airport’s emergency services.“There were 175 customers on board the flight, with six cabin crew and two pilots. Three customers were taken to hospital as a precaution and have since been discharged.“The safety of our customers and crew is always our highest priority.

8070,"Canadian conservationists are sounding an alarm over the survival of the North Atlantic right whale, a once numerous species that live off the east coast of the US and Canada.This June, six right whales were killed, followed by two more in July – a potentially devastating blow to a population that is now estimated to be no more than 400 strong.The abrupt increase in mortality is believed to be caused by boat strikes and entanglements in fishing gear caused by changes in the whale’s feeding patterns.Right whales typically feed on the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, a tiny shrimplike creature that is found in abundance in the Gulf of Maine. But according to a paper published this month in the journal Oceanography, warming ocean water has reduced Calanus finmarchicus in the gulf, forcing the whales to hunt further north in the Gulf of St Lawrence, a region with heavy shipping traffic.The change in feeding habits also adds 700 to 800 additional miles (1126.5 to 1287.5km) distance from their breeding grounds off the coast of Georgia.The latest spike in mortality is particularly disappointing because in 2003 the Canadian government and the shipping industry negotiated for shipping lanes to be rerouted to avoid a feeding ground and whale nursery in the bay. That shift, which marked the first time lanes were moved to help a species, reduced the risk of ship strikes by as much as 90%. The change helped right whale populations grow from about 350 to almost 500 between 2000 and 2010.Recent losses to the population includes a 40-year-old female named Punctuation that scientists have been tracking since 1981. she gave birth to eight calves, two of which had calves of their own.Scientists determined she died as a result of being hit by a ship. Of the whales lost over the past two months, necropsies performed on seven found four died from trauma consistent with vessel collisions, and two died from entanglement in fishing gear.The spike in deaths comes after no right whales were recorded dying in Canadian waters in 2018. In the previous year, 12 were found to have died in the St Lawrence.“Any loss of a right whale is detrimental to the population. It’s an endangered whale. ,” the department of fisheries biologist Stephanie Ratelle told CBC.As a result of the recent losses, Canadian authorities are imposing a precautionary speed restriction of 10 knots in the western areas of St Lawrence for vessels 20 meters or more in length.Those who fail to comply could face fines up to $25,000.",Alarm over North Atlantic right whale's survival after recent deaths,2019-08-02/17:40:42,canadian conservationists are sounding an alarm over the survival of the north atlantic right whale a once numerous species that live off the east coast of the us and canada this june six right whales were killed followed by two more in july a potentially devastating blow to a population that is now estimated to be no more than  strong the abrupt increase in mortality is believed to be caused by boat strikes and entanglements in fishing gear caused by changes in the whale s feeding patterns right whales typically feed on the copepod calanus finmarchicus a tiny shrimplike creature that is found in abundance in the gulf of maine but according to a paper published this month in the journal oceanography warming ocean water has reduced calanus finmarchicus in the gulf forcing the whales to hunt further north in the gulf of st lawrence a region with heavy shipping traffic the change in feeding habits also adds  to  additional miles   to  km distance from their breeding grounds off the coast of georgia the latest spike in mortality is particularly disappointing because in  the canadian government and the shipping industry negotiated for shipping lanes to be rerouted to avoid a feeding ground and whale nursery in the bay that shift which marked the first time lanes were moved to help a species reduced the risk of ship strikes by as much as  the change helped right whale populations grow from about  to almost  between  and  recent losses to the population includes a  year old female named punctuation that scientists have been tracking since  she gave birth to eight calves two of which had calves of their own scientists determined she died as a result of being hit by a ship of the whales lost over the past two months necropsies performed on seven found four died from trauma consistent with vessel collisions and two died from entanglement in fishing gear the spike in deaths comes after no right whales were recorded dying in canadian waters in  in the previous year  were found to have died in the st lawrence any loss of a right whale is detrimental to the population it s an endangered whale the department of fisheries biologist stephanie ratelle told cbc as a result of the recent losses canadian authorities are imposing a precautionary speed restriction of  knots in the western areas of st lawrence for vessels  meters or more in length those who fail to comply could face fines up to   ,Boeing Crisis,0.16233770549297333
8121,"Spain’s traffic authorities are deploying drones to help tackle drivers breaking the law as the annual August exodus begins.The General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) said it had 11 drones, three of which had been certified by the Spanish Meteorological Centre to gather evidence. The remote-controlled aircraft will monitor areas where accidents frequently happen and roads used by large numbers of cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians. They will also be used at large events that cause heavy traffic and to assist the emergency services.Photographic evidence gathered by the certified drones will be sent to civil guard traffic officers as soon as offences are committed, or relayed later to the relevant authorities. “In the early days of August, the three [certified] drones will be in the Canaries, where we don’t have helicopters, so we can cover things,” said a DGT spokesman. “After that they’ll be sent wherever they’re needed. There’s no set plan yet. The other eight will also be deployed wherever they’re needed depending on traffic flows.”The DGT said it was in the process of buying 20 more drones to be used for patrols and traffic control.It expects 47m long-distance trips will be made as Spain enters the summer holiday period. On Wednesday and Thursday of this week alone, the DGT estimates 2.9m long journeys will be undertaken – twice the average for the summer period.“Although 1 August is still the day when thousands of people begin their holidays, recent years have seen people choosing to break up their vacations and enjoy shorter periods away,” the directorate said. “That’s why the DGT will be deploying special traffic teams every weekend during the summer to assist drivers with their needs.” ",Spain deploys drones to monitor traffic blackspots,2019-08-01/12:15:36,spain s traffic authorities are deploying drones to help tackle drivers breaking the law as the annual august exodus begins the general directorate of traffic dgt said it had  drones three of which had been certified by the spanish meteorological centre to gather evidence the remote controlled aircraft will monitor areas where accidents frequently happen and roads used by large numbers of cyclists motorcyclists and pedestrians they will also be used at large events that cause heavy traffic and to assist the emergency services photographic evidence gathered by the certified drones will be sent to civil guard traffic officers as soon as offences are committed or relayed later to the relevant authorities in the early days of august the three certified drones will be in the canaries where we don t have helicopters so we can cover things said a dgt spokesman after that they ll be sent wherever they re needed there s no set plan yet the other eight will also be deployed wherever they re needed depending on traffic flows the dgt said it was in the process of buying  more drones to be used for patrols and traffic control it expects m long distance trips will be made as spain enters the summer holiday period on wednesday and thursday of this week alone the dgt estimates  m long journeys will be undertaken twice the average for the summer period although  august is still the day when thousands of people begin their holidays recent years have seen people choosing to break up their vacations and enjoy shorter periods away the directorate said that s why the dgt will be deploying special traffic teams every weekend during the summer to assist drivers with their needs ,Boeing Crisis,0.19810253381729126
8275,"Rail travellers face continued disruption on Sunday after record temperatures, thunderstorms and heavy rainfall played havoc with the transport network.A spokesman for East Midlands Trains told people to expect a significantly reduced service in and out of London at the weekend after an overhead line was damaged. Meanwhile, the number of flights arriving at airports continued to be restricted.Rail passengers were told to check before embarking on their journeys and were advised not to travel on the London St Pancras to Nottingham-Sheffield route. Replacement coaches and revised timetables were in place due to industrial action taken by conductors from the RMT union over pay and working conditions.East Midlands Trains apologised to passengers and advised that the continuing disruption to services on the Midland mainline route to London would continue during the weekend.“We’re sorry to everybody who has experienced disrupted journeys over the past two days,” Jake Kelly, the company’s managing director, said. “We do have a significantly reduced timetable in place on our London route over the weekend and our advice for customers is to avoid travelling on this route wherever possible and make alternative arrangements.”After the high temperatures of last week, a yellow weather warning for rain covering vast areas of Scotland and England, with the exception of the south-west region, has been issued until Sunday afternoon.Problems were not confined to the rail network. People found themselves sleeping on the floor around Heathrow airport on Friday night after a technical problem was identified at Swanwick air traffic control centre shortly after noon that day, which had restricted the rate of arrivals. A Heathrow spokesman said the technical issue, which caused a number of cancellations, had since been resolved. “We apologise to passengers for any disruption that this caused.”Gatwick said that, while it aimed to run a normal schedule, passengers were advised to check with their airlines for the latest information “due to ongoing adverse weather across Europe”.The disruption comes after the UK recorded maximum temperatures of 38.1C (100.6F) on Thursday – the second hottest day on record – while record highs were experienced in a number of western European countries.

8363,"A former jetski champion has failed in his effort to cross the Channel on his jet-power hoverboard.Franky Zapata fell into the sea as he attempted to land on a vessel to refuel halfway across the Channel.A member of the Frenchman’s team said the movement of the waves required perfect timing and the landing platform had shifted a few centimetres as Zapata came down.“We’re talking about a few centimetres. It’s an enormous disappointment…but he will definitely try again,” they said.Zapata, who was wearing a lifejacket, was not thought to have been injured.The 40-year-old military reservist had hoped to succeed in what he said was a “kid’s dream” on the 110th anniversary of the first aircraft crossing of the Channel by his aviator compatriot Louis Blériot.Zapata left a stretch of beach in Sangatte, near Calais, at 9.05am local time.Locals and television crews watched as the five mini turbo-jets on the Flyboard Air roared and he rose into the air heading disappearing over the sea.There followed about 10 nervous minutes before he arrived at a refuelling vessel in the middle of the Channel, where he was expected to stop for two minutes to change the backpack carrying the kerosene fuel powering the Flyboard.The landing platform is a metal structure measuring only one square metre. Zapata was supposed to land, throw off his backpack carrying the fuel and strap on another backpack with enough fuel to make it to St Margaret’s Bay near Dover.He covered 11 miles (18km) and reached the refuelling vessel in the middle of the Channel. The sea was not rough, but a slight movement of the landing platform because of waves threw him off balance and sent him into the water.Afterwards, Zapata was reportedly furious, blaming French maritime authorities for the failure of his challenge. Officials had apparently refused to allow the flying Frenchman to refuel his jet-propelled hoverboard in the air – one over French waters the other over UK waters – during the crossing, forcing him to attempt a landing on a vessel at sea. French media reported the “Anglo-Saxon” authorities were more relaxed about maritime regulations as long as other people were not put at risk.Zapata is reported to have fallen into the sea on the English side of the Channel and was rescued “conscious” by divers on the refuelling vessel.Zapata wowed crowds on 14 July – Bastille Day – flying over a military parade on Paris’s Place de la Concorde in the presence of The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.",Franky 'Flyboard' Zapata fails in attempt to cross Channel,2019-07-25/08:45:35,a former jetski champion has failed in his effort to cross the channel on his jet power hoverboard franky zapata fell into the sea as he attempted to land on a vessel to refuel halfway across the channel a member of the frenchman s team said the movement of the waves required perfect timing and the landing platform had shifted a few centimetres as zapata came down we re talking about a few centimetres it s an enormous disappointment but he will definitely try again they said zapata who was wearing a lifejacket was not thought to have been injured the  year old military reservist had hoped to succeed in what he said was a kid s dream on the th anniversary of the first aircraft crossing of the channel by his aviator compatriot louis blériot zapata left a stretch of beach in sangatte near calais at  am local time locals and television crews watched as the five mini turbo jets on the flyboard air roared and he rose into the air heading disappearing over the sea there followed about  nervous minutes before he arrived at a refuelling vessel in the middle of the channel where he was expected to stop for two minutes to change the backpack carrying the kerosene fuel powering the flyboard the landing platform is a metal structure measuring only one square metre zapata was supposed to land throw off his backpack carrying the fuel and strap on another backpack with enough fuel to make it to st margaret s bay near dover he covered  miles km and reached the refuelling vessel in the middle of the channel the sea was not rough but a slight movement of the landing platform because of waves threw him off balance and sent him into the water afterwards zapata was reportedly furious blaming french maritime authorities for the failure of his challenge officials had apparently refused to allow the flying frenchman to refuel his jet propelled hoverboard in the air one over french waters the other over uk waters during the crossing forcing him to attempt a landing on a vessel at sea french media reported the anglo saxon authorities were more relaxed about maritime regulations as long as other people were not put at risk zapata is reported to have fallen into the sea on the english side of the channel and was rescued conscious by divers on the refuelling vessel zapata wowed crowds on  july bastille day flying over a military parade on paris s place de la concorde in the presence of the french president emmanuel macron and the german chancellor angela merkel ,Boeing Crisis,0.14830927550792694
8469,"More than 500,000 Volvo cars are being recalled worldwide, including 70,000 in the UK, because of a fire risk in the engine.The manufacturer said a plastic part in the engine has, in rare cases, been liable to melt and deform, resulting in a possible engine fire. The affected models have four-cylinder diesel engines and are 2014-2019 versions of the following cars: S80, S60, V70, XC70, S60 Cross Country, V60, XC60, V60 Cross Country, S90, V90, V90 Cross Country, XC90, V40 and V40 Cross Country.A spokesman said there had only been “a few” fires to date, with no reports of injuries. Letters have been sent to owners of the affected cars. Drivers have been told it is safe to continue using their vehicle but Volvo said they should be aware of the potential problem and “symptoms” in the car, including lack of power, and should pay attention if the engine warning light comes on.The manufacturer plans to contact owners again to notify them of a fix when it becomes available.In a statement, Volvo said: “We take this situation very seriously and are working to finalise a fix for the cars.“We are taking full responsibility to ensure the highest quality and safety standards of our cars.

8474,"India’s mission to the moon has blasted into space one week after a technical glitch forced scientists to abruptly halt its scheduled launch.Thousands gathered to watch Chandrayaan-2 take off at 2.43pm local time (0913 GMT) on Monday from Satish Dhawan space centre in Sriharikota, north of Chennai. Last Monday, the unmanned mission was aborted 56 minutes from takeoff. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) blamed a “technical snag”. Indian media later reported that scientists had found a leak while filling helium in the rocket’s cryogenic engine.In a speech after the launch, Kailasavadivoo Sivan, chairman of Isro, said the agency’s staff had worked tirelessly to fix the fault and had “bounced back with flying colours”.“It is the beginning of a historical journey of India towards the moon, and to land at a place near the south pole to carry out scientific experiments to explore the unexplored,” said Sivan.Scientists in the control room applauded as the spacecraft launched into space. It will spend 23 days in the Earth’s orbit, before beginning a series of manoeuvres that will take it into lunar orbit.With India poised to become the world’s fifth-largest economy, Narendra Modi’s ardently nationalist government is eager to show off the country’s prowess in security and technology.On Monday the prime minister tweeted: “The launch of #Chandrayaan2 illustrates the prowess of our scientists and the determination of 130 crore [1.3 billion] Indians to scale new frontiers of science. Every Indian is immensely proud today!”It was, he added, a “fully indigenous” project, using Indian technology.Chandrayaan-2 aims to become the first mission to conduct a surface landing on the lunar south pole region, where it will collect crucial information about the moon’s composition. It would be India’s first surface landing on the moon – a feat previously achieved by only Russia, the US and China.The $141m (£113m) mission is a “demonstration of the growing sophistication of India’s space power”, said Dr Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, head of the nuclear and space policy initiative at the Observer Research Foundation thinktank in Delhi.India launched its first lunar probe in 2008, and guided a spacecraft into orbit around Mars in 2014. Its space programmes are famously thrifty, and its Mars mission, Modi has joked, had a smaller budget than that of the film Gravity.India’s achievements in space have been hailed by Modi as a mark of the country’s rising ambition as a global power. In March, he announced that the country had successfully shot down one of its own satellites with a missile. Though celebrated by Modi as a breakthrough for India’s national security, the missile test was criticised by Nasa for creating hundreds of pieces of orbital debris and threatening astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS).The launch of Chandrayaan-2 follows the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, and comes amid renewed interest in returning to the moon among states and private industry. In January China landed the Chang’e 4 spacecraft on the previously unexplored far side of the moon, while in April the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, the first privately funded mission to the moon, crashed after an apparent engine failure. Donald Trump has also said he wants to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024.Chandrayaan-2 – Sanskrit for “moon craft” – is India’s most ambitious space mission yet. Its first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, helped to confirm the presence of water on the moon, but did so without landing on the lunar surface. Sivan said carrying out a soft landing would be “15 terrifying minutes”.At the forefront of the Chandrayaan-2 mission are two women. Its project director, Muthayya Vanitha, an electronics system engineer, was named by the science journal Nature as one of five scientists to watch in 2019. It is also being navigated by Ritu Karidhal, who helped to lead India’s Mars mission in 2014. It will take more than six weeks to travel about 238,600 miles (384,000km) to the moon. The four-tonne spacecraft has a lunar orbiter, a lander named Vikram after the founder of Isro, and a rover. The rover, named Pragyan, which means “wisdom” in Sanskrit, will spend two weeks traversing the moon’s surface. The six-wheeled vehicle, which will be deployed in early September, will collect crucial information about the mineral and chemical composition of the lunar surface, and search for water.The lunar south pole is interesting to scientists because they believe water may be present on its vast shadowed areas. The lunar south pole also has craters that are cold traps and which contain a fossil record of the early solar system, according to Isro.As well as Chandrayaan-2, India has said it aims to send three astronauts into space by 2022.",India's Chandrayaan-2 moon mission lifts off a week after aborted launch,2019-07-22/11:30:02,india s mission to the moon has blasted into space one week after a technical glitch forced scientists to abruptly halt its scheduled launch thousands gathered to watch chandrayaan  take off at  pm local time  gmt on monday from satish dhawan space centre in sriharikota north of chennai last monday the unmanned mission was aborted  minutes from takeoff the indian space research organisation isro blamed a technical snag indian media later reported that scientists had found a leak while filling helium in the rocket s cryogenic engine in a speech after the launch kailasavadivoo sivan chairman of isro said the agency s staff had worked tirelessly to fix the fault and had bounced back with flying colours it is the beginning of a historical journey of india towards the moon and to land at a place near the south pole to carry out scientific experiments to explore the unexplored said sivan scientists in the control room applauded as the spacecraft launched into space it will spend  days in the earth s orbit before beginning a series of manoeuvres that will take it into lunar orbit with india poised to become the world s fifth largest economy narendra modi s ardently nationalist government is eager to show off the country s prowess in security and technology on monday the prime minister tweeted the launch of chandrayaan illustrates the prowess of our scientists and the determination of  crore   billion indians to scale new frontiers of science every indian is immensely proud today it was he added a fully indigenous project using indian technology chandrayaan  aims to become the first mission to conduct a surface landing on the lunar south pole region where it will collect crucial information about the moon s composition it would be india s first surface landing on the moon a feat previously achieved by only russia the us and china the m m mission is a demonstration of the growing sophistication of india s space power said dr rajeswari pillai rajagopalan head of the nuclear and space policy initiative at the observer research foundation thinktank in delhi india launched its first lunar probe in  and guided a spacecraft into orbit around mars in  its space programmes are famously thrifty and its mars mission modi has joked had a smaller budget than that of the film gravity india s achievements in space have been hailed by modi as a mark of the country s rising ambition as a global power in march he announced that the country had successfully shot down one of its own satellites with a missile though celebrated by modi as a breakthrough for india s national security the missile test was criticised by nasa for creating hundreds of pieces of orbital debris and threatening astronauts onboard the international space station iss the launch of chandrayaan  follows the th anniversary of the apollo  landing and comes amid renewed interest in returning to the moon among states and private industry in january china landed the chang e  spacecraft on the previously unexplored far side of the moon while in april the israeli spacecraft beresheet the first privately funded mission to the moon crashed after an apparent engine failure donald trump has also said he wants to put astronauts back on the moon by  chandrayaan  sanskrit for moon craft is india s most ambitious space mission yet its first lunar mission chandrayaan  helped to confirm the presence of water on the moon but did so without landing on the lunar surface sivan said carrying out a soft landing would be  terrifying minutes at the forefront of the chandrayaan  mission are two women its project director muthayya vanitha an electronics system engineer was named by the science journal nature as one of five scientists to watch in  it is also being navigated by ritu karidhal who helped to lead india s mars mission in  it will take more than six weeks to travel about   miles  km to the moon the four tonne spacecraft has a lunar orbiter a lander named vikram after the founder of isro and a rover the rover named pragyan which means wisdom in sanskrit will spend two weeks traversing the moon s surface the six wheeled vehicle which will be deployed in early september will collect crucial information about the mineral and chemical composition of the lunar surface and search for water the lunar south pole is interesting to scientists because they believe water may be present on its vast shadowed areas the lunar south pole also has craters that are cold traps and which contain a fossil record of the early solar system according to isro as well as chandrayaan  india has said it aims to send three astronauts into space by  ,Boeing Crisis,0.2546320855617523
8505,"A former jetski champion and French military reservist who became known as the “flying soldier” after he invented a jet-powered hoverboard will attempt to cross the Channel this week.Franky Zapata, who impressed France with a demonstration of his flyboard at this year’s Bastille Day parade, has said he will make the crossing on Thursday to mark the 110th anniversary of Louis Blériot’s first cross-Channel airplane flight.Zapata, 40, expects to cross from Sangatte near Calais to St Margaret’s Bay near Dover in 20 minutes, refuelling halfway and reaching speeds of up to 86.9mph (140km/h).“It’s the realisation of a dream,” the inventor told Le Parisien, adding that he was “very stressed”. He said the Bastille Day demonstration was easy by comparison.“I used 3% of the machine’s capabilities and I’ll need 99% for the Channel. It won’t be easy at all and I reckon I’ve a 30% chance of succeeding,” he said.Zapata said his flight had been approved by civil aviation authorities but not maritime officials who insisted stationing a ship to refuel the flyboard would pose a risk to shipping in the busy Channel.“We have advised against the crossing because it is extremely dangerous given the traffic in the Channel, one of the busiest (shipping) straits in the world,” the French maritime authority said.An official added that authorities were not banning the crossing and had asked Zapata to inform the French coastal search and rescue team before he took off “in case of any problems”.Zapata said the decision had forced him to refuel once midway, instead of twice as he had planned – once in French waters, once in UK waters.“This has made the challenge 10 times more difficult,” Zapata said. “It’s a completely arbitrary and unreasonable decision.”He added that the take-off time would depend on weather conditions and he had not yet decided whether to refuel the kerosene-powered flyboard by landing on a ship or hovering over it, the latter being more risky but which would enable him to claim a true “cross-Channel flight”.At France’s Bastille Day parade on 14 July, the president, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and other European leaders watched as Zapata flew above the Champs-Elysées brandishing a rifle.Florence Parly, the French armed forces minister, said the flyboard could be “tested for different kinds of uses, for example as a flying logistical platform or, indeed, as an assault platform”.Zapata was awarded a €1.3m grant for his Flyboard Air from the French government defence and procurement agency) last December. It is powered by five mini turbo engines and can run autonomously for about 10 minutes and reach speeds of up to 118mph (190km/h).",French inventor to attempt to cross Channel on jet-powered flyboard,2019-07-21/14:44:22,a former jetski champion and french military reservist who became known as the flying soldier after he invented a jet powered hoverboard will attempt to cross the channel this week franky zapata who impressed france with a demonstration of his flyboard at this year s bastille day parade has said he will make the crossing on thursday to mark the th anniversary of louis blériot s first cross channel airplane flight zapata  expects to cross from sangatte near calais to st margaret s bay near dover in  minutes refuelling halfway and reaching speeds of up to  mph km h it s the realisation of a dream the inventor told le parisien adding that he was very stressed he said the bastille day demonstration was easy by comparison i used  of the machine s capabilities and i ll need  for the channel it won t be easy at all and i reckon i ve a  chance of succeeding he said zapata said his flight had been approved by civil aviation authorities but not maritime officials who insisted stationing a ship to refuel the flyboard would pose a risk to shipping in the busy channel we have advised against the crossing because it is extremely dangerous given the traffic in the channel one of the busiest shipping straits in the world the french maritime authority said an official added that authorities were not banning the crossing and had asked zapata to inform the french coastal search and rescue team before he took off in case of any problems zapata said the decision had forced him to refuel once midway instead of twice as he had planned once in french waters once in uk waters this has made the challenge  times more difficult zapata said it s a completely arbitrary and unreasonable decision he added that the take off time would depend on weather conditions and he had not yet decided whether to refuel the kerosene powered flyboard by landing on a ship or hovering over it the latter being more risky but which would enable him to claim a true cross channel flight at france s bastille day parade on  july the president emmanuel macron angela merkel and other european leaders watched as zapata flew above the champs elysées brandishing a rifle florence parly the french armed forces minister said the flyboard could be tested for different kinds of uses for example as a flying logistical platform or indeed as an assault platform zapata was awarded a  m grant for his flyboard air from the french government defence and procurement agency last december it is powered by five mini turbo engines and can run autonomously for about  minutes and reach speeds of up to mph km h ,Boeing Crisis,0.19018718600273132
8531,"British Airways has suspended all flights to Cairo for seven days as a security precaution.The airline made the surprise announcement last night that all flights into the Egyptian capital were halted.A statement said: “We constantly review our security arrangements at all our airports around the world, and have suspended flights to Cairo for seven days as a precaution to allow for further assessment. The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our priority, and we would never operate an aircraft unless it was safe to do so.”Lufthansa, which operates routes from Frankfurt and Munich, said: “As safety is the number one priority of Lufthansa, the airline has temporarily suspended its flights to Cairo today as a precaution, while further assessment is being made.”Lufthansa said is planned to resume flights on Sunday.The airline said in a statement: “As safety is the number one priority of Lufthansa, the airline temporarily suspended its flights to Cairo on July 20 as a precaution. Egyptian officials, cited by the Reuters news agency said Cairo’s international airport was notified by the airline that it was suspending flights to and from London for two days. Airport officials said the decision came after British security officials conducted routine security checks earlier this week.However, Ahmed Fawzi, chairman of the Cairo Airport Company, told Egyptian newspaper Al Shorouk that British Airways did not inform them of any concerns regarding airport security prior to cancelling flights. He said Cairo airport had not received any notification of British Airways’ decision, and blamed it on “an internal affair inside the company”.A second Egyptian newspaper, Al Masry Al Youm, cited Egypt’s ministry of civil aviation, which emphasised the one-week suspension did not mean a permanent halt to flights. Officials said the decision was one of “security and political measures that are concerned with internal affairs, and not those of Egypt”, and pointed to a series of upcoming of strikes expected to take place at Heathrow Airport.The ministry claimed UK security checks last week, which included Cairo and Egypt’s second busiest Hurghada airport, resulted in “excellent ratings” for both airports. They said all other airlines were operating as usual at Cairo airport. Egyptair, which also flies between London and Cairo, said its flights were unaffected.BA told the Department for Transport of its suspension decision ahead of the announcement. A government spokesman said: “We are aware that British Airways is notifying passengers it has decided to suspend flights to Cairo temporarily.”The Foreign Office updated its advice to travellers to Egypt yesterday advising travellers affected to contact the airline. The FCO has warned against any travel to and from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, following the bombing of a Russian passenger jet in 2015 which killed 224 passengers and crew but has not issued similar warnings against travel to and from Cairo.Egypt’s government has been pressing for a resumption of flights to Sharm el-Sheikh. MPs questioning transport ministers in parliament said Egypt has invested nearly £20m to improve security failings the UK government had highlighted. It also employed a UK-security firm, Restrata, to train more than 6,000 Egyptian airport security staff in a bid to get flights restarted.“There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures are in place for flights departing from Egypt to the UK,” the British advice said. An estimated 415,000 British nationals visited Egypt in 2018, according to the FCO.Passengers alerted before boarding last night’s flight used social media to show a letter handed out by British Airways warning that security was behind the decision.“Currently about to board a British Airways flight to Cairo and it’s cancelled,” one affected flyer wrote. “Not for a day. Not for two days but for seven. Security risk.

8561,"The swift return of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft to the skies was put further in doubt this week with airlines signalling that they do not hope to operate the plane any time soon.With more than four months already elapsed since the plane was grounded by regulators, Southwest and American, two of the jet’s main US operators, followed United Airlines in saying they would be taking the Max out of their schedules until November.Ryanair, Europe’s biggest short-haul carrier, also announced it would have to curb expansion plans pinned on the arrival of its 737 Max orders and that some airport bases would have to shut as a result.Making the announcement on Tuesday, its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said he remained committed to the plane: “We’ve described them as gamechangers – and they remain gamechangers.”But O’Leary admitted even its biggest customers – Ryanair has ordered 135 models – have little visibility on its immediate future: “We’re still operating in the realms of considerable uncertainty ... there are no guarantees.”According to one report, the 737 Max might not return until next year as Boeing searches to fix the design flaws behind two deadly crashes. Boeing’s top-selling plane, with around 5,000 on order worldwide, was pulled from service after an Ethiopian Airlines crash outside Addis Ababa in March that killed all 157 people on board. It was the 737 Max’s second disaster in five months, after 189 people were killed on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October.Elsewhere this week, it became clear that restoring trust among passengers could take longer than fixing the plane. In Washington, relatives of passengers who died in the Ethiopian disaster told Congressional hearings that Boeing had focused on profits “at the expense of human life”. In a blistering attack on the manufacturer and the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Paul Njoroge, who lost five family members including his wife and three children in the crash, warned that, without change, “another plane will dive to the ground, killing me, you”.Boeing released an initial $50m (£40m) in compensation for the bereaved on Wednesday, as part of a $100m fund it has set aside for victims’ families. The aerospace group also announced on Thursday it would take a $4.9bn charge reflecting the cost of compensation to airlines for schedule disruptions and a slowdown in production.Weeks of silence on the software issues at the centre of the crash investigations will worry airlines. Investigators are focusing on the 737 Max’s new anti-stall software, the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was designed to keep the aircraft stable in flight. In both cases they suspect that the MCAS software – which automatically pushes the aircraft’s nose down to guard against a loss of lift – was activated by erroneous data from a single sensor. This forced the aircraft into dives that the pilots, ultimately, could not stop.In the wake of the Lion Air crash in October, Boeing started work on a fix. But in late June, when Boeing and the FAA appeared to be reaching a conclusion, they instead revealed a second flaw had been discovered, beyond MCAS. It was another “potential source of uncommanded stabiliser motion”. Or, another way the plane’s computers might battle unwitting pilots in the cockpit, should it think its nose would be better pointing down.According to the global airline body, Iata, restoring the plane to service would take another five weeks from regulatory approval by the FAA. Boeing hopes to present its full bid for recertification in September, but the US carriers’ rescheduling moves show they do not envisage an immediate sign-off.Approval is likely to be checked by non-US regulators, virtually all of whom grounded the plane before the FAA. That schism caused profound concern in the aviation industry and the FAA is unlikely to go it alone now. Iata, which hosted a summit to urge regulators to align, warned that aviation relied on “mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators ... Restoring public confidence demands it.”Retraining 737 Max pilots is another moot question. The Max was sold as an upgrade to the existing, bestselling 737, rather than as a new type: removing the expense of extra training, beyond a short iPad session. Many pilots doubt this was enough – redoubled since the Ethiopian crash, where flight crew had followed Boeing’s instructions and reminders after the Lion Air disaster. Should Boeing and the FAA decide it necessary to refer Max pilots to simulators – even as a confidence-restoring measure – further delays would ensue. This would hit early adopters such as Norwegian, who are deep in the red and desperate for the economies the Max would bring.Some have more radical suggestions. Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and former US presidential candidate, whose grand-niece Samya Stumo died in the Ethiopia crash, has demanded a full, transparent review of the aircraft before recertification. He says the review should be overseen by a public panel including victims’ families, pilots, cabin crew and mechanics, as well as the FAA experts.Some think the plane may never fly again – at least as the Max. Donald Trump has already tweeted a suggestion to change the name. Boeing executives at June’s Paris Air Show appeared to consider a rebrand, but the idea was slapped down by the boss. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said he did not “see the need”, adding: “This is not a marketing or branding exercise. Certainly it impacts the public view, but the most important thing is safety.”Yet a Ryanair Max 200 emerging from the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, this week had the designation “737-8200” on the nose cone, instead of the 737 Max seen on other planes. Who oversaw the paint job remains a mystery. Boeing indicated it was a question for Ryanair, but O’Leary later said it was “nothing to do with us ... We just put the names and a big Ryanair on them.”O’Leary does not anticipate customer concerns when the planes are certified and delivered, pointing to the example of the 787 Dreamliner. The 787 was temporarily grounded due to safety concerns in 2013 but is now popular with the public, he said. Likewise, the Max “will be warmly welcomed by passengers who fly on them”.O’Leary added: “The [Max 737] operating costs are phenomenal; the fuel consumption, and additional revenue opportunity, while still operating with only four cabin crew,. If Boeing could deliver them tomorrow, we’d take them.”",Boeing Max 737: airlines delay plane's return until November,2019-07-19/17:59:01,the swift return of boeing s  max aircraft to the skies was

8569,"More than half a century of lunar exploration has left its mark on the moon. What Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin described as the “magnificent desolation” of the relentlessly grey surface is littered with clapped-out robots, spacecraft parts, moon buggies (including one with a bible on the dashboard) and technical equipment.Scattered around the Apollo landing sites are other items that were never meant to come home: a falcon’s feather, a javelin, bags of human waste, a family photo and an aluminium figure, the Fallen Astronaut, which lies on its side near a plaque bearing the names of 14 men who died in the pursuit of space exploration.In all, the lunar junkyard holds nearly 200 tonnes of human objects. The dusty remains of five Saturn V rocket stages from the Apollo missions are the heaviest single items. Then there are the wreckages of spacecraft that smashed, or were crashed intentionally at the end of their missions, into the lunar surface. There are a dozen 1960s Soviet Luna probes; nearly twice as many US Rangers, Lunar Orbiters, Surveyors and more recent observatories; at least four Japanese spacecraft, and other robots sent from Europe, China and India. In April, the mangled remains of the first private moon mission, Israel Aerospace Industries’ Beresheet probe, became the latest addition when the lander’s gyroscopes failed.More striking are those that met a more gentle end. Besides all the wreckages strewn across the moon are robotic landers and rovers that simply fell silent, their batteries spent or their hardware worn out. The Luna 9, the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing, is there on the western edge of the near side of the moon. So is the Soviets’ magnificent, eight-wheeled Lunokhod 1, the first lunar rover, which in 1970 trundled around the Mare Imbrium, or Sea of Rains. Joining them in the lunar graveyard are Surveyor 1, the first of several American probes to land softly on the surface, and three moon buggies discarded by Apollo 15, 16 and 17. James Irwin, an Apollo 15 astronaut, left a bible on the dashboard of his mission’s buggy. The most recent rover to shut down on the moon was China’s Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, which has not been heard from since 2015.Beyond the crashed, the ditched and the broken down are pieces of equipment and personal effects that astronauts left behind. The least charming are 96 bags for poo, urine and vomit that scientists, being scientists, are keen to get their hands on should the opportunity arise. More difficult to find will be the two golf balls that the Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard hit for “miles and miles” and the metal rod, described by Nasa as a “javelin”, lobbed by Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man on the moon.The crew of Apollo 15 carried an 8.5cm-tall aluminium figure to the moon. Created by the Belgian artist Paul Van Hoeydonck, the Fallen Astronaut was laid on its side with a plaque listing the names of astronauts and cosmonauts who died during the space race. At the end of Apollo 15’s final moonwalk, David Scott pulled out a falcon’s feather and a hammer and demonstrated Galileo’s theory that in the absence of air resistance, different objects fall at the same rate. The items are still there, along with 12 pairs of boots; one hundred $2 bills taken into space as good luck charms; a small gold olive branch left by Neil Armstrong as a symbol of peace; and a family photo placed on the ground by Charles Duke, the Apollo 16 astronaut who in 1972 became the 10th and youngest person to walk on the moon.There is an abundance of technical junk there, too. The Apollo landing sites are littered with cameras, power packs, tongs, drills, towels, brushes, rakes and trenching tools, and scientific experiments that measured dust, seismic vibrations and the solar wind. Some of the artefacts still serve a scientific purpose. Retroreflectors installed on the moon by the Apollo astronauts and the Lunokhod 1 and 2 missions have been used to measure the Earth-moon distance with laser beams for the past 50 years.The parts and pieces that dot the surface are only the most physical remnants of humanity’s intimate encounter with the moon. Less enduring are the marks in the ground, the footprints first made 50 years ago.",Moon buggies and bags of poo: what humans left on the moon,2019-07-19/14:07:32,more than half a century of lunar exploration has left its mark on the moon what edwin buzz aldrin described as the magnificent desolation of the relentlessly grey surface is littered with clapped out robots spacecraft parts moon buggies including one with a bible on the dashboard and technical equipment scattered around the apollo landing sites are other items that were never meant to come home a falcon s feather a javelin bags of human waste a family photo and an aluminium figure the fallen astronaut which lies on its side near a plaque bearing the names of  men who died in the pursuit of space exploration in all the lunar junkyard holds nearly  tonnes of human objects the dusty remains of five saturn v rocket stages from the apollo missions are the heaviest single items then there are the wreckages of spacecraft that smashed or were crashed intentionally at the end of their missions into the lunar surface there are a dozen s soviet luna probes nearly twice as many us rangers lunar orbiters surveyors and more recent observatories at least four japanese spacecraft and other robots sent from europe china and india in april the mangled remains of the first private moon mission israel aerospace industries beresheet probe became the latest addition when the lander s gyroscopes failed more striking are those that met a more gentle end besides all the wreckages strewn across the moon are robotic landers and rovers that simply fell silent their batteries spent or their hardware worn out the luna  the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing is there on the western edge of the near side of the moon so is the soviets magnificent eight wheeled lunokhod  the first lunar rover which in  trundled around the mare imbrium or sea of rains joining them in the lunar graveyard are surveyor  the first of several american probes to land softly on the surface and three moon buggies discarded by apollo   and  james irwin an apollo  astronaut left a bible on the dashboard of his mission s buggy the most recent rover to shut down on the moon was china s yutu or jade rabbit which has not been heard from since  beyond the crashed the ditched and the broken down are pieces of equipment and personal effects that astronauts left behind the least charming are  bags for poo urine and vomit that scientists being scientists are keen to get their hands on should the opportunity arise more difficult to find will be the two golf balls that the apollo  astronaut alan shepard hit for miles and miles and the metal rod described by nasa as a javelin lobbed by edgar mitchell the sixth man on the moon the crew of apollo  carried an  cm tall aluminium figure to the moon created by the belgian artist paul van hoeydonck the fallen astronaut was laid on its side with a plaque listing the names of astronauts and cosmonauts who died during the space race at the end of apollo  s final moonwalk david scott pulled out a falcon s feather and a hammer and demonstrated galileo s theory that in the absence of air resistance different objects fall at the same rate the items are still there along with  pairs of boots one hundred  bills taken into space as good luck charms a small gold olive branch left by neil armstrong as a symbol of peace and a family photo placed on the ground by charles duke the apollo  astronaut who in  became the th and youngest person to walk on the moon there is an abundance of technical junk there too the apollo landing sites are littered with cameras power packs tongs drills towels brushes rakes and trenching tools and scientific experiments that measured dust seismic vibrations and the solar wind some of the artefacts still serve a scientific purpose retroreflectors installed on the moon by the apollo astronauts and the lunokhod  and  missions have been used to measure the earth moon distance with laser beams for the past  years the parts and pieces that dot the surface are only the most physical remnants of humanity s intimate encounter with the moon less enduring are the marks in the ground the footprints first made  years ago ,Boeing Crisis,0.2566838264465332
8634,"The Dutch airline KLM is facing a storm of protest after warning that women who breastfeed their babies on its flights may be asked to cover up to avoid offending other passengers.The company’s policy emerged after a woman claimed on Facebook she had been asked to shield herself from view while feeding her one-year-old on a flight between San Francisco and Amsterdam last month.Shelby Angel, from Sacramento in California, said a flight attendant had approached her with a blanket, which she refused, saying she felt “uncomfortable and disrespected”.Angel said she always sought to be discreet but that her daughter did not like to be covered. After complaining to KLM she was told it was the airline’s official policy and that passengers needed to be “respectful of people of other cultures”.A KLM Twitter account later tweeted in response to the criticism prompted by the woman’s Facebook post, confirming that “to ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board, we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding, should other passengers be offended by this”.Breastfeeding is permitted at KLM flights. However, to ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board, we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding, should other passengers be offended by this.It added: “As an international airline company, we transport passengers with a variety of backgrounds. Not all passengers feel comfortable with breastfeeding in their vicinity and sometimes these passengers complain to the cabin staff.”The response has led to other airlines being asked on social media to explain their stance. British Airways said it did not have an official policy but that passengers who required privacy should “please speak with one of the crew when you are board”.KLM, which recently sought to burnish its credentials as an environmentally conscious airline by encouraging passengers to take fewer flights, has been accused of stigmatising mothers.Niki Kandirikirira, from the Equality Now lobby group, said: “Negative attitudes about breastfeeding in public stem from the over-sexualisation of women’s bodies. Breastfeeding is a totally natural process and women should have the freedom to do it wherever and whenever they want, rather than being forced to hide as if they are doing something inappropriate.”Physicians and health campaigners have expressed their frustration on social media at the “antiquated” policy of the airline.One doctor tweeted: “I find it uncomfortable and offensive when people chew with their mouths open, infinitely more so than breastfeeding. Can you cover up the heads of passengers who do so with a blanket? Thanks!”The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that babies be breastfed exclusively for their first six months, then have a diet of breast milk and other food until they are two years old or beyond.The NHS advises new mothers that breastfeeding reduces a baby’s risk of infection, diarrhoea and vomiting, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood leukaemia, obesity and cardiovascular disease in adulthood.Ayala Ochert, from the campaign group Better Breastfeeding, said: “In their effort to avoid offence in the tiny minority of people disturbed by the sight of a child feeding, KLM has instead chosen to offend a mother trying to feed and nurture her child.”The chief executive of the Breastfeeding Network, Shereen Fisher, added: “Companies and employers should be taking a lead on supporting and protecting breastfeeding.“The recent poor treatment of a KLM customer who happened to also be a breastfeeding mother is another disappointing example of how treating people badly is not only bad for business but perpetuates a myth that breastfeeding in a public space is likely to invite controversy.“Many mothers tell us they already feel isolated and embarrassed when breastfeeding, despite the irony of most of us being surrounded by images of nudity from a young age.“Employers and providers of services can play an important role in putting women and their families at ease by supporting breastfeeding, which is a normal feeding practice across all societies and cultures. The law offers women protection to feed whenever and wherever they like and companies like KLM should take note of this.”The airline said in a statement: “We would like to emphasise that breastfeeding is permitted on KLM flights. However, we strive to ensure that all of our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable onboard.”• This article was amended on 24 July 2019 to give the full WHO recommendation on breastfeeding.",KLM tells breastfeeding women they may be asked to cover up,2019-07-17/18:14:31,the dutch airline klm is facing a storm of protest after warning that women who breastfeed their babies on its flights may be asked to cover up to avoid offending other passengers the company s policy emerged after a woman claimed on facebook she had been asked to shield herself from view while feeding her one year old on a flight between san francisco and amsterdam last month shelby angel from sacramento in california said a flight attendant had approached her with a blanket which she refused saying she felt uncomfortable and disrespected angel said she always sought to be discreet but that her daughter did not like to be covered after complaining to klm she was told it was the airline s official policy and that passengers needed to be respectful of people of other cultures a klm twitter account later tweeted in response to the criticism prompted by the woman s facebook post confirming that to ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding should other passengers be offended by this breastfeeding is permitted at klm flights however to ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding should other passengers be offended by this it added as an international airline company we transport passengers with a variety of backgrounds not all passengers feel comfortable with breastfeeding in their vicinity and sometimes these passengers complain to the cabin staff the response has led to other airlines being asked on social media to explain their stance british airways said it did not have an official policy but that passengers who required privacy should please speak with one of the crew when you are board klm which recently sought to burnish its credentials as an environmentally conscious airline by encouraging passengers to take fewer flights has been accused of stigmatising mothers niki kandirikirira from the equality now lobby group said negative attitudes about breastfeeding in public stem from the over sexualisation of women s bodies breastfeeding is a totally natural process and women should have the freedom to do it wherever and whenever they want rather than being forced to hide as if they are doing something inappropriate physicians and health campaigners have expressed their frustration on social media at the antiquated policy of the airline one doctor tweeted i find it uncomfortable and offensive when people chew with their mouths open infinitely more so than breastfeeding can you cover up the heads of passengers who do so with a blanket thanks the world health organization who recommends that babies be breastfed exclusively for their first six months then have a diet of breast milk and other food until they are two years old or beyond the nhs advises new mothers that breastfeeding reduces a baby s risk of infection diarrhoea and vomiting sudden infant death syndrome childhood leukaemia obesity and cardiovascular disease in adulthood ayala ochert from the campaign group better breastfeeding said in their effort to avoid offence in the tiny minority of people disturbed by the sight of a child feeding klm has instead chosen to offend a mother trying to feed and nurture her child the chief executive of the breastfeeding network shereen fisher added companies and employers should be taking a lead on supporting and protecting breastfeeding the recent poor treatment of a klm customer who happened to also be a breastfeeding mother is another disappointing example of how treating people badly is not only bad for business but perpetuates a myth that breastfeeding in a public space is likely to invite controversy many mothers tell us they already feel isolated and embarrassed when breastfeeding despite the irony of most of us being surrounded by images of nudity from a young age employers and providers of services can play an important role in putting women and their families at ease by supporting breastfeeding which is a normal feeding practice across all societies and cultures the law offers women protection to feed whenever and wherever they like and companies like klm should take note of this the airline said in a statement we would like to emphasise that breastfeeding is permitted on klm flights however we strive to ensure that all of our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable onboard this article was amended on  july  to give the full who recommendation on breastfeeding ,Boeing Crisis,0.1726805865764618
8638,"A father whose five family members, including three children, died when a Boeing 737 Max jet crashed in Ethiopia in March, accused the company of “utter prejudice and disrespect” and warned there would be more deaths unless action is taken.Paul Njoroge’s wife, mother-in-law and three young children died when Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed on 10 March, shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. All 157 passengers and crew members aboard were killed.The congressional hearing in Washington at which Njoroge spoke comes in the wake of two fatal crashes involving Boeing 737 Maxes that killed 346 people and which have triggered investigations and lawsuits around the world.In blistering testimony, Njoroge said Boeing’s focus on share price and profits “at the expense of the safety of human life” and its cosy relationship with its US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), had led to the two crashes and cost him his family.In prepared notes, Njoroge wrote: “I miss their laughter, their playfulness, their touch. I am empty. I feel that I should have been on that plane with them. My life has no meaning. It is difficult for me to think of anything else but the horror they must have felt. I cannot get it out of my mind.”Unless Boeing’s conduct is addressed “another plane will dive to the ground killing me, you”, Njoroge told Congress.Njoroge said Boeing had moved to blame “foreign pilots” after a Lion Air 737 Max crashed into the Java Sea in October 2018. He said Boeing’s insinuation of pilot error allowed it to keep flying the plane – and that led directly to the death of his family.As investigations have continued, it now appears that a software system called MCASs, which is designed to automatically prevent stalling, was central to both crashes.Njoroge said: “I speak for all of the families who lost loved ones whom they will never see again and who were tragically torn from their lives because of reckless conduct on the part of so many. Particularly Boeing, a company who became steadfast in its single-minded quest to place blame on so-called ‘foreign pilots’.”He went on: “In Canada, Independence Day was celebrated on 1 July. I stayed buried in my little house, in my grief, hearing the sounds of celebration and fireworks in the sky. But all I could think about was the 737 Max struggling to gain height and eventually diving to the ground, killing my whole family and 152 others.”Boeing’s fleet of 737 Maxes remain grounded. Last month, US regulators said they had found more problems with the airplanes after a simulator test, leading United and Southwest airlines to extend their bans on flying the 737 Max.The company appears to be planning to rebrand the plane before it is given the all-clear.

8647,"French prosecutors have recommended that Air France face trial for manslaughter and negligence over the 2009 crash of a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in which 228 people died.Prosecutors concluded that Air France was aware of technical problems with a key speed-measuring instrument on its Airbus A330 plane, but had failed to inform or train pilots on how to resolve the issue, according to an investigation document seen by Agence France-Presse.Flight AF447 plunged into the Atlantic during a storm on 1 June 2009. A defect with the plane’ speed sensors, called pitot tubes, was found to be the cause of the crash.It took two years to find the wreckage of the plane, which was eventually located off Brazil by remote-controlled submarines at a depth of 3,900 metres (13,000 ft).The crash was the biggest loss of life in the history of the company and the search for the wreckage was the biggest ever organised by France.The prosecutors recommended dropping the case against Airbus, despite demands from the families of victims that the aircraft manufacturer should also be held accountable for the crash.Both companies had been charged with manslaughter in 2011.Investigating magistrates must now decide whether to follow the recommendations of prosecutors and bring the case to trial.Air France will also be able to appeal against any decision to bring the case to court.A report from the French air crash investigator BEA in 2012 concluded that the ill-prepared crew had failed to react correctly when their Airbus stalled and lost altitude after the speed sensors froze up.AF447 was flying through a storm over the south Atlantic when it disappeared. The plane was in a blackspot between air traffic control towers in Brazil and Senegal, but still sending automatic communication “pings” every 10 minutes. Four minutes and 23 seconds after its last ping, it vanished.Black box data showed the aircraft’s pitot tubes had frozen, setting off a catastrophic chain of events in the cockpit. The pilots were confused and unaware they had stalled the plane – which was plummeting – until seconds before it plunged into the ocean at around 200km/h.",Air France could face trial over 2009 crash of Rio-Paris flight,2019-07-17/12:58:16,french prosecutors have recommended that air france face trial for manslaughter and negligence over the  crash of a flight from rio de janeiro to paris in which  people died prosecutors concluded that air france was aware of technical problems with a key speed measuring instrument on its airbus a plane but had failed to inform or train pilots on how to resolve the issue according to an investigation document seen by agence france presse flight af plunged into the atlantic during a storm on  june  a defect with the plane speed sensors called pitot tubes was found to be the cause of the crash it took two years to find the wreckage of the plane which was eventually located off brazil by remote controlled submarines at a depth of   metres   ft the crash was the biggest loss of life in the history of the company and the search for the wreckage was the biggest ever organised by france the prosecutors recommended dropping the case against airbus despite demands from the families of victims that the aircraft manufacturer should also be held accountable for the crash both companies had been charged with manslaughter in  investigating magistrates must now decide whether to follow the recommendations of prosecutors and bring the case to trial air france will also be able to appeal against any decision to bring the case to court a report from the french air crash investigator bea in  concluded that the ill prepared crew had failed to react correctly when their airbus stalled and lost altitude after the speed sensors froze up af was flying through a storm over the south atlantic when it disappeared the plane was in a blackspot between air traffic control towers in brazil and senegal but still sending automatic communication pings every  minutes four minutes and  seconds after its last ping it vanished black box data showed the aircraft s pitot tubes had frozen setting off a catastrophic chain of events in the cockpit the pilots were confused and unaware they had stalled the plane which was plummeting until seconds before it plunged into the ocean at around km h ,Boeing Crisis,0.301016628742218
8723,"A Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair has had the name Max dropped from the livery, further fuelling speculation that the manufacturer and airlines will seek to rebrand the troubled plane once it is given the all clear to fly again.Photos have emerged of a 737 Max in Ryanair colours outside Boeing’s manufacturing hub, with the designation 737-8200 – instead of 737 Max – on the nose. The 737-8200 is a type name for the aircraft that is used by aviation agencies.The Max aircraft remains grounded worldwide after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed a total of 346 people.

8745,"India’s moon mission, destined for the uncharted south pole, has been put on hold less than an hour before take off, following a technical glitch.The mission, which was scheduled to launch at 02:51 local time from Sriharikota space centre, north of Chennai, is India’s most ambitious to date.At 56.24 minutes from launch, the countdown stop was frozen and a media feed from the control room was cut off. Shortly afterwards, the Indian Space Research Organisation confirmed that the launch had been abandoned for the day.“A technical snag was observed in launch vehicle system at T-56 minute. As a measure of abundant precaution, #Chandrayaan2 launch has been called off for today,” the agency tweeted.A revised launch date will be announced later, it added.The mission has another 10-minute back up window in which it could launch on Tuesday. Chandrayaan-2 is India’s first attempt at a surface landing on the moon - a feat achieved by only Russia, the US and China. If successful, it would also be the first mission to conduct a surface landing on the little-explored lunar south pole region, where scientists hope to collect information about the moon’s mineral and chemical composition, and search for water.The four-tonne spacecraft is equipped with a lunar orbiter, a lander and a rover that is designed to spend two weeks analysing the moon’s surface.The mission comes amid a renewed global interest in moon exploration. In January, a Chinese spacecraft became the first to land on the far side of the moon, while in April, the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, the first privately funded mission to the moon, crashed after an apparent engine failure.India’s space programmes have been hailed by nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi as a marker of the country’s rising status as a global power. In March, Modi announced the successful test of the country’s first space weapon, an anti-satellite missile. The missile test was criticised by Nasa, who warned it had created dangerous orbital debris.Monday’s attempted launch follows Chandrayaan-1, India’s first lunar mission in 2008, which helped confirm the presence of water on the moon, but did not land on the lunar surface.As well as Chandrayaan-2, India is developing a plan to launch a manned space mission by 2022.",India's Chandrayaan-2 moon mission called off minutes before launch,2019-07-14/22:58:51,india s moon mission destined for the uncharted south pole has been put on hold less than an hour before take off following a technical glitch the mission which was scheduled to launch at   local time from sriharikota space centre north of chennai is india s most ambitious to date at   minutes from launch the countdown stop was frozen and a media feed from the control room was cut off shortly afterwards the indian space research organisation confirmed that the launch had been abandoned for the day a technical snag was observed in launch vehicle system at t  minute as a measure of abundant precaution chandrayaan launch has been called off for today the agency tweeted a revised launch date will be announced later it added the mission has another  minute back up window in which it could launch on tuesday chandrayaan  is india s first attempt at a surface landing on the moon a feat achieved by only russia the us and china if successful it would also be the first mission to conduct a surface landing on the little explored lunar south pole region where scientists hope to collect information about the moon s mineral and chemical composition and search for water the four tonne spacecraft is equipped with a lunar orbiter a lander and a rover that is designed to spend two weeks analysing the moon s surface the mission comes amid a renewed global interest in moon exploration in january a chinese spacecraft became the first to land on the far side of the moon while in april the israeli spacecraft beresheet the first privately funded mission to the moon crashed after an apparent engine failure india s space programmes have been hailed by nationalist prime minister narendra modi as a marker of the country s rising status as a global power in march modi announced the successful test of the country s first space weapon an anti satellite missile the missile test was criticised by nasa who warned it had created dangerous orbital debris monday s attempted launch follows chandrayaan  india s first lunar mission in  which helped confirm the presence of water on the moon but did not land on the lunar surface as well as chandrayaan  india is developing a plan to launch a manned space mission by  ,Boeing Crisis,0.29358822107315063

8840,"Dutch airline KLM has launched a campaign asking people to fly less. The video and open letter from CEO Pieter Elbers asks: “Do you always have to meet face-to-face?” and “Could you take the train instead?”The campaign aims to encourage travellers and the aviation industry to consider the environmental impact of flying. It describes the “shared responsibility” of travellers and airlines to “fly more responsibly”, and says those in the industry need to “create a sustainable future for aviation”.The aviation industry accounts for an estimated 2%-3% of the manmade CO2 emissions in the world – a figure that is expected to increase with growing population, trade and wealth. KLM’s message comes at a time when the flight-shaming movement is becoming more influential and there is a rise in holidays by rail. Airline passenger growth is also at its lowest in more than three years, according to a traffic report by European airport trade association Airports Council International Europe(May 2019, at +3.1%).The KLM campaign, which marks the airline’s 100th anniversary, calls on passengers to consider train travel for shorter distances and to replace face-to-face meetings with video calls. It also suggests packing lightly to reduce baggage weight so that planes uses less fuel, and to consider offsetting CO2 emissions. The airline’s carbon-offset programme (CO2zero) uses passenger contributions for reforestation projects, including a new tropical forest in Panama.However, critics have suggested that instead of asking the public to be aware of their actions, KLM, and other airlines, need to be considering solutions that lie with the industry itself. Justin Francis, founder of Responsible Travel, has called carbon-offsetting a “a dangerous distraction” from reducing emissions.“Voluntary initiatives by customers are not enough; the cost of flying must increase … Responsible Travel advocates a Green Flying Duty, with the proceeds ringfenced for research and development into decarbonised aviation,” said Francis. “Carbon offsets are no substitute for carbon reduction. At the same time as telling customers to think about flying less, KLM will be telling its investors about its future growth.”The airline acknowledges that the most impactful change would be to use sustainable fuel, which its research suggests would reduce CO2 emissions from each flight by up to 85%. The airline itself is using 57 times more biofuel than in 2011, including for commercial flights, and is working towards developing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which would run on organic waste including cooking oil and residue from other industries in the Netherlands and Benelux region. KLM said its sustainability initiatives have, so far, led to a relative reduction of 17% in CO2-emissions per passenger in 2018, compared with 2011.But Anna Hughes, who runs Flight Free UK, sees much of the “greening” in aviation as problematic. “For aviation to become sustainable, the answer is simply not to fly,” she said. “And the simple fact is that climate change, exacerbated by our reliance on fossil fuels, will make it difficult for our children to inhabit [the] planet. While we welcome measures to make aviation more sustainable, airlines must be transparent about their contribution to the climate crisis.”The climate crisis has led France to announce the introduction of an eco-tax on tickets for all flights leaving the country. The new tax will range from €1.50 for short-haul and up to €18 for long-haul in business class. At a press conference, transport minister Élisabeth Borne, said that €180m is expected to be raised annually from 2020, which will help finance daily transport in France, notably rail.KLM has stated it is against this type of national CO2 aviation tax, because it believes Dutch passengers would travel by car to neighbouring countries, and continue to fly from there. On the company’s website, it says: “A global approach makes more sense. If the tax is implemented, we believe that it should be invested in sustainability of the aviation industry. National taxes will just go into the national coffers and won’t do anything to combat climate change.”The airline also said it would not stop promoting air travel: “We are stepping up … progress towards a sustainable future but we are a company that needs to make a profit to survive and to continue to invest in sustainable solutions. We want to still be around when we have succeeded in our efforts to make aviation sustainable.”The International Air Transport Association is backing the KLM campaign. Rafael Schvartzman, IATA’s vice-president for Europe, said: “We support it in the sense you do have a choice. In certain cases you could use the alternative.” But, he added: “The UK is an island. If you want to trade globally, you will have to count on aviation.”",Dutch airline KLM calls for people to fly less,2019-07-11/13:25:55,dutch airline klm has launched a campaign asking people to fly less the video and open letter from ceo pieter elbers asks do you always have to meet face to face and could you take the train instead the campaign aims to encourage travellers and the aviation industry to consider the environmental impact of flying it describes the shared responsibility of travellers and airlines to fly more responsibly and says those in the industry need to create a sustainable future for aviation the aviation industry accounts for an estimated   of the manmade co emissions in the world a figure that is expected to increase with growing population trade and wealth klm s message comes at a time when the flight shaming movement is becoming more influential and there is a rise in holidays by rail airline passenger growth is also at its lowest in more than three years according to a traffic report by european airport trade association airports council international europe may  at   the klm campaign which marks the airline s th anniversary calls on passengers to consider train travel for shorter distances and to replace face to face meetings with video calls it also suggests packing lightly to reduce baggage weight so that planes uses less fuel and to consider offsetting co emissions the airline s carbon offset programme cozero uses passenger contributions for reforestation projects including a new tropical forest in panama however critics have suggested that instead of asking the public to be aware of their actions klm and other airlines need to be considering solutions that lie with the industry itself justin francis founder of responsible travel has called carbon offsetting a a dangerous distraction from reducing emissions voluntary initiatives by customers are not enough the cost of flying must increase responsible travel advocates a green flying duty with the proceeds ringfenced for research and development into decarbonised aviation said francis carbon offsets are no substitute for carbon reduction at the same time as telling customers to think about flying less klm will be telling its investors about its future growth the airline acknowledges that the most impactful change would be to use sustainable fuel which its research suggests would reduce co emissions from each flight by up to  the airline itself is using  times more biofuel than in  including for commercial flights and is working towards developing a sustainable aviation fuel plant which would run on organic waste including cooking oil and residue from other industries in the netherlands and benelux region klm said its sustainability initiatives have so far led to a relative reduction of  in co emissions per passenger in  compared with  but anna hughes who runs flight free uk sees much of the greening in aviation as problematic for aviation to become sustainable the answer is simply not to fly she said and the simple fact is that climate change exacerbated by our reliance on fossil fuels will make it difficult for our children to inhabit the planet while we welcome measures to make aviation more sustainable airlines must be transparent about their contribution to the climate crisis the climate crisis has led france to announce the introduction of an eco tax on tickets for all flights leaving the country the new tax will range from   for short haul and up to  for long haul in business class at a press conference transport minister élisabeth borne said that m is expected to be raised annually from  which will help finance daily transport in france notably rail klm has stated it is against this type of national co aviation tax because it believes dutch passengers would travel by car to neighbouring countries and continue to fly from there on the company s website it says a global approach makes more sense if the tax is implemented we believe that it should be invested in sustainability of the aviation industry national taxes will just go into the national coffers and won t do anything to combat climate change the airline also said it would not stop promoting air travel we are stepping up progress towards a sustainable future but we are a company that needs to make a profit to survive and to continue to invest in sustainable solutions we want to still be around when we have succeeded in our efforts to make aviation sustainable the international air transport association is backing the klm campaign rafael schvartzman iata s vice president for europe said we support it in the sense you do have a choice in certain cases you could use the alternative but he added the uk is an island if you want to trade globally you will have to count on aviation ,Boeing Crisis,0.2137003242969513
8859,"A Japanese spacecraft has successfully landed on a distant asteroid where it hopes to collect samples that could shed light on the evolution of the solar system.Scientists at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) observing the landing from a control room on the southern island of Tanegashima applauded and made “V” for victory signs after the Hayabusa2 probe landed on the asteroid on Thursday morning local time.“The touchdown is successful,” Jaxa spokesman Takayuki Tomobe said.The agency said the probe had been working normally above Ryugu asteroid, some 300m km (185m miles) from Earth.Its landing is the second time the probe has touched down on the desolate asteroid as part of a complex mission that has also involved sending rovers and robots.[PPTD] July 11 at 10:51 JST: Gate 5 check. The state of the spacecraft is normal and the touchdown sequence was performed as scheduled. Project Manager Tsuda has declared that the 2nd touchdown was a success!The mission hopes to collect pristine materials from beneath the surface of the asteroid that could provide insights into what the solar system was like at its birth 4.6bn years ago. The agency said it would be the first time a probe has taken particles from below the surface of an asteroid.To get at those crucial materials, in April an “impactor” was fired from Hayabusa2 towards Ryugu in a risky process that created a crater on the asteroid’s surface and stirred up material that had not previously been exposed to the atmosphere.Jaxa said the samples could contain organic materials and water.“This is the second touchdown, but doing a touchdown is a challenge whether it’s the first or the second,” Yuichi Tsuda, Hayabusa2 project manager, told reporters ahead of the mission.“The whole team will do our best so that we’ll be able to complete the operation,” he said.Hayabusa2’s first touchdown was in February, when it landed briefly on Ryugu and fired 5g pellet at more than 1,050km per hour (650mph) into the asteroid’s surface to puff up dust for collection, before blasting back to its holding position.Thursday’s second touchdown required special preparations because any problems could have meant the probe lost the precious materials already gathered during its first landing.The probe began its descent on Wednesday from its usual stationary position 20km above the asteroid, and is believed to have touched down on a targeted area located about 20 metres from the artificial crater’s centre.During its brief time on the asteroid, Hayabusa2 collected samples from the crater formed in February via a tube that retrieved the unidentified “ejecta” as it floated up.A photo of the crater taken by Hayabusa2’s camera showed that parts of the asteroid’s surface are covered with materials that are “obviously different” from the rest of the surface, mission manager Makoto Yoshikawa told reporters. “I’m really looking forward to analysing these materials.”Tsuda said: “It would be safe to say that extremely attractive materials are near the crater.”The probe will return to Earth next year, when scientists hope to learn more about the history of the solar system and even the origin of life from its samples.At about the size of a large refrigerator and powered by solar panels, Hayabusa2 is the successor to Jaxa’s first asteroid explorer, Hayabusa – Japanese for falcon.That probe returned with dust samples from a smaller, potato-shaped asteroid in 2010, despite various setbacks during its epic seven-year odyssey and was hailed as a scientific triumph.Hayabusa2’s photos of Ryugu, which means “Dragon Palace” in Japanese and refers to a castle at the bottom of the ocean in an ancient Japanese tale, show the asteroid has a rough surface full of boulders.The Hayabusa2 mission was launched in December 2014 at a cost of around 30bn yen ($270m). It reached its stationary position above Ryugu in June last year after travelling 3.2bn km on an elliptical orbit around the sun for more than three years, according to Kyodo news agency.If the rest of its historical mission goes to plan, Hayabusa2 will return to its landing site in Woomera, South Australia, at the end of 2020.In 2005, NASA’s Deep Impact project succeeded in creating an artificial crater on a comet but only for observation purposes.",Falcon has landed: Japan's Hayabusa2 probe touches down on asteroid,2019-07-11/03:02:54,a japanese spacecraft has successfully landed on a distant asteroid where it hopes to collect samples that could shed light on the evolution of the solar system scientists at the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa observing the landing from a control room on the southern island of tanegashima applauded and made v for victory signs after the hayabusa probe landed on the asteroid on thursday morning local time the touchdown is successful jaxa spokesman takayuki tomobe said the agency said the probe had been working normally above ryugu asteroid some m km m miles from earth its landing is the second time the probe has touched down on the desolate asteroid as part of a complex mission that has also involved sending rovers and robots pptd july  at   jst gate  check the state of the spacecraft is normal and the touchdown sequence was performed as scheduled project manager tsuda has declared that the nd touchdown was a success the mission hopes to collect pristine materials from beneath the surface of the asteroid that could provide insights into what the solar system was like at its birth  bn years ago the agency said it would be the first time a probe has taken particles from below the surface of an asteroid to get at those crucial materials in april an impactor was fired from hayabusa towards ryugu in a risky process that created a crater on the asteroid s surface and stirred up material that had not previously been exposed to the atmosphere jaxa said the samples could contain organic materials and water this is the second touchdown but doing a touchdown is a challenge whether it s the first or the second yuichi tsuda hayabusa project manager told reporters ahead of the mission the whole team will do our best so that we ll be able to complete the operation he said hayabusa s first touchdown was in february when it landed briefly on ryugu and fired g pellet at more than  km per hour mph into the asteroid s surface to puff up dust for collection before blasting back to its holding position thursday s second touchdown required special preparations because any problems could have meant the probe lost the precious materials already gathered during its first landing the probe began its descent on wednesday from its usual stationary position km above the asteroid and is believed to have touched down on a targeted area located about  metres from the artificial crater s centre during its brief time on the asteroid hayabusa collected samples from the crater formed in february via a tube that retrieved the unidentified ejecta as it floated up a photo of the crater taken by hayabusa s camera showed that parts of the asteroid s surface are covered with materials that are obviously different from the rest of the surface mission manager makoto yoshikawa told reporters i m really looking forward to analysing these materials tsuda said it would be safe to say that extremely attractive materials are near the crater the probe will return to earth next year when scientists hope to learn more about the history of the solar system and even the origin of life from its samples at about the size of a large refrigerator and powered by solar panels hayabusa is the successor to jaxa s first asteroid explorer hayabusa japanese for falcon that probe returned with dust samples from a smaller potato shaped asteroid in  despite various setbacks during its epic seven year odyssey and was hailed as a scientific triumph hayabusa s photos of ryugu which means dragon palace in japanese and refers to a castle at the bottom of the ocean in an ancient japanese tale show the asteroid has a rough surface full of boulders the hayabusa mission was launched in december  at a cost of around bn yen m it reached its stationary position above ryugu in june last year after travelling  bn km on an elliptical orbit around the sun for more than three years according to kyodo news agency if the rest of its historical mission goes to plan hayabusa will return to its landing site in woomera south australia at the end of  in  nasa s deep impact project succeeded in creating an artificial crater on a comet but only for observation purposes ,Boeing Crisis,0.2347029149532318

Output has since slumped to only 30 a month in the second quarter. Boeing halted deliveries of the top-selling plane since it was grounded in mid-March.There are more than 150 undelivered Max planes parked at sites around the US as well as 380 owned by airlines that remain grounded. June was the third month running that Boeing booked no new orders of its Max aircraft. Air regulators are not expected to clear the model to fly again before the end of September as the company continues to work on fixing the aircraft’s flight-control systems.Airbus has been ramping up the pressure on Boeing by pushing its best-selling A320neo, a direct rival to the Max, and publicly announcing an increase in production.This week Boeing lost a provisional deal for 50 737 Max planes from flyadeal, the budget arm of Saudi Arabian Airlines, which instead ordered the Airbus rival. The deal, with a value of more than $5.5bn (£4.4bn), is one of the first direct signs that the Max crashes have resulted in business shifting to Boeing’s rival.However, last month at the Paris air show Boeing was given a shot in the arm when International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, signed a “letter of intent” to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded.

9132,"The fingerprints of a man whose frozen body fell into a garden in London from the landing gear of a Kenya Airways plane are being analysed after being sent by British police to Nairobi, where investigators suspect he may have been an airport employee.A bag, water and some food were discovered in the landing gear compartment after the flight arrived at Heathrow on Sunday. The man’s body was found in a garden in Clapham, south London, shortly before 3.40pm that day.The director general of the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, Gilbert Kibe, told the BBC: “Whoever it is most likely had access to the airside, because with the way security is tight, it’s unlikely that an outsider would have been able to make his way through to the airside where an aeroplane is parked and be able to climb in. I’m suspecting it’s probably somebody who had access to the airside.”He added that the captain or first officer would normally walk around the plane and check the undercarriage thoroughly before takeoff.Asked about the security concerns the breach raised, he said: “That problem exists globally everywhere, it cannot be isolated to one airport.”A review of all CCTV coverage on flight KQ100 over the 24 hours before departure has been continuing, the Kenya Airports Authority said on Wednesday. All staff who came into contact with the plane are also being questioned.“Due to the large amount of data to be analysed, we request for your patience to enable due diligence to be followed,” the KAA said.A postmortem is due to be carried out on the body, which was said by a neighbour to have landed a metre away from a resident who had been sunbathing.A plane spotter who had been following the flight on an aircraft tracking app saw the body fall and arrived at the scene in time to give this information to the police.A neighbour said she and her husband had heard a noise but thought at first it was collapsing scaffolding, before they learned what had happened and saw the man’s remains.“We need to be grateful that no one on the ground was killed or hurt, but I think that the real focus now needs to be on why this man was so desperate that he felt that he had to do this,” she said, adding that police had told her the body was frozen to the touch.Four years ago, the body of Carlito Vale from Mozambique was found on the roof of a west London office building below the Heathrow flight path.Another man was found unconscious in the undercarriage of the same British Airways plane, having survived freezing temperatures over the 8,000-mile (12,800km) flight from Johannesburg to London.Stowaways risk being crushed or burned by the wheels as soon as they are retracted after takeoff.

9164,"There have been calls for fresh scrutiny of aviation security as efforts continue to identify a man whose frozen body fell into a garden in London from the landing gear of a Kenya Airways plane.Investigations have centred on Nairobi airport, where the man is believed to have concealed himself in the aircraft, but one aviation expert suggested airlines and plane manufacturers could take steps including fitting heat sensors to detect stowaways.A bag, water and some food were discovered in the landing gear compartment after the flight arrived at Heathrow on Sunday. The man’s body was found in a garden in Clapham, south London, shortly before 3.40pm that day.A postmortem is due to be carried out on the body, which was said by a neighbour to have landed a metre away from a resident who had been sunbathing.A plane spotter who had been following the flight on an aircraft tracking app saw the body fall and arrived at the scene in time to give this information to the police.A neighbour told the Guardian she and her husband had heard a noise but thought at first it was collapsing scaffolding, before they learned what had happened and saw the man’s remains.“We need to be grateful that no one on the ground was killed or hurt, but I think that the real focus now needs to be on why this man was so desperate that he felt that he had to do this,” she said, adding that police had told her that the body was frozen to the touch.Philip Baum, an aviation security consultant and a visiting professor at Coventry University, said the case illustrated the porous nature of airport security in developing countries.“If someone can secrete themselves into the landing gear then it would seem possible that they can put in other things,” said Baum, who added that stowaways often waited until an aircraft was taxiing to the runway before climbing in, rather than doing so at the departure gate.“But it’s all very well to point the finger at Nairobi, which actually has some stringent security measures in place. I do think that there are other measures that could be taken, such as fitting heat sensors inside the wheel wells to detect the heat from human bodies,” he said.Jomo Kenyatta airport in Nairobi, which has direct British Airways flights to and from the UK, is based in a suburb near the business district.Passengers must go through at least three tiers of security before reaching their planes, not including the large perimeter fence that encloses the airport. A first point of entry is a security screening yard some distance from the terminal, where passengers must alight from their vehicles and pass through a metal detector.After a winding road of about 2.5 miles (4km), passengers enter a second security check at their respective terminals, this time with their luggage. Finally, after checking in, they are directed to a body scan and carry-on security check.There has been a bomb scare and an employee strike at the airport so far this year, while two Kenya Airports Authority managers died in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 in March.Employees from KAA and Kenya Airways said they were not briefed about the stowaway incident in their morning staff meetings and had mostly heard about the story from social media or the local morning news.

9289,"For most Canadians, flying from one corner of their country to the other can be a pricey endeavour – so expensive, in fact, that they could fly to Europe or Asia for nearly the same price.Online travel agency Kiwi noted in its 2017 flight price index that Canadians pay more than twice the price Americans do for similar-distance domestic flights.On Friday, the cheapest Air Canada return fare from Montreal to Vancouver on 1-8 September cost C$759 (US$580); for just C$79 more on the same dates, one could fly from Montreal to Paris instead.Meanwhile, a direct US flight from New York City to Los Angeles costs a mere C$344.That's why Air Canada’s C$520m purchase this week of fellow Canadian carrier Air Transat is prompting alarm over dwindling competition and rising ticket prices.The move further consolidates Air Canada’s power in an already tiny market; the airline and its main Canadian competitor WestJet enjoy a duopoly, together controlling 82% of domestic seats.“It’s consolidation in what is a pretty small airline sector,” Rick Erickson, a Calgary-based independent aviation analyst says of the Transat deal. The deal puts Air Canada in a position to further control pricing, though analysts say it’s difficult to predict whether fares will actually increase.The Competition Bureau will probably scrutinize the deal, though it may not be able to stop it. Earlier this year, the bureau concluded that a merger between two small northern Canadian airlines was anti-competitive, but the federal government still approved it.Ultimately, it will come down to efficiencies, says Vincent Geloso, a research fellow at the Montreal Economic Institute and an economics professor at Kings University College.“It happens that firms are in 100% market shares, but they’ve achieved these market shares because they’re efficient. They were able to reduce costs [and] prices, they were able to improve quality. But once they get that high level of market share, their ability to abuse customers will depend on whether or not they can be threatened,” Geloso says.Canadian airlines are tough to threaten, because the federal government works hard to keep foreign competitors at bay, says Geloso. Loosening restrictions on foreign airline ownership or operation could drive down domestic airline prices while enabling the carrier to operate a greater network of feeder routes to overseas destinations.Some foreign airlines have instead boosted service at airports just across the US border. According to the Conference Board of Canada, 5 million Canadians a year cross the border on land to fly out of US airports.A lack of competition isn’t the only thing driving Canadian airfares skyward.“We do some things completely wrong here that add to the fee structure,” says Erickson. Canadian travellers pay security costs and airport improvement fees, which typically tack on an extra $30–60 per one-way ticket.Furthermore, the Canadian government owns the majority of the country’s airports, and leases them to local airport authorities. Most regional markets have only one airport, which keeps the number of available gates low. And fewer gates means higher prices, the cost of which gets passed on to consumers.“All of these factors amount to massive protections for any incumbent firm on the Canadian market,” says Geloso. “[For a monopoly], they’re the perfect ingredients.”",Canadians are paying sky-high prices for flights – and merger could make it worse,2019-06-29/11:00:48,for most canadians flying from one corner of their country to the other can be a pricey endeavour so expensive in fact that they could fly to europe or asia for nearly the same price online travel agency kiwi noted in its  flight price index that canadians pay more than twice the price americans do for similar distance domestic flights on friday the cheapest air canada return fare from montreal to vancouver on   september cost c  us  for just c  more on the same dates one could fly from montreal to paris instead meanwhile a direct us flight from new york city to los angeles costs a mere c  that s why air canada s c m purchase this week of fellow canadian carrier air transat is prompting alarm over dwindling competition and rising ticket prices the move further consolidates air canada s power in an already tiny market the airline and its main canadian competitor westjet enjoy a duopoly together controlling  of domestic seats it s consolidation in what is a pretty small airline sector rick erickson a calgary based independent aviation analyst says of the transat deal the deal puts air canada in a position to further control pricing though analysts say it s difficult to predict whether fares will actually increase the competition bureau will probably scrutinize the deal though it may not be able to stop it earlier this year the bureau concluded that a merger between two small northern canadian airlines was anti competitive but the federal government still approved it ultimately it will come down to efficiencies says vincent geloso a research fellow at the montreal economic institute and an economics professor at kings university college it happens that firms are in  market shares but they ve achieved these market shares because they re efficient they were able to reduce costs and prices they were able to improve quality but once they get that high level of market share their ability to abuse customers will depend on whether or not they can be threatened geloso says canadian airlines are tough to threaten because the federal government works hard to keep foreign competitors at bay says geloso loosening restrictions on foreign airline ownership or operation could drive down domestic airline prices while enabling the carrier to operate a greater network of feeder routes to overseas destinations some foreign airlines have instead boosted service at airports just across the us border according to the conference board of canada  million canadians a year cross the border on land to fly out of us airports a lack of competition isn t the only thing driving canadian airfares skyward we do some things completely wrong here that add to the fee structure says erickson canadian travellers pay security costs and airport improvement fees which typically tack on an extra   per one way ticket furthermore the canadian government owns the majority of the country s airports and leases them to local airport authorities most regional markets have only one airport which keeps the number of available gates low and fewer gates means higher prices the cost of which gets passed on to consumers all of these factors amount to massive protections for any incumbent firm on the canadian market says geloso for a monopoly they re the perfect ingredients ,Boeing Crisis,0.1926012933254242
9346,"Airlines including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have resisted calls to remove “no-show” clauses, which bump passengers off the second half of a return trip, despite heavy criticism from regulators and calls for a ban.Consumer body Which? wrote to nine airlines in December, warning they may be breaking consumer laws by keeping clauses that cancel the second leg of a return flight if a passenger misses the first leg of the same booking, forcing some customers to pay hundreds of pounds for replacement flights.In many cases airlines can sell on the same tickets, doubling their earnings for one seat.Of the nine airlines, only Flybe told Which? it would change the clauses, although it has not removed them completely. The airlines that retained the clauses were British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Air France, Singapore, Qatar and Swiss.KLM said it did not cancel the return flight ticket if the first leg was missed. Instead, it charges an extra fixed-rate fee of between €125 (£112) and €3,000 to passengers at the airport.In one case brought to Which?, a customer was forced to pay more than £600 to British Airways after he and his wife were barred from the second leg of their return trip from London to Pisa. The customer booked an outbound flight with an alternative airline after the first leg with British Airways was cancelled because of an airline strike, and he was only offered a replacement two days later.Last week, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) added to the pressure on airlines, saying it was concerned by airlines’ failure to remove the no-show clauses.Which? on Friday called for the “rip-off” no-show clauses to be banned, following the example set in Austria, which banned the practice in April.Caroline Normand, the consumer group’s director of advocacy, said: “It’s totally unreasonable for an airline to cancel a passenger’s return flight – often without warning – simply because they’ve missed the first leg of their journey.“Airlines have been able to cash in with this tactic for too long, leaving people miserable, stranded and hundreds if not thousands of pounds out of pocket.However, the CAA said in its report that its enforcement powers were limited, meaning government action may be required.The CAA criticised the airlines for their failure to create simple key terms documents, saying it was unfair for passengers to be forced to comply with terms that are not transparent.Airlines argue that the clauses prevent people from taking advantage of offers of return flights, which are cheaper than singles.• This article was amended on 1 July 2019 to clarify that KLM does not routinely cancel return leg tickets if the outbound flight is missed, but instead charges an extra fixed-rate fee.",Airlines refuse to scrap ‘no-show’ clauses for passengers,2019-06-28/00:01:07,airlines including british airways and virgin atlantic have resisted calls to remove no show clauses which bump passengers off the second half of a return trip despite heavy criticism from regulators and calls for a ban consumer body which wrote to nine airlines in december warning they may be breaking consumer laws by keeping clauses that cancel the second leg of a return flight if a passenger misses the first leg of the same booking forcing some customers to pay hundreds of pounds for replacement flights in many cases airlines can sell on the same tickets doubling their earnings for one seat of the nine airlines only flybe told which it would change the clauses although it has not removed them completely the airlines that retained the clauses were british airways virgin atlantic emirates air france singapore qatar and swiss klm said it did not cancel the return flight ticket if the first leg was missed instead it charges an extra fixed rate fee of between   and   to passengers at the airport in one case brought to which a customer was forced to pay more than  to british airways after he and his wife were barred from the second leg of their return trip from london to pisa the customer booked an outbound flight with an alternative airline after the first leg with british airways was cancelled because of an airline strike and he was only offered a replacement two days later last week the civil aviation authority caa added to the pressure on airlines saying it was concerned by airlines failure to remove the no show clauses which on friday called for the rip off no show clauses to be banned following the example set in austria which banned the practice in april caroline normand the consumer group s director of advocacy said it s totally unreasonable for an airline to cancel a passenger s return flight often without warning simply because they ve missed the first leg of their journey airlines have been able to cash in with this tactic for too long leaving people miserable stranded and hundreds if not thousands of pounds out of pocket however the caa said in its report that its enforcement powers were limited meaning government action may be required the caa criticised the airlines for their failure to create simple key terms documents saying it was unfair for passengers to be forced to comply with terms that are not transparent airlines argue that the clauses prevent people from taking advantage of offers of return flights which are cheaper than singles this article was amended on  july  to clarify that klm does not routinely cancel return leg tickets if the outbound flight is missed but instead charges an extra fixed rate fee ,Boeing Crisis,0.22256234288215637
9491,"Nasa’s Curiosity rover has detected its largest belch of methane on Mars so far, fuelling speculation that the robot may have trundled through a cloud of waste gas released by microbial Martians buried deep under the surface.Mission scientists announced on Monday that Curiosity had measured a record-breaking 21 parts per billion (ppb) of methane in the air in Gale crater, the rover’s landing site and area of exploration. The level is substantially more than the 5.8ppb it sensed on 16 June 2013.Curiosity touched down on the red planet in August 2012 and has recorded a number of sharp spikes in methane and a fluctuating background level of the gas that appears to rise and fall with the seasons.The latest measurement has excited some Mars enthusiasts because on Earth, much of the methane in the air comes from living things that release it one way or another as waste gas. But methane can have far more mundane origins than microscopic Martians, such as reactions between water and certain types of rock, and Nasa’s rover cannot distinguish between these.While Mars was once warm and home to coursing rivers and giant lakes, it is now exceptionally dry and battered with intense radiation. If any life exists on the planet, it would probably have to be sheltering deep underground.“With our current measurements, we have no way of telling if the methane source is biology or geology, or even ancient or modern,” said Paul Mahaffy from Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt in Maryland, US.The methane spike was recorded by the rover’s sample analysis at Mars (SAM) tunable laser spectrometer. After noticing the methane surge in data beamed back to Earth last week, mission scientists commanded the rover to perform follow-up experiments over the weekend.The measurement deepens the mystery of why a European Space Agency probe sent to Mars to nail down the origins of the planet’s methane has so far found no traces of the gas. One possible explanation is that any methane released on the planet is broken down before it reaches the altitude studied by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO).In April, a team of Italian scientists traced a plume of methane on Mars back to a particular spot on the surface where the movement of a geological fault may have released bubbles of the gas trapped in Martian permafrost.Manish Patel, an Open University researcher who works on the TGO mission, said the latest detection by Curiosity was what the European team had been waiting for. Until now, the TGO has not looked for methane on Mars at the same time as Curiosity. “The previous ‘discrepancy’ in findings was always complicated by the fact that we never made measurements at the same time,” Patel said. “There was always a possibility that something was occurring in the atmosphere to trap or remove the methane before we arrived to measure it.”He added: “Now that both Curiosity and TGO are active on Mars, we have the chance to compare measurements made at the same time, which will allow direct comparison. Curiosity will likely continue to make measurements, and it will be interesting to see whether they still see the methane, or whether it disappears immediately.” In the meantime, scientists on TGO will examine their own data to see if any trace of the methane was picked up by their own instruments high above the Martian surface.",Mars rover's large methane discovery excites scientists,2019-06-24/17:16:42,nasa s curiosity rover has detected its largest belch of methane on mars so far fuelling speculation that the robot may have trundled through a cloud of waste gas released by microbial martians buried deep under the surface mission scientists announced on monday that curiosity had measured a record breaking  parts per billion ppb of methane in the air in gale crater the rover s landing site and area of exploration the level is substantially more than the  ppb it sensed on  june  curiosity touched down on the red planet in august  and has recorded a number of sharp spikes in methane and a fluctuating background level of the gas that appears to rise and fall with the seasons the latest measurement has excited some mars enthusiasts because on earth much of the methane in the air comes from living things that release it one way or another as waste gas but methane can have far more mundane origins than microscopic martians such as reactions between water and certain types of rock and nasa s rover cannot distinguish between these while mars was once warm and home to coursing rivers and giant lakes it is now exceptionally dry and battered with intense radiation if any life exists on the planet it would probably have to be sheltering deep underground with our current measurements we have no way of telling if the methane source is biology or geology or even ancient or modern said paul mahaffy from nasa s goddard space flight center in greenbelt in maryland us the methane spike was recorded by the rover s sample analysis at mars sam tunable laser spectrometer after noticing the methane surge in data beamed back to earth last week mission scientists commanded the rover to perform follow up experiments over the weekend the measurement deepens the mystery of why a european space agency probe sent to mars to nail down the origins of the planet s methane has so far found no traces of the gas one possible explanation is that any methane released on the planet is broken down before it reaches the altitude studied by the exomars trace gas orbiter tgo in april a team of italian scientists traced a plume of methane on mars back to a particular spot on the surface where the movement of a geological fault may have released bubbles of the gas trapped in martian permafrost manish patel an open university researcher who works on the tgo mission said the latest detection by curiosity was what the european team had been waiting for until now the tgo has not looked for methane on mars at the same time as curiosity the previous discrepancy in findings was always complicated by the fact that we never made measurements at the same time patel said there was always a possibility that something was occurring in the atmosphere to trap or remove the methane before we arrived to measure it he added now that both curiosity and tgo are active on mars we have the chance to compare measurements made at the same time which will allow direct comparison curiosity will likely continue to make measurements and it will be interesting to see whether they still see the methane or whether it disappears immediately in the meantime scientists on tgo will examine their own data to see if any trace of the methane was picked up by their own instruments high above the martian surface ,Boeing Crisis,0.21077263355255127
9707,"The parent company of British Airways has announced plans to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded because of safety fears after two crashes.The short-haul planes would be delivered between 2023 and 2027 and shared among International Airlines Group’s carriers, including Vueling, the low-cost venture Level, and BA, for its flights out of London Gatwick airport.IAG and Boeing revealed a “letter of intent” for the huge order at the Paris airshow, in a significant boost to the US manufacturer after its rival Airbus appeared to be stealing a march on it with big orders and the launch of a  competing model.The fleet of planes, a mixture of 737 Max 8 and Max 10 variants, would be valued at about $25bn (£20bn) at list prices but IAG said it had secured a substantial discount, likely to be more than usual considering Boeing’s difficult circumstances.The deal will be seen as a crucial vote of confidence in the troubled airplane. Although more than 5,000 have been ordered, the IAG deal is the first sale of any kind for the 737 Max since it was grounded worldwide in March.Investigators suspected faulty Boeing software was behind the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters that killed 346 people.Willie Walsh, the IAG chief executive, said: “We have every confidence in Boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months having received approval from the regulators.”Walsh, a former 737 pilot himself, told reporters in Paris that he would have “no hesitation” in flying on the plane, and voiced confidence in its safety.The manufacturer is still in negotiations with regulators to get a modified version of the plane flying again.Although investigations into the two 737 Max disasters are continuing, problems with sensors and the anti-stall software known as MCAS are believed to have caused both the Ethiopian and Indonesian planes to crash. Pilots in the US have accused Boeing of failing to adequately notify them of changes in the way the aircraft automatically adjusted its angle.No timeline for its return to service has been confirmed but it is expected to be at least August before regulators worldwide agree to lift the ban, should Boeing’s proposed fixes be approved.As well as affirming faith in the 737 Max, the IAG order will have given a boost to Boeing as rival Airbus led the way at the Paris airshow, having unveiled the A321XLR aircraft on Monday.Airbus followed up with a string of announcements of orders for the new plane, a long-range version of its top-selling single-aisle jet.IAG was also among the customers for the A321XLR, placing a firm order for eight planes for Iberia and six for Aer Lingus, plus an option for 14 more.The deal, potentially worth almost $4bn, will see first deliveries in 2023. IAG said each plane will have fully flat seats in a small business cabin and have much the same inflight amenities as traditional, wide-body transatlantic jets.Walsh said the smaller plane would have the same costs per passenger as a bigger long haul aircraft, allowing the airlines to expand their networks profitably. “This will strengthen both Dublin and Madrid hubs providing new transatlantic routes and additional flexibility for connecting passengers,” he said.",BA parent company reveals plans to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max jets,2019-06-18/16:10:12,the parent company of british airways has announced plans to buy  boeing  max aircraft the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded because of safety fears after two crashes the short haul planes would be delivered between  and  and shared among international airlines group s carriers including vueling the low cost venture level and ba for its flights out of london gatwick airport iag and boeing revealed a letter of intent for the huge order at the paris airshow in a significant boost to the us manufacturer after its rival airbus appeared to be stealing a march on it with big orders and the launch of a competing model the fleet of planes a mixture of  max  and max  variants would be valued at about bn bn at list prices but iag said it had secured a substantial discount likely to be more than usual considering boeing s difficult circumstances the deal will be seen as a crucial vote of confidence in the troubled airplane although more than   have been ordered the iag deal is the first sale of any kind for the  max since it was grounded worldwide in march investigators suspected faulty boeing software was behind the ethiopian airlines and lion air disasters that killed  people willie walsh the iag chief executive said we have every confidence in boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months having received approval from the regulators walsh a former  pilot himself told reporters in paris that he would have no hesitation in flying on the plane and voiced confidence in its safety the manufacturer is still in negotiations with regulators to get a modified version of the plane flying again although investigations into the two  max disasters are continuing problems with sensors and the anti stall software known as mcas are believed to have caused both the ethiopian and indonesian planes to crash pilots in the us have accused boeing of failing to adequately notify them of changes in the way the aircraft automatically adjusted its angle no timeline for its return to service has been confirmed but it is expected to be at least august before regulators worldwide agree to lift the ban should boeing s proposed fixes be approved as well as affirming faith in the  max the iag order will have given a boost to boeing as rival airbus led the way at the paris airshow having unveiled the axlr aircraft on monday airbus followed up with a string of announcements of orders for the new plane a long range version of its top selling single aisle jet iag was also among the customers for the axlr placing a firm order for eight planes for iberia and six for aer lingus plus an option for  more the deal potentially worth almost bn will see first deliveries in  iag said each plane will have fully flat seats in a small business cabin and have much the same inflight amenities as traditional wide body transatlantic jets walsh said the smaller plane would have the same costs per passenger as a bigger long haul aircraft allowing the airlines to expand their networks profitably this will strengthen both dublin and madrid hubs providing new transatlantic routes and additional flexibility for connecting passengers he said ,Boeing Crisis,0.5235208868980408
9749,"Airbus has stepped up the pressure on arch-rival Boeing on the opening day of the Paris airshow by launching a new long-range small passenger jet and announcing $15bn (£12bn) worth of orders.The European manufacturer unveiled the A321XLR, a long-haul version of the A321neo that competes with Boeing’s grounded 737 Max.Airbus said on Monday that the plane’s additional range, which opens up routes such as India to Europe or China to Australia, would allow airlines to operate a single-aisle aircraft on intercontinental journeys that are currently possible only on larger, less fuel-efficient wide-body planes.It is expected to confirm up to 200 orders for the new model, the A321XLR, at the show this week, according to Reuters. Middle East Airlines, the Lebanese flag carrier, was announced as launch customer, with an order for four A321XLRs, which are expected to be operational from 2023. The California-based Air Lease Corporation also signed a letter of intent to purchase 27 of the new planes – as well as 50 A220-300s and 23 additional A321neos, worth a total of $11bn at list prices. Boeing, meanwhile, expressed further contrition over the 737 Max, which remains grounded in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters. The two crashes, suspected to be caused by faulty software and sensors, killed a total of 346 passengers and crew.Kevin McAllister, the chief executive of Boeing’s commercial aircraft, said: “We are very sorry for the loss of lives.” He also apologised for the disruption to airlines from the subsequent removal of service of the 737 Max. He did not predict when the model would fly again, but said it was “a pivotal moment” for Boeing: “It’s a time to be introspective. And it’s a time for us to make sure accidents like this never happen again.”The firm suffered a fresh setback as its engine supplier, GE Aviation, announced a delay because of problems with a part in the GE9X engine that it is developing for a new Boeing plane. The 777X will be the world’s largest twin-engined passenger jet when it takes to the skies later this year.Expectations for the Paris show, which usually features a plethora of new products and big-money orders, had been dampened by economic headwinds, including the US-China trading salvoes and concerns over sluggish growth.However, Airbus followed up the Air Lease deal with news that Virgin Atlantic would buy 14 of its A330neo widebody planes in an order valued at $4.1bn (£3.3bn). Virgin said the planes, with Rolls-Royce engines, would be 13% more fuel-efficient than the aircraft they replaced and also significantly quieter on take-off and landing.The airline’s chief executive, Shai Weiss, said the deal would “play a pivotal role in our fleet transformation”, adding: “Twenty-nineteen marks a return to growth for Virgin Atlantic as we strive to become the most loved travel company and the nation’s second flag carrier at an expanded Heathrow.”Optimism over airlines’ prospects was in shorter supply elsewhere after another overnight profit warning from German giant Lufthansa. Shares in Lufthansa, which cut its forecast profit for 2019 by 20% in the face of intense fare competition, fell 10%, and European rivals were also dragged down, with easyJet and the British Airways owner, IAG, also falling on the FTSE 100.",Airbus unveils new jet at Paris airshow and $15bn worth of orders,2019-06-17/17:22:29,airbus has stepped up the pressure on arch rival boeing on the opening day of the paris airshow by launching a new long range small passenger jet and announcing bn bn worth of orders the european manufacturer unveiled the axlr a long haul version of the aneo that competes with boeing s grounded  max airbus said on monday that the plane s additional range which opens up routes such as india to europe or china to australia would allow airlines to operate a single aisle aircraft on intercontinental journeys that are currently possible only on larger less fuel efficient wide body planes it is expected to confirm up to  orders for the new model the axlr at the show this week according to  middle east airlines the lebanese flag carrier was announced as launch customer with an order for four axlrs which are expected to be operational from  the california based air lease corporation also signed a letter of intent to purchase  of the new planes as well as  a s and  additional aneos worth a total of bn at list prices boeing meanwhile expressed further contrition over the  max which remains grounded in the wake of the ethiopian airlines and lion air disasters the two crashes suspected to be caused by faulty software and sensors killed a total of  passengers and crew kevin mcallister the chief executive of boeing s commercial aircraft said we are very sorry for the loss of lives he also apologised for the disruption to airlines from the subsequent removal of service of the  max he did not predict when the model would fly again but said it was a pivotal moment for boeing it s a time to be introspective and it s a time for us to make sure accidents like this never happen again the firm suffered a fresh setback as its engine supplier ge aviation announced a delay because of problems with a part in the gex engine that it is developing for a new boeing plane the x will be the world s largest twin engined passenger jet when it takes to the skies later this year expectations for the paris show which usually features a plethora of new products and big money orders had been dampened by economic headwinds including the us china trading salvoes and concerns over sluggish growth however airbus followed up the air lease deal with news that virgin atlantic would buy  of its aneo widebody planes in an order valued at  bn  bn virgin said the planes with rolls royce engines would be  more fuel efficient than the aircraft they replaced and also significantly quieter on take off and landing the airline s chief executive shai weiss said the deal would play a pivotal role in our fleet transformation adding twenty nineteen marks a return to growth for virgin atlantic as we strive to become the most loved travel company and the nation s second flag carrier at an expanded heathrow optimism over airlines prospects was in shorter supply elsewhere after another overnight profit warning from german giant lufthansa shares in lufthansa which cut its forecast profit for  by  in the face of intense fare competition fell  and european rivals were also dragged down with easyjet and the british airways owner iag also falling on the ftse  ,Boeing Crisis,0.4157974421977997

June is always a difficult month in northern India because the heat builds up inexorably as a prelude to the monsoon, which normally arrives at the end of the month.This is when air conditioners almost cease to be effective and even normally frisky street dogs lie prone on the pavement all day.But this year the temperatures have been unusually high even for June, touching 48C near the airport in Delhi last week – the hottest June day in the Indian capital on record – and above 50C in Rajasthan.Tens of thousands of people in drought-affected villages in north India have left their homes because they do not have any drinking water either for themselves or for their cattle.Even in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in the Himalayas, where many Indians go to escape the summer heat, the temperature has reached 39C.The rush to the higher ground resulted in huge traffic jams at the weekend that snaked around the mountains. People had to sleep in their cars because towns such as Shimla and Nainital – known as hill stations from the days of the British Raj – had no spare hotel rooms.“It was unbelievable. The hills were alive and heaving with cars and SUVs and a journey that should take one hour took five,” said Sumith Verma, a Nainital resident.About two-thirds of the country has been affected by the blistering heat, which looks set to become the longest heatwave the country has ever experienced.But Sunday brought light showers to New Delhi and the temperature dipped to around 36C. The skies remained overcast on Monday. Other parts of north and western India – Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Maharashtra – also had some rain over the weekend.By now the monsoon should have reached parts of central India but is lagging behind schedule. So far, the monsoon has hit only Karnataka and Kerala in the south.",India heatwave: rain brings respite for some but death toll rises,2019-06-17/12:23:08,weekend showers provided a much needed but partial respite to parts of india sweltering in a brutal heatwave in bihar however one of the poorest areas of the country  people died on saturday in just  hours with temperatures in bihar hovering consistently at around c f hospitals were inundated with people suffering from heatstroke the death toll has since risen to at least  and with many heatstroke victims still in hospital is expected to rise further schools in bihar will remain closed until wednesday in the southern state of tamil nadu people have been advised to stay indoors between am and pm earlier this month four elderly passengers on board the kerala express train died of suffocation the heatwave one of the longest on record has been scorching large parts of north and central india with temperatures of more than c june is always a difficult month in northern india because the heat builds up inexorably as a prelude to the monsoon which normally arrives at the end of the month this is when air conditioners almost cease to be effective and even normally frisky street dogs lie prone on the pavement all day but this year the temperatures have been unusually high even for june touching c near the airport in delhi last week the hottest june day in the indian capital on record and above c in rajasthan tens of thousands of people in drought affected villages in north india have left their homes because they do not have any drinking water either for themselves or for their cattle even in the state of jammu and kashmir in the himalayas where many indians go to escape the summer heat the temperature has reached c the rush to the higher ground resulted in huge traffic jams at the weekend that snaked around the mountains people had to sleep in their cars because towns such as shimla and nainital known as hill stations from the days of the british raj had no spare hotel rooms it was unbelievable the hills were alive and heaving with cars and suvs and a journey that should take one hour took five said sumith verma a nainital resident about two thirds of the country has been affected by the blistering heat which looks set to become the longest heatwave the country has ever experienced but sunday brought light showers to new delhi and the temperature dipped to around c the skies remained overcast on monday other parts of north and western india rajasthan gujarat punjab and maharashtra also had some rain over the weekend by now the monsoon should have reached parts of central india but is lagging behind schedule so far the monsoon has hit only karnataka and kerala in the south ,Boeing Crisis,0.1341473013162613
9772,"On 10 March, 24-year-old Samya Stumo was on her way to start a healthcare job in Kenya when, along with 156 other passengers on an Ethiopian Airlines-operated Boeing 737 Max 8, she died as the plane took a high-speed dive into countryside outside Addis Ababa.Now her parents, Michael Stumo and Nadia Milleron, together with her great-uncle Ralph Nader, have become the most vocal relatives to demand a say on when or if the fastest-selling plane in Boeing’s history should fly again.For four months since the tragedy, Stumo and Milleron say they have been thwarted in their quest for clarity from Boeing, the company’s political representatives in Washington and regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration.The couple recently filed a 50-page negligence lawsuit against Boeing, Ethiopian Airlines and Rosemount Aerospace, the makers of the sensor that informed the Max’s controversial MCAS anti-stall system at the center of investigations into the Ethiopian tragedy and the Lion Air Max crash last October.“We just don’t want there to be a third crash,” Michael Stumo told the Guardian. “Nothing was done after the first Lion Air crash. Something has to be done now after the second.”The drip of information about the rush development of the Max 8, the shortcomings and ferocity of its anti-stall technology, and the degree to which regulators permitted Boeing to certify the plane and its systems, have left Samya Stumo’s parents with little reason for confidence.“We have a fear that the un-grounding process is being rushed and improperly influenced by a concern for Boeing’s profits more than for safety,” Stumo said.In previous air crashes, families have had months to grieve before engaging in the process of investigation and public hearings. In this case, there was no time wasted. FAA officials have indicated the Max 8 could be back in service by the end of the year, though officially airlines have been told to keep the plane off their schedules only until 3 September.“We felt only economic interests were being represented. So we felt an obligation to get involved quicker than we might want to,” Stumo said.While the family is leaving the technical negligence arguments about the plane and its software systems to their lawyers, their narrative is straightforward. “The MCAS software grabbed control of the plane, overpowered the pilots and ran this plane into the ground at 500 or 600mph,” Stumo said.In the days and months after the crash, the victims’ families communicated through WhatsApp groups. The single largest nationality of passengers lost in the Ethiopian crash was Kenyan, accounting for 47 passengers. There are currently 43 cases from the crash filed in Illinois district court, including on behalf of 10 Canadian victims, three generations of the Manant Vaidya family and the wife and three children of Kenyan Paul Njoroge.Nadia Milleron said the couple are trying to help families from abroad through the US legal system. “After the Indonesian crash, there was no opportunity for victims’ families to stand up and say anything, so there was a second crash. We feel we have to do this.”As other air crashes have shown, the greater the ability of victims’ families to work together the better the outcome. But Stumo said reliving the experience in the media or in testimony is distressing. “It takes something out of us each time we do it, but we want a return to a safety-first culture in American aviation.”The couple recalled their hurried trip to Ethiopia in the hope Samya might have survived or that she or her effects might be recoverable. But the plane and its passengers were obliterated on impact.As lawsuits begin to wind their way through the court system, a key question for the families – and future passengers – is when and if the 737 should be recertified by US regulators. Boeing faces an estimated $1.4bn bill for canceled flights and airlines’ lost profits if the Max is still grounded by the end of September. It has cut its production rate for the model by 10 planes a month to 42.Earlier this week, Ali Bahrami, the FAA administrator for aviation safety, said the agency was “under a lot of pressure” and that the plane should be back in the air by December, echoing comments by Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg.But the FAA is not the only regulator involved. The European Aviation Safety Agency is examining Boeing’s changes to the plane’s flight-control system – a process that will not conclude until the end of July at the earliest.“We don’t have confidence the FAA has not been captured by Boeing,” said Stumo. He believes the agency was unduly lax in allowing Boeing to include the MCAS system in the first place.If or when the 737 Max is approved for service, airlines may face difficulties convincing passengers of its safety.A study by US-based Global Business Travel Association for the Financial Times found more than 80% of business travel managers expressed concern about flying on the jet and two-thirds thought their employees might change travel plans to avoid flying on it.American Airlines said last week it would ask airline executives to fly on the plane first to help build public confidence, reported Bloomberg.On the eve of the Paris Air Show on Sunday, Muilenburg said he was “disappointed” that Boeing had not “crisply” relayed information in 2017 about changes in a cockpit alert system designed to warn pilots of a fault in the MCAS system.Muilenburg said that the company “was very confident in the design solution that we have come up with”. Boeing, he added, had work to do “to re-earn the public’s trust”.Victims’ families are also highly attuned to efforts to shift blame to the pilots for the crash. Last month, the Missouri Republican Sam Graves cited pilot error as a factor in the crash – which was rejected by Ethiopian Airlines. Boeing’s Muilenburg also implicated “foreign” pilots in the crashes and denied flaws in the 737 Max.“It doesn’t give us confidence,” said Stumo. “You don’t blame the pilots that the plane overpowered, and you can’t just have the pilots as the last piece of redundancy before a crash.”An Ethiopian Airlines representative said any effort “to divert public attention from the flight control system problem of the airplane is a futile exercise because it is not based on factually correct analysis”.Nader, Milleron’s mother’s brother, has come out against the jet ever returning to service. He says placing larger engines on an airframe designed in the 1960s represents a basic design flaw.The 737 Max “must never fly again”, Nader said at an aviation safety event in Washington earlier this month. “It’s not a matter of software. It’s a matter of structural design defect: the plane’s engines are too much for the traditional fuselage.”But arguing for permanent grounding risks cutting victims’ families out of the safety process, an outcome Stumo and his wife are reluctant to consider because it could exclude them from the deliberative process of reapproval.Instead, they maintain, instead of being guided by financial interests, Boeing needs to go back to being a premier, safety-at-all-costs, manufacturer.If that requires a change of leadership, so be it, said Stumo. “Boeing needs to come clean. It needs to say: something went wrong with this plane. It grabbed control multiple times and tried to run it into the ground. It overpowered the pilots, and we need to figure out how this will not happen again.”",Profit over safety?

9783,"The head of Boeing has admitted the company made communications errors in its dealings with regulators and airlines in the wake of the 737 Max jet crisis that grounded the entire fleet.Speaking on the eve of the Paris air show, the Boeing chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said the company’s communications were “not consistent” and that was “unacceptable”. Muilenburg added that the US aerospace group had failed to communicate “crisply” with regulators and carriers about the plane.The 737 Max was grounded globally in the aftermath of an Ethiopian Airlines crash outside Addis Ababa in March that killed all 157 people on board. It was the 737 Max’s second disaster in five months, after 189 people were killed on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October.Asked how the design and constructions of the 737 Max failed to capture apparent flaws in the software and sensors behind the airplane, Muilenburg said: “Clearly, we can make improvements, and we understand that and we will make those improvements.”Investigations into the Ethiopia and Indonesia accidents have centred on the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was designed to keep the aircraft stable in flight. An investigation into the Ethiopia crash has reportedly found that the MCAS software – which automatically pushes the aircraft’s nose down to guard against a loss of lift – was activated by erroneous “angle of attack” data from a single sensor, forcing the pilots into a doomed struggle to control the aircraft.Muilenburg added: “When I make comments about the previous design and how we followed those processes, that’s something we put a lot of thought and depth of analysis into. That doesn’t mean that it can’t be improved.”The Boeing boss, who has been under fire over the 737 MAX design and Boeing’s handling of the crisis, said he expected the plane to return to service this year.Muilenburg said he was “disappointed” the company wasn’t more forthcoming with information when engineers in 2017 learned that cockpit alerts intended to warn pilots about certain sensor malfunctions didn’t work or weren’t operating as intended due to a software error. The company previously said senior Boeing leaders didn’t learn about the issue until after the second crash.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air.

The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard.

9816,"Airline pilots have voiced fears over the safety of a fleet of Boeing aircraft after a crucial fire-fighting system has been found to have the potential to malfunction.Boeing has issued an alert to airlines using its flagship B787 Dreamliner, warning that the switch used to extinguish an engine fire has failed in a “small number” of instances. The switch also severs the fuel supply and the hydraulic fluid to prevent flames spreading.UK airlines Tui, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic operate more than 60 Dreamliners between them. The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has decided not to ground the fleet, despite admitting a “risk to the flying public”.Pilots, however, claim that the safety of passengers and crew is being compromised. “If there was an engine fire on a transatlantic flight and the aircraft had one of the defective fire switches, then we would have to fly with a burning wing for up to three hours before we could safely land,” a pilot with a British airline told the Observer.In its alert to airlines, Boeing warns that long-term heating can cause the fire switch to stick in the locked position so it can’t be used to release the two fire extinguishers in each engine.The FAA has issued an airworthiness directive, mandatory instructions to air operators, announcing that the problem is “likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design” and that “the potential exists for an airline fire to be uncontrollable”. However, it stopped short of grounding the aircraft and instead ordered airlines to check the switch every 30 days.The FAA was criticised for declining to ground Boeing’s fleet of 737 Max aircraft in March after a software malfunction was suspected of causing two fatal crashes. It changed its stance after regulators in other countries banned the aircraft from flying while the accidents were investigated.Launched in 2011, the Dreamliner fleet was designed to revolutionise air travel with fuel-efficient technology and a longer flight range.The $200m (£160m) aircraft were grounded in 2013 following a series of fires caused by leaking batteries. In 2017 the FAA ordered the company to improve its quality control after metal shavings were found among electrical wiring, causing a fire hazard.This year Boeing increased production of the Dreamliner from 12 to 14 a month and announced that it would be replacing up to 900 quality control inspectors with smart technology. Critics claim that the speed of production is compromising safety.“We, as a pilot community, have found it all smacks of taking the cheap route and not the safe route,” says a pilot who spoke anonymously to the Observer.“Boeing insists that the risk of an engine fire is very low, and that’s true, but it’s Boeing’s attitude to the risk that has upset us, especially in light of recent B737 Max issues. If the fire switch malfunctions, there’s no manual override to deploy the engine fire extinguishers and therefore no way of putting out a fire, but Boeing says that it’s fine, and the airlines agree. Such is the fear of Boeing’s power that no one dares speak out.”Tui, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic all told the Observer that they abided by the safety requirements set out by aviation authorities and their aircraft had been checked and would continue to fly as normal.Boeing said that fewer than 1% of fire switches have proved defective, and that it was supporting airlines with inspections and replacement parts. “Boeing works closely with the FAA to monitor the fleet for potential safety issues and take appropriate actions,” said a spokesperson.“Engine fires are a very unlikely event and there have been no observed engine fires in the 787 fleet history.”The FAA declined to comment on pilot concerns, stating that it invited responses in February when the airworthiness directive was proposed.",Pilots reveal safety fears over Boeing’s fleet of Dreamliners,2019-06-15/17:18:40,airline pilots have voiced fears over the safety of a fleet of boeing aircraft after a crucial fire fighting system has been found to have the potential to malfunction boeing has issued an alert to airlines using its flagship b dreamliner warning that the switch used to extinguish an engine fire has failed in a small number of instances the switch also severs the fuel supply and the hydraulic fluid to prevent flames spreading uk airlines tui british airways and virgin atlantic operate more than  dreamliners between them the us regulator the federal aviation administration faa has decided not to ground the fleet despite admitting a risk to the flying public pilots however claim that the safety of passengers and crew is being compromised if there was an engine fire on a transatlantic flight and the aircraft had one of the defective fire switches then we would have to fly with a burning wing for up to three hours before we could safely land a pilot with a british airline told the observer in its alert to airlines boeing warns that long term heating can cause the fire switch to stick in the locked position so it can t be used to release the two fire extinguishers in each engine the faa has issued an airworthiness directive mandatory instructions to air operators announcing that the problem is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design and that the potential exists for an airline fire to be uncontrollable however it stopped short of grounding the aircraft and instead ordered airlines to check the switch every  days the faa was criticised for declining to ground boeing s fleet of  max aircraft in march after a software malfunction was suspected of causing two fatal crashes it changed its stance after regulators in other countries banned the aircraft from flying while the accidents were investigated launched in  the dreamliner fleet was designed to revolutionise air travel with fuel efficient technology and a longer flight range the m m aircraft were grounded in  following a series of fires caused by leaking batteries in  the faa ordered the company to improve its quality control after metal shavings were found among electrical wiring causing a fire hazard this year boeing increased production of the dreamliner from  to  a month and announced that it would be replacing up to  quality control inspectors with smart technology critics claim that the speed of production is compromising safety we as a pilot community have found it all smacks of taking the cheap route and not the safe route says a pilot who spoke anonymously to the observer boeing insists that the risk of an engine fire is very low and that s true but it s boeing s attitude to the risk that has upset us especially in light of recent b max issues if the fire switch malfunctions there s no manual override to deploy the engine fire extinguishers and therefore no way of putting out a fire but boeing says that it s fine and the airlines agree such is the fear of boeing s power that no one dares speak out tui british airways and virgin atlantic all told the observer that they abided by the safety requirements set out by aviation authorities and their aircraft had been checked and would continue to fly as normal boeing said that fewer than  of fire switches have proved defective and that it was supporting airlines with inspections and replacement parts boeing works closely with the faa to monitor the fleet for potential safety issues and take appropriate actions said a spokesperson engine fires are a very unlikely event and there have been no observed engine fires in the  fleet history the faa declined to comment on pilot concerns stating that it invited responses in february when the airworthiness directive was proposed ,Boeing Crisis,0.47844675183296204

The airline and Manchester airport confirmed the details of the incident.Officials in Pakistan blamed a shortage of airline staff for allowing the emergency exit door to be opened, according to the English-language newspaper Express Tribune.The flight carrying nearly 400 passengers eventually left Manchester at 5am on Saturday. It arrived in Islamabad seven hours late having made up some time during the journey. Several other departures from Manchester were also delayed as a result of the disruption.The travel misery did not end there. Flight PK702 was only able to take off when 38 passengers volunteered to disembark, owing to its evacuation capacity being reduced, and some of those have since complained that their baggage was left behind in Manchester.One passenger, tweeting as Sleeping Beauty, wrote after arriving in Islamabad on another flight: “Pathetic service from pia.

10094,"Nasa will allow unprecedented commercial access to the International Space Station (ISS) for marketing, business and space tourism, the agency announced on Friday.The change paves the way for the wealthy to rocket from Earth and spend time aboard the astronaut home and laboratory in space, through trips planned by private enterprise, and for businesses to develop products or shoot film – including adverts – in space.The move is part of Nasa’s effort to put the first woman and another man on the moon by 2024. Until now, the space station has only been used for research and development.“We are so excited to be part of Nasa as our home and laboratory in space transitions into being accessible to expanded commercial and marketing opportunities, as well as to private astronauts,” said astronaut Christina Koch, in a Nasa tweet.“Enabling a vibrant economy in low-Earth orbit has always been a driving element of the space station program, and will make space more accessible to all Americans,” Koch said. “Transitioning toward this new model of business is an important step to allow Nasa to move full speed ahead in landing the first woman and the next man on the moon.”The new directive will allow private astronauts to spend up to 30 days in low-Earth orbit aboard the ISS through trips planned by private companies. Nasa said it believes it can accommodate up to two privately funded, short-duration missions a year with, essentially, space tourists.Private astronauts will have to reimburse the government for the costs to the space station, including $11,250 a day for life support and toilets, and $22,500 a day for food, air and medical supplies. However, astronauts will have to pay a private company to get to the space station, and those tickets will probably cost millions.Eventually, Nasa hopes the space station will be just one of several “commercial and free-flying habitable destinations in low-Earth orbit”. For now, Nasa is making one space station port available for commercial uses “for a finite period of time”.The move is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to end government funding for the ISS, and allow commercial enterprise to fund what is now astronauts’ home in space.“Nasa is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we’ve never done before,” the chief financial officer, Jeff DeWit, said in New York, according to the BBC.Other details, such as exactly who would be eligible to buy a ticket to the ISS, were not disclosed.Last year, a committee formed by the Trump administration floated the idea of allowing astronauts to appear in marketing, such as on cereal boxes, for commercials to be filmed in the space station or even for extra-terrestrial rover vehicles to have logos in the way that racing cars do. The committee is headed by an attorney who works in government relations for the space tech firm Maxar Technologies.“Commercial companies will play an important role both here in low-Earth orbit and around the moon, working with Nasa to test technologies train astronauts and develop a sustainable human presence,” said Koch.Astronauts have lived aboard the space station for more than 18 years conducting thousands of experiments. The ISS costs Nasa roughly $3bn to $4bn a year to operate, according to the Verge.",Nasa to allow commercial access to the International Space Station,2019-06-07/17:53:04,nasa will allow unprecedented commercial access to the international space station iss for marketing business and space tourism the agency announced on friday the change paves the way for the wealthy to rocket from earth and spend time aboard the astronaut home and laboratory in space through trips planned by private enterprise and for businesses to develop products or shoot film including adverts in space the move is part of nasa s effort to put the first woman and another man on the moon by  until now the space station has only been used for research and development we are so excited to be part of nasa as our home and laboratory in space transitions into being accessible to expanded commercial and marketing opportunities as well as to private astronauts said astronaut christina koch in a nasa tweet enabling a vibrant economy in low earth orbit has always been a driving element of the space station program and will make space more accessible to all americans koch said transitioning toward this new model of business is an important step to allow nasa to move full speed ahead in landing the first woman and the next man on the moon the new directive will allow private astronauts to spend up to  days in low earth orbit aboard the iss through trips planned by private companies nasa said it believes it can accommodate up to two privately funded short duration missions a year with essentially space tourists private astronauts will have to reimburse the government for the costs to the space station including   a day for life support and toilets and   a day for food air and medical supplies however astronauts will have to pay a private company to get to the space station and those tickets will probably cost millions eventually nasa hopes the space station will be just one of several commercial and free flying habitable destinations in low earth orbit for now nasa is making one space station port available for commercial uses for a finite period of time the move is part of a broader push by the trump administration to end government funding for the iss and allow commercial enterprise to fund what is now astronauts home in space nasa is opening the international space station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we ve never done before the chief financial officer jeff dewit said in new york according to the bbc other details such as exactly who would be eligible to buy a ticket to the iss were not disclosed last year a committee formed by the trump administration floated the idea of allowing astronauts to appear in marketing such as on cereal boxes for commercials to be filmed in the space station or even for extra terrestrial rover vehicles to have logos in the way that racing cars do the committee is headed by an attorney who works in government relations for the space tech firm maxar technologies commercial companies will play an important role both here in low earth orbit and around the moon working with nasa to test technologies train astronauts and develop a sustainable human presence said koch astronauts have lived aboard the space station for more than  years conducting thousands of experiments the iss costs nasa roughly bn to bn a year to operate according to the verge ,Boeing Crisis,0.3448624610900879
10152,"Airport security queues could soon be less stressful for Heathrow passengers who should be able to keep liquids and laptops in their hand baggage when new 3D scanners are introduced.Following successful trials of the new equipment, the UK’s biggest airport plans to spend £50m on new scanners across its four terminals by 2022.The computed tomography (CT) scanners, used in hospitals to scan patients, produce more detailed images that allow security staff to assess cabin bags with electronic equipment and liquids inside.The technology is expected to lead to a relaxation of current rules, which state that passengers can only carry liquids such as toiletries or medicine in individual containers of 100ml or less, with the items placed in a separate, clear plastic bag to pass through security. The changes should cut queuing times, as well as reduce plastic waste.There are hopes that the improved technology could potentially end the liquids ban altogether. However, abolition would likely require the scanners to be installed at all airports, an expensive process that could take several years beyond Heathrow’s 2022 target.The CT technology is used at some airports in Europe and the US – including Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport and JFK in New York – but Heathrow was the first UK airport to install the scanners, which it started testing in 2017. The Department for Transport is planning to trial the scanners at other UK airports this summer.The aviation minister, Baroness Vere, said: “Passenger safety remains our top priority and this programme clearly shows the huge importance we place on security.“This innovative new equipment will ensure Heathrow continues to provide a safe and smooth travel experience for passengers, as we look to roll out this new screening technology at airports across the country.”Heathrow’s chief operations officer, Chris Garton, added: “This cutting-edge equipment will not only keep the airport safe with the latest technology, but will mean that our future passengers can keep their focus on getting on with their journeys and spend less time preparing for security screening.”",Heathrow's £50m scanners to mean liquids can stay in hand luggage,2019-06-06/11:42:10,airport security queues could soon be less stressful for heathrow passengers who should be able to keep liquids and laptops in their hand baggage when new d scanners are introduced following successful trials of the new equipment the uk s biggest airport plans to spend m on new scanners across its four terminals by  the computed tomography ct scanners used in hospitals to scan patients produce more detailed images that allow security staff to assess cabin bags with electronic equipment and liquids inside the technology is expected to lead to a relaxation of current rules which state that passengers can only carry liquids such as toiletries or medicine in individual containers of ml or less with the items placed in a separate clear plastic bag to pass through security the changes should cut queuing times as well as reduce plastic waste there are hopes that the improved technology could potentially end the liquids ban altogether however abolition would likely require the scanners to be installed at all airports an expensive process that could take several years beyond heathrow s  target the ct technology is used at some airports in europe and the us including amsterdam s schiphol airport and jfk in new york but heathrow was the first uk airport to install the scanners which it started testing in  the department for transport is planning to trial the scanners at other uk airports this summer the aviation minister baroness vere said passenger safety remains our top priority and this programme clearly shows the huge importance we place on security this innovative new equipment will ensure heathrow continues to provide a safe and smooth travel experience for passengers as we look to roll out this new screening technology at airports across the country heathrow s chief operations officer chris garton added this cutting edge equipment will not only keep the airport safe with the latest technology but will mean that our future passengers can keep their focus on getting on with their journeys and spend less time preparing for security screening ,Boeing Crisis,0.358854204416275
10229,"The number of Swedes taking the train for domestic journeys has risen as plane journeys inside the country have fallen, reflecting rapidly growing public concern about the climate crisis.“Flygskam”, or flight shame, the feeling of being embarrassed or ashamed to take the plane because of the environmental impact, has become a social media buzzword along with the hashtag #jagstannarpåmarken, which translates as #stayontheground.Echoing the schoolgirl climate activist Greta Thunberg’s refusal to fly because of the harm to the environment, a survey published last week by Swedish Railways (SJ) found 37% of respondents chose to travel by rail instead of air, compared with 26% last autumn and 20% in early 2018.SJ said the shift was evident in its passenger numbers: the total number of journeys on its network rose by 5% last year to 31.8m, but then by a further 8% in the first quarter of this year, with business trips surging 12%.The trend was also apparent in recent figures from Swedavia, which operates Sweden’s 10 busiest airports. The company said domestic passenger numbers fell by 8% from January to April, following a 3% fall in the whole of 2018.For the first time, climate impact tops travellers’ reasons for choosing the train. “Rail travel is soaring thanks to climate fears,” said an SJ spokesman, Tobbe Lundell, adding that the operator was boosting capacity, particularly on longer routes such as between Stockholm, Malmö and Gothenburg.According to SJ, a single flight between Sweden’s two biggest cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg, generates as much CO2 as 40,000 train journeys – a fact that has plainly struck a chord with Swedes, previously a nation of frequent flyers that last year experienced a record heatwave and wildfires in the Arctic.According to a report commissioned by the Swedish environmental protection agency, in 2017 the country’s aviation sector was responsible for producing 1.1 tonnes of emissions per head of the population, five times more than the global average.But while Swedish tour operators are starting to offer inclusive trips abroad by train, it may take some time for climate concerns to influence most Swedes’ foreign travel plans. Rail trips abroad from Sweden can be long: the average flight from Stockholm to Paris is two hours 35 minutes; the same journey by train can take 24 hours.",#stayontheground: Swedes turn to trains amid climate 'flight shame',2019-06-04/14:52:25,the number of swedes taking the train for domestic journeys has risen as plane journeys inside the country have fallen reflecting rapidly growing public concern about the climate crisis flygskam or flight shame the feeling of being embarrassed or ashamed to take the plane because of the environmental impact has become a social media buzzword along with the hashtag jagstannarpåmarken which translates as stayontheground echoing the schoolgirl climate activist greta thunberg s refusal to fly because of the harm to the environment a survey published last week by swedish railways sj found  of respondents chose to travel by rail instead of air compared with  last autumn and  in early  sj said the shift was evident in its passenger numbers the total number of journeys on its network rose by  last year to  m but then by a further  in the first quarter of this year with business trips surging  the trend was also apparent in recent figures from swedavia which operates sweden s  busiest airports the company said domestic passenger numbers fell by  from january to april following a  fall in the whole of  for the first time climate impact tops travellers reasons for choosing the train rail travel is soaring thanks to climate fears said an sj spokesman tobbe lundell adding that the operator was boosting capacity particularly on longer routes such as between stockholm malmö and gothenburg according to sj a single flight between sweden s two biggest cities stockholm and gothenburg generates as much co as   train journeys a fact that has plainly struck a chord with swedes previously a nation of frequent flyers that last year experienced a record heatwave and wildfires in the arctic according to a report commissioned by the swedish environmental protection agency in  the country s aviation sector was responsible for producing   tonnes of emissions per head of the population five times more than the global average but while swedish tour operators are starting to offer inclusive trips abroad by train it may take some time for climate concerns to influence most swedes foreign travel plans rail trips abroad from sweden can be long the average flight from stockholm to paris is two hours  minutes the same journey by train can take  hours ,Boeing Crisis,0.2301068902015686
10271,"Safety regulators in the US have identified a further problem in Boeing’s grounded 737 Max model and the generation of planes that preceded it.The Federal Aviation Administration has told airlines to check more than 300 737 aircraft, including 179 of the Max model, for improperly manufactured parts.The affected components – part of the wing – help provide lift during takeoff and landing, and “may be susceptible to premature failure or cracks resulting from the improper manufacturing process”, the FAA said on Sunday.The 737 Max, Boeing’s top-selling passenger jet, was taken out of service in March after the second fatal crash in four months. A total of 346 people died in the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters.The manufacturer said it had not been told of any issues during flying regarding the potentially faulty parts. It said there were 20 737 Max airplanes that were likely to have the defective parts, and that airlines would check an additional 159 planes. Another 133 of the 737 NG model, a predecessor to the Max, will also be checked.The FAA said a complete failure of the part, called a leading-edge slat track, would not cause a crash, but could cause aircraft damage in flight. Airlines operating the affected NG planes need to remove faulty parts within 10 days, but can continue to operate them in the meantime.However, the wider worries around the 737 Max led to a $1bn (£790m) order being put on hold on Monday, as the Azerbaijan airline AZAL postponed an order for 10 planes.Boeing has yet to finalise a software upgrade, which it hopes will convince regulators that it is safe for the plane to return to the skies. Although investigations continue, a controversial automated anti-stall system, MCAS, has been implicated in both crashes.Last week, the head of the global airline trade body, IATA, said it would be at least August before the all clear was given, with regulators outside the US having indicated that they will also expect to give separate clearance rather than accept the FAA ruling.However, Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, told reporters at IATA’s AGM in Seoul that it could take six months to restore 737 Max operations, saying: “If it is in the air by Christmas, I’ll be surprised.”",Further safety issue found in grounded Boeing 737 Max planes,2019-06-03/17:01:34,safety regulators in the us have identified a further problem in boeing s grounded  max model and the generation of planes that preceded it the federal aviation administration has told airlines to check more than   aircraft including  of the max model for improperly manufactured parts the affected components part of the wing help provide lift during takeoff and landing and may be susceptible to premature failure or cracks resulting from the improper manufacturing process the faa said on sunday the  max boeing s top selling passenger jet was taken out of service in march after the second fatal crash in four months a total of  people died in the ethiopian airlines and lion air disasters the manufacturer said it had not been told of any issues during flying regarding the potentially faulty parts it said there were   max airplanes that were likely to have the defective parts and that airlines would check an additional  planes another  of the  ng model a predecessor to the max will also be checked the faa said a complete failure of the part called a leading edge slat track would not cause a crash but could cause aircraft damage in flight airlines operating the affected ng planes need to remove faulty parts within  days but can continue to operate them in the meantime however the wider worries around the  max led to a bn m order being put on hold on monday as the azerbaijan airline azal postponed an order for  planes boeing has yet to finalise a software upgrade which it hopes will convince regulators that it is safe for the plane to return to the skies although investigations continue a controversial automated anti stall system mcas has been implicated in both crashes last week the head of the global airline trade body iata said it would be at least august before the all clear was given with regulators outside the us having indicated that they will also expect to give separate clearance rather than accept the faa ruling however tim clark the president of emirates told reporters at iata s agm in seoul that it could take six months to restore  max operations saying if it is in the air by christmas i ll be surprised ,Boeing Crisis,0.5335254073143005

10562,"Even without missiles being test-fired into the sky by a hostile regime 35 miles to the north, airline executives might be a little tense next weekend. More than 1,000 of them will gather in the South Korean capital, Seoul, for the big event in the industry’s calendar, the International Air Transport Association’s general meeting.Many Iata members have a degree of protection from turbulence thanks to deep pockets, airline alliances, sheer size, or national loyalty. But the big issues to be discussed in Seoul may still keep some jet-lagged executives awake at night.Globally, the industry is still turning a profit. It is on course for a 10th straight year of positive returns, after racking up losses in the financial crisis. Jet fuel is still far cheaper than the $120-plus per barrel airlines had to pay until 2013 but, bar a sharp plunge in late 2018, the price is heading upwards. European carriers in particular are looking shaky, with a combined loss in early 2019 ten times worse than last year’s first quarter – although the collapse of smaller airlines may allow survivors to increase fares. Behind the low yield from passengers is another statistic that might spook the industry: a tailing-off in demand for air freight. If the Trump trade war escalates, storm clouds could appear.More than once this decade, Iata has proudly reported the safest year on record for aviation. Drilling down into the statistics to separate out old turboprops from international commercial flights, the organisation has spoken of “zero western-built passenger jet hull losses”. These modern planes, conventional wisdom had it, did not fall out of the skies. Now the two Boeing 737 Max crashes, with 346 fatalities, have shaken that complacency. The repercussions for an industry that has ordered hundreds more 737 Max aircraft, expecting to retire its older planes and fly further and cheaper, are not clear. Some fear passengers will refuse to fly on 737 Max planes if and when regulatory approval is restored, with a breakdown in trust in the whole process of certification.Back in the days when Britain was a key part of Europe, even international airlines were clamouring for access to Heathrow: tearing down the opposition to a third runway became a key objective. With that one in the bag, the discussion has largely moved on from airports – although Mexico’s decision to scrap plans for a new international hub at the capital has provoked some airline consternation. The new “infrastructure” issue is airspace: airlines see the highways in the skies, in Europe in particular, getting clogged, and the traffic lights malfunctioning due to a lack of staff and strike-happy controllers. Plans for an efficient, pan-European traffic control system, which could both straighten flight paths to save fuel and dampen the impact of local industrial action, have stagnated.As growing protests declare a climate emergency, and other sectors clean up their act, transport looks ever more the problem. And within the sector, aviation has yet to identify even the potential solutions that land-based transport can envisage. “Only a highly [greenhouse gas] emitting volatile fuel has the weight-to-power density that allows you to fly,” says aviation consultant Andrew Charlton. Airlines have clung to a “sustainable roadmap” that looks an ever weaker response to the climate emergency, largely reliant on carbon offsetting. The main plank of that, the Corsia scheme agreed in 2018 via the UN, whereby international airlines will voluntarily report and offset emissions above current levels, has started but not been secured. And, says Charlton, “what seemed like a clever idea is now … looking a pretty relaxed timetable. The airlines think it’s a fantastic win, so you can guess from that it’s not very demanding.” A technological breakthrough will be sorely needed for aviation to continue as is.

10632,"American Airlines’ pilots’ union has hit back at Boeing for insinuating that some responsibility for the two crashes of its 737 Max jets lies with the pilots, and claimed AA pilots made several suggestions to Boeing to fix the plane’s anti-stall systems before the second crash.Describing Boeing’s position as “inexcusable”, Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, accused Boeing of unfairly blaming foreign pilots involved in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes.Tajer told CNN: “Shame on you. We’re going to call you out on it. That’s a poisoned, diseased philosophy.” Asked if the Ethiopian crash might have been prevented if Boeing had acted on the US pilots’ concerns, Tajer said: “I think that’s a fair conclusion.”Tajer said the Ethiopian Airlines pilots did what they were instructed to do, but that Boeing’s controversial anti-stall software (MCAS) forced the plane into such an aggressive nosedive that the pilots could not recover. “They had wired that thing so that it was irrecoverable. It just blew us away,” Tajer said.In the original exchange with Boeing, the audio of which was released earlier this month, pilots angrily confronted a Boeing official about the MCAS system implicated in both crashes.“These guys didn’t even know the damn system was on the airplane,” a pilot said.In recent weeks, Boeing has tried to shift blame for both crashes from its software systems. In April, Dennis Muilenburg, the company’s chief executive, claimed the 737 Max was correctly designed and suggested the pilots did not “completely” follow the procedures that Boeing had outlined.Ethiopian officials have insisted the Ethiopian Airlines pilots repeatedly performed all of Boeing’s procedures, but were unable to recover the plane. Ethiopian Airlines also complained that Boeing did not do enough to warn them about the system or provide functioning cockpit alerts about problems with sensors.Earlier this week, US aviation officials said a bird strike may have triggered the faulty data that led to the MCAS system engaging. However, an Ethiopian Airlines spokesman said that the preliminary crash investigation report showed “no evidence of any foreign object damage”.At a meeting on Thursday, 33 international aviation authorities will meet the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to discuss the process of review for the software fixes Boeing is to make to fix the MCAS system and give pilots greater control.FAA’s acting administrator, Dan Elwell, rejected the idea that the twin crashes involving the aircraft have shaken trust between foreign regulators and the FAA. He said the FAA and the other regulators remain in “constant, close communication”.But he would not predict a timeline for certifying Boeing’s software fix. When asked whether plans to return the 737 Max to service in August were realistic, Elwell admitted recertification could be pushed to October or beyond.",American Airlines union: blaming pilots for Boeing 737 Max crashes 'inexcusable',2019-05-23/16:40:51,american airlines pilots union has hit back at boeing for insinuating that some responsibility for the two crashes of its  max jets lies with the pilots and claimed aa pilots made several suggestions to boeing to fix the plane s anti stall systems before the second crash describing boeing s position as inexcusable dennis tajer a spokesman for the allied pilots association accused boeing of unfairly blaming foreign pilots involved in the lion air and ethiopian airlines crashes tajer told cnn shame on you we re going to call you out on it that s a poisoned diseased philosophy asked if the ethiopian crash might have been prevented if boeing had acted on the us pilots concerns tajer said i think that s a fair conclusion tajer said the ethiopian airlines pilots did what they were instructed to do but that boeing s controversial anti stall software mcas forced the plane into such an aggressive nosedive that the pilots could not recover they had wired that thing so that it was irrecoverable it just blew us away tajer said in the original exchange with boeing the audio of which was released earlier this month pilots angrily confronted a boeing official about the mcas system implicated in both crashes these guys didn t even know the damn system was on the airplane a pilot said in recent weeks boeing has tried to shift blame for both crashes from its software systems in april dennis muilenburg the company s chief executive claimed the  max was correctly designed and suggested the pilots did not completely follow the procedures that boeing had outlined ethiopian officials have insisted the ethiopian airlines pilots repeatedly performed all of boeing s procedures but were unable to recover the plane ethiopian airlines also complained that boeing did not do enough to warn them about the system or provide functioning cockpit alerts about problems with sensors earlier this week us aviation officials said a bird strike may have triggered the faulty data that led to the mcas system engaging however an ethiopian airlines spokesman said that the preliminary crash investigation report showed no evidence of any foreign object damage at a meeting on thursday  international aviation authorities will meet the federal aviation administration faa to discuss the process of review for the software fixes boeing is to make to fix the mcas system and give pilots greater control faa s acting administrator dan elwell rejected the idea that the twin crashes involving the aircraft have shaken trust between foreign regulators and the faa he said the faa and the other regulators remain in constant close communication but he would not predict a timeline for certifying boeing s software fix when asked whether plans to return the  max to service in august were realistic elwell admitted recertification could be pushed to october or beyond ,Boeing Crisis,0.448349267244339
10709,"Boeing officials, shortly after the first fatal crash of its 737 Max jet, played down the likelihood that a bird strike could impair the plane’s sensor equipment. Now investigators are exploring whether such a situation led to a second deadly accident just five months later.According to the Wall Street Journal, US aviation authorities believe a bird collision may have set off the sequence of events that led to the downing of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max in March, in which 157 people died.American Airlines pilots called a meeting with Boeing last November after a Lion Air Max crashed in Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers and crew.The Journal reviewed a recording of the meeting in which Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice-president of product strategy, raised and dismissed the possibility that a bird strike could trigger a second crash by affecting the Max’s controversial sensor system.Sinnett told the pilots he was “absolutely” confident that heightened pilot awareness following the Lion Air disaster had further reduced the chances of another accident.Ethiopian Airlines has been facing criticism of its pilots’ conduct in the wake of the crash. At a House hearing into the accidents last week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) administrator, Daniel Elwell, said pilot error contributed to the crash.In both crashes, the Max’s anti-stall system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (Mcas), appears to have forced the planes’ noses down shortly after takeoff, leaving the pilots struggling unsuccessfully to right the jets before they crashed.The Mcas system may have been reacting to faulty information from sensors that could have been damaged by a bird strike.Ethiopian Airlines has rejected accusations that its pilots contributed to the crash. Officials have said Boeing failed to provide cockpit alerts that would have warned the pilots about sensor errors.Last week, the airline said its pilots followed procedures set out by the FAA and Boeing but “none of the expected warnings appeared in the cockpit, which deprived the pilots of necessary and timely information”.Nine countries and the US justice department are currently investigating the crashes.",Boeing dismissed chance of 'bird strike' that may have caused second 737 Max crash,2019-05-21/16:25:07,boeing officials shortly after the first fatal crash of its  max jet played down the likelihood that a bird strike could impair the plane s sensor equipment now investigators are exploring whether such a situation led to a second deadly accident just five months later according to the wall street journal us aviation authorities believe a bird collision may have set off the sequence of events that led to the downing of an ethiopian airlines  max in march in which  people died american airlines pilots called a meeting with boeing last november after a lion air max crashed in indonesia killing all  passengers and crew the journal reviewed a recording of the meeting in which mike sinnett boeing s vice president of product strategy raised and dismissed the possibility that a bird strike could trigger a second crash by affecting the max s controversial sensor system sinnett told the pilots he was absolutely confident that heightened pilot awareness following the lion air disaster had further reduced the chances of another accident ethiopian airlines has been facing criticism of its pilots conduct in the wake of the crash at a house hearing into the accidents last week the federal aviation administration faa administrator daniel elwell said pilot error contributed to the crash in both crashes the max s anti stall system called the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system mcas appears to have forced the planes noses down shortly after takeoff leaving the pilots struggling unsuccessfully to right the jets before they crashed the mcas system may have been reacting to faulty information from sensors that could have been damaged by a bird strike ethiopian airlines has rejected accusations that its pilots contributed to the crash officials have said boeing failed to provide cockpit alerts that would have warned the pilots about sensor errors last week the airline said its pilots followed procedures set out by the faa and boeing but none of the expected warnings appeared in the cockpit which deprived the pilots of necessary and timely information nine countries and the us justice department are currently investigating the crashes ,Boeing Crisis,0.44186919927597046

29,"SAO PAULO   - Beverage distributors working for Brazilian brewer Ambev SA (ABEV3.SA) have filed a complaint against the company at the local antitrust regulator Cade, accusing it of anticompetitive practices. An industry group representing 110 resellers and logistic distributors, known as Confenar, blames Ambev for implementing abusive commercial policies due to its dominant market position in Brazil. “Ambev creates a closed and vicious cycle of control, determining resellers to work on the product mix they want, in the format, price and structure of their interest,” Confenar’s president, Ataíde Gil Guerreiro, said in a statement on Friday. Fines applied to companies found guilty of anticompetitive practices may range from 0.1% to 20% of the gross revenue in the year preceding the filing of the complaint, Cade said in an emailed statement. Ambev said in a statement that it regrets that Confenar has taken to Cade private contract negotiations, which has been ongoing for months. “Confenar wants a guarantee of minimum profitability, which goes against free enterprise and business logic, and is using authorities as an instrument to try to pressure Ambev in a private negotiation,” it said in a statement sent to Reuters. The company also said that all of its commercial policies “are thoroughly reviewed by a committee with external members and are absolutely in line with current laws, including antitrust.” Earlier on Friday, Latin America’s largest brewery reported a 9.7% fall in third-quarter net profit hurt by a jump in costs and slowed volume growth in its home market.

135,"WASHINGTON   - A top Democratic senator on Thursday questioned whether President Donald Trump interfered with a criminal investigation of Turkey’s Halkbank, which has been accused of conspiring to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking if Trump or anyone acting on the president’s behalf had asked Mnuchin to “handle, intervene, or otherwise engage with Turkish concerns related to Halkbank, or with Halkbank generally?”  Wyden said he was launching an investigation to examine the relationship between Halkbank and Trump administration officials. The letter cited an Oct. 16 Bloomberg report that Trump told Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in April that Mnuchin and U.S. Attorney General William Barr would handle the Halkbank issue. Wyden said he expected an answer by Nov. 20. U.S. federal prosecutors in Manhattan earlier this month charged Turkey’s second-largest state bank with fraud and money laundering, among other sanctions-related offenses, using sham food and gold transactions to get around U.S. sanctions.  Halkbank has denied the charges.  The U.S. court case has further strained tensions between Turkey and the United States, which have been at odds over a number of issues, including Ankara’s Syria incursion and purchase of a Russian missile defense system. The charges against Halkbank are the latest development in a U.S. criminal case that became public in 2016 with the arrest in Miami of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader accused of playing a central role in the sanctions evasion scheme.  Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Halkbank deputy general manager, was arrested in New York the following year. He was sentenced to 32 months in prison following his conviction and was released and returned to Turkey earlier this year. Zarrab pleaded guilty and testified for U.S. prosecutors at Atilla’s trial. Before pleading guilty, Zarrab hired Rudy Giuliani, a longtime associate of Trump, to try to negotiate a deal between the U.S. and Turkish governments to secure his release. Zarrab said that Iran, with the help of Halkbank and Turkish government officials, including Erdogan, used a complex web of shell companies and sham transactions in gold, food and medicine to get around U.S. sanctions. Turkish officials raised Halkbank in their discussions with American counterparts last week, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence   told a press conference in Ankara following the talks, which were focused on Syria. Pence said the Turks were told this was a matter for the Southern District of New York, whose prosecutors brought the criminal case. Turkey’s Erdogan has blasted the U.S. charges against Halkbank and called the case an ‘unlawful, ugly’ step.

182,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed four pieces of legislation taking a hard line on China, three related to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and one commending Canada in its dispute over the extradition of a Chinese telecom executive. All four measures passed by unanimous voice vote, as members of Congress - Democrats and Republicans - said they wanted to take an aggressive stance on China and show support for Hong Kong following four months of unrest in the city. The measures come as the White House engages in delicate talks with Beijing to resolve a crippling trade war, with U.S. Treasury yields edging lower on Tuesday as investors pared back expectations that an agreement was at hand. One of the measures, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would require the U.S. secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong retained its autonomy in order to keep receiving the special treatment that has allowed it to be a major financial center. A second, the Protect Hong Kong Act, would bar commercial exports of military and crowd-control items that Hong Kong police could use against demonstrators. China’s foreign ministry accused the U.S. lawmakers of “sinister intentions” to undermine Hong Kong’s stability and warned that bilateral relations would be damaged should the measures become law.  “China must take effective measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement.  The Senate has not yet scheduled votes on the legislation, which would send the measures to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. However, a Foreign Relations Committee aide said votes on Hong Kong-related measures were expected in the chamber in the coming weeks.  The third measure passed by the House is a non-binding  resolution recognizing Hong Kong’s relationship to the United States, condemning Beijing’s “interference” in its affairs, and supporting the right of the city’s residents to protest. The Hong Kong government expressed regret over the passage of the legislation and reiterated that foreign legislatures should not interfere in the city’s internal affairs.     The fourth measure was another non-binding House resolution commending Canada for its actions related to a U.S. request to extradite Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, who was arrested in Canada in December. Meng is charged in the United States with bank fraud and is accused of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc about Huawei’s business in Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition. The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions. Many Republican and Democratic members of Congress say they view the company as a security threat. Hong Kong has been rocked by at times violent protests over concerns Beijing is tightening its grip on the former British colony and eroding its democratic system. Beijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, like the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble. The unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He has warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.

The market for adult diapers, disposable underwear and absorbent pads is growing fast, up 9% last year to $9 billion, having doubled in the last decade, according to Euromonitor. But manufacturers like market leaders Essity (ESSITYa.ST) and Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) reckon only half of the more than 400 million adults likely to be affected by weak bladders, are buying the right products, because they are too embarrassed. Companies are trying various methods to change attitudes, including making products more discreet, avoiding terms like diapers or nappies, and placing items in the personal care aisle, next to deodorants and menstrual pads, rather than in the baby products section. They are also trying to normalize discussions around the subject through advertising. In Japan, where adult incontinence products have outsold baby diaper sales since around 2013 due to a rapidly ageing population, market leader Unicharm Corp (8113.T) has adopted the phrase “choi more” in its advertising, which translates as “lil’ dribble”, to make light of the problem. “What we are doing is trying to let people know that incontinence, even among young people, is normal,” said Unicharm spokesman Hitoshi Watanabe. The company is focusing particularly on people with mild bladder issues where it sees the biggest growth as people lead more active lives. Unicharm’s sales of absorbent pads and liners that target this market were up 8% last year. In the U.S., market leader Kimberly-Clark has this year given its 35-year-old Depend brand a makeover, introducing thinner, softer and more fitted products that can be worn discreetly, in an effort to make them more acceptable. The changes are just the latest in a decade-long attempt to win over consumers, which started with manufacturers dropping the ‘diaper’ label, to loosen the association older customers might have with a loss of control in their life. Yet it is still difficult for companies to persuade people they should buy specially made incontinence products. “People keep the fact that they have incontinence secret from their loved ones, from their husbands, brothers and sisters – this is a deep secret for many consumers and yet it’s just a fact of life, it’s a physiological reality,” said Fiona Tomlin, who leads Kimberly-Clark’s adult and feminine care division. Manufacturers have been particularly keen to win over women, who are more than twice as likely as men to experience bladder weakness, due to childbirth. Kimberly-Clark has reached out to them directly over the years in light-hearted ad campaigns featuring actresses Whoopi Goldberg and Kirstie Alley. Graphic: Incontinence affects three times more women than men, here Kimberly-Clark’s Poise brand is aimed at younger women like Ellie Foster, a 31-year-old from Maine, who has struggled with leaks since having her first child a year-and-a-half ago but is too embarrassed to buy products that might help her. “At first I did, but it was definitely weird picking out adult diapers to wear,” said Foster. “You feel like you’re in the old lady section.” Sweden’s Essity, the global industry leader, is also trying to reach a younger audience with its TENA brand and a new line of black, low-rise disposable underwear called Silhouette Noir. The advert’s tagline reads: ‘secret’s out: 1 in 3 women have incontinence’. Around 12% of all women and 5% of men experience some form of urinary incontinence, although conditions vary from mild and temporary to serious and chronic, according to the Global Forum on Incontinence, which is backed by Essity. Essity said it tries to package and market its products in a way that avoids associations with ageing. “Designing products and packaging it as feminine and discreet as possible for females and as masculine and discreet as possible for men helps,” said Ulrika Kolsrud, president of Essity’s health and medical solutions. Getting the message across to potential customers can sometimes be a tricky path to tread. A few years ago, SCA (SCAb.ST) - from which Essity was spun off in 2017 - mailed samples of its products to Swedish men above 55, only to receive a barrage of complaints. But efforts are starting to pay off. Five years ago, adult incontinence products were used by around 13% of the target adult female audience in France and the UK and that is now closer to 20%, according to research firm Kantar. That does, of course, leave huge potential for further sales growth. As Kolsrud puts it: “If incontinence was a country, it would be the third largest country in the world.” For the interactive graphic, click here: here ",Diaper rush: conquering a $9 billion market no one wants to talk about,"October 22, 2019 /  6:41 AM ",chicago tokyo the time may not be far off when more adults need diapers than babies as the population grows older potentially a huge opportunity for manufacturers of incontinence products if they can lift the stigma that has long constrained sales the market for adult diapers disposable underwear and absorbent pads is growing fast up  last year to  billion having doubled in the last decade according to euromonitor but manufacturers like market leaders essity essitya st and kimberly clark corp kmb n reckon only half of the more than  million adults likely to be affected by weak bladders are buying the right products because they are too embarrassed companies are trying various methods to change attitudes including making products more discreet avoiding terms like diapers or nappies and placing items in the personal care aisle next to deodorants and menstrual pads rather than in the baby products section they are also trying to normalize discussions around the subject through advertising in japan where adult incontinence products have outsold baby diaper sales since around  due to a rapidly ageing population market leader unicharm corp  t has adopted the phrase choi more in its advertising which translates as lil dribble to make light of the problem what we are doing is trying to let people know that incontinence even among young people is normal said unicharm spokesman hitoshi watanabe the company is focusing particularly on people with mild bladder issues where it sees the biggest growth as people lead more active lives unicharm s sales of absorbent pads and liners that target this market were up  last year in the u s market leader kimberly clark has this year given its  year old depend brand a makeover introducing thinner softer and more fitted products that can be worn discreetly in an effort to make them more acceptable the changes are just the latest in a decade long attempt to win over consumers which started with manufacturers dropping the diaper label to loosen the association older customers might have with a loss of control in their life yet it is still difficult for companies to persuade people they should buy specially made incontinence products people keep the fact that they have incontinence secret from their loved ones from their husbands brothers and sisters this is a deep secret for many consumers and yet it s just a fact of life it s a physiological reality said fiona tomlin who leads kimberly clark s adult and feminine care division manufacturers have been particularly keen to win over women who are more than twice as likely as men to experience bladder weakness due to childbirth kimberly clark has reached out to them directly over the years in light hearted ad campaigns featuring actresses whoopi goldberg and kirstie alley graphic incontinence affects three times more women than men here kimberly clark s poise brand is aimed at younger women like ellie foster a  year old from maine who has struggled with leaks since having her first child a year and a half ago but is too embarrassed to buy products that might help her at first i did but it was definitely weird picking out adult diapers to wear said foster you feel like you re in the old lady section sweden s essity the global industry leader is also trying to reach a younger audience with its tena brand and a new line of black low rise disposable underwear called silhouette noir the advert s tagline reads secret s out  in  women have incontinence around  of all women and  of men experience some form of urinary incontinence although conditions vary from mild and temporary to serious and chronic according to the global forum on incontinence which is backed by essity essity said it tries to package and market its products in a way that avoids associations with ageing designing products and packaging it as feminine and discreet as possible for females and as masculine and discreet as possible for men helps said ulrika kolsrud president of essity s health and medical solutions getting the message across to potential customers can sometimes be a tricky path to tread a few years ago sca scab st from which essity was spun off in  mailed samples of its products to swedish men above  only to receive a barrage of complaints but efforts are starting to pay off five years ago adult incontinence products were used by around  of the target adult female audience in france and the uk and that is now closer to  according to research firm kantar that does of course leave huge potential for further sales growth as kolsrud puts it if incontinence was a country it would be the third largest country in the world for the interactive graphic click here here ,Boeing Crisis,0.3914183974266052
386,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he thinks a trade deal between the United States and China will be signed by the time the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings take place in Chile on Nov. 16 and 17.  Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will provide Beijing’s perspective on the progress of the talks in a speech on Saturday, according to a tweet from editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid published by the People’s Daily of China’s ruling Communist Party. “I think it will get signed quite easily, hopefully by the summit in Chile, where President Xi and I will both be,” Trump told reporters at the White House, without providing details. “We’re working with China very well,” Trump also said. The White House has announced that China agreed to buy up to $50 billion of U.S. farm products annually, as part of the first phase of a trade deal, although China seems slow to follow through.  The so-called phase 1 deal was unveiled at the White House last week during a visit by vice premier He as part of a bid to end a tit-for-tat trade war between Beijing and Washington that has roiled markets and hammered global growth. U.S. officials said a second phase of negotiations could address thornier issues like forced technology transfer and non-financial services issues.

654,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump pressed Ukraine’s leader to investigate Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, in coordination with the U.S. attorney general and Trump’s personal lawyer, according to a summary of a telephone call released by the Trump administration on Wednesday. The official account of the half-hour July call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy laid bare an astonishing exchange of requests, pledges and ingratiation, including some unrelated to Biden. The summary was released a day after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic-led chamber was launching an official impeachment inquiry, setting  up a political showdown that threatens Trump’s presidency as he campaigns for re-election in 2020. A Pelosi aide said that in two meetings with Democratic leaders on Wednesday, the speaker suggested the possibility of making the inquiry narrowly focused on Trump and his dealings with Ukraine, after months of House committee hearings on a range of other activities by the president. No final decisions were made, the aide said. The Washington Post first reported that possible strategy earlier on Wednesday. The inquiry could lead to articles of impeachment in the House that could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office.  The details of the July 25 call drew furious reactions from Democrats, who accused Trump of soliciting Ukraine’s help to smear Biden, who has led in polls among Democratic candidates seeking to challenge the Republican president in the November 2020 election. The call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of nearly $400 million in American aid to Ukraine, which the administration only later released. “What those notes reflect is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,” said Democrat Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ABC News reported that an adviser to Zelenskiy, Serhiy Leshchenko, contended that any telephone conversation between Trump and the newly elected leader of Ukraine came with a U.S. precondition that the Biden case would be discussed. Republicans said the summary of the call showed Democrats were wrong to move forward with impeachment. “There was no quid pro quo and nothing to justify the clamor House Democrats caused,” said U.S. Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. Trump and Zelenskiy appeared side by side in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and denied impropriety in their call, with Ukraine’s president telling reporters: “Nobody pushed me.” At a news conference closing out three days of meetings in New York around the General Assembly, Trump accused Democrats of launching the impeachment inquiry “because they can’t beat us at the ballot.” In a statement, Biden said Trump put personal politics above his oath of office and that Congress must hold him to account for “his abuse of power.” The controversy arose after a whistleblower from within the U.S. intelligence community brought a complaint relating to Trump’s conversation with Zelenskiy.  Members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees were allowed to see the complaint on Wednesday, the day before acting U.S. director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testifies at a House intelligence panel hearing.   Late on Wednesday, Representative Chris Stewart, a Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a Twitter posting that the complaint had been declassified. “I encourage you all to read it,” he tweeted. But it was not yet clear when it would be released to the public. Democratic lawmakers said the allegations were credible and deeply disturbing, while Republicans largely downplayed the complaint. According to the summary, Trump told Zelenskiy that Attorney General William Barr, the top U.S. law enforcement official, and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani would speak to him about reopening a Ukrainian investigation into a Ukrainian gas company for which Biden’s son Hunter had served as director. “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said, referring to Barr. Trump has repeatedly suggested wrongdoing by Biden and his son but has offered no evidence to back up the assertion. In the summary, Trump never explicitly told Zelenskiy that U.S. aid was contingent on him investigating Biden, but Trump emphasized the importance of American support before pressing him for action on Biden. “I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,” Trump said. Trump then said German Chancellor Angela Merkel “doesn’t do anything” for Ukraine but that “the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.” According to the summary, Zelenskiy responds that Trump is “1,000%” right, thanks Trump for “your great support in the area of defense” and said he planned to buy more Javelins, anti-tank missiles developed by the U.S. military that are now produced by Raytheon Co (RTN.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). In raising the Biden issue, Trump told Zelenskiy: “I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair.” Trump said he would have Giuliani - a political ally with no formal role in the U.S. government - and Barr call him. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me,” Trump said. There has been no evidence that Biden, who served as U.S. vice president from 2009 to 2017, used his position to help his son in the Ukraine matter. Zelenskiy assured Trump that his next prosecutor general “will be 100% my person” and “will look into the situation.” Zelenskiy, a former comedian, then volunteered that the last time he visited New York, he stayed at Trump Tower. He told Ukrainian media later that he thought only Trump’s side of their phone call would be published. “I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation,” Zelenskiy added. After Zelenskiy’s promise, Trump invites him to visit the White House. Trump never actually asked Barr to contact Ukraine, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, and Barr has not communicated with Ukraine about a possible investigation or any other subject. Barr, a Trump appointee, first found out about the conversation several weeks after it took place, Kupec said. Pelosi said the notes on the call confirmed that Trump engaged in behavior that undermined the integrity of U.S. elections, the dignity of the presidency and national security. “The president has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad,” Pelosi said. The summary, not a verbatim transcript, was developed with assistance from voice-recognition software along with note takers and experts listening, a White House official said. Trump has withstood repeated scandals since taking office in 2017. House Democrats had considered, but never moved ahead with, pursuing articles of impeachment over Trump’s actions relating to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election aimed at boosting his candidacy. Under the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to impeach a president for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” No president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Democrats control the House and Trump’s fellow Republicans control the Senate. Justice Department officials concluded last week that Trump’s conduct on the call did not amount to a criminal violation of campaign finance law because what he was asking for - an investigation of a political rival - was not a quantifiable “thing of value,” said a senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The United States, European countries and others had pushed for the ouster of the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating the energy company because he was not pursuing it aggressively enough. The prosecutor who replaced him, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Reuters on Friday that no wrongdoing was found on the part of Biden’s son in his relationship with the energy firm. Ukrainian officials have not said publicly that they would open any investigation of Biden or his son. Many Republicans came to Trump’s defense and said the absence of a quid pro quo - a Latin phrase meaning a favor for a favor - in the call showed that the concerns of Democrats were overblown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced what he called the Democratic “impeachment obsession.” Senator Pat Toomey said Trump’s conversation about Biden was inappropriate but not an impeachable offense. But fellow Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he had read the memo and “it remains troubling in the extreme.” The United States has been giving military aid to Ukraine since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The $391.5 million in aid at issue in the current controversy was approved by Congress to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country. The whistleblower was concerned that Trump was pressuring a foreign leader to take an official action that would help his 2020 re-election, according to a legal memo released by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. The Inspector General’s office found “some indication of an arguable political bias” by the whistleblower in favor of a rival political candidate,” but determined that the allegation appeared credible, according to the office. The Justice Department said Barr would not recuse himself from Ukraine-related investigations despite Democratic demands.

858,"WASHINGTON/SAO PAULO   - Southwest Airlines Co and Brazil’s Gol Linhas Aereas have grounded a total of 13 Boeing Co 737 NG airplanes, the companies said, after U.S. regulators ordered urgent inspections. Southwest said it had taken two planes out of service, while Gol had grounded 11. Both airlines are major operators of the 737, including the NG variant and the more recent MAX, which has been grounded for months after two deadly crashes.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last week told aircraft operators to inspect 165 older 737 NG planes for structural cracks within seven days, after cracking was found on a small number of planes. Nearly all the 165 jets were Southwest aircraft, officials said.  First delivered in 1997, the NG is the third generation of the 737, preceding the grounded MAX, which is unaffected by the cracking issues. Southwest, which did not find any issues in the “vast majority” of planes, said it “removed the two aircraft from our operation and reported the findings to Boeing and the FAA.”  Gol, which runs a fleet of 115 737s excluding its grounded MAX jets, said it took 11 out of service after finding “evidence of the need to replace a specific component.” The fleet change will affect 3% of passengers until Dec. 15, it said. The inspections were ordered following the discovery of cracks on a part known as the “pickle fork,” which attaches the fuselage to the wing structure and manages forces. Minor aircraft cracks are not unusual, an industry source said, but are not normally expected to occur on the pickle fork until near the end of the plane’s lifespan, typically considered to be more than 90,000 takeoff and landing cycles. The FAA mandated checks for “cracking of the left and right hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps,” warning the issue “could adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane” and result in loss of control. More planes will eventually be inspected, it said. The initial inspection order covered a total of 1,911 U.S.-registered planes. The checks can be done visually and take about an hour per airplane. Aircraft that have carried out more than 30,000 flight legs, or cycles, must be checked within seven days, the safety regulator said, while those with 22,600-29,999 cycles must be checked before completing a further 1,000. Boeing has been in touch with 737 NG operators about the inspections, the manufacturer said earlier, emphasizing that “no in-service issues have been reported.” United Airlines and American Airlines Inc are among other U.S. carriers flying the 737 NG, which includes the 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER variants. Each airline has about 80 planes that will need inspection in coming months, United and American said, but none that fall into the seven-day requirement for more urgent checks. European budget carrier Ryanair, which has a fleet of more than 450 737-800s, confirmed it was in the process of carrying out the inspections, without saying how many planes required them. “We are midway through the first part of this mandatory check program and don’t expect it will have any impact upon our fleet or operations,” a Ryanair spokeswoman said. Transavia Airlines, a low-cost carrier owned by Air France-KLM, said it would examine all 42 of its 737s even though only 16 need checks under the FAA mandate - of which one was inspected under the seven-day requirement. KLM, which also operates 737 NGs, has inspected all but one of 13 aircraft covered by the order and found no anomalies, a spokesman said.

1079,"WASHINGTON   - Democratic White House hopefuls should ensure their Medicare for All proposals honor union-negotiated private insurance, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, head of the largest federation of U.S. labor unions, said on Thursday. How to best extend health coverage to millions of uninsured or under-insured Americans has been one of the early issues defining the Democratic nominating contest to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November 2020. The issue is increasingly cropping up on the campaign trail as the 20 candidates still vying to become the Democratic nominee compete for support from unionized workers and official endorsements that can lead to critical on-the-ground resources. “There’s no question that ultimately we need to establish a single-payer system, but there has to be a role for those hard, hard-fought-for, high-quality plans that we’ve negotiated,” Trumka told reporters at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.  “You can’t ask the American worker, who sacrificed wages and everything, to simply say: ‘Okay, I’ll accept this plan here,’” Trumka added, noting that some union plans likely provide more benefits than Medicare. Progressive U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have favored a Medicare for All approach that would extend the existing, government-run Medicare health insurance program to all Americans, largely eliminating a role for private insurance. Medicare currently serves Americans aged 65 and older. Moderate candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Michael Bennet prefer taking a more incremental approach that would create a so-called “public option” allowing people to enroll in a government healthcare plan that would exist alongside private insurance. Still others, including U.S. Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, have modified their healthcare proposals, after backing Sanders’ Medicare for All bill in the Senate, to preserve some role for private insurance, even if for a limited time. Candidates have invoked union-negotiated health insurance as one reason why a public option is preferable to the Medicare for All proposals offered by their rivals. “If you have a generous union-backed plan and you have given up union wages to get that plan, you can keep it,” Biden said last week at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Most national unions, including the AFL-CIO, which is a federation of more than 50 unions that collectively represent more than 12 million workers, have yet to back a candidate.  Sanders won his first national endorsement this week from the 35,000-member United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. Biden in April secured an endorsement from the International Association of Firefighters, which has more than 300,000 members. Sanders, after speaking to the Iowa Federation of Labor last week, updated his campaign website to show that his Medicare for All legislation would allow unions to renegotiate their contracts in a government-overseen process and seek plans for additional services not covered by Medicare. His “Workplace Democracy” proposal now states that there will be a “fair transition to Medicare for All” that will “require that resulting healthcare savings from union-negotiated plans result in wage increases and additional benefits for workers during the transition.” Trumka called it a “positive sign” that candidates seem to be listening to union workers and are integrating their feedback into policy proposals. “It’s going to generate huge savings for employers,” Trumka said of transitioning to a single-payer system. “The question will be: What happens to the savings?” “What we’re saying is our plans, we’ve negotiated hard ... there has to be a way for us to recoup that.” ",Democrats' Medicare for All must consider union-won plans: AFL-CIO,"August 29, 2019 /  4:51 PM ",washington democratic white house hopefuls should ensure their medicare for all proposals honor union negotiated private insurance afl cio president richard trumka head of the largest federation of u s labor unions said on thursday how to best extend health coverage to millions of uninsured or under insured americans has been one of the early issues defining the democratic nominating contest to take on republican president donald trump in november  the issue is increasingly cropping up on the campaign trail as the  candidates still vying to become the democratic nominee compete for support from unionized workers and official endorsements that can lead to critical on the ground resources there s no question that ultimately we need to establish a single payer system but there has to be a role for those hard hard fought for high quality plans that we ve negotiated trumka told reporters at an event hosted by the christian science monitor you can t ask the american worker who sacrificed wages and everything to simply say okay i ll accept this plan here trumka added noting that some union plans likely provide more benefits than medicare progressive u s senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have favored a medicare for all approach that would extend the existing government run medicare health insurance program to all americans largely eliminating a role for private insurance medicare currently serves americans aged  and older moderate candidates such as former vice president joe biden and u s senator michael bennet prefer taking a more incremental approach that would create a so called public option allowing people to enroll in a government healthcare plan that would exist alongside private insurance still others including u s senators kamala harris and cory booker have modified their healthcare proposals after backing sanders medicare for all bill in the senate to preserve some role for private insurance even if for a limited time candidates have invoked union negotiated health insurance as one reason why a public option is preferable to the medicare for all proposals offered by their rivals if you have a generous union backed plan and you have given up union wages to get that plan you can keep it biden said last week at dartmouth college in hanover new hampshire most national unions including the afl cio which is a federation of more than  unions that collectively represent more than  million workers have yet to back a candidate sanders won his first national endorsement this week from the   member united electrical radio and machine workers of america biden in april secured an endorsement from the international association of firefighters which has more than   members sanders after speaking to the iowa federation of labor last week updated his campaign website to show that his medicare for all legislation would allow unions to renegotiate their contracts in a government overseen process and seek plans for additional services not covered by medicare his workplace democracy proposal now states that there will be a fair transition to medicare for all that will require that resulting healthcare savings from union negotiated plans result in wage increases and additional benefits for workers during the transition trumka called it a positive sign that candidates seem to be listening to union workers and are integrating their feedback into policy proposals it s going to generate huge savings for employers trumka said of transitioning to a single payer system the question will be what happens to the savings what we re saying is our plans we ve negotiated hard there has to be a way for us to recoup that ,Boeing Crisis,0.22388775646686554

The European Commission said the deal would remove world No. 3 player Embraer from the commercial aircraft industry while potential rivals from China, Japan and Russia would be unable to fill the gap in the next decade because of the high barriers to entry. The EU competition enforcer said both companies engage in head-to-head competition in terms of price and other parameters worldwide and in Europe. The deal would also remove Embraer from the overall single aisle plane market. The Commission set a Feb. 20 deadline for its decision.

1147,"  - The world’s two largest economies, China and the United States, on Friday exchanged blows in the latest escalation in their trade war that has roiled supply chains and whipsawed financial markets. China said it would slap retaliatory tariffs on about $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, while President Donald Trump announced a 5 percentage-point hike in tariffs already in place and others set to take effect next month. Trump also demanded that U.S. companies take steps to exit China, throwing a new twist into a bitter trade war now in its second year, although Trump cannot legally compel U.S. companies to abandon China immediately.  Beijing’s planned tariffs will add as much as 10% on top of existing rates after Trump said he would impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese products. Washington has long pressed Beijing for wide-ranging economic reforms, including better protection for American intellectual property, ending subsidies that favor Chinese state-owned enterprises, and improving access to China’s markets for U.S. companies.The United States has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports. Trump has said bad trade deals with China and others have cost millions of American jobs.  Below are some of the costs of Trump’s push to rewrite the terms of global trade with China and other top trade partners: Fitch Ratings has estimated that extending tariffs to cover another $300 billion in Chinese goods would chop 0.4% from world economic output. The International Monetary Fund said last month that global trade in the first quarter of 2019 was the slowest since 2012, noting big downside risks for world growth if more tariffs are imposed. Trump has said China pays the tariffs he has imposed on Chinese goods, but tariffs are paid by U.S.-registered firms  when the products enter the United States. Importers often pass the cost onto consumers via higher prices American farmers have been among the hardest hit so far. China is the top market for many of their biggest crops and has hit them with retaliatory tariffs, aiming at U.S. farmers because they helped vote Trump into power. The trade war has hurt sales of many agricultural products, including fruit, meat and grains. Soybeans are the single biggest U.S. agricultural export, most of which went to China before the trade war. U.S. soybean exports to China were at their lowest level since 2002 in the January-June period, according to U.S. government data. Pork exports are at a nine-year low, and shipments of U.S. sorghum are down 96% from a 2015 peak.  Corn and soybean futures prices tumbled in response to Beijing’s announcement.  To compensate for lost sales to China, the U.S. government has offered $28 billion in aid to U.S. farmers, of which about $8.6 billion had been doled out as of the end of June. U.S. crude was also on the list of new Chinese tariffs, causing oil prices to drop on Friday. U.S. crude fell 3.47% to $53.40 per barrel and Brent was last at $58.56, down 2.27%.  Tech companies were the among the hardest hit on Friday, with tech stocks on the S&P 500 index closing down 3.2% close. The tariff-sensitive Philadelphia chip index .SOX slid 4.4%. Shares of chip manufacturer Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) lost 5.3% and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) fell 4.6%.  Tariffs are costing the U.S. tech sector $1.3 billion a month, the Consumer Technology Association said in a statement to the United States trade representative in June. The U.S. plan for more tariffs would raise the retail price of cellphones by an average of $70, laptop computers by $120 and video game consoles by $56, the association has said. Apple’s AirPod, Apple Watch and HomePod, which have helped the company offset waning sales of its bestselling iPhone this year, will face a 15% levy on Sept 1. MacBooks and iPhones will face 15% tariffs on Dec. 15. The company said in June that the new round of U.S. tariffs would reduce its contributions to the U.S. economy and hurt its global competitiveness. U.S. retailers say consumers will be hit especially hard by the tariffs due to take effect in two stages, on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15. The American Apparel & Footwear Association estimates that 77% of U.S. imports of apparel, footwear and home textiles from China - or about $39 billion worth of goods - will be hit when the new 15% tariffs kick in on Sept. 1. The tariffs already imposed on China are estimated to cost the average American household $600 per year, according to a report by JPMorgan Chase. That will rise to $1,000 if the tariffs on another $300 billion of U.S. imports take place, the bank added. Carmakers would be risking significant sales if they abandoned China.  General Motors Co (GM.N) last year sold more than 3.64 million vehicles in China, accounting for more than 43 percent of unit sales globally. Ford Motor Co (F.N) last year reported revenue in Asia Pacific of $12.4 billion. Ford does not break out China revenue, but the country accounted for the majority of its sales in that region. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs have added billions of dollars to the cost of assembling U.S. vehicles, and tariffs on Chinese-made parts have also hiked costs.  Motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson (HOG.N) was hit by retaliatory tariffs from the European Union for the metals tariffs. The company calculates spending $100 million on tariff costs in 2019. Motor home maker Winnebago Industries Inc (WGO.N) said it expected at least $10 million in added cost pressures in fiscal 2020 from the latest tariffs and proposed duties. Equipment manufacturer Deere & Co (DE.N) last week trimmed its full-year earnings forecast for the second time in three months, citing the U.S.-China trade war and bad weather, and said it will cut production at its facilities in Illinois and Iowa in the second half of 2019. Deere and rival Case New Holland CNHCN.UL have passed on higher costs from metals tariffs to customers, further lifting farm costs.  Steel and aluminum tariffs were among the first to be levied by the United States in early 2018 and included imports from almost the entire world. The move benefited U.S. steel producers, but not the manufacturers that process the metal. The tariff burden on U.S. steel and aluminum buyers was almost $5 billion last year, according to the American Action Forum.

1155,"LONDON   - British department stores group John Lewis has told shopping centers landlords it will withhold 20% of this quarter’s service charge as it seeks to cut costs, it said on Friday. The move, first reported by the BBC, highlights the pressure UK retailers are under in the face of subdued consumer spending, the structural shift to online shopping and with Brexit looming. John Lewis is part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership, which said on Tuesday it was seeking to save 100 million pounds ($123 million) through a major management restructuring. Service charges are the fees retailers pay, in addition to rent, for services such as heating, cleaning, maintenance and security. John Lewis said these charges had risen regularly and landlords had not cooperated in trying to reduce costs.  A spokeswoman for the chain said it was withholding 20% at around 20 covered shopping centers. It has 50 UK department stores in total.     “At a time when we are doing everything we can to reduce our cost base, we have unfortunately been faced with regular increases to the service charges we pay for some of our shops in shopping centers,” John Lewis said. Over the last three years it has seen an increase in service charges of 20%. “These continued increases are simply not acceptable particularly in the absence of strenuous efforts by landlords to work collaboratively with us to reduce these costs,” it said. “We are investing more in our current shop estate than ever before to do everything we can to encourage customers and grow footfall and we hope that our landlords will support us in continuing to do this.” Asked if the move could leave John Lewis open to legal action from landlords, the spokeswoman said: “We are looking to work with our suppliers, so those conversations have started.” Hammerson (HMSO.L) and Intu Properties (INTUP.L) are among John Lewis’ biggest landlords. Last month, John Lewis reported a 61.8 million pounds loss for the six months to July 27. Its sales are down 2.1% over the 35 weeks to Sept. 28. Britain’s department store sector has been under intense pressure from weak demand and rising costs for several years. BHS went bust in 2016, House of Fraser was bought out of administration last year by Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct (SPD.L) and Debenhams went into administration in April and is now owned by its lenders. Debenhams secured major rent reductions in May when creditors approved a restructuring.

1365,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering unveiling, as early as September, his healthcare plan as part of his presidential re-election campaign strategy, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. The plan would lay out an alternative to former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which has been challenged by Republicans in court, and could include coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and a variety of insurance options, the Wall Street Journal said, citing unnamed sources.  Trump has not signed off on the tentative plan, the newspaper said, describing ongoing debate about the plan and the timing for the roll-out. Polling shows that healthcare is a top concern for voters leading up to the election. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the timing. Democrats vying to be their party’s candidate for the November 2020 presidential election have focused on healthcare, debating how far to go to transform the U.S. healthcare system. Some candidates have suggested abolishing private insurance in favor of a single government-run plan, sometimes referred to as “Medicare for All,” while others favor more modest reforms. On Tuesday, Trump is slated to give a speech at The Villages in Florida - a large retirement community - where he will address his administration’s efforts to secure and improve Medicare. While he is there, Trump is expected to sign an executive order related to Medicare, a White House official said separately, declining to comment on specific details.

1420,"TORONTO   - A U.S. recommendation that consumers avoid vaping products containing the active ingredient in marijuana ahead of their legalization in Canada next month could be a blow to Canadian cannabis companies’ hopes that the higher-margin products will help propel them to profitability. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday that an investigation into 805 confirmed or probable cases of vaping-related respiratory illnesses suggested that products containing THC, the psychoactive element in cannabis, likely played a role. The heightened health concerns come at a time when Canadian cannabis companies, whose share prices have tumbled over disappointing sales and supply and quality hiccups, are investing millions of dollars into marijuana derivatives, including vape products. While keeping a wary eye on U.S. developments, they are  betting that already strict Canadian regulations will ensure the safety of their products. The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF has dropped 54% since its Oct. 16 peak, the day before adult recreational use of cannabis flower and THC and CBD oils were legalized. CBD does not contain the compound that gets people high.   The vaping concerns have contributed to recent declines, and will continue to hurt shares, said Bruce Campbell, portfolio manager at Stonecastle Investment Management, which invests in cannabis stocks.  “It’s a case of ‘shoot first, ask questions later’,” he said. “(Investors) probably do some quick back-of-the-envelope math and say, ‘we’re not going to see the sales we expected, so we’re out’.” Analysts estimate that in some established U.S. markets, vape sales are down as much as 30%, with many marijuana consumers reverting to use of less profitable flower and oil products.   While a shift away from Canada’s illicit cannabis vape market into legal dried flower is positive from a public health standpoint, prolonged uncertainty could hurt legal vape sales.   “These illnesses ... occurred using non-regulated products,” said Jason Zandberg, research analyst at investment dealer PI Financial.  Investigators have pointed to vaping products containing THC or vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent often mixed with THC oil in the illicit market, as possible causes of the rash of serious lung problems. “In theory, it should promote the legal market,” Zandberg said. “But if you don’t have very aggressive education behind these products, a good portion of the population doesn’t see the difference.” The regulations that take effect on Oct. 17 take into account the emerging health risks associated with cannabis vaping. They prohibit additives including vitamins and coloring agents, Health Canada, which regulates cannabis producers, said in an email. The health agency added that it is monitoring the situation, and will take additional action if needed. “The Canadian government should come out as soon as possible one way or other and either double down on vape products or remove them from the derivatives market. You have to give the industry clarity,” said Brett Hundley, a cannabis analyst at Seaport Global. If the government suddenly removes vape products from the roster of expanded legal cannabis offerings, including edibles and extracts, “that’s going to reverberate back through the supply chain and it’s going to lead to a whole host of near-term issues” for these companies, Hundley said. Cannabis companies are trusting that adhering to Health Canada’s rules will provide reassurance for investors and consumers.  A spokesman for Canopy Growth Corp, Canada’s biggest cannabis producer, in an email, pointed to the importance of the regulatory frameworks for cannabis vape products that Canada has in place. Hexo Corp, another Canadian company with a variety of cannabis products, said it is focused on ensuring it is compliant with Health Canada’s regulations. Hexo is double testing its vape products, James McMillan, vice president of business development, said in a phone interview.

1460,"PARIS   - Environmental activists daubed the Louvre’s glass pyramid with thick molasses on Friday in protest at what they said were the environmentally-damaging activities of museum sponsor Total (TOTF.PA), a multinational oil and gas company.  Clad in black, the activists belonging to “Liberons le Louvre” (Let’s Free the Louvre) plastered dirty hand-prints over the museum’s famed 70-foot-high glass-and-steel pyramid, a much-loved Paris landmark, as tourists gazed on. Total has been a Louvre sponsor in past years, the museum said on its website, including support for renovations to the Apollo Gallery and the creation of an Islamic arts department.  They dipped their hands into bags of molasses - a black treacle that results from refining sugar cane - before smearing it over the structure to denounce what they called “the dirty hands” of Total. “The handprints on the Pyramid can be cleaned away easily, whereas the environmental footprint left by Total is not as easy to clean”, said Victoire, a member of the collective. Another member, Kester Lovelse, told Reuters: “A cultural institution should not be receiving money from a multinational company that continues to endanger the climate, pollute the climate and leave such a dirty environmental footprint on the earth.” “Even if we are not the main patron of the Louvre, we are proud to supports the initiatives of this emblematic institution,” Total said in a statement to Reuters.

1494,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. cable networks CNN and MSNBC have invited Democratic presidential candidates to participate in televised town hall events in September focused on climate change after activists and some candidates pressured party officials for months to host a debate dedicated to the issue. CNN announced on Thursday it will host a “town hall” on climate change on Sept. 4 for candidates who are polling above 2% and have at least 130,000 donors - the threshold for the Democratic National Committee’s September debate criteria. Currently eight out of the two dozen Democratic hopefuls make the cut. MSNBC also announced on Thursday it will televise on Sept. 19 and 20 “Climate Forum 2020” - a two-day town hall event where all declared 2020 presidential candidates will discuss their solutions to climate change with young voters moderated by two hosts. During the two June debates, climate change got a total of 15 minutes out of four hours, giving candidates little opportunity to detail their plans to tackle the issue.  Activist group the Sunrise Movement, whose members camped out in front of DNC headquarters for three days during the first Democratic debates to demand an official DNC debate on the issue, claimed “two huge victories” on Thursday and said “our pressure is working” on Twitter. Their demands had been rebuffed by party Chairman Tom Perez, who said a specialized debate would favor certain candidates and open the floodgates for calls to host other issue-specific events. However, the DNC executive committee will vote on a resolution on Aug. 23 to host an official debate.

1842,"LORDSTOWN, Ohio   - When asked about reports General Motors Co (GM.N) may turn its shuttered Lordstown, Ohio, plant into a battery factory, “Buffalo” Joe Nero snorts and points at the vast complex that until six months ago made the Chevrolet Cruze. “You can’t support a plant like this making batteries. We need a new vehicle allocated to us,” said Nero, 62, who has worked at five plants over 42 years with the No. 1 U.S. automaker.  “It wouldn’t even cover 10% of the facility or hire 10% of the people, and they wouldn’t pay enough to support yourself, let alone a family,” he said. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which went on strike last week, agrees.   The sprawling Lordstown plant at one time employed more than 4,500 workers. GM’s decision to close it and three other U.S. facilities due to sagging U.S. passenger car sales has drawn widespread criticism, including from President Donald Trump. Ohio is a crucial swing state in the 2020 presidential election. The closure is part of the reason for the UAW strike, to demand that GM build another vehicle there. The union also wants GM to reduce the use of temporary workers and share more of its profits, a decade after the union helped the company through a government-led bankruptcy.     Visiting nearby Youngstown soon after becoming president in 2017, Trump told workers that factory jobs would not leave, advising them: “Don’t move, don’t sell your house.” Since GM’s announcement, Trump has urged the Detroit company to move vehicle production back to the United States from Mexico.  As part of contract talks with the UAW, GM has suggested the Lordstown facility could be converted to an electric vehicle (EV) battery plant. Separately, it says it is also negotiating to sell the plant to a group affiliated with EV start-up Workhorse Group Inc (WKHS.O).  A source familiar with GM’s plans said if the sale goes ahead, the automaker would then build a new battery plant near the Lordstown facility. Workhorse declined to comment. In Washington in June, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra defended the Workhorse plan. She also told Reuters that GM had no intention of building a new vehicle in Lordstown. Lordstown workers say that’s the only way there will be enough well-paid manufacturing jobs for the community. They - and the UAW - place the blame squarely on GM. “You did everything GM ever asked of you and it still wasn’t enough,” UAW Local 1112 president Tim O’Hara told 100 cheering workers during a rally outside the plant on Friday. “We’re going to hold the line as long as it takes.” The reality is that GM needs to cut back underutilized U.S. manufacturing capacity even at current levels, said Sam Fiorani, a vice president with Auto Forecast Solutions. “There’s no chance that GM is going to put a product back into that plant,” he said. “They have too much capacity as it is.” GM’s capacity utilization rate in its North American plants is about 75 percent, excluding idled assembly plants in Lordstown and Detroit, research firm LMC Automotive said. The 6.2-million-sq foot (576,000 sq meters) Lordstown complex has manufactured more than 16 million vehicles since it opened in 1966. The last Cruze rolled off the line in March. Most workers here have taken transfers to other GM plants. But around 450 workers have not, many because they did not want to uproot their families. Even if the Workhorse deal goes through, workers wonder how many people the plant would employ, whether they would still be working for GM and what kind of pay cut that would entail. UAW workers at the top of the wage scale earn about $31 an hour, compared with the $15-$17 an hour workers are paid at a GM battery plant near Detroit that operates under a side agreement. Analysts said neither a Workhorse nor a GM plant would be likely to employ even half the plant’s previous workforce. “Nothing other than vehicle production has even a hope of replacing the jobs and income and economic impact of what was previously there as an automotive assembly plant,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The UAW said in a 2018 research paper that the disruptive effect of electric vehicles and their less complex batteries compared with gasoline-powered engines meant that fewer workers were going to be needed in the future. Teresa Oakes, 44, has done the math. “If they made batteries here it would allow them to lower wages to the bare minimum,” said Oakes, who worked at the plant for 10 years. “GM should bring back vehicles they make in Mexico and have them made by U.S. workers instead.”   Most other jobs in the Lordstown area pay less, including at  warehouses like the one discount retailer TJX Companies Inc (TJX.N) is building nearby. Rick Michaels, 49, took a transfer to a plant in Lansing, Michigan, and travels 4-1/2 hours home every weekend to see his family. He was on the picket line at Lordstown all week. “If GM opened a battery factory here, that would barely employ all the people here,” Michaels said on Friday, pointing at the rally crowd. “There would be no way for me to get back home.” Doug Grant, 59, was picketing in a homemade T-shirt that read “DID YOU MAKE $21,905,256 IN 2017” on the front and “MARY BARRA DID!” on the back. Grant, who said he declined to take a transfer to another GM facility, said it could take years to get a battery plant up and running. “That’s way too long,” he said. “That puts me right out of the game.” ","At shuttered Ohio plant, workers still hope for new GM vehicle","September 23, 2019 /  10:12 AM ",lordstown ohio when asked about reports general motors co gm n may turn its shuttered

1859,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump violated the Constitution by blocking people whose views he disliked from his Twitter account, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday. In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the First Amendment forbids Trump from using Twitter’s “blocking” function to limit access to his account, which has 61.8 million followers. “The First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise-open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees,” wrote Circuit Judge Barrington Parker, citing several Supreme Court decisions. Kelly Laco, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, which argued the appeal, said: “We are disappointed with the court’s decision and are exploring possible next steps.” The White House declined to comment. White House social media director Dan Scavino was also a defendant. Twitter (TWTR.N) declined to comment. Trump has made his @RealDonaldTrump account, which he opened in 2009, a central and controversial part of his presidency, using it to promote his agenda and to attack critics. His blocking of critics was challenged by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, as well as seven Twitter users he had blocked. “The decision will help ensure the integrity and vitality of digital spaces that are increasingly important to our democracy,” said Jameel Jaffer, Knight’s executive director. Tuesday’s decision upheld a May 2018 ruling by U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan, which prompted Trump to unblock some accounts. The Justice Department had called her ruling “fundamentally misconceived,” saying Trump used Twitter to express his views, not to offer a public forum for discussion. Parker, however, said Trump’s account bears “all the trappings of an official, state-run account” and is “one of the White House’s main vehicles for conducting official business.” He said Trump and his aides have characterized the president’s tweets as official statements, and that even the National Archives considers them official records. Parker also found it ironic that Trump censored speech at a time the conduct of the U.S. government and its officials is subject to intense, passionate and wide-open debate. “This debate, as uncomfortable and as unpleasant as it frequently may be, is nonetheless a good thing,” he wrote. “We remind the litigants and the public that if the First Amendment means anything, it means that the best response to disfavored speech on matters of public concern is more speech, not less.” The case is Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University et al v Trump et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-1691.

2167,"TIKRIT, Iraq   - Iraqi and U.S. military spokesmen denied on Saturday that U.S. forces were preparing to evacuate hundreds of staff of Lockheed Martin Corp and Sallyport Global from an Iraqi military base where they work as contractors. Four separate military sources, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said on Friday the contractors from the two firms had been preparing to leave Balad military base, which hosts U.S. forces some 80 km (50 miles) north of Baghdad, over “potential security threats”, without saying what those threats might be. One of the military sources and a fifth security source later said the evacuation had been called off early on Saturday after U.S. and Iraqi military personnel assured the companies that safety measures would be stepped up around the base. Three mortar shells landed on Balad last week, the first of several unclaimed attacks in recent days targeting bases in Iraq hosting U.S. forces and a site used by a U.S. energy firm. Iraqi and U.S. military spokesmen denied there were any plans for an evacuation in the first place, which the sources disclosed at a time of rising regional tensions between the United States and Iraq’s eastern neighbor Iran. “There are no plans at this time to evacuate any personnel from Balad ... Should there be increased threats to our people, the U.S. Air Force will put measures in place to provide the protections required”, Air Force Colonel Kevin Walker said in a statement.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement: “The United States is not evacuating personnel from Balad Air Base.” Iraq’s military spokesman said Iraq “protects the safety of our fighters and American advisers and trainers”. A security source familiar with one of the company’s operations said its management informed staff supervisors early on Saturday that the evacuation plan for both companies, which was being prepared until Friday, had been halted. The companies had received assurances from U.S. military personnel at the base that they would step up security at Balad as well as around the base, including aerial surveillance, to ensure the safety of their contractors, the source said. One of the military sources at Balad said Iraqi commanders had also assured U.S. military officials they would ensure the safety of foreign staff at the base in case of future attacks. U.S. forces would be allowed to help secure the outside perimeter of the base, a task normally only assigned to Iraqi forces, as part of efforts to step up safety measures for contractors, the source said. The U.S. coalition in Iraq declined to comment on the additional security measures.  A spokeswoman for Lockheed in the Middle East said: “We are not evacuating Lockheed Martin employees right now from Balad Air Base.” She did not say whether any other evacuation was being prepared. Lockheed and Sallyport did not immediately respond to requests for further comment later on Saturday. The mortar attack on Balad last week caused no casualties, the military said. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.  That incident was followed by attacks on two other military installations hosting U.S. forces, near Baghdad and in the northern city of Mosul. U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil evacuated at least 21 foreign staff from a site near the southern city of Basra on Wednesday after a rocket also hit that facility, an Iraqi security source said. One of the military sources, an official with knowledge of Balad base’s daily operations said on Friday that the U.S. military informed Iraqi officials they would begin evacuating about half of the 800 employees who work for both companies. The sources said the evacuation could start at any moment. “Americans informed us that they will only keep limited, necessary staff who work closely on the maintenance of Iraqi  F-16 war planes,” one of the Iraqi sources said. Lockheed Martin began delivering the first F-16s to Iraq in 2014. Local officials blamed Iran-backed Shi’ite militias for the Basra incident. Iran has not commented on the incidents in Iraq, but has strongly rejected accusations by Washington that it was behind several attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf in recent weeks. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad evacuated hundreds of staff last month after Washington cited unspecified threats from Iran to U.S. interests in the region. ExxonMobil evacuated its own staff last month, and had begun returning them to Iraq before the Basra attack. Washington has ramped up sanctions pressure on Tehran since last year and several violent incidents in the Gulf have been blamed on the rising tensions. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had called off a U.S. strike on Iran at the last minute. In Iraq, Tehran backs several Shi’ite Muslim militias which have positions close to U.S. military installations. Representatives of those militias have not publicly commented on the recent incidents.

without saying what those threats might be one of the military sources and a fifth security source later said the evacuation had been called off early on saturday after u s and iraqi military personnel assured the companies that safety measures would be stepped up around the base three mortar shells landed on balad last week the first of several unclaimed attacks in recent days targeting bases in iraq hosting u s forces and a site used by a u s energy firm iraqi and u s military spokesmen denied there were any plans for an evacuation in the first place which the sources disclosed at a

2241,"NEW YORK   - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP filed for bankruptcy protection Sunday night, succumbing to pressure from more than 2,600 lawsuits alleging the company helped fuel the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic. Purdue’s board met Sunday evening to approve the long-expected bankruptcy filing, which the company is pursuing to restructure under terms of a proposal to settle the widespread litigation.  Purdue, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in a federal bankruptcy court in White Plains, New York, reached a tentative deal to resolve lawsuits with 24 states and five U.S. territories, as well as lead lawyers for more than 2,000 cities, counties and other plaintiffs, the company said. Two dozen states remain opposed or uncommitted to the proposed settlement, setting the stage for contentious legal battles over who bears responsibility for a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest U.S. data. Thousands of cities and counties, along with nearly every state, have sued Purdue and, in some cases, its controlling Sackler family. The lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars in damages, claim the company and family aggressively marketed prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their addiction and overdose risks.  Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations.      Opposing states, including Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut, want the Sacklers to guarantee more of their own money will go toward a settlement, and have questioned Purdue’s calculations valuing the overall deal at more than $10 billion. The Sacklers, who would cede control of Purdue in the proposed settlement, have offered $3 billion in cash and an additional $1.5 billion or more through the eventual sale of another company they own, called Mundipharma, according to the company and people familiar with the terms. The Sacklers have declined to revise their offer. “This is the fork in the road. There are only two ways to go from here,” said Purdue Chairman Steve Miller in an interview with Reuters. Miller said Purdue plans to argue to opposing states that fighting the proposed settlement will likely result in protracted litigation, increasing legal fees and depleting value that could be steered to U.S. communities reeling from opioid abuse. He described bankruptcy proceedings as the “best hope for finalizing and implementing a global resolution to this litigation.”  In a statement, members of the Sackler family controlling Purdue said they hoped those opposing the current settlement offer would eventually change their minds.  “It is our hope the bankruptcy reorganization process that is now underway will end our ownership of Purdue and ensure its assets are dedicated for the public benefit,” the family said.  The outcome of Purdue’s attempted bankruptcy reorganization and settlement negotiations will help determine how much money U.S. communities receive from the company and the Sacklers to address harm from opioids. A reorganization and settlement would ultimately need to be approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge.   States suing the Sacklers, including several over the past week, allege the family improperly reaped billions of dollars from opioid sales despite knowledge of their harmful effects. The Sacklers, some of whom previously served on the Purdue’s board and are well-known wealthy philanthropists, have denied the allegations.  Purdue’s proposed settlement envisions it becoming a trust that would contribute to U.S. communities, at little or no cost, tens of millions of doses of drugs the company developed to combat opioid overdoses and addiction, the company said. Purdue values the drugs at $4.45 billion over a decade, the people familiar with the matter said. Under the proposal’s terms, the restructured Purdue would be permanently bound by so-called injunctive relief, which includes restrictions on the promotion and sale of opioids.      States opposing the settlement offer have vowed to fight attempts by Purdue and the Sacklers to use bankruptcy proceedings to contain the litigation. On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said she uncovered roughly $1 billion in wire transfers “between the Sacklers, entities they control and different financial institutions, including those that have funneled funds into Swiss bank accounts.” The information, in records an unnamed financial institution produced in response to a subpoena from James’s office, detailed financial transfers involving former Purdue board member Mortimer D.A. Sackler, according to court documents her office filed.  He allegedly used shell companies “to shift Purdue money through accounts around the world and then conceal it in at least two separate multimillion-dollar real estate investments back here in New York, sanitized (until now) of any readily-detectable connections to the Sackler family,” a lawyer in James’ office said in one of the court filings. “There is nothing newsworthy about these decade-old transfers, which were perfectly legal and appropriate in every respect,” a spokesman for Mortimer D.A. Sackler said in a statement.  “This is a cynical attempt by a hostile AG’s office to generate defamatory headlines to try to torpedo a mutually beneficial settlement that is supported by so many other states and would result in billions of dollars going to communities and individuals across the country that need help,” the statement added.  Purdue, meanwhile, plans to ask a bankruptcy judge to halt active litigation so it can negotiate a final settlement, the people said. But the company is preparing for states to argue their lawsuits cannot be halted by a Chapter 11 filing because their legal actions were brought to enforce public health and safety laws - exempting them from the usual bankruptcy rules that would stop their complaints. Another thorny legal question involves the Sacklers and under what circumstances Purdue could use bankruptcy law in an attempt to also halt lawsuits against them.  Those legal skirmishes could take some time to develop, as Purdue initially must seek court approval to continue paying employees and address routine operating expenses.

2449,"LONDON   - German bond yields and the euro rebounded on Thursday and European banking shares were whipsawed as doubts crept in about the effectiveness of the ECB’s decision to cut interest rates and pledge an indefinite supply of asset purchases. The ECB cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to a record low of -0.5%, promised that rates would stay low for longer and said it would restart bond purchases at a rate of 20 billion euros a month from Nov. 1. It also eased the terms of its long-term loan facility to banks and said it would introduce a multi-tier deposit rate facility to help them.  The package of measures initially cheered investors whose expectations for aggressive easing had recently been dented by some ECB policymakers’ comments. Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell to a record low at 0.76%, pushing the gap over German peers to 136 basis points — its tightest since May 2018 while German long-dated bonds saw yields tumble as much as 11 basis points on the day. But over the course of Mario Draghi’s press conference, German borrowing costs crept higher while the euro rose off  lows By 1430 GMT, the 10-year Bund yield was marginally higher on the day at -0.56% — having fallen as much 8 bps. Two-year yields were up 8 bps at -0.74%. “It was a big package but in the press conference, there was a bit of realization that monetary policy is running into limitations,” said Rainer Guntermann, a rates strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt “Draghi stressed the need for fiscal spending, maybe that has taken the market down a bit.” The euro rebounded sharply from its earlier losses and was last up 0.4% at $1.1051, having earlier traded as low as $1.0927 - within a whisker of a 28-month low of $1.0926 touched earlier this month.  Analysts said the euro’s rise came after Draghi told reporters there had been no discussion about raising bond issuer limits within the asset purchase program. That introduced doubts over how long the QE program could last, while his repeated calls for fiscal stimulus also supported the single currency, they said. “The price action confirms that the markets worry that the ECB is certainly running out of options,” said Valentin Marinov, Head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole.  “The announced easing package looks like another compromise between the doves and hawks at the Governing Council. There might be some upside risks for the euro from here.” (Graphic: Italy yields fall sharply, here) Reports of a interim U.S./China agreement to delay trade tariffs also boosted stock markets and dented safe-haven bonds, making it difficult to read the market signals on the ECB’s policy decisions. Euro zone stocks had a volatile session. After a brief jump following the ECB announcement, the market then fell into the red, only to recover some ground to trade 0.3% higher.. Investors trained their sights on euro zone bank shares, given the negative impact of sub-zero interest rates on lenders’ profits. An index of bank shares first jumped 1.6%, then fell back by a similar amount before clawing back those losses. “Today’s release in our view has some marginal positives but is far from a panacea for banks’ profitability,” Morgan Stanley analysts told clients.  However, an index used by investors to gauge credit risk on European financial debt including bank bonds — the iTraxx Europe Senior Financials index —  dropped as much as 7 bps on the day, according to Tradeweb data. The prospect of QE and the measures to help banks also bolstered sentiment on peripheral markets, especially Italy and Spain where 10-year borrowing costs slipped 5-10 bps. (Graphic: Bank shares roller coaster, here) One positive for the ECB was the uptick in inflation expectations following its policy announcement. A key market gauge of long-term inflation expectations shot up to 1.32%, their highest level since late-July, as the ECB’s policy action boosted confidence in the central bank’s ability to lift inflation. It had been at 1.26% earlier in the day. “The main point to take away is that QE is here to stay and the ECB has joined the Bank of Japan in having an open-ended program,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. “Effectively Mr Draghi has sent a signal: ‘as long as it takes’”.

2707,"DUBUQUE, Iowa   - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg asked a crowd of supporters packed into an Iowa brewery this weekend whether the United States has a plan to win the ongoing trade war with China. “Nooo,” was the response.	 The world’s two largest economies have been locked in a 10-month trade war that has roiled global supply chains and rattled financial markets. U.S. farmers, who helped carry Trump to his surprise 2016 election win, have been among the hardest-hit as China has imposed tariffs on imports of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans, pork and grain sorghum in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Now, increasing frustrations over the prolonged dispute are prompting some rural residents in Iowa, home of the first presidential nominating contest in February, to consider candidates other than President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Their desire for alternatives highlights the deep financial pain the trade war is causing in the agriculture sector, a backbone of Iowa’s economy. Farm incomes have also suffered from years of overproduction and low commodity prices. The United States and China appeared on track for an agreement before relations soured this month, pushing U.S. soybean futures to their lowest in more than a decade.    Virgil Murray of Bellevue, Iowa, a city of about 2,000 people, voted for Trump and considers himself a Republican. But the 72-year-old retired school superintendent attended the rally for Buttigieg in Dubuque on Saturday with his wife, a Democrat. Murray said he is open to voting for a Democratic candidate. “A lot of the farmers voted for Trump. Now they’re feeling it,” said Murray, who lives near the Mississippi River, a key pipeline for moving grain from Midwestern farms to export terminals along the Gulf Coast Trump has pledged to help farmers with direct payments and says the China trade war will benefit them in the long run. Other Democratic candidates, including Joe Biden, who leads primary polls, have also criticized Trump’s trade policies. Rival John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado, called Trump’s trade policy “reckless” at an event in Chicago on Monday, calling the trade war “a tax on the American people.”  Farmers worry that a deal to end the trade dispute will take much longer than expected after Trump on May 9 increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. China quickly raised tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods in response. “We were optimistic. That blew up,” Ken Ries, a farmer who raises soybeans, corn and hogs, said in an interview at his home in Ryan, Iowa. Ries, 69, voted for Trump in 2016 and said he will not vote for a Democrat in 2020 but would consider a candidate other than Trump if there is a Republican primary. “The soybean farmer is sucking air,” Ries said. Some farmers are wary of Democrats who have expressed opposition to “Big Ag” and support for the Green New Deal, a proposal that aims to cut carbon emissions in agriculture and other parts of the economy, said Kirk Leeds, chief executive of the Iowa Soybean Association. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, another Democratic presidential contender, has advocated breaking up large agribusinesses that dominate dealings in the meat and grain sectors. “I think you’re going to see the support for the president stay pretty solid, based on no clear alternative,” Leeds said. But some farmers who are unhappy with Trump and dislike Democrats could not vote at all during the next election, Leeds said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is preparing a second package of aid worth up to $20 billion for farmers hurt by the trade war. The agency in 2018 pledged up to $12 billion, most of it in direct payments to farmers to help offset their crop losses. It has allocated about $9.4 billion of that so far. Charmayne McMurray, who raised crops and livestock for more than a quarter century in Andrew, Iowa, said the payouts will not stop farmers from considering Democratic candidates. “Farmers, they want to work. They don’t want a handout,” said McMurray, a 73-year-old undecided Democrat who now lives in Dubuque and was among about 550 people at Buttigieg’s rally. Dubuque County flipped from supporting Democrat Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016.  Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said Trump launched the trade war without a strategy of how to win it. The dispute is just one problem that could prompt farmers to consider Democratic candidates in 2020, he said. Other threats include consolidation among commodity buyers and changes in climate that are making it more difficult to produce crops, Buttigieg told reporters. “I’ve certainly talked to a lot of farmers who are getting killed and in a lot of different ways,” he said. “All of these things I think are a good moment for Democrats to remind rural America why we have a better message for them than the current president, who I think has been taking them for granted.” ",Rural Iowans ponder Trump alternatives as China trade war drags on,"May 20, 2019 /  2:42 PM ",dubuque iowa democratic u s

2929,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump defended himself on Wednesday following a media report that said his businesses had lost more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994, saying he had leeway with his taxes as a real estate developer. The report, published in the New York Times on Tuesday, detailed how his core businesses of casinos, hotels and apartment buildings had lost $1.17 billion over a decade, allowing him to avoid paying income taxes for eight of those 10 years. Trump said he was allowed massive tax write-offs for depreciation and many “non monetary” losses, adding the report contained “very old information.” “You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes ... almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport,” Trump said in a post on Twitter on Wednesday. Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives have requested Trump’s tax returns as part of investigations into the president and possible conflicts of interest. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this week refused a request for those documents, setting up a likely legal fight. Though U.S. presidential candidates have traditionally released their tax returns during election campaigns, Trump has refused to do so. He also continues to own his businesses, though he has said his sons run the day-to-day operations. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday tweeted that the report underscored the need for lawmakers to review Trump’s taxes, as allowed by law. Separately, she told the Washington Post in an interview it would be up to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to decide the next steps over the tax return issue.  “He has a path,” Pelosi said, adding there were several options to move forward, including going to court.     Officials in New York state are also taking steps to seek the president’s tax returns, the New York Times has reported. Trump has repeatedly said he could not release his tax documents because he is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  His former lawyer Michael Cohen, however, told a House panel in February that rather than an audit being underway, Trump feared releasing the tax information could lead to an audit and penalties.      Trump has previously warned that he considered any probe of his personal or business finances off limits, telling the Times in a July 2017 interview that any such scrutiny would be crossing a “red line.” ","Trump blasts report on his business losses, calls accounting a 'sport'","May 8, 2019 /  12:34 PM ",washington u s president donald trump defended himself on wednesday following a media report that said his businesses had lost more than  billion from  to  saying he had leeway with his taxes as a real estate developer the report published in the new york times on tuesday detailed how his core businesses of casinos hotels and apartment buildings had lost   billion over a decade allowing him to avoid paying income taxes for eight of those  years trump said he was allowed massive tax write offs for depreciation and many non monetary losses adding the report contained very old information you always wanted to show losses for tax purposes almost all real estate developers did and often re negotiate with banks it was sport trump said in a post on twitter on wednesday democrats in the u s house of representatives have requested trump s tax returns as part of investigations into the president and possible conflicts of interest treasury secretary steven mnuchin this week refused a request for those documents setting up a likely legal fight though u s presidential candidates have traditionally released their tax returns during election campaigns trump has refused to do so he also continues to own his businesses though he has said his sons run the day to day operations house speaker nancy pelosi on wednesday tweeted that the report underscored the need for lawmakers to review trump s taxes as allowed by law separately she told the washington post in an interview it would be up to house ways and means committee chairman richard neal to decide the next steps over the tax return issue he has a path pelosi said adding there were several options to move forward including going to court officials in new york state are also taking steps to seek the president s tax returns the new york times has reported trump has repeatedly said he could not release his tax documents because he is under audit by the internal revenue service irs his former lawyer michael cohen however told a house panel in february that rather than an audit being underway trump feared releasing the tax information could lead to an audit and penalties trump has previously warned that he considered any probe of his personal or business finances off limits telling the times in a july  interview that any such scrutiny would be crossing a red line ,Boeing Crisis,0.16028434038162231
2967,"  - Civil rights groups in Tennessee have asked a federal court to block enforcement of a new state law that threatens to impose new penalties on voter-registration groups if they file too many incomplete forms. The state’s Republican Governor, Mike Lee, signed the bill passed by the Republican-dominated legislature on Thursday, saying it would help ensure the integrity of elections. The law imposes fines on groups that file more than 100 incomplete voter registration forms and threatens paid workers who file more than 100 forms without state training with up to a year in jail. U.S. politicians, particularly Republicans, have long cited concerns about fraud to justify laws restricting access to polls. But independent researchers have documented only a handful of cases over the years, and many Democrats and civil rights groups say the restrictions disproportionately affect poorer voters and members of minority groups. The Tennessee Conference of the NAACP and the three other civil rights group sued the state in U.S. District Court in Nashville, calling the law an effort at voter suppression and asking a judge to stop its enforcement. They said it will hurt their work enrolling African-Americans and members of other minority groups, many of whom tend to vote for Democrats, in a state that already has one of the lowest election turnout rates in the nation. The Tennessee lawsuit says the law’s wording is so vague it is not clear whether registering a voter named James under his nickname Jim would be penalized. “This is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to discourage and deter people from helping others to register to vote,” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the group that helped filed the lawsuit, said in a statement. The law exempts unpaid volunteers from the requirements, but the groups behind the lawsuit say it is unclear whether their use of paid staff to oversee volunteers will make them subject to the penalties. Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, a Republican, did not respond to a request for comment. His office has previously said that thousands of incomplete forms have created difficulties for election officials. The voter registration issue came to the fore again around last year’s elections for the U.S. Congress, and many of the Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls have made attacks on voting restrictions part of their campaigns. A North Carolina Republican political operative was  arrested in February and charged with running an absentee ballot fraud scheme that led the state to order the rerun of a congressional election.

2981,"WASHINGTON   - Joe Biden’s rapid emergence as front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination has caught the attention of President Donald Trump and unnerved some of his allies, who believe Biden is a potentially dangerous rival. Biden soared from “will-he-or-won’t-he-run?” status to the head of the crowded Democratic field just days after announcing his candidacy last week, pulling away from Senator Bernie Sanders and a host of other rivals in opinion polls. A CNN poll gave Biden a 15-point lead in a field of 20 Democratic candidates. Some Trump advisers see the former vice president, with his mainstream blue-collar appeal, as a tough opponent in the three  states that carried Trump to his improbable victory in 2016 - Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Losing any of those states in 2020 would make Trump’s path to re-election more problematic. “They think they’re in trouble there and they think he’s a real threat,” said one outside Trump adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump’s initial response to Biden’s entry into the race was to use a well-worn playbook - give him a mocking nickname - “Sleepy Joe Biden” - and insult his intelligence. “I have known Joe over the years,” Trump said on Fox News.  “He is not the brightest light bulb in the group, I don’t think, but he has a name that they know.” Trump later went on a Twitter tirade after the largest U.S. firefighters union endorsed Biden, including posting dozens of retweets on Wednesday from purported firefighters and their friends and families professing support for the Republican president or criticizing Biden. Despite his focus on Biden, some of Trump’s friends said he did not seem particularly concerned about him, at least at this stage, given that the first votes in the nominating process will not be cast until early next year. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway played down the idea that Trump saw Biden as his biggest threat. “No, I think it’s just fun to remind everybody about him. ... Maybe he’s an easy mark, and he just announced for president of the United States,” she told reporters. Trump allies said Biden, who was vice president under Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, could still get chewed up by a large, diverse field of Democratic rivals, many leaning to the left of Biden and discussing policies such as tax hikes for wealthier Americans and government-run healthcare. As long as Democrats are moving left, said David Urban, a political consultant and Trump campaign aide in 2016, “I like our chances whoever is at the top of the ticket for the Democrats.” The Trump re-election campaign said it believed that whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee would have adopted policy stances out of tune with most Americans. “There is no centrist lane in the Democrat primary,” said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh. “We view them as one big liberal organism right now with 28 heads.” Still, there are warning signs for Trump. He won narrow victories in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania with the help of blue-collar voters who once voted Democratic but switched to Trump. Trump’s advisers said repeating his victories in those crucial states next year might be a tall order. Biden, a longtime U.S. senator from Delaware, held his first campaign rally in Pennsylvania and has quickly sought to make the campaign into a battle against Trump rather than against his rivals for the Democratic nomination. One Trump confidant said poll numbers indicated Biden stood to do well at this point at least in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and potentially in two other Trump states, Florida and North Carolina. If that were to happen, the confidant said, it would be hard for Trump to make up the losses with wins in other states in order to get to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory. “There’s not really a lot of room to expand the (electoral) map over the previous results,” the confidant said.  In a response to Biden, Trump has touted strong economic indicators in Pennsylvania, where unemployment is at a historic low. But some allies said Trump had not been disciplined about selling his record on the economy and that his lack of a healthcare overhaul plan was hurting him along with his preoccupation with migrants at the U.S. southern border.  They added that Trump had time to straighten out his message for the long slog to the November 2020 election. “We’ve got a long way to go,” said one Trump confidant.

3063,"  - Fitbit Inc (FIT.N) on Wednesday launched its latest smartwatch, Versa 2, adding Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) voice assistant Alexa, online payments and music storage in a bid to compete strongly with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) smartwatches. Shares of Fitbit rose as much as 5.6% to $3.01. Pre-orders for Versa 2, which is priced at $200, will start later in the day, the company said, adding that the smartwatch would be available in stores on Sept. 15. Fitbit has struggled to gain a foothold in the smartwatch category as Apple and Samsung (005930.KS) have cornered a bigger share of the market with more sophisticated devices, while its dominant share of the fitness tracking sector continues to be chipped away by cheaper offerings from China’s Huawei and Xiaomi (1810.HK), among others.  Fitbit last month cut its 2019 revenue forecast, blaming disappointing sales of Versa Lite smartwatches, a cheaper version that lacked features such as the ability to store music. “While Versa Lite received good present consumer reviews, we saw that consumers were willing to pay more for a smartwatch with additional features,” Chief Executive Officer James Park said on an earnings call with analysts earlier this month. The company separately launched Fitbit Premium, which will give its users personalized coaching including health reports, workouts and sleep features at a cost of $9.99 per month, beginning September. Versa 2 and Fitbit Premium are steps to upsell to its existing base of 27 million users by adding more features, according to Scott Searle from Roth Capital Partners. Searle added that Fitbit Premium provides sleep guidance and insights enabled by 10.5 billion nights of sleep data gathered from its previous models that give it an edge over Apple’s watches. Fitbit provides five days of battery life on an average against Apple’s watches that only have a day of battery life and loses sleep data as it is charged overnight, he added. The San Francisco-based wearables pioneer, which has seen its shares sink in the past two years, has been looking for new avenues to boost sales.  Last week, it signed a contract with the Singapore government to provide fitness trackers and services in a health program it said could reach up to 1 million users.

3086,"  - Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google is shifting its Pixel smartphone production to Vietnam from China starting this year as it builds a cheap supply chain in Southeast Asia, the Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday. The move comes as labor costs are rising in China along with added pressure from spiraling tariffs due to the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade tensions. The U.S. internet giant plans to move most of its American-bound hardware out of China, including the Pixel phones and its smart speaker Google Home, Nikkei said. The company plans to ship about 8 million to 10 million smartphones this year, double from a year ago, making Vietnam a key part of Google’s drive for growth in the smartphone market, the newspaper added. Google will shift some production of the Pixel 3A phone to Vietnam before the end of this year, Nikkei reported citing sources. For its smart speakers, some production is likely to be moved to Thailand but the company’s new product development and initial production for its hardware lineup will still be in China, the newspaper said.

3217,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING   - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday lashed back at a new round of Chinese tariffs by heaping an additional 5% duty on some $550 billion in targeted Chinese goods in the latest tit-for-tat trade war escalation by the world’s two largest economies. Trump’s move, announced on Twitter, came hours after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, prompting the president earlier in the day to demand U.S. companies move their operations out of China. The intensifying U.S.-China trade war stoked market fears that the global economy will tip into recession, sending U.S. stocks into a tailspin, with the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC down 3%, and the S&P 500 .SPX down 2.6%. U.S. Treasury yields also declined as investors sought safe-haven assets, and crude oil, targeted for the first time by Chinese tariffs, fell sharply. Trump’s tariff response was announced after markets closed on Friday, leaving potentially more damage for next week. “Sadly, past Administrations have allowed China to get so far ahead of Fair and Balanced Trade that it has become a great burden to the American Taxpayer,” Trump said on Twitter. “As President, I can no longer allow this to happen!” He said the United States would raise its existing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to 30% from the current 25% beginning on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the communist People’s Republic of China.  At the same time, Trump announced an increase in planned tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese goods to 15% from 10%. The United States will begin imposing those tariffs on some products starting Sept. 1, but tariffs on about half of those goods have been delayed until Dec. 15. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office confirmed the effective dates, but said it would conduct a public comment period before imposing the 30% tariff rate on Oct. 1. U.S. business groups reacted angrily to the new tariff hike. “It’s impossible for businesses to plan for the future in this type of environment. The administration’s approach clearly isn’t working, and the answer isn’t more taxes on American businesses and consumers. Where does this end?” said David French, a senior vice president for the National Retail Federation. Trump is due to meet leaders of the G7 major economies at a summit this weekend in France, where trade tensions will be among the hottest discussion topics.  The president’s announcement, which followed an Oval Office meeting with his advisers, fits a pattern of swift retaliation since the trade dispute with China started more than a year ago. “He decided he wanted to respond. He was given a few different options on things he could do and ultimately that was what he decided,” a senior White House official said. “He’s not taking this stuff lightly, but he’s in a fine mood and looking forward to the G7.” Another person familiar with the matter said officials had to scramble to come up with options after Trump caught them offguard with tweets promising a response in the afternoon. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has demanded that China make sweeping changes to its economic policies to end theft and forced transfers of American intellectual property, curb industrial subsidies, open its markets to American companies and increase purchases of U.S. goods. China denies Trump’s accusations of unfair trade practices and has resisted concessions to Washington. “We don’t need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them. The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must STOP,” Trump tweeted on Friday morning. “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.” It’s unclear what legal authority Trump would be able to use to compel U.S. companies to close operations in China or stop sourcing products from the country. Experts said he could invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act used in the past for sanctions on Iran and North Korea, or cut offending companies out of federal procurement contracts.. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce rebuffed Trump’s call, urging “continued, constructive engagement.” “Time is of the essence. We do not want to see a further deterioration of U.S.-China relations,” Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of the business group’s international affairs, said in a statement.   Trump also said he was ordering shippers including FedEx (FDX.N). Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), UPS (UPS.N) and the U.S. Postal Service to search out and refuse all deliveries of the opioid fentanyl to the United States.  China’s Commerce Ministry said that on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15 it will impose additional tariffs of 5% or 10% on a total of 5,078 products originating from the United States and reinstitute tariffs of 25% on cars and 5% on auto parts suspended last December as U.S.-China trade talks accelerated.  It was unclear whether a new round of talks expected in September would go ahead. China Daily, an official English-language daily often used by Beijing to communicate its message to the rest of the world, said China’s tariff list is the result of “prudent calculation”. “With the U.S. proceeding at full throttle with its beggar-thy-neighbor policy, China has no choice but to fight back to protect its core national and economic interests,” it said in an editorial on Saturday. “China has taken the countermeasures so that U.S. decision-makers wake up and smell the coffee. And appreciate that until Washington follows the Osaka consensus, there can be no deal.”  The growing economic impact of the trade dispute was a key reason behind the U.S. Federal Reserve’s move to cut interest rates last month for the first time in more than a decade. “The president’s trade war threatens to push the economy into a ditch,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The president is hoping that the Federal Reserve will ... bail him out, but if he continues to pursue the war, the Fed won’t be up to the task.” Among U.S. goods targeted by Beijing’s latest duties were soybeans, which will be hit with an extra 5% tariff starting Sept. 1. China will also tag beef and pork from the United States with an extra 10% tariff, as well as ethanol with an additional 10% duty from December 15. Although the Trump administration has rolled out aid to farmers stung by China’s tariffs, there is growing frustration in America’s agricultural belt, a key political constituency for Trump as he heads into his 2020 re-election campaign. “The view from much of farm country is bleak and anger is boiling over. With bankruptcies and delinquencies rising and prices falling, the frustration with the lack of progress toward a deal is growing,” the bipartisan Farmers for Free Trade group said in a statement.

3231,"  - Qualcomm Inc won a partial stay against the enforcement of a sweeping antitrust ruling in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), according to a court filing on Friday. The company on May 21 lost in an antitrust lawsuit and has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursued an appeal. The San Diego-based company argued that letting the ruling stand could upend its talks with phone makers over chips for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks. In the ruling issued on Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put on hold the provisions of the earlier ruling that required Qualcomm to grant patent licenses to rival chip suppliers and end its practice of requiring its chip customers to sign a patent license before purchasing chips. The earlier ruling would have required Qualcomm to renegotiate all of its existing chip and patent deals, as well as make new deals conform to the requirements. The stay granted Friday puts on hold the effect of parts of the ruling while the appeals process, which could take a year or more, plays out. The Qualcomm antitrust case was unique in that different parts of the U.S. government weighed in with differing views. The Department of Justice - the other primary antitrust regulator in the United States - said during the initial trial that it disagreed with the FTC’s legal theory. And after the trial judge handed down a decision, the Pentagon and the Department of Energy both made filings saying that enforcing the decision would harm national security. “The government itself is divided about the propriety of the judgment and its impact on the public interest,” the appeals court wrote in its ruling.  Shares rose briefly after the news but then dropped 3.7% to $74.29 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Shares have been volatile this year, rising from the mid-$50 range to above $85 after Qualcomm settled a major lawsuit with Apple Inc, but then dropping to the mid-$60 range after its loss of the case brought by the FTC. The company has not formally filed its appeal in the FTC lawsuit. After Qualcomm files its arguments, the appeal will take place in January. In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company believes “the district court decision will be overturned once the merits of our appeal have been considered.” ",Qualcomm wins a pause in enforcement of FTC ruling,"August 23, 2019 /  3:50 PM ", qualcomm inc won a partial stay against the enforcement of a sweeping antitrust ruling in a lawsuit brought by the u s federal trade commission ftc according to a court filing on friday the company on may  lost in an antitrust lawsuit and has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursued an appeal the san diego based company argued that letting the ruling stand could upend its talks with phone makers over chips for g the next generation of wireless data networks in the ruling issued on friday the th u s circuit court of appeals put on hold the provisions of the earlier ruling that required qualcomm to grant patent licenses to rival chip suppliers and end its practice of requiring its chip customers to sign a patent license before purchasing chips the earlier ruling would have required qualcomm to renegotiate all of its existing chip and patent deals as well as make new deals conform to the requirements the stay granted friday puts on hold the effect of parts of the ruling while the appeals process which could take a year or more plays out the qualcomm antitrust case was unique in that different parts of the u s government weighed in with differing views the department of justice the other primary antitrust regulator in the united states said during the initial trial that it disagreed with the ftc s legal theory and after the trial judge handed down a decision the pentagon and the department of energy both made filings saying that enforcing the decision would harm national security the government itself is divided about the propriety of the judgment and its impact on the public interest the appeals court wrote in its ruling shares rose briefly after the news but then dropped   to   in afternoon trading on the nasdaq shares have been volatile this year rising from the mid  range to above  after qualcomm settled a major lawsuit with apple inc but then dropping to the mid  range after its loss of the case brought by the ftc the company has not formally filed its appeal in the ftc lawsuit after qualcomm files its arguments the appeal will take place in january in a statement qualcomm general counsel don rosenberg said the company believes the district court decision will be overturned once the merits of our appeal have been considered ,Boeing Crisis,0.21351274847984314
3236,"NEW YORK   - Stocks, the dollar and oil prices fell on Friday while safe havens rose after President Donald Trump demanded U.S. companies look at alternatives to China for manufacturing, following Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs on American goods. China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement early on Friday it would impose tariffs on about $75 billion in imports from the United States including some agricultural products, crude oil and small aircraft. Trump responded mid-morning in a series of tweets, writing that “American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.” Trump cannot force U.S. companies to abandon China and he gave no detail on how he might proceed with any such order. But his series of tweets was seen as a harbinger for yet another escalation of the trade war. After markets closed in New York, Trump tweeted the United States would raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to 30% from 25% beginning Oct. 1. “Additionally, the remaining 300 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China, that was being taxed from September 1st at 10%, will now be taxed at 15%,” he wrote.    The morning’s tweets “certainly heightened concerns about trade and its drag on global growth,” said Craig Bishop, lead strategist of the fixed income group at RBC Wealth Management at Minneapolis. “It has heightened chances of a recession. The President is his own worst enemy when he tries to manage both fiscal and monetary policies.” Stocks that benefit during economic expansions fell the most on Wall Street, also hinting at recession concerns. “There is a lot of worry here. I would say what (Trump) is tweeting is disconcerting. It’s a fair reaction from the markets. I don’t think anyone thought we’d get to this level,” Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said during market hours. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 623.34 points, or 2.37%, to 25,628.9, the S&P 500 lost 75.84 points, or 2.59%, to 2,847.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 239.62 points, or 3%, to 7,751.77. The pan-European STOXX 600 index turned sharply lower after Trump’s tweets, dropping 1% in the last half hour of trading to close down 0.78%, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe dropped 1.57%. Emerging market stocks lost 0.20%, an index of Latin American shares dropped more than 3% to close at its 2019 low and U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures fell 2.0%. Oil prices fell after China’s retaliatory tariffs announcement highlighted concern that the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies could slow global growth or even trigger a recession. Trump’s tweets made matters worse. “We still view the U.S.-Chinese trade standoff as a major bearish consideration that will likely be requiring additional downward oil demand adjustments as this year proceeds,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. U.S. crude fell 2.67% to $53.87 per barrel and Brent was last at $59.11, down 1.35% on the day. Trump’s comments came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank will “act as appropriate” to keep the economic expansion on track, but noted rising risks. Powell’s remarks had given markets some relief after the overnight announcement from Beijing. Trump’s tweeted response to the speech asked who is “our bigger enemy” between Powell and China’s President Xi Jinping. The two-year/10-year yield curve inverted last week for the first time since 2007, a signal that a U.S. recession is likely in one to two years. The curve has traded in and out of inversion over the past three days. U.S. Treasury yields fell, with 10-year notes last up 22/32 in price to yield 1.5351%, from 1.61% late on Thursday. The U.S. dollar fell after Powell’s comments and dropped further after Trump’s tweets. The dollar index fell 0.47%, with the euro up 0.53% to $1.1137. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.95% versus the greenback at 105.45 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.228, up 0.24% on the day. Spot gold added 1.8% to $1,525.37 an ounce.

3365,"DUBLIN   - All Ryanair (RYA.I) flights to and from British and Irish airports have departed without disruption so far on Thursday, the airline said, adding it also expected no impact for the rest of the day from a strike by some of its pilots based in Britain. Ryanair unions in Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal have been planning strikes over various grievances that began with a five-day cabin crew walkout in Portugal on Wednesday and continued with a 48-hour strike by some UK pilots on Thursday. Europe’s biggest low cost airlines said its first flights to and from UK airports on Thursday operated with 97% punctuality, with the slight slip due to air traffic control delays.   While more widespread strikes over pay and conditions a year ago forced Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, the airline has forecast minimal disruption this time and ran a full schedule without major delays in the first day of action in Portugal. With the exception of two delayed flights, all departures from Portugal appeared to be operating as normal on Thursday. Fernando Gandra, head of the SNPVAC trade union representing striking Portuguese cabin crew, told Reuters the airline had managed the fallout by making major changes to departure times in advance and notifying passengers ahead of time. Ryanair also limited the potential disruption by taking its fight to the courts on Wednesday and winning an Irish High Court injunction to prevent Dublin-based pilots striking. A London court rejected a similar application against its British pilots, who plan a second strike from the early hours of Sept. 2 until just before midnight on Sept. 4. Ryanair has said the striking pilots, members of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), represent less than 30% of those operating its aircraft there. Unions representing cabin crew in Spain said this week their plans for 10 days of strikes next month still stood after a round of mediated talks with the airline ended without agreement. The strikes are the first since Ryanair managed to quell last year’s disputes by reaching pay deals with many staff in Europe following its dramatic U-turn in late 2017 to recognize trade unions for the first time. However, it has failed to move beyond recognition deals with others and further angered unions by telling staff last month that it had 900 more pilots and crew than it needed due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX, and would have to close some bases.

3490,"WASHINGTON   - Major tech firms and U.S. tech industry groups said on Monday that France’s new digital services tax undermines the global tax regime and multilateral efforts to reform it. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and major trade associations testified Monday against the tax at a hearing before the U.S. Trade Representative’s office and other government officials. The French Senate in July approved a 3% levy that will apply to revenue from digital services earned in France by companies with more than 25 million euros in French revenue and 750 million euros ($838 million) worldwide.  “It does depart from even the outlines of what we expect out of the OECD,” said Daniel Bunn, director of global projects at the Tax Foundation, commenting on OECD-wide efforts to create a global agreement on taxing the digital economy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the tax will generate revenue of approximately 500 million euros ($554 million) per year “a large majority of which will be paid by U.S. firms” and will cost U.S. firms millions to conduct “significant re-engineering of accounting systems to ensure that they can accurately assess” liability. Major tech firms warned of increased costs. “Unilateral measures like the DST are harmful to Facebook and the digital economy,” Alan Lee, Facebook’s global head of tax policy, said in a statement. Matthew Schruers, chief operating officer at the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), representing companies like Intel Corp (INTC.O), eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), said at the hearing that the tax “undermines the progress made” on a new tax system on the digital economy and “supports an aggressive response to this problem.” “CCIA believes that this action warrants a substantial, proportionate response from the United States,” Schruers said, adding the tax “unquestionably” targets U.S. firms in an attempt by the French government to “ringfence” them. Amazon’s international tax policy director Peter Hiltz said more than 10,000 French-based businesses are selling on Amazon’s online stores and notified them certain fees will increase by 3% for Amazon.fr sales starting Oct. 1. Last month, President Donald Trump threatened to tax French wines or other products in response. USTR could impose new tariffs after a public comment period ends Aug. 26.  Other EU countries have also announced plans for their own digital taxes, arguing a levy is needed because big, multinational internet companies book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland, no matter where the revenue originates.

3546,"NEW YORK   - U.S. and European stocks surged on Friday on expectations the European Central Bank will cut interest rates but the dollar pared gains against the euro after a report said the German government was prepared to take on new debt to lift the economy. The dollar hit a two-week high against the euro as expectations of ECB stimulus weighed on the single currency and bullish data showing a jump in U.S. homebuilding permits to a seven-month high also helped lift the greenback. But German and other euro zone government bond yields rose late Friday on a Der Spiegel report. Borrowing costs had plumbed new lows throughout the week as investors unnerved by the prospect of European recession piled into safer assets. The euro rebounded to pare most losses after Der Spiegel magazine said the German government would be prepared to ditch its balanced budget rule and take on new debt to counter a possible recession. Germany’s Finance Ministry declined to comment on the report.  There has been a rising drumbeat of news recently from German politicians and businesses calling for a stimulus program, said Karl Schamotta, director of global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. “Markets are still betting on a raft of stimulus measures from the ECB in September and that is having a pretty strongly negative effect on the euro,” Schamotta said. “But in the near term, this idea that we could see more spending out of Germany is helping to alleviate that.” The German 10-year bund yield rose to a negative 0.688%, having earlier hit a record low of negative 0.727%. Rates turned negative in March and have trended lower since May. The rebound in equity markets buoyed investor sentiment, though it is hard to say the recent rout has found a floor despite cheaper prices, said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL-FCStone Financial in New York. U.S. banks are likely to get cheaper because European banks are likely to do so if the ECB does not put together a credible off-set plan for further negative rates for banks, he said. “That’s the concern. Despite some equities looking attractive the macro concern is giving investors a reason to pause and not so aggressively buy the dip,” Abbasi said. Technology shares led Wall Street’s advance but U.S. stocks posted a third straight week of declines, battered by the U.S.-China trade row and an “inversion” of 2- and 10-year bond yields that sparked fears of a recession. MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries gained 1.18% and its emerging market rose 0.69%. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed 1.23%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 306.62 points, or 1.2%, to 25,886.01. The S&P 500 gained 41.08 points, or 1.44%, to 2,888.68 and the Nasdaq Composite added 129.38 points, or 1.67%, to 7,895.99. The euro earlier slid to $1.1090, shy of a two-year low it set two weeks ago, on reports the ECB’s Olli Rehn had  suggested Thursday that a significant easing package was needed in September.  The dollar index rose 0.06%, with the euro down 0.15% to $1.1089. The Japanese yen weakened 0.23% versus the greenback at 106.35 per dollar. The German 10-year bund posted a fifth straight week of declines, Italy’s 10-year bond yield set its biggest weekly fall since late 1997 and the decline in Spanish 10-year yields were the largest since at least 1994. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 9/32 in price to push yields up to 1.5589%.

3666,"TOKYO   - China’s troubled Anbang Insurance Group has put its $2.4 billion property portfolio in Japan up for sale and previous owner Blackstone Group (BX.N) is bidding, two people familiar with the company’s plans said. The insurer is offering its entire portfolio of mainly residential buildings in Tokyo and other big cities after it failed to sell some of the assets last year, the sources said.   “The sale process has just started. Anbang is planning to sell the entire portfolio it bought from Blackstone,” said one of the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the company’s plans.  Representatives for Anbang and Blackstone declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A price has not been set as the sale is still in its early stages, they said. Anbang paid Blackstone about 260 billion yen ($2.4 billion) for the portfolio in 2017, then Japan’s biggest property deal since the global financial crisis. The Chinese government took control of Anbang in February last year, part of a campaign to reduce financial risk. Anbang’s former chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was later sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud and embezzlement. Since then Beijing has accelerated asset disposals at the insurance group, which was among the most aggressive Chinese buyers of foreign assets. Anbang tried to sell a portion of the Japanese portfolio last year, but failed to attract buyers because the assets were less attractive due to age and location, the sources said.  They said Blackstone was among the bidders for the entire portfolio largely made up of apartment buildings catering to middle class clients in Tokyo, Nagoya and other large cities.  Residential assets are attractive to Blackstone because they generate stable cash flow regardless of the economic cycle, unlike commercial office buildings, the sources said.

3683,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday said it would hold a meeting next week on whether to publish new guidance regarding the responsibilities of investors when relying on so-called proxy advisors. The proposal comes amid a push by the corporate lobby to rein in proxy advisors, which recommend how investors should vote in corporate elections on issues like pay and diversity. Groups representing listed companies claim the current SEC rules have allowed special interests to hijack boardrooms with costly demands. Shareholder proposals on charged issues like gun rights and climate change have taken on a higher profile since the 2007-2009 financial crisis as a mechanism for better corporate oversight. The move could set the SEC up for a clash with investors, who worry the agency is siding with companies to diminish voting rights. The SEC said in a notice published on its website that the agency will “consider whether to publish” the new guidance at Wednesday’s meeting, but did not specify what the guidance would be.  However, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters they expected it to clarify that investors do not have to submit votes for every share they own - a misconception that has allowed proxy firms to gain significant influence, say their critics.   The guidance is also expected to outline how investors should monitor their use of proxy advisors and ensure they are actually voting the way investors designate.  Investor groups and proxy advisory firms have said they worry any new guidance could ultimately make it more difficult for proxy advisory firms to provide timely, independent and cost-effective research for investors. A spokeswoman for the SEC declined to comment beyond Wednesday’s notice.

Concerns that a trade deal would not be reached before the 2020 U.S. presidential election grew after Goldman Sachs on Sunday became the latest to cut its U.S. growth outlook and warn a trade stand-off would fester past the election. Graphic: China trade shock interactive - tmsnrt.rs/2SRopIf Stocks on Wall Street fell more than 1% to push a gauge of global equity performance down almost as much. Earlier in China stocks rallied more than 1% as the yuan avoided further drama after Chinese authorities allowed the yuan to slip below the seven-per-dollar level last week. Stocks in the near term lack a catalyst either from company earnings, the Federal Reserve or a trade deal, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of Ideal Asset Management in New York.  “The promise of a trade deal coming this year, I think that’s becoming less and less likely,” Shah said. “That does set up the market possibly for a correction at this point,” he said. Stocks could dip between 5% to 10% but prompt long-term investors to enter the market as valuations fall, he said. Half of Shah’s portfolio is corporate debt with the remainder tech stocks and shares with solid dividends, he said. MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries fell 0.85%, driven lower by tumbling U.S. stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 index is now almost 5% off its all-time high set just 11 sessions ago.

U.S. Treasury yields dropped across the board as trade worries and political tensions around the world in places such as Hong Kong and Argentina supported safe-haven assets. U.S. long-term yields have fallen in six of the past nine sessions, reflecting investors’ diminished risk appetite. Bond yields in Europe also were lower on the day. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 28/32 in price to push their yield lower at 1.6386%. The Argentine peso collapsed, falling to 55.85 to the dollar, after voters snubbed market-friendly President Mauricio Macri by giving the opposition a greater-than-expected victory in Sunday’s primary election.

3732,"WASHINGTON   - The closure of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election does not mark the end of legal worries for President Donald Trump and people close to him. Other continuing investigations and litigation are focusing on issues including his businesses and financial dealings, personal conduct, charitable foundation and inaugural committee. The special counsel on Friday submitted his confidential report on the investigation to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who must decide on how much of it to make public. On Sunday Barr released a summary of Mueller’s findings that said the investigation did not find that President Donald Trump committed a crime but also does not exonerate him. The summary also said Mueller found no evidence that any member of Trump’s election campaign conspired with Russia during the election. While Mueller’s probe has ended, the other investigations, pursued by prosecutors at the federal and state level, could result in charges beyond those brought by Mueller or civil liability. The U.S. Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president cannot face criminal charges, so such a case against Trump would be unlikely while he is in office even if there were evidence of wrongdoing. Some legal experts have argued the department is wrong and that a president is not immune from prosecution. Either way, Trump potentially could face charges once he is out of office.  Here is an explanation of some criminal investigations and civil lawsuits still under way. Mueller charged 34 individuals and three companies. Several of those cases resulted in guilty pleas and one case went to trial, with former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort convicted in August 2018 of eight criminal counts, including bank fraud and tax fraud. Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone was indicted in January of this year and pleaded not guilty, but his trial is still pending. There are other cases involving indicted Russians that have not gone to trial. Other prosecutors within the Justice Department will likely take over criminal cases begun by Mueller, legal experts said. Trump may face significant peril from federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to legal experts. His former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said in Feb. 27 congressional testimony that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is examining Trump’s business practices and financial dealings. Cohen already has implicated Trump in campaign finance law violations to which he pleaded guilty in August 2018 as part of the Southern District investigation. Cohen admitted he violated campaign finance laws by arranging, at Trump’s direction, “hush money” payments shortly before the 2016 presidential election to porn film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal to prevent damage to Trump’s candidacy. Both women said they had sexual relationships with Trump more than a decade ago. He has denied that. Prosecutors said the payments constituted illegal campaign contributions intended to influence the election. Under federal election laws, such donations cannot exceed $2,700 and need to be publicly disclosed. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, received $130,000. McDougal received $150,000. The New York investigation has involved longtime Trump ally David Pecker, publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper, who admitted to paying McDougal for the rights to her story and then suppressing it to influence the election, an arrangement called “catch and kill.”  During his Feb. 27 congressional hearing, Cohen said he was in “constant contact” with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, and said other crimes and wrongdoing by Trump are being investigated by them, though he did not offer details. Cohen said he could not testify about the nature of his last conversation with Trump in early 2018 because it was under investigation by the federal prosecutors in New York. The Manhattan district attorney’s office is exploring criminal charges against Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, over financial crimes related to unpaid state taxes and possibly loans. In cases bought by Mueller, Manafort in 2018 was convicted of tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts in Virginia and pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges in Washington. He was sentenced to a combined 7-1/2 years in prison in the two cases. Trump has not ruled out granting Manafort a pardon. The president would not be able to pardon Manafort if he is convicted of charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney because they would not be federal crimes. However, New York has broad double-jeopardy protections that usually prevent the state from prosecuting a person for crimes arising from the same criminal conduct the federal government has prosecuted before. A defamation lawsuit against Trump by Summer Zervos, a  former contestant on his reality television show “The Apprentice,” continues in New York state court after a judge in 2018 allowed it to proceed. Zervos sued Trump after he called her and other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct liars and retweeted a post labeling her claims a hoax. Trump has agreed to provide written answers to questions from Zervos by Sept. 28, according to a court filing. Zervos accused Trump of kissing her against her will at his New York office in 2007 and later groping her at a meeting at a hotel in California. More than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics. Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Trump, had argued that the lawsuit unconstitutionally impedes the president from performing his duties. An appeals court rejected that argument on March 14 by a 3-2 vote. Kasowitz said he would appeal the decision to the state’s  highest court. Separately, two lawsuits against Trump brought by porn star Stormy Daniels were dismissed. A lawsuit filed by the New York state Attorney General’s Office has already led the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which was presented as the charitable arm of Trump’s business empire, to agree in December 2018 to dissolve, and the litigation continues.  The state is seeking an order banning Trump and his three eldest children from leadership roles in any other New York charity. Trump has said the lawsuit was concocted by “sleazy New York Democrats.” The state’s Democratic attorney general accused the foundation of being “engaged in a “shocking pattern of illegality” and “functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump’s business and political interests” in violation of federal law. The attorney general’s office alleged Trump and his family members used the charity to pay off his legal debts and purchase personal items. The foundation agreed to dissolve and give away all its remaining assets under court supervision. Trump is accused in a lawsuit filed by the Democratic attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia of violating anti-corruption provisions of the U.S. Constitution through his businesses’ dealings with foreign governments. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on March 19 in the Trump administration’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Peter Messitte’s 2018 rulings allowing the case to proceed. The Constitution’s “emoluments clause” bars U.S. officials from accepting payments from foreign governments and the governments of U.S. states without congressional approval. The lawsuit stated that because Trump did not divest himself of his business empire, spending by foreign governments at the Trump International Hotel in Washington amounts to unconstitutional gifts, or “emoluments,” to the president. The three appeals court judges, all appointed by Republican presidents, expressed approval toward Trump’s arguments in the case and signaled they might dismiss it, but did not issue a ruling. Some experts have said the case will eventually be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating whether the committee that organized Trump’s inauguration in January 2017 accepted illegal donations from foreigners, misused funds or brokered special access to the administration for donors. Federal election law prohibits foreigners from donating to U.S. political campaigns or inaugural committees, and corruption laws ban donors from making contributions in exchange for political favors. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in December 2018 that the president was not involved in his inaugural committee. The $107 million raised by the committee, which was chaired by real estate developer and investor Thomas Barrack, was the largest in history, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Under the Constitution, the president, vice president and “all civil officers of the United States” can be removed from office by Congress through the impeachment process for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” The House of Representatives acts as the accuser - voting on whether to bring specific charges such as obstruction of justice - and the Senate then conducts a trial with House members acting as prosecutors and the individual senators serving as jurors. A simple majority vote is needed in the House to impeach. A two-thirds majority is required in the Senate to convict and remove.

3816,"WEIFANG, China   - Charging elderly clients just 1 yuan or about 15 cents a day, little-known Lanchuang Network Technology Corp has embarked on one of the most ambitious undertakings in aged care by a private sector firm in China.  Provided with a setup box, a webcam paired with a TV set and “Xiaoyi”, a Siri-like voice assistant, customers gain access to telemedicine and an SOS system as well as for-pay services that include housekeeping and meal deliveries.  A small robot that can ring up a medical center in response to verbal calls for help costs an extra 2 yuan per day. Launched just four months ago, Lanchuang’s smart care system has already signed up 220,000 elderly clients in 16 cities, half of which are in Shandong, a rapidly aging province in eastern China where the company is based.   It is targeting as many as 1.5 million users this year, 12 million next year and 30 million in 2021, when it hopes to list on China’s new Nasdaq-style tech board.  The aim, however, is not to make money from its clients, some of whom get by on pensions as low as a few hundred yuan a month, but to take a cut from providers of offline services.  “China’s market for elderly care is huge, but services in the industry are fragmented,” CEO Li Libo told Reuters in an interview at his company’s headquarters in Weifang city.  “Scattered on the ground are pearls,” Li, 47, said of the products and services available, adding it was his company’s aim to string them together.  Lanchuang, which is also working with China Mobile Ltd (0941.HK) on a smartphone for seniors, is an example of growing, albeit still nascent, attempts by entrepreneurs to provide comprehensive smart home care services for China’s vast number of elderly.  China has a quarter of a billion people aged 60 or over, and by 2050, that number is set to climb to almost half a billion, or 35% of the population, according to government estimates.  Liu, 66, a native of Jinan, Shandong’s capital, knows how hard taking care of the elderly can be. In her mother’s final years, her urinary tract would get obstructed despite wearing a catheter and often in the middle of the night, to her daughter’s despair.  “If only I had been able to reach a doctor to help my mother, but doctors are not reachable 24 hours a day,” said Liu, who only gave her surname.  The retired accountant, who was unaware of tech products aimed at the elderly, now lives alone and is reluctant to trouble her own daughter and son-in-law.  Care of aging parents has traditionally fallen on the shoulders of children, but in modern China, where the one-child policy was abolished only in 2016, the son or daughter has to look after as many as four aging people including in-laws. Often, children have moved to cities far away for work.  Retirement and nursing homes are on the rise, but are too pricey for most families and largely perceived as ridden with abuse. Three-quarters of old people prefer to live out their days at home, official surveys show.   While Beijing has been eager to establish a policy framework for a formal aged care system, local governments have been reluctant to support aged-care services which they see as nice-to-haves or just too much work.  But change is afoot.  In April, Beijing issued a detailed policy document outlining services to be developed for the sector, including smart technology, as well as financial support.  The central government provided almost 22 million yuan ($3 million) in subsidies for Lanchuang’s smart platform and the Shandong provincial government has given 3 million yuan.  That level of encouragement is a far cry from a decade ago when entrepreneurs consistently met with local resistance.  “Why are you doing this? What has this got to do with me?” said U.S. entrepreneur Wang Jie, 59, as he recalled skeptical looks when he sounded out local authorities in China about trials of motion sensors at people’s homes.  Wang had to go to Canada for his trials. When he returned to Beijing in late 2013 to kick start a venture, Wang had to convince local authorities, district by district, of the virtues of his sensors - which help family members monitor activity levels of elderly people via an app but are not as intrusive as cameras.  Wang, who sits on the National Advisory Committee on Smart Elderly Care, has since managed to make inroads into two Beijing districts, with talks underway with three others.  The two districts have helped Wang identify high-risk individuals, typically those aged 70 and above, who live alone and might be willing to use his sensors.  His firm, Beijing eCare Smart Tech Co, has sold several hundred sets of sensors in Beijing so far this year under three-year contracts with community organizations. Wang’s company also helps train grassroots emergency response crews as part of the deal. Households pay nothing.   “If an elderly person dies and the body is only discovered after three days, this creates negative publicity for the local government, publicity that it wants to avoid,” Wang said.  Entrepreneurs in other graying economies such as the United States, Britain and South Korea have similarly seized on opportunities in the sector, touting technologies from voice recognition for home appliances to robot companions for lonely old people.  But it is still early days in China.  In Weifang, Zhuojing Healthcare Center, one of 147 community medical service providers connected to the Lanchuang network, said it has only receives 1-2 calls through the system a day. On a Reuters visit organized by Lanchuang to the homes of two elderly clients in Weifang, both said they use the platform mainly for video chats with family.   Zhao Xi’e, 55, said she uses it to talk to her mother who lives nearby.   Zhao’s shopping and food delivery panels on her TV display were grayed out, indicating zero service providers in her neighborhood. She was also unaware the red button on her handheld control had an SOS function.  “Is that an on/off button?” she asked.

3843,"  - Kontoor Brands Inc (KTB.N) beat expectations for quarterly profit on Thursday as the denim apparel maker’s efforts to cut costs post its spinoff from VF Corp (VFC.N) paid off, sending shares up over 13%.  Just months after completing its separation from Vans sneaker maker VF Corp, the company said its total costs and operating expenses had fallen about 5% in the second quarter as it streamlined supply chains and sourced materials for less. With revenue down 6% and profits almost 40%, executives from the maker of Lee and Wrangler jeans also said they were looking at withdrawing from unprofitable markets if need be and would look at sourcing opportunities in new markets. Its net income of 96 cents per share beat analysts’ estimates of 67 cents while adjusted net revenue of $602.4 million was around $10 million above forecasts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “The restructuring and cost savings actions we’ve taken ... are paying off and are setting the foundation for improved profitability in the second half of 2019,” Chief Executive Officer Scott Baxter said in a statement. The popularity of Lee in China has given Kontoor a strong base to launch Wrangler there next year but it has kept manufacturing spread out, allowing it to evade the risks of U.S.-China trade tensions and resulting tariffs.  It has manufacturing bases in Mexico, Bangladesh and the United States, allowing it to supply the U.S. market from outside China. The company said it expected Wrangler sales, hit hard by the bankruptcy of Sears last October, to accelerate in the second half of the year, helped by a promotional kick from rapper Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” hit, which mentions the jeans.  “If you look at denim in the United States, the strong-holders are Levi’s and American Eagle because their messaging is very strong and speaks directly to the millenial consumers....

3857,"OSLO   - Danske Commodities, a power and gas trading firm owned by oil major Equinor (EQNR.OL), has expanded its operations to the United States, completing its first trade on the PJM wholesale power market, it said on Thursday. The trade, which Danske Commodities called a milestone, extended the company’s reach to 39 countries and was part of a strategy to expand globally, adding to the European and Australian markets that the firm is currently active in. “The price drivers are very similar to those in our current core markets, and that also applies to risk and return characteristics, so there is a good fit with our business model and capabilities,” Danske’s Chief Executive Helle Oestergaard Kristiansen said. The company launched its U.S. operation with three employees based in Equinor’s Connecticut office, Danske’s global head of power trading Jesper Tronborg told Reuters, declining to disclose the size of the initial trade. In the last two months Danske Commodities has signed three multi-year power purchase agreements to manage part of the production of offshore wind farms in Britain in which Equinor has a stake. In July, Equinor also won a bid to develop the Empire Wind farm, one of the largest offshore wind projects ever built in the U.S.. Construction offshore of New York will begin in 2022 with operations expected to start in 2024. It will have a capacity of 816 megawatts (MW). “Danske Commodities’ call is to support Equinor’s investments in the new energy solutions whenever we can,” Tronborg said when asked if the firm will also manage output at the Empire Wind project. Danske has taken over Equinor’s third-party gas trading, downstream gas storage positions and power trading activities including certificates trading as well as balancing and optimization of Equinor’s growing portfolio of renewable assets.

3872,"  - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) on Wednesday released the second generation of its processor chip for data centers and said that it had landed Alphabet Inc’ (GOOGL.O) Google and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) as customers. AMD competes against Intel Corp (INTC.O) to supply chips for data centers that power internet-based services. Both firms have come to rely on data center chips for growth because personal computer sales have stagnated as users shifted to mobile devices. AMD’s newest generation of server chip, called EPYC, uses a new chip-making technology from its contract manufacturers that helps the chips have better performance while consuming less power.  Intel, which makes chips in its own factories instead of relying on contractors, is behind schedule delivering chips made with its own newer manufacturing process. It plans to release them next year. AMD has tried to take advantage of that by courting some of Intel’s biggest customers, such as Google.  AMD said on Thursday that Google is using its second-generation EPYC server chip in Google’s internal data centers and that Google will offer it to external developers as part of its cloud computing offerings later this year. It is the first time Google has publicly acknowledged using AMD’s EPYC chips. Intel shares were down 0.6% to $46.42 in after-hours trading after AMD’s customer announcements. AMD shares were up 0.3% to $29.30.  Intel, which said that both Google and Twitter remain customers, is the dominant supplier of data center chips, with more than 90% of the market under its control. But AMD has been making inroads with its most recent chips. Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, said he estimates that AMD took “low single-digit” market share from Intel with the first generation of EPYC server chips and that he expects that share to expand with the second generation announced Wednesday. In terms of performance, Moorhead said the new AMD chips are better than Intel’s chips at some kinds of computing work but may lag on others. He said that new Intel chip features for machine learning tasks and new Intel memory technology being with customers such as German software firm SAP SE (SAPG.DE) could give Intel an advantage in those areas. Moorhead said in a research note that most every large business he talks to “wants more competition in the space to accelerate innovation and lower costs. With that said, none of these customers would adopt AMD if it didn’t have some advantages.” ","AMD lands Google, Twitter as customers with newest server chip","August 7, 2019 /  11:08 PM ", advanced micro devices inc amd o on wednesday released the second generation of its processor chip for data centers and said that it had landed alphabet inc googl o google and twitter inc twtr n as customers amd competes against intel corp intc o to supply chips for data centers that power internet based services both firms have come to rely on data center chips for growth because personal computer sales have stagnated as users shifted to mobile devices amd s newest generation of server chip called epyc uses a new chip making technology from its contract manufacturers that helps the chips have better performance while consuming less power intel which makes chips in its own factories instead of relying on contractors is behind schedule delivering chips made with its own newer manufacturing process it plans to release them next year amd has tried to take advantage of that by courting some of intel s biggest customers such as google amd said on thursday that google is using its second generation epyc server chip in google s internal data centers and that google will offer it to external developers as part of its cloud computing offerings later this year it is the first time google has publicly acknowledged using amd s epyc chips intel shares were down   to   in after hours trading after amd s customer announcements amd shares were up   to   intel which said that both google and twitter remain customers is the dominant supplier of data center chips with more than  of the market under its control but amd has been making inroads with its most recent chips patrick moorhead founder of moor insights strategy said he estimates that amd took low single digit market share from intel with the first generation of epyc server chips and that he expects that share to expand with the second generation announced wednesday in terms of performance moorhead said the new amd chips are better than intel s chips at some kinds of computing work but may lag on others he said that new intel chip features for machine learning tasks and new intel memory technology being with customers such as german software firm sap se sapg de could give intel an advantage in those areas moorhead said in a research note that most every large business he talks to wants more competition in the space to accelerate innovation and lower costs with that said none of these customers would adopt amd if it didn t have some advantages ,Boeing Crisis,0.4965074360370636
3889,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump issued the first veto of his presidency on Friday to block a measure passed by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that would terminate his emergency declaration for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. The veto, made necessary after a strong and unusual rebuke from members of Trump’s Republican party, capped a week that left Trump politically wounded, at least temporarily, as immigration and his signature promise of a wall become a flashpoint again in the 2020 presidential campaign. Congress is unlikely to muster the votes to override Trump’s veto, a fact that left White House officials confident despite disappointment that it passed the Republican-controlled Senate at all.   The bipartisan vote on Thursday was a slap at Trump for his decision to circumvent Congress and take money already designated for other programs to pay for a barrier on the southern border. Twelve Republicans joined Democrats in the Senate to pass the measure, concerned that the president had overstepped his authority. Trump repeated his view that a crisis existed at the border, called the resolution reckless and said he was proud to veto it. “As president the protection of the nation is my highest duty. Yesterday, Congress passed a dangerous resolution that if signed into law would put countless Americans in danger, very grave danger,” he said, sitting behind his desk in the Oval Office. “Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it.” The White House had lobbied heavily for Republicans to back Trump, despite concerns among some about executive overreach and precedent-setting action that a future Democratic president could copy on policies that Republicans oppose. The president, without acknowledging that lobbying, said he had sympathy for those who defied him, adding they did what they had to do. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the president’s emergency declaration was legal.  It is being challenged in court as an unconstitutional usurpation of Congress’ power of the purse. Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said her chamber would vote on March 26 to override the veto. “The House and Senate resoundingly rejected the president’s lawless power grab, yet the president has chosen to continue to defy the Constitution, the Congress and the will of the American people,” she said in a statement. The Senate would have to vote to override the veto as well, requiring more Republicans than the original 12 to sign on, which is unlikely to happen. Trump was flanked by border officials and people whose relatives were killed by someone who was in the United States illegally. They praised the president for standing firm on the issue, which resonates strongly with his political base. Researchers have said that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes, despite Trump repeatedly linking immigration and crime.  The president has said he wants a wall to prevent immigrants from crossing into the United States illegally. Democrats deny there is an emergency at the border, saying border crossings are at a four-decade low.  Trump thanked Republican senators who voted for his declaration in a Twitter post earlier on Friday. “Watch, when you get back to your State, they will LOVE you more than ever before!” he said. Trump made a border wall a central promise of his 2016 campaign for the White House. He initially insisted that Mexico would pay for the wall but it has declined to do so.

3902,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the “horrible massacre” at two mosques in New Zealand on Friday, a deadly attack that killed 49 people in what the White House called a “vicious act of hate.”   The massacre during Friday prayers wounded more than 40 others in the country’s worst-ever mass shooting, which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern condemned as terrorism.  “My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died, with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do,” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter. Earlier, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that the United States strongly condemned the attack. “The United States strongly condemns the attack in Christchurch. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with the people of New Zealand and their government against this vicious act of hate,” Sanders said. New Zealand police said three people were in custody including one man in his late 20s who was charged with murder. The accused gunman’s manifesto praised Trump as “a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump drew strong criticism in the days after a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 when he equated white supremacists with counter-protesters and saying “both sides” were to blame. He said on the anniversary of the rally in August that he condemns “all types of racism and acts of violence.” Trump has at times indicated his supporters could turn to violence. Asked about possible impeachment in a December interview with Reuters, he said, “I think that the people would revolt if that happened.” ",Trump condemns New Zealand mosque attack as 'horrible massacre',"March 15, 2019 /  11:55 AM ",washington u s president donald trump condemned the horrible massacre at two mosques in new zealand on friday a deadly attack that killed  people in what the white house called a vicious act of hate the massacre during friday prayers wounded more than  others in the country s worst ever mass shooting which prime minister jacinda ardern condemned as terrorism my warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of new zealand after the horrible massacre in the mosques  innocent people have so senselessly died with so many more seriously injured the u s stands by new zealand for anything we can do trump wrote in a post on twitter earlier white house press secretary sarah sanders said in a statement that the united states strongly condemned the attack the united states strongly condemns the attack in christchurch our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families we stand in solidarity with the people of new zealand and their government against this vicious act of hate sanders said new zealand police said three people were in custody including one man in his late s who was charged with murder the accused gunman s manifesto praised trump as a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment trump drew strong criticism in the days after a deadly white supremacist rally in charlottesville virginia in  when he equated white supremacists with counter protesters and saying both sides were to blame he said on the anniversary of the rally in august that he condemns all types of racism and acts of violence trump has at times indicated his supporters could turn to violence asked about possible impeachment in a december interview with  he said i think that the people would revolt if that happened ,Boeing Crisis,0.5476598143577576

3949,"NEW YORK   - Oil prices fell more than 1% on Tuesday, with Brent crude settling near seven-month lows below $60 a barrel as trade tensions between the U.S. and China intensified worries about weakening global demand.  During the session, Brent traded at a low of $58.81 a barrel, down more than 22% from its peak in April. That decline puts the global benchmark in “bear market” territory. Brent prices have lost more than 9% in the past week, with U.S. President Donald Trump vowing to impose new tariffs on Chinese imports and Beijing making further moves against U.S. agricultural cargoes.  The United States also responded to a decline in China’s yuan on Monday by branding China a currency manipulator. Trump on Tuesday dismissed concerns over a protracted trade war with China, as Beijing warned that Washington’s decision the day before would lead to chaos in financial markets.  International benchmark Brent futures LCOc1 fell 87 cents, or 1.45%, to settle at $58.94 a barrel.  West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 futures were down $1.06, or 1.94%, at $53.63 a barrel. “As far as the oil market is concerned, there are two key questions: 1) Why should China carry on buying U.S. crude oil? and 2) Why should China continue to adhere to the U.S. sanctions when it comes to buying Iranian oil?” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said in a note. Global equities hit a two-month low .MIWD00000PUS and Brent fell more than 3% on Monday as traders worried the dispute between the world’s two biggest oil buyers would dent demand, helping to prompt Tuesday’s short-covering.  “It’s difficult for oil to hold (up) when you have such moves in equities,” Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob said. Oil prices found little encouragement as the U.S. government forecast that growth in the Permian basin and other shale formations would largely offset production losses from the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Barry.  Crude could still find some support after the market settles on Tuesday, with a Reuters poll showing U.S. crude oil inventories were expected to have fallen for an eighth consecutive week.  The American Petroleum Institute is set to release its weekly inventory data at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT), with official government numbers to follow on Wednesday. On the supply side, Iran has threatened to block all energy exports out of the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of global oil traffic passes, if it is unable to sell oil as promised by a 2015 nuclear deal in exchange for curbing uranium enrichment. Britain on Monday joined the United States in a maritime security mission in the Gulf to protect merchant vessels after Iran seized a British-flagged vessel.

3976,"NEW DELHI   - India has increased the cost estimate of a giant refinery and petrochemical project to be jointly built with Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co by more than 36%, after protests by farmers forced the relocation of the plant, four sources said. The 1.2 million barrels-per-day (bpd) coastal refinery in the western state of Maharashtra is now expected to be built at Roha in the Raigad district, about 100 km (62 miles) south of Mumbai.  The new cost estimate of $60 billion for the refinery was given to Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al-Falih at a meeting with Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan last month in New Delhi, said the four sources familiar with the talks between the two ministers.  “The $60 billion is a preliminary estimate that was told to Saudi Arabia. The final number will be decided on the basis of a detailed feasibility study,” said a source present at the meeting. The project cost at the signing of a deal with Saudi Aramco in 2018 was pegged at $44 billion. The four sources requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.  Despite the cost expansion, the project is still expected to be commissioned in 2025, the sources said. Global oil producers are vying to gain entry into India to establish a stable outlet for their output and to earn profit from the South Asian nation’s strong gasoline and petrochemical demand prospects due to the rising disposable income of its 1.3 billion population.  The world’s third-largest crude oil importer aims to raise its refining capacity by 77% to 8.8 million bpd by 2030.  The state government suspended land acquisition at the previous site in Ratnagiri - about 400 km south of Mumbai - after thousands of farmers refused to surrender their land, fearing the project could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches.  “It is a huge escalation in cost. But since the project is of a mega scale, we expect the investment to be staggered,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, director at Singapore-based consultancy FGE, adding that her firm was doubtful the 2025 timeline of the project would be met.  The sources said the cost escalation is mainly due to the delay in land acquisition for the project and that all calculations need to be reworked.  State run companies - Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum - own 50% of the Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), the company building the project.  Saudi Aramco and ADNOC hold the remaining half. B. Ashok, chief executive of RRPCL, declined comment on the increased cost estimate, and there was no immediate response from India’s national oil ministry.  Saudi Arabia’s Energy Ministry and Saudi Aramco also did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  The Maharashtra state government has promised that land at the new site would be acquired by end-December.  A consortium led by Russia’s Rosneft acquired a controlling stake in Nayara Energy in 2017, illustrating the interest in India refining sector.  Saudi Aramco is also in talks to buy a minority stake in Reliance Industries’ refining, marketing and petrochemical business, and analysts say any further delay in land acquisition may force it to take a harder look at the private Indian refiner’s assets.  Investment in a new west coast refinery is a better option as this would give Aramco more say in the operation and configuration of the project, said Paravaikkarasu.  “But if land acquisition is not completed within this year, then Reliance appears to be a better option as this is a running project and they can monetise the investment from day one.”  ",Exclusive: India raises cost of refinery project with Aramco by 36% - sources,"August 6, 2019 /  8:12 AM ",new delhi india has increased the cost estimate of a giant refinery and petrochemical project to be jointly built with saudi aramco and abu dhabi national oil co by more than  after protests by farmers forced the relocation of the plant four sources said the   million barrels per day bpd coastal refinery in the western state of maharashtra is now expected to be built at roha in the raigad district about  km  miles south of mumbai the new cost estimate of  billion for the refinery was given to saudi arabia s energy minister khalid al falih at a meeting with indian oil minister dharmendra pradhan last month in new delhi said the four sources familiar with the talks between the two ministers the  billion is a preliminary estimate that was told to saudi arabia the final number will be decided on the basis of a detailed feasibility study said a source present at the meeting the project cost at the signing of a deal with saudi aramco in  was pegged at  billion the four sources requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter despite the cost expansion the project is still expected to be commissioned in  the sources said global oil producers are vying to gain entry into india to establish a stable outlet for their output and to earn profit from the south asian nation s strong gasoline and petrochemical demand prospects due to the rising disposable income of its   billion population the world s third largest crude oil importer aims to raise its refining capacity by  to   million bpd by  the state government suspended land acquisition at the previous site in ratnagiri about  km south of mumbai after thousands of farmers refused to surrender their land fearing the project could damage a region famed for its alphonso mangoes cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches it is a huge escalation in cost but since the project is of a mega scale we expect the investment to be staggered said sri paravaikkarasu director at singapore based consultancy fge adding that her firm was doubtful the  timeline of the project would be met the sources said the cost escalation is mainly due to the delay in land acquisition for the project and that all calculations need to be reworked state run companies indian oil corp bharat petroleum corp and hindustan petroleum own  of the ratnagiri refinery petrochemicals ltd rrpcl the company building the project saudi aramco and adnoc hold the remaining half b ashok chief executive of rrpcl declined comment on the increased cost estimate and there was no immediate response from india s national oil ministry saudi arabia s energy ministry and saudi aramco also did not respond to a  request for comment the maharashtra state government has promised that land at the new site would be acquired by end december a consortium led by russia s rosneft acquired a controlling stake in nayara energy in  illustrating the interest in india refining sector saudi aramco is also in talks to buy a minority stake in reliance industries refining marketing and petrochemical business and analysts say any further delay in land acquisition may force it to take a harder look at the private indian refiner s assets investment in a new west coast refinery is a better option as this would give aramco more say in the operation and configuration of the project said paravaikkarasu but if land acquisition is not completed within this year then reliance appears to be a better option as this is a running project and they can monetise the investment from day one ,Boeing Crisis,0.361425518989563
3986,"LONDON   - It’s 10 o’clock at night, and Benjamin Arnold’s day is just beginning. The former Goldman Sachs trader is gearing up to trade equities in Asia from his small office thousands of miles away in Park City, Utah. He’s not trading his own book, but rather is taking orders and executing trades for a client, an Asian asset manager. After almost 15 years working at hedge funds and banks, Arnold launched an outsourced trading firm, joining a growing crop of niche companies aiming to tap burgeoning demand for outside help from small and mid-sized asset managers. “There comes a time when you have to decide between standing by and watching the world change or stepping up and becoming that change,” the 37-year-old said.        A heavier regulatory burden on money managers, razor-thin margins and rapid technological developments in trading are driving many to cut costs and hire outside firms to handle their day-to-day trading. The pace of demand has accelerated this year in particular as asset managers feel the pinch following the introduction in 2018 of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) which slapped more onerous paperwork on them. It is as much as 40% cheaper for small to medium-sized fund firms to hire an external trading company than employ two traders themselves, according to interviews with executives from more than a dozen asset managers, banks and brokerages, as well as industry experts.  Michael Broadbent at Ergo Consultancy, which helps set up trading desks and advises fund managers on regulation, has seen a “giant switch” this year. “It is almost impossible for an in-house trading team to stay focused on every new and opening liquidity venue, electronic broker, non-incumbent exchange and crossing network while continuing to execute their existing business to a MiFID II standard of best execution,” he said. The industry is still in its infancy, but industry experts say it is one of the fastest-growing segments in prime brokerage, which covers the complex financial services needs of big institutions.  They reckon about two dozen firms offer outsourced trading services with at least four, including Wells Fargo (WFC.N), BTON Financial and Arnold’s Meraki Global Advisors, venturing into the business this year. That compares with just a handful a few years ago, they say. Last month, mid-sized broker INTL FCStone (INTL.O) bought U.S. outsourcer Fillmore Advisors to bolster its prime brokerage offering. The gap in the market being filled by boutique outsourcers, like Fillmore, Arnold’s Meraki, Tourmaline Partners and CF Global, is prompting some big banks and brokerages to try to grab a slice of the action. Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O) and Jefferies Financial Group (JEF.N), for example, have set up their own outsourcing teams of traders working for a range of clients.  Such outsourced trading desks effectively work as units of “buy-side” investors like asset managers, and include all the analysis, administration and compliance services an in-house team would provide. They are distinct from a bank or brokerage’s regular “sell-side” trading operations which simply execute trades on a client’s behalf.  One in every five fund firms with over $50 billion worth of assets will outsource some portion of their trading desks by 2022, according to research by financial consultancy Opimas. Global revenues in the outsourced trading business are about $450-$500 million annually and expected to grow 20-30% a year, it said. The practice of farming out trading functions has been around for years, but it is becoming increasingly attractive for small and mid-sized asset managers who may not be trading frequently or in big enough volumes to justify the cost of maintaining an in-house desk. Opimas estimates it works out cheaper to hire an outsourced firm if an asset manager’s equities trader is handling less than $1.5 billion in annual trading volume.  “We like to stick to our knitting,” said Karen Zachary, chief operating officer of Crux Asset Management, which uses Northern Trust to handle all its day-to-day trading so it can focus on strategy.  London-based EdenTree Investment Management, with 2.7 billion pounds  ($3.28 billion) assets under management, is considering outsourcing its dealings, said one of its fund managers, Chris Hiorns.  By outsourcing, asset managers would typically spend about 5 basis points per trade, compared with the equivalent of around 8 basis points if they traded in-house, according to the market players and researchers interviewed.  Experts estimate it costs about $1.5 million per year to operate a three-member trading desk, and small to mid-sized fund firms typically employ two to three traders. Then there are the costs of reporting trades to regulators and additional compliance due to MiFID II. Needs vary among asset managers; some like Crux hire an outside company to handle all their execution, while London-based Hermes Investment Management, for example, relies on CF Global for its emerging market and Asia ex-Japan equities, and keeps its own traders for other assets. Some use trading firms to cover inconvenient time zones like Australia. For the banks and brokerages who are increasingly offering outsourced trading, it represents a much-needed source of extra income as they too have been squeezed by regulation and are grappling with perennially low interest rates. “The sell side is facing its own challenges, as fixed costs are rising while the commission pool is shrinking,” said Richard Johnson, a senior analyst at research firm Greenwich Associates.  “Within this dynamic, outsourced trading desks have created a strong niche and compelling value proposition.” U.S.-based Northern Trust ventured into the business almost two years ago and now has 32 clients including Fundsmith and Mobius Capital Partners. Gary Paulin, head of institutional brokerage at Northern Trust, said his outsourcing team of 18 traders processed equity trades worth $145 billion last year for its various clients. That’s about $8 billion per trader. Jefferies Prime Brokerage launched its outsourced trading business in June last year, and now has 70 clients, according to John Laub, co-head of prime brokerage at Jefferies. According to Laub, under 10% of their start-up clients were using outsourced trading in 2016, while the figure for start-up funds today is “north of 70%”. Aside from cost savings, outsourced trading desks also offer big broker networks, which are increasingly necessary under MiFIDII. The rules require money managers to prove to clients they have traded in the most efficient way possible - known as “best execution” - piling on extra pressure as they battle competition from passive funds, which track markets rather than trying to outperform them. “It’s a really cumbersome process with around 80 reporting fields, it’s a real pain and it costs money,” said Paulin at Northern Trust. Tourmaline Partners, for instance, says it has access to 400 brokers through its almost 40 traders in London, Stamford in the United States and Sydney, Australia.  They handled $175 billion worth of trades last year. Andrew Walton, head of its European business, said he expects that to rise by a fifth this year. For experienced traders like Meraki’s Arnold, this fast-growing outsourcing sector also offers a new lease of life as bustling trading rooms steadily dwindle in the era of algorithms and automation. “I believe that outsourcing in the asset management community is still in an early growth phase and that more and more managers will utilize firms like ours,” he said.

4118,"TAIPEI   - Taiwan’s Foxconn is exploring the sale of its new $8.8 billion display panel factory in China, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as demand for the product wanes amid an intensifying U.S.-China trade war. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, is in talks to appoint banks to find a buyer for its liquid crystal display (LCD) factory that is being built in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  A sale would come at a delicate time for Foxconn, which has extensive investments in China, a large roster of U.S. clients that includes Apple Inc, and is having to navigate a tricky path amid the protracted trade war between Washington and Beijing. It would mark one of its largest divestments from China. Foxconn’s discussions are at an initial stage and it has not yet come up with a price tag for the so-called Gen-10.5 facility specializing in large-screen LCDs, the sources said, adding a sale was not a surety. “It’s not an easy sale and it could take a while,” said one of the sources, citing tepid global demand for large-screen LCDs. Foxconn, in a written statement to Reuters, said: “As a matter of company policy, Foxconn does not respond to market rumors or speculation.” The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. U.S. President Donald Trump sharply raised the stakes in the bruising trade war with China and jolted global financial markets by vowing on Thursday to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from September 1. The trade war has disrupted technology global supply chains in a major way, forcing Foxconn to review its own. That and slowing demand for large-screen televisions and monitors had prompted Foxconn’s management to seek a buyer for the LCD plant, one of the sources familiar with the management’s thinking said. Questions were also being raised within Foxconn on the need for the Guangzhou project. “Existing plants are already not running at full capacity ... why need another one?,” the source said. The second source said the new factory would not go into production until early October, which makes it less appealing for buyers because of the additional risks as compared to an already operating plant. The Nikkei daily reported earlier this year that the company would delay most of its planned production in Guangzhou for a minimum of six months, but Foxconn said the project was on schedule. Dubbed the largest single investment ever in the southern city by Chinese media, Foxconn announced the Guangzhou plant in 2016, hoping to start operations by 2019 to meet an expected rise in demand for large-screen TVs and monitors in Asia in a challenge to top Chinese display maker BOE Technology Group. The project was mainly run by a joint venture between the Guangzhou government and Japan’s Sakai Display Products, an advanced panel factory owned by Foxconn founder Terry Gou and Japan’s Sharp Corp, Foxconn’s display unit.  The Japanese panel maker said on Thursday it would build a plant in Vietnam to make flat screens and electronic devices to guard against additional U.S. import tariffs on Chinese goods. The global display industry has been struggling with a supply glut and tumbling earnings due to moribund sales of televisions and smartphones, and the worsening trade dispute that could raise product prices and dampen consumer demand.  Sharp reported on Thursday a double-digit decline in profit for the quarter ended June due to sluggish tech demand. Taipei-based Foxconn said in April that it remained committed to building a display plant and tech research facilities in Wisconsin amid growing skepticism about the fate of the $10 billion project. Trump had cited Foxconn’s Wisconsin plans as proof he was reviving American manufacturing.  But Foxconn is already under the spotlight for having failed so far to meet job-creation targets in Wisconsin.  The company told Reuters earlier this year it was reconsidering plans to make advanced LCD panels at Wisconsin.

4143,"  - A Bayer executive on Thursday said the company was closely watching the plant-based meat market which has seen booming demand in recent years, adding that Bayer could potentially enter the market as an alternative protein source provider. “They are sourcing different types of crops and that also could create opportunity for us, being a company that is a plant-breeding company,” Bob Reiter, Bayer’s head of research and development at the company’s crop science division, said in reference to plant-based meat companies. Reiter made the remarks at an investor event in St. Louis, Missouri in response to a question by an analyst who wanted to know what impact the growth of plant-based meat substitutes would have on the company’s business. Meat alternatives have seen booming demand as consumers are looking to add more plant-based protein to their diet, amid growing concerns about health risks from eating meat, animal welfare and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming. Companies including Beyond Meat (BYND.O) and Impossible Foods, and even traditional meat producers including Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N), Maple Leaf Foods Inc (MFI.TO) and Perdue Farms are cashing in on the trend, selling sausages, burgers and imitation ground beef largely made from pea protein or soy. Analysts say there are no signs of the meat alternatives market slowing, with nearly 40% of consumers trying to add more plant-based protein to their diet, according to research group Mintel. Germany-based Bayer, which acquired seed and pesticides maker Monsanto in a $63 billion deal last year, is the world’s largest seed and pesticides company by sales, leading the market in corn, soybean and cereal seed sales. Reiter on Thursday said that in order for plant-based companies to produce at scale and succeed, they require efficient sources of amino acids and carbohydrates, which will bring them around to row crops that can be tilled and cultivated by machinery. “We’re not going to scale peas to get to 10% of the alternative meat market,” Reiter said. Beyond Meat’s latest burger is made from peas, brown rice, sunflower seeds and mung beans. Its chief executive, Ethan Brown, in the past said the company was exploring new protein sources, saying there are an “almost endless number of crops you can pull from.” ",Bayer sees potential future business in plant-based meat market,"August 1, 2019 /  9:34 PM ", a bayer executive on thursday said the company was closely watching the plant based meat market which has seen booming demand in recent years adding that bayer could potentially enter the market as an alternative protein source provider they are sourcing different types of crops and that also could create opportunity for us being a company that is a plant breeding company bob reiter bayer s head of research and development at the company s crop science division said in reference to plant based meat companies reiter made the remarks at an investor event in st louis missouri in response to a question by an analyst who wanted to know what impact the growth of plant based meat substitutes would have on the company s business meat alternatives have seen booming demand as consumers are looking to add more plant based protein to their diet amid growing concerns about health risks from eating meat animal welfare and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming companies including beyond meat bynd o and impossible foods and even traditional meat producers including tyson foods inc tsn n maple leaf foods inc mfi to and perdue farms are cashing in on the trend selling sausages burgers and imitation ground beef largely made from pea protein or soy analysts say there are no signs of the meat alternatives market slowing with nearly  of consumers trying to add more plant based protein to their diet according to research group mintel germany based bayer which acquired seed and pesticides maker monsanto in a  billion deal last year is the world s largest seed and pesticides company by sales leading the market in corn soybean and cereal seed sales reiter on thursday said that in order for plant based companies to produce at scale and succeed they require efficient sources of amino acids and carbohydrates which will bring them around to row crops that can be tilled and cultivated by machinery we re not going to scale peas to get to  of the alternative meat market reiter said beyond meat s latest burger is made from peas brown rice sunflower seeds and mung beans its chief executive ethan brown in the past said the company was exploring new protein sources saying there are an almost endless number of crops you can pull from ,Boeing Crisis,0.2546977400779724

It was not immediately clear why the sentencing hearing was rescheduled from March 8.  Manafort was convicted in August of eight charges of bank and tax fraud as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Manafort, 69, also pleaded guilty in a federal court in Washington, D.C. last September to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Manafort had struck a deal to cooperate with the special counsel’s office, but in November, Mueller’s team accused Manafort of violating the agreement. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson agreed, ruling Manafort had breached the deal.  Manafort faces up to 25 years of prison in the Virginia case and 10 years of prison for the Washington charges.

4243,"NEW YORK   - Oil prices rose for a fifth day on Wednesday following a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories and after the Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. The front-month Brent crude LCOc1 futures contract, which expired Wednesday, rose 45 cents to settle at $65.17 a barrel. Brent posted a monthly decline of 2.1%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures gained 53 cents to settle at $58.58 a barrel, and inched up 0.2% in July. U.S. crude stockpiles USOILC=ECI fell for a seventh straight week, slumping 8.5 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, far exceeding analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 2.6 million barrels.  At 436.5 million barrels, U.S. crude inventories, not including strategic oil reserves, were at the five year average for this time of year, the EIA said. The drawdown came even as offshore production restarted as the effects of Hurricane Barry waned, with output rebounding to 12.2 million barrels per day, near recent levels, from 11.3 million bpd a week earlier. Gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI fell 1.8 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI dipped by 894,000 barrels. “These are bullish numbers across the board. The renewed large draw in crude oil is remarkable as U.S. oil production bounced back significantly after (Hurricane Barry),” said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank. In a separate report, the EIA said U.S. crude oil output in May slipped from a monthly record high, falling 26,000 bpd to 12.11 million bpd. After its two-day policy meeting, the U.S. Fed cut interest rates, citing concerns about the global economy and muted U.S. inflation. The central bank signaled a readiness to lower borrowing costs further if needed. The Fed said the rate cut should help return inflation to its 2% target but that uncertainties about that outlook remain.

4471,"WASHINGTON/CHICAGO   - The U.S. government will pay American farmers hurt by the trade war with China between $15 and $150 per acre in an aid package totaling $16 billion, officials said on Thursday, with farmers in the South poised to see higher rates than in the Midwest.  The assistance, starting in mid-to-late August, follows Republican President Donald Trump’s $12 billion package last year that was aimed at making up for lower farm good prices and lost sales.  U.S. farmers, a key Trump constituency, have been among the hardest hit in the year-long trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Shipments of soybeans, the most valuable U.S. farm export, to top buyer China sank to a 16-year low in 2018.  Democrats criticized the move, saying farmers needed fair trade instead of a bailout. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue argued that U.S. farmers were disproportionately hurt by the trade dispute and that the new round of aid was justified. “President Trump has a great affection for America’s farmers and ranchers and it’s pretty evident in this program,” Perdue said. “He knows that they are fighting the fight and they are on the front line.” In the new aid package, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would pay farmers according to geographic location rather than by crop - a change from last year.  “There were a number of factors from last year’s programs that we wanted to correct,” USDA Chief Economist Rob Johansson said in a call with reporters.  Farmers in the cotton-growing Mississippi Delta states stand to be the greatest beneficiaries of the program, according to a Reuters analysis of the payment rates posted online.     The average county payment rate is about $95 per acre in Alabama, $87 in Mississippi and $70 in Louisiana. Payment rates were lower in the Midwest, with a $69-per-acre county average in Illinois, the country’s top soybean producer, and a $66 average in Iowa, the top corn- and hog-producing state. The program covers 29 commodity crops, including soybeans, corn, wheat, sorghum and upland cotton. It also covers dairy and hog farmers, as well as farms that grow 10 specialty crops - including almonds, pistachios, walnuts, cranberries and fresh sweet cherries. Johansson said the minimum and maximum payment rates were based on an analysis of 10 years of trade data and the amount countries with retaliatory tariffs, including China and India, could have imported. “These payments are enough to make a difference, kind of get us to the harvest,” said Tim Bardole, an Iowa corn and soybean farmer.   To be eligible for payments, crops must be planted by Aug. 1, 2019, the USDA said. The number of farm acres that could not be planted was at a historic level this year because of Midwest flooding, officials said, further straining the farm economy.  NOT A LONG-TERM SOLUTION  While farm and industry groups welcomed the support, they continued to push for the Trump administration to end trade fights and strike deals with top export markets. Such federal financial support, the Illinois Farm Bureau said in a statement, “is not a long-term solution.” The National Cotton Council said there had been significant cancellations and deferrals of U.S. cotton sales to China over the past year.  Trade talks between China and the United States broke down in May after getting close to a potential agreement and were only revived in a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last month. Next week, top U.S. and Chinese negotiators will be meeting face-to-face for the first time since then. Promises of large agricultural purchases by China have been a key element of a potential deal, but Washington has complained that Beijing has not delivered on those fully. Perdue said that of the 20 million tonnes of soybeans China committed to buy, 13.6 million tonnes had been purchased so far. USDA officials said sign-ups for the payments would begin on Monday and last until Dec. 6. Additional payments are scheduled for November and January but will depend on whether trade disputes are still ongoing.  Payments are capped at $500,000 per person or legal entity.

4476,"  - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday reported its first profit miss in two years and said income would slump in the current quarter, as the online retailer ramps up spending on one-day delivery to spark sales growth. The company also said its investment in faster shipping was starting to pay off, with revenue rising 20% to $63.4 billion in the second quarter ended in June. That topped analysts’ estimates and the 17% rate of growth that Amazon posted in April. Shares fell more than 1% in after-hours trade. Seattle-based Amazon has drawn more than 100 million paid subscribers to its loyalty club Prime by releasing original TV shows, equipping more gadgets with its voice assistant Alexa and offering quick shipping for countless goods, including groceries from its subsidiary Whole Foods Market. Now, it is investing heavily to halve delivery times to one day for Prime members, to stay ahead of rivals such as Walmart Inc (WMT.N) that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. So far Amazon has expanded one-day delivery to more than 10 million items, a fraction of the 100 million-plus goods it offers in two days in the United States. The cost slightly exceeded the $800 million Amazon had forecast it would spend on the initiative in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2y7OGJN)   “Right now we are seeing an increasing and ramping cost penalty, and that’s what’s built into the Q3 guidance,” Olsavsky said, adding that most of the work to roll out single-day delivery outside the United States lies ahead of the company. Amazon’s profit inched up to $2.6 billion in the quarter, short of $2.8 billion that analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Operating expenses had jumped about 21%. The money Amazon is sinking into delivery shows how the world’s largest online retailer is not immune to competition, said Neil Saunders, managing director at research firm GlobalData. “It is a necessary evil,” Saunders said. “Amazon exists in a world where a lot of retailers have the advantage of allowing customers to pick things up the same day in stores,” with far larger brick-and-mortar footprints than Amazon can boast. Amazon’s slowing revenue growth has in part reflected the evolving nature of its business. The company is gradually moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it collects lucrative fees for helping other merchants on its site ship and advertise their products. Revenue from seller services grew 23% to $12.0 billion in the second quarter, while ad and other sales increased 37% to $3.0 billion. Though profitable, the dual retail and marketplace model has drawn scrutiny. Earlier this month, the European Commission launched an antitrust probe into whether Amazon’s use of other merchants’ data offered an unfair advantage to its retail unit, which has made private-label versions of popular products. The U.S. Justice Department also said Tuesday it would look into whether Big Tech engaged in any anticompetitive practices, including in online retail. Olsavsky declined to discuss the matter. At the same time, sales growth for Amazon’s cloud unit fell below 40% for the first time in years. The unit, which handles data storage and computing operations for other enterprises, raked in $8.4 billion in revenue in the second quarter, or 37% more than the year prior. Nascent competitor Google (GOOGL.O) on Thursday reported a doubling of cloud revenue to about $2 billion, from its last disclosure of $1 billion at the end of 2017.  CFO Olsavsky said Amazon Web Services’ revenue was strong, though sales cycles fluctuate depending on the timing of customers’ migration to the cloud. “We’re growing faster than anyone” on a dollar basis, he said. Still, that is not sufficient to cover the stepped-up investments that Amazon has planned for this year. It now is gearing up for the winter holiday shopping season. It is expanding a variety of its U.S. services globally. And it has beefed up AWS sales staff and overall marketing, which included a live-streamed concert with pop star Taylor Swift to promote its summer “Prime Day” sale. These bets and others further afield, like its recent investments in electric and self-driving car companies, show how Amazon has been happy to forgo short-term income for long-term gains. The company for years had been known for rollercoaster profits. Overall for the third quarter, Amazon said it expects operating income between $2.1 billion and $3.1 billion, versus $3.7 billion the year prior. Analysts were expecting $4.4 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.

4522,"HAMPTON, N.H.   - U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown sought advice earlier this year from former President Barack Obama about running a 2020 presidential bid, the Democrat told voters on Friday at an event in New Hampshire. “I called the president about a month ago and just talked to him about his thoughts of candidacy,” Brown, 66, said.  Brown, who is weighing whether to mount a campaign for his party’s nomination to challenge President Donald Trump, said he did not ask the former president whether he should launch a campaign. But Obama spoke about what it was like to be a candidate. “I think he encourages anyone who talks to him - so in no way am I implying pushing me, pulling me, stopping me or encouraging me,” Brown told Reuters after the Hampton, New Hampshire event. “It was a good talk; he was generous with his time.” The field of Democratic hopefuls is rapidly expanding. As many as two dozen Democrats could ultimately launch campaigns, a race that is expected to pit the liberal wing of the party against moderates. Brown is spending the weekend in New Hampshire, a state that holds the second presidential primary contest in 2020 and plays an outsized role in picking the nominee. While he has not launched a presidential campaign, Brown has branded his visit to key political states the “Dignity of Work” tour. He is focusing on issues like wages, union organization and paid family leave.  As a senator from the key political state of Ohio, Brown is seen as a potentially formidable opponent to Trump. Brown was reelected in 2018 with a larger percentage than Trump received there in 2016, thanks to his ability to connect with middle-class voters. Brown said he thinks he can be both progressive and willing to connect with working voters.  “You either choose to talk to the progressive base or you talk to working families and listen to issues that matter to them, but I don’t think it’s a choice. I think you can do both,” he said.

4607,"  - Consumers affected by the massive Equifax Inc data breach in 2017 will not reap any windfalls from the credit reporting company’s $700 million U.S. settlement announced on Monday, but may face a cumbersome process to get compensation. Federal Trade Commission officials said those among the 147 million consumers who had to spend time or money to protect their information or fight identity theft after the September 2017 data breach could be entitled to compensation. Consumers can file documents detailing what sort of information might have been stolen or harmed by identity theft. They need not prove the theft occurred during the Equifax hack, but simply show their identities were stolen after the breach, officials added. Consumers can also seek repayment for time spent responding to the Equifax breach, at $25 per hour for up to 20 hours. Documentation must be provided, but consumers can “self-certify” up to 10 hours. Any time spent addressing identity theft or fraud issues after the breach, seeking credit monitoring, or freezing credit reports can be reimbursed. Equifax will cover the cost of four years of credit monitoring from all three credit bureaus, including Experian Plc and TransUnion , and up to $1 million in identity theft protection. After that, Equifax will provide another six years of credit monitoring.  Anyone who was a minor at the time of the breach is eligible for 18 years of free credit monitoring.  “That is a significant benefit,” said Norman Siegel of Kansas City’s Stueve Siegel, an attorney and chairman of the settlement committee who led the negotiations on behalf of consumers in class-action lawsuits. “We have also tried to make this process as simple as possible.” The settlement is subject to court approval.

4609,"WASHINGTON   - Senior U.S. and Chinese officials are poised to start another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to push for a deal to protect American intellectual property and avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, two people familiar with the plans said on Tuesday. The sources said that the U.S. delegation would begin arriving in Beijing over the weekend, following a break this week for Chinese New Year. U.S. President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union address on Tuesday that any new trade deal with China “must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit and protect American jobs.” The new round of talks in Beijing, to be led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal, citing an unidentified senior administration official. A USTR spokeswoman said the agency had no new announcements to make on the issue. A Treasury Department spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. The U.S. president has vowed to increase U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent currently if the two sides cannot reach a deal by 12:01 a.m. (0501 GMT) on March 2. Bilateral talks have centered on addressing U.S. demands for deep structural changes to China’s economic and trade policies, including new protections for U.S. intellectual property, ending forced technology transfers, reining in China’s subsidies for state industries and increasing Chinese purchases of U.S. farm, energy and manufactured products. The Journal said that China has agreed to widen the trade discussions to include cyber hacking. “We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end,” Trump said in his speech.   Trump said last week in Washington that he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in coming weeks to try to seal a comprehensive deal, possibly as part of a trip to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That summit will take place Feb. 27 and 28 in Vietnam, Trump said on Tuesday.

4668,"  - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced on Monday that Equifax Inc. (EFX.N) will pay up to $700 million for a data breach that exposed millions of consumers’ personal information. The following are seven of the largest data breach settlements in recent years. 1) Equifax Following its 2017 data breach, Equifax will pay up to $700 million to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and nearly all U.S. states and territories. That includes a $175 million fine to the states and $100 million to the CFPB. It will also establish a $300 million restitution fund for harmed consumers. That amount could grow to $425 million depending on how many consumers act on it. 2) Uber In 2018, ride-hailing app Uber (UBER.N) reached a $148 million settlement with 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., for failing to disclose a massive data breach in 2016. It exposed personal data from 57 million user accounts.  3) Target Retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) agreed in 2017 to pay $18.5 million to 47 U.S. states and the District of Columbia for the company’s massive 2013 data breach. Target reported that hackers stole data from up to 40 million credit and debit cards from shoppers who visited its stores in the 2013 holiday season. 4) Anthem  Anthem, Inc. (ANTM.N) agreed to pay $16 million to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Office for Civil Rights in 2018 to settle potential violations of HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy and Security Rules, an HHS statement said. A series of cyberattacks exposed the health information of almost 79 million people. 5) Premera  Earlier this month, health insurance company Premera Blue Cross agreed to pay $10 million to 30 U.S. states for allegedly failing to secure consumer data. A hacker had access to its network of private health information and Social Security numbers from May 2014 to March 2015, a statement from the Washington state attorney general said.  6) Nationwide Mutual Insurance company Nationwide Mutual agreed in 2017 to pay $5.5 million to 33 U.S. states for a 2012 data breach. The attorneys general alleged that the company failed to apply a critical security patch and resulted in the loss of the personal information of over one million consumers.  7) Ashley Madison Adultery website Ashley Madison’s parent company Ruby Corp agreed in 2016 to pay $1.6 million to settle FTC and state charges that it failed to protect 36 million users’ account and profile information in a July 2015 data breach. In a separate 2017 settlement, the company agreed to pay $11.2 million in a class-action settlement, which said users with valid claims could recoup up to $3,500 depending on their losses from the breach.

4802,"NEW YORK   - A gauge of global equities retreated for a second straight session and U.S. Treasury yields fell as simmering trade concerns gained steam and the pace of the U.S. corporate earnings season picked up.  On Wall Street, CSX Corp was one of the biggest drags on the benchmark S&P 500 index. The railroad tumbled 10.27% after it reported quarterly earnings that missed expectations and cut its full-year revenue forecast on weakness in its trade-related intermodal business. Fellow railroad Union Pacific lost 6.34% while Berkshire Hathaway, which owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, saw its Class B shares fall 2.55%. The results come after U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his threat to tax another $325 billion of Chinese goods on Tuesday, which weighed on stocks. In addition, the U.S. could also face Chinese sanctions, following a World Trade Organization ruling on Tuesday, further complicating trade talks between the two countries. “None of the underlying issues have really been put to bed,” said Ed Campbell, portfolio manager and managing director at QMA in Newark, New Jersey, regarding trade concerns. “It’s a risk factor that could come back at any time.” U.S. stocks have also eased over the past two sessions in part due to a sluggish start to the quarterly earnings season. Those declines also follow a rally that sent key stock averages to record peaks on expectations for lower U.S. rates.  Big banks such as Citi, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have recorded drops in net interest margins, a sign low interest rates are hurting their bottomlines. Bank of America shares were up 0.7% after it reported results on Wednesday but lowered its annual net interest income guidance. While it is still early in what is expected to be a lackluster reporting season, the earnings growth rate for the second quarter now stands at 0.4%, according to Refinitiv data. Expectations were recently calling for a quarterly decline in S&P 500 results.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 115.64 points, or 0.42%, to 27,219.99, the S&P 500 lost 19.63 points, or 0.65%, to 2,984.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 37.59 points, or 0.46%, to 8,185.21. European shares closed lower as weakness in Swedish shares on some disappointing quarterly results and a decline in shares of oil majors helped snap a three-day winning streak. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.37% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.45%. Along with the trade concerns, U.S. Treasury yields moved lower after data showed weakness in the housing market for a second straight month, even as mortgage rates have declined.  “The housing starts were a little weaker but the building permits were definitely significantly weaker,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rates strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.

4872,"WASHINGTON   - The United States has offered to hold arm control talks with Russia during a United Nations meeting in Beijing next week that almost certainly would include a feud over a Cold War-era treaty, a senior State Department official said on Thursday. Under Secretary of State Andrea Thompson reiterated that the Trump administration will “suspend our obligations” under the disputed pact if Russia fails to return to compliance by Feb. 2. But the move is “reversible” and Washington has made no final decision on announcing a full U.S. withdrawal, she said. “I’m not particularly optimistic” that Russia will return to compliance, she told reporters at a breakfast. The dispute over the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty has added to the gravest U.S.-Russia tensions since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Some experts fear that its demise could undermine other arms control agreements and speed an erosion of the global system designed to block the spread of nuclear arms. Washington charges that Russia has violated the INF Treaty by deploying the ground-launched Novator 9M729 nuclear-capable cruise missile. The weapon exceeds the pact’s range limit of 500-5,000 km (310-3,106 miles) and targets European allies, Washington contends. To return to compliance with the treaty, Russia must destroy the missiles, three battalions of which have been deployed, Thompson said. Russia rejects the U.S. allegations, and says the missile, designated the SSC-8 by NATO, complies with the pact. It accuses the United States of inventing a false pretext to leave an accord it wants to exit anyway to develop its own new missiles. Thompson said that talks she held last week in Geneva with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov made no headway toward resolving the dispute. But, she added, she has offered to discuss with Ryabkov arms control issues that almost certainly would include the feud on the sidelines of a U.N. Security Council meeting on nonproliferation next week in Beijing. “I’ve told the deputy foreign minister if and when it’s appropriate and they have tangible next steps, that I’m willing to talk,” Thompson said. “But to come to the table and hear the same story line from the past five years isn’t a productive use of our time.” Thompson rejected the first unveiling in Moscow of the Novator for diplomats and journalists on Wednesday as proof that it complies with the INF Treaty. “A static display of a missile cannot tell you how far a missile flies,” she said. The United States has presented Russia “time after time after time” with data showing that the missile flew more than the treaty’s proscribed 500-km range during one of the tests conducted between 2008 and 2013, she said. It also has presented Moscow with a plan for the “verifiable” destruction of the missile systems. Moscow has countered with its own unacceptable proposal for demonstrating the missile, she said. “They would have controlled the environment,” she said on the Russian plan. “When you go and select the missile and you select the fuel and you control all of those parameters, characteristics, you are controlling the outcome of the test.” (This story corrects paragraph 13 to show missile test exceeded 500 km, and paragraph 14 to show U.S. plan is for destruction of missiles, not test) ",U.S. has offered to hold arms control talks with Russia: official,"January 24, 2019 /  2:13 PM ",washington the united states has offered to hold arm control talks with russia during a united nations meeting in beijing next week that almost certainly would include a feud over a cold war era treaty a senior state department official said on thursday under secretary of state andrea thompson reiterated that the trump administration will suspend our obligations under the disputed pact if russia fails to return to compliance by feb  but the move is reversible and washington has made no final decision on announcing a full u s withdrawal she said i m not particularly optimistic that russia will return to compliance she told reporters at a breakfast the dispute over the  intermediate range nuclear forces inf treaty has added to the gravest u s russia tensions since the end of the cold war in  some experts fear that its demise could undermine other arms control agreements and speed an erosion of the global system designed to block the spread of nuclear arms washington charges that russia has violated the inf treaty by deploying the ground launched novator m nuclear capable cruise missile the weapon exceeds the pact s range limit of    km    miles and targets european allies washington contends to return to compliance with the treaty russia must destroy the missiles three battalions of which have been deployed thompson said russia rejects the u s allegations and says the missile designated the ssc  by nato complies with the pact it accuses the united states of inventing a false pretext to leave an accord it wants to exit anyway to develop its own new missiles thompson said that talks she held last week in geneva with russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov made no headway toward resolving the dispute but she added she has offered to discuss with ryabkov arms control issues that almost certainly would include the feud on the sidelines of a u n security council meeting on nonproliferation next week in beijing i ve told the deputy foreign minister if and when it s appropriate and they have tangible next steps that i m willing to talk thompson said but to come to the table and hear the same story line from the past five years isn t a productive use of our time thompson rejected the first unveiling in moscow of the novator for diplomats and journalists on wednesday as proof that it complies with the inf treaty a static display of a missile cannot tell you how far a missile flies she said the united states has presented russia time after time after time with data showing that the missile flew more than the treaty s proscribed  km range during one of the tests conducted between  and  she said it also has presented moscow with a plan for the verifiable destruction of the missile systems moscow has countered with its own unacceptable proposal for demonstrating the missile she said they would have controlled the environment she said on the russian plan when you go and select the missile and you select the fuel and you control all of those parameters characteristics you are controlling the outcome of the test this story corrects paragraph  to show missile test exceeded  km and paragraph  to show u s plan is for destruction of missiles not test ,Boeing Crisis,0.2179737091064453

4916,"NEW YORK   - Oil prices sank about 1% on Monday on signs that the impact of a tropical storm on U.S. Gulf Coast production and refining would be short-lived, while Chinese economic data dimmed the crude demand outlook. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled at $66.48 a barrel, losing 24 cents, while U.S. crude CLc1 settled at $59.58 a barrel, shedding 63 cents, or 1.1%.  Both contracts last week made their biggest weekly gains in three weeks on cuts in U.S. oil inventories and diplomatic tensions in the Middle East.  “Crude prices softened as oil companies returned workers to offshore platforms as the effects of (the storm) have subsided,” said Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA in New York. “With no major damage done oil output will start coming back online and we could see crude prices pare back some of last week’s gains.” One U.S. Gulf Coast refinery was restarting after shutting under threats of Tropical Storm Barry, while other refineries in the path of the storm continued to operate. U.S. offshore oil producers restarted 4% of the production shut by Barry last week, according to a report on Monday by the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). [nL2N24G0WF] Energy companies had slashed offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude output by 73%, or 1.4 million bpd. Chinese data showed industrial output and retail data beat expectations, but overall figures showed the country’s slowest quarterly economic growth in decades. China’s oil throughput rose to a record 13.07 million barrels per day in June, up 7.7% from a year earlier, following the start-up of two new large refineries, official data showed. Still, economic growth of just 6.2% in the second quarter of 2019 - the weakest in 27 years - highlighted the impact of trade tensions with Washington and raised the possibility that more incentives might be needed to jump-start the economy. “The basic message is that the second half of this year will see some depletion in global oil inventories but this will be followed by a dismal 2020, especially the first six months of next year,” PVM analyst Tamas Varga said. Easing tensions between the West and the Middle East also weighed on oil futures. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech on Sunday that Iran was ready to hold talks with the United States if Washington lifted sanctions and returned to the 2015 nuclear deal it quit last year. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there remained a “small window” of time to save the Iran nuclear deal as Tehran signaled it would ramp up its nuclear program.

5107,"STOCKHOLM   - Swedish truckmaker AB Volvo’s first commercial autonomous truck deal shows how it is bundling services to generate revenue from a technology that is years away from wide deployment. Driverless transportation has been hailed as a transformative revenue opportunity, with the Boston Consulting Group expecting connected high-tech vehicles to generate about $150 billion of new profits for the auto sector by 2035. But regulatory, technological and infrastructure roadblocks stand in the way of deploying fully autonomous vehicles on public roads and the journey is proving long and costly. Volvo, the world’s second biggest truckmaker behind Daimler, has decided for now to only deploy driverless trucks in pilots for customers, aiming to perform specific jobs on a limited, repetitive and controlled route, often on enclosed customer sites. “There’s a lot of uncertainties and that’s why we believe the right way to develop autonomous is with commercial pilots where we partner up with customers, go for real implementations and learn from that,” Sasko Cuklev, Volvo Trucks’ autonomous solutions director, told Reuters in an interview. The truck maker said last month that its first commercial autonomous transport package will involve seven trucks transporting limestone for Norway’s Broennoey Kalk AS from a mine to a nearby port starting this winter.     “We are in the early stages when it comes to implementing autonomous solutions, so we’re trying to learn and we’re open to different setups. But in general it is more and more talk about services and solutions that is coming into play,” Cuklev said. The deal with Broennoey bundles together the provision of the autonomous trucks with a virtual driver, control tower system, maintenance, repair and insurance, with Volvo paid per tonne transported.  “We see autonomous as more of a complement to today’s business and limited to dedicated specific applications where it really makes sense,” Cuklev said.       He said Volvo was targeting autonomous vehicles for mining operations and hub-to-hub transport on a highway road or regional hauling over shorter distances such as between ports and warehouses using its cabinless truck Vera. Volvo’s Vera and some other commercial vehicles from rivals are experimenting with using self-driving trucks on public roads, often limiting speeds, picking less busy industrial roads or having people in the cabin in case the technology fails. Nvidia-backed startup TuSimple said in May that it would deploy its self-driving trucks to haul mail between U.S. Postal Service facilities in Phoenix and Dallas in the southwestern United States.  Sweden’s Einride is testing its cabinless trucks to haul freight between a warehouse and a terminal on public roads in Sweden. Carmakers BMW and Daimler this month teamed up to spread the costs of developing automated driving technology as cooperation within the industry becomes more widespread.  Volkswagen and Ford are in the final stage of talks on a strategic alliance to jointly develop self-driving and electric cars, while Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles attempted and failed to merge.  Automakers’ investment in autonomous transportation comes as traditional sales are dented by the economic uncertainty caused by the U.S.-China trade war, with analysts worried that truck cycles might have peaked and margins might fall. Volvo has forecast lower demand in China and Europe this year and its trucks order intake has fallen for two consecutive quarters this year, missing forecasts.  Volvo, which produces trucks under the Mack, Renault and UD Trucks brands, is facing a push to cooperate with others from China’s Geely [GEELY.UL], which became a top shareholder in both Volvo and its main rival Daimler last year. Cuklev declined to comment on the subject, but highlighted the example of Volvo’s recent tie-up with Nvidia to develop artificial intelligence for self-driving trucks as the type of cooperation that Volvo was keen on. “When it comes to automation we’re open to looking into different partnerships in the entire autonomous area,” Cuklev said.

5170,"HONG KONG/LONDON/NEW YORK   - Summoned by HR to be handed a Deutsche Bank envelope, many of its staff across the world then left their desks for the last time on Monday, shown the door by their German employer within hours of a restructuring announcement.  Deutsche Bank confirmed on Sunday that it was closing huge parts of its trading businesses, with staff in its equities division in Sydney and Hong Kong among the first to be told their roles would go. “If you have a job for me, please let me know,” said a banker leaving the Hong Kong office on Monday. Staff leaving in Hong Kong were holding envelopes with the bank’s logo. Three employees took a picture of themselves beside a Deutsche Bank sign outside, hugged and then hailed a taxi. “They give you this packet and you are out of the building,” said one equities trader.  “The equities market is not that great so I may not find a similar job, but I have to deal with it,” said another.  At the bank’s Wall Street office, staff impacted by the cuts were summoned to the cafeteria to learn of their fate. A notice inside the building’s lobby told staff the cafeteria would be closed until 11.30 a.m. EST.  Hundreds of staff were informed during the meetings that their positions were being cut, sources within the bank told Reuters. They also received details of their redundancy packages. One source said staff could be seen saying their goodbyes to colleagues upon leaving the cafeteria.  Speaking outside the bank’s office, one employee told Reuters the cuts had been anticipated for weeks. “People have been planning their next moves but it’s a tough  market,” the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Another employee, who asked not to be named, said the bank held a short meeting in its auditorium at 9.30 a.m. EST to inform staff of the cutbacks. He said he was later handed an envelope informing him of his redundancy. The staffer said he and his colleagues had known the impending cuts were likely for the past couple of weeks. Deutsche Bank plans to close all of its equity trading business and cut some parts of its fixed income operations, in an overhaul expected to lead to 18,000 job cuts. Some of those roles will be cut immediately, while some staff will be kept on for longer while they help wind down operations.  A few hours after the Hong Kong staff left, workers were seen leaving Deutsche Bank’s office in the City of London, which along with New York is expected to bear the brunt of the cuts, carrying similar envelopes. “I was terminated this morning, there was a very quick meeting and that was it,” said one IT worker, who left while Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing was inside the building doing a call with the media.  Few staff wanted to speak outside the bank’s London office, but trade was picking up at the nearby Balls Brothers pub around lunchtime.  “I got laid off, where else would I go,” said a man who had just lost his job in equity sales.  FAR-FLUNG CUTS The layoffs were going beyond the major financial centers. A Deutsche Bank employee in Bengaluru told Reuters that he and several colleagues were told first thing that their jobs were going.  “We were informed that our jobs have become redundant and handed over our letters and given approximately a month’s salary,” he said.  “The mood is pretty hopeless right now, especially (among)people who are single-earners or have big financial burdens such as loans to pay,” he added.  Deutsche spokespeople in Hong Kong and London declined to comment on specific details about the number of departures, but said they would try to support people being made redundant.   For those losing their jobs in equities, finding a new one could prove difficult, with the industry still grappling with higher costs from new European regulations on share trading.  “The job market in equities is going to be very tough,” said George Kuznetsov head of research and analytics at Coalition, which analyses the investment banking industry.  “Our expectations if for equities sales and trading revenues falling 7-8% this year and that of course is going to put a lot of halts into the hiring across most of the brokers”.    For Deutsche Bank staff whose jobs are safe for now, there was some relief, but also big doubts about the future.  “The biggest question for us is where do we go from here if we don’t offer the whole suite of  products? Will clients stick with us or is the game over?” said a Singapore banker who remains in his job.

5303,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. trade deficit jumped in May and trade tensions between the United States and China helped drive activity in the services sector to a two-year low in June, further signs that economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter. The economy’s dimming outlook was also underscored by other data on Wednesday showing private employers adding far fewer-than-expected jobs to their payrolls last month.  New orders for manufactured goods dropped in May for a second straight month. The reports followed recent weak housing and business investment data, as well as moderate consumer spending. Business and consumer confidence have dipped. The slowdown in activity as last year’s massive stimulus from tax cuts and more government spending fades could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this month.  The U.S. central bank last month signaled it could ease monetary policy as early as its July 30-31 meeting, citing rising risks to the economy from the trade war between Washington and Beijing, and low inflation. The International Monetary Fund has lowered global growth estimates because of reduced trade flows as a result of the trade fights. “One wonders how long Washington will continue to claim they are helping the U.S. economy,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “One of the factors behind the economy’s fall in the Great Depression was protectionism and trade wars, and it will be a miracle if the world economy can avoid another downturn this time.” The trade deficit rose 8.4% to $55.5 billion as a surge in imports overshadowed a broad increase in exports, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap widening to $54.0 billion in May. The goods trade deficit with China, a focus of President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda, increased 12.2% to $30.2 billion. Trump imposed additional import tariffs on Chinese goods, after a breakdown in negotiations, prompting Beijing to retaliate. Economists say the expectation of additional duties likely boosted imports from China, which jumped 12.8% in May.  Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week agreed to a trade truce and a return to talks. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Tuesday talks were heading in the right direction, but it would take time to get the right deal made. The U.S.-China trade tensions have caused wild swings in the trade deficit, with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants. Trump on Wednesday accused China and Europe of “playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA.”  “We still think it is slightly more likely than not that the trade dispute with China will ultimately escalate further,” said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London. “Trade is likely to remain a modest drag on growth over the second half of this year, which we expect to compound a sharp slowdown in domestic demand growth.” The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies in thin U.S. trade ahead of Thursday's Independence Day holiday. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 .SPX index hitting a record high on expectations of a rate cut. U.S. Treasury prices also were higher. In May, goods imports increased 4.0% to $217.0 billion. Apart from drawing more imports from China, the United States imported record amounts from the European Union, Mexico and Canada in May. The increase in imports was broad-based, with those of motor vehicle and parts soaring to an all-time high.  Petroleum imports rose and crude oil was more expensive, helping to inflate the import bill in May.  Goods exports increased 2.8% to $140.8 billion. Exports advanced across all sectors, including passenger aircraft despite Boeing (BA.N) in March suspending deliveries of its fastest-selling MAX 737 jetliner. The aircraft was grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes in five months.  When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit increased $4.8 billion to $87.0 billion in May, suggesting trade could be a drag on second-quarter gross domestic product.  Trade contributed 0.94 percentage point to the economy’s 3.1% annualized growth pace in the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.3% rate in the April-June quarter. Anxiety over trade is spilling over from manufacturing to the services industries. In a third report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 55.1 in June, the lowest reading since July 2017, from 56.9 in May.  A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. The ISM said “a degree of uncertainty exists due to trade and tariffs.”  The decrease in services industry activity reflected a decline in the new orders measure, which dropped to the lowest level since December 2017. A gauge of services employment also fell. “The slowing trend evident across categories raises concern that a slowing trend most evident in manufacturing is also becoming more apparent in the broader economy,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York. “This should leave the Fed right on the precipice of providing some ‘insurance’ by cutting rates at the July meeting.” The slowdown in employment was mirrored by the ADP National Employment Report showing private payrolls increased by 102,000 jobs in June from 41,000 in May, but below market expectations for a gain of 140,000. That suggests a moderate rebound in the private payrolls component of the government’s closely followed employment report.  The June employment report will be released on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters are looking for nonfarm employment to have increased by 160,000 jobs after rising by only 75,000 in May. The unemployment rate is expected to have held near a 50-year low of 3.6% in June.  Still, layoffs remain low.

5305,"NEW YORK   - Record low bond yields in Europe and the expectation of further interest rate cuts by central banks worldwide helped push global stock market indices higher Wednesday as the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 hit another record high.  European Union leaders’ nomination of Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, to replace Mario Draghi as president of the European Central Bank reinforced expectations of more monetary policy easing if it is needed. Traders greeted the decision by sinking German 10-year Bund yields to record lows of minus 39 basis points, lowering Italian two-year yields back into negative territory for first time in over a year and lifting stocks worldwide.  The yield on 10-year UK gilts fell 4 basis points to 0.687%, which left it below the Bank of England’s main policy rate for the first time in a decade. U.S. Treasury yields slumped to their lowest since late 2016.  “We have already seen some weak data in recent weeks, so that is the backdrop,” said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank. “And now have Christine Lagarde as the likely successor of Mr Draghi at the ECB, which for the market says that the dovish policies will continue.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 179.32 points, or 0.67%, to 26,966, the S&P 500 gained 22.81 points, or 0.77%, to 2,995.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 61.14 points, or 0.75%, to 8,170.23. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.55%, following broad equity gains in Europe.  The U.S. market closed early due to the Fourth of July holiday and will reopen Friday, when the closely-watched monthly jobs report will provide one of the most important data points before the Federal Reserve holds its next meeting at the end of the month.  Investors continued to seek out the safe haven of bonds due to concerns of slowing global growth after data showed Britain’s economy apparently shrank in the second quarter. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.9532%, from 1.977% late on Tuesday. “The latest downturn has followed a gradual deterioration in demand over the past year as Brexit-related uncertainty has increasingly exacerbated the impact of a broader global economic slowdown,” Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said of the Britain reading. In the currency markets, the pound flirted with two-week lows and stood at $1.2568, on course for its fifth drop in the past six sessions. Oil prices also rose after data showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week.

5390,"WASHINGTON   - Democrats will hold 12 televised debates during the 2020 U.S. presidential race, an increase from four years ago, to help voters sort through what is expected to be a crowded field of candidates seeking to take on President Donald Trump. The debates will begin in June 2019 and continue through the following April, a period in which the field will likely narrow to a handful of candidates as nominating contests are held in a bevy of states.   The announcement by the Democratic National Committee on Thursday marks a departure from the 2016 race, when the party scheduled just six debates. That was criticized by supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, who felt the compact schedule handed an advantage to the front-runner, Hillary Clinton. Ultimately, nine debates were held. In the 2020 contest, two dozen Democrats or more could jump into the race. Many are expected to announce their intentions in early 2019. There is no established favorite as yet, but some of those said to be considering campaigns include former Vice President Joe Biden; U.S. Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Sherrod Brown and Cory Booker; and current and former mayors Eric Garcetti and Michael Bloomberg. The early debates could be spread over several nights to accommodate the expected high number of candidates, the party said. To qualify, they will have to satisfy criteria that include measurable support in opinion polls and grassroots fundraising.  Republicans faced a similar problem in the 2016 race, with a field so large the party was forced to hold two separate debates on a given evening. The earlier debates were mocked at times as ‘kids’ table’ events. Intraparty debates often carry more risk than reward for candidates. With his background in television, Trump, however, was largely able to use them to his advantage during his maverick presidential bid.  Following Clinton’s victory over Sanders, the party was pressed to enact a series of reforms to bolster grassroots candidates. The debate schedule was set with that in mind, DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement.  “My goal in this framework is to give the grassroots a bigger voice than ever before; to showcase our candidates on an array of media platforms; to present opportunity for vigorous discussion about issues, ideas and solutions; and to reach as many potential voters as possible,” Perez said. The first nominating contests are scheduled to be held in February 2020 in the traditional early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. The field may not narrow significantly until so-called ‘Super Tuesday’ in March 2020, when states such as California, North Carolina and Texas hold primaries.

5670,"DENVER/HOUSTON   - Kinder Morgan Inc can begin work on a $2 billion natural gas pipeline without having the Texas energy regulator approve its proposed route, a state judge ruled on Tuesday. The decision removes a challenge to the state’s licensing process that lets gas pipeline companies determine their own route and acquire land without a landowner’s consent. Texas is in the midst of a pipeline-construction boom with multibillion-dollar projects under way to bring shale oil and gas to market. A Travis County District court ruled the Texas Railroad Commission, the state’s oil and gas regulator, is not required to set standards for routing the pipelines or private land-takings, Judge Lora Livingston wrote on Tuesday. The state allows gas pipeline operators that qualify as utilities to use eminent domain to take land for the public good.  “The court finds no authority for the proposition that the legislature has granted authority to the Commission to oversee the rights granted,” she wrote. She also granted Kinder Morgan’s request to dismiss it from the lawsuit.  A group of Texas landowners and officials had sued to block construction, arguing the oil and gas regulator failed to seek public input or properly supervise the routing of Kinder Morgan’s Permian Highway Pipeline, which will carry 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas roughly 400 miles (645 km) from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Kinder Morgan had asked the court to throw out the landowners’ lawsuit, arguing it was up to the state legislature, not the court, to change the pipeline permitting process. “The court’s finding validates the process established in Texas for the development of natural gas utility projects,” Tom Martin, a Kinder Morgan executive, said on Tuesday. U.S. shale gas production in July is projected to hit a record 81.4 billion cubic feet per day, which would be an 18th consecutive monthly increase. Shale oil could hit 8.52 million barrels per day that same month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Landowners argued that the pipeline will cross “sensitive environmental features,” such as endangered species habitats, sites of historical significance and residential subdivisions, according to a filing. The Texas Real Estate Advocacy and Defense Coalition, which advocates for Texas landowner rights, said it was weighing an appeal and additional legal actions in other venues. The ruling “is unfortunate but not unexpected,” said Travis Mitchell, mayor of Kyle, Texas, a co-plaintiff. “We will be working to determine the best path forward. We’re certainly not giving up.”  A spokeswoman for the Railroad Commission of Texas declined to comment.

5885,"DETROIT/PARIS   - French automaker Renault SA, its Japanese partner Nissan Motor Co and tech giant Alphabet Inc’s Waymo are exploring a partnership to develop and use self-driving vehicles to transport people and goods in France and Japan, the companies said on Thursday. The proposed venture could also be expanded to other markets, the companies said. If the partnership is realized, it will have ramifications for other alliances and other self-driving projects, most of which have yet to hit the road. Automakers across the world are re-thinking independent autonomous vehicle efforts, and instead looking for partners to share rising investment costs and regulatory risks. In Japan, a potential competitor to a Renault-Nissan-Waymo venture would be Monet Technologies, a self-driving project involving Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co and backed by SoftBank Group Corp. SoftBank and Honda also have invested in General Motors Co’s Cruise self-driving car unit. The initial agreement among Waymo, Renault and Nissan aims to “develop a framework for deployment of mobility services at scale,” according to Hadi Zablit, Renault-Nissan Alliance business development chief. Physical testing of vehicles and deployment of services would come in later phases. The two automakers will set up 50-50 joint ventures in France and Japan to develop the driverless transportation services. Zablit said a later Waymo investment is “one of the options” under consideration. With Waymo, they will also research commercial, legal and regulatory issues related to building automated transportation-as-a-service businesses in the two countries. The agreement is time-limited and exclusive in both countries, barring either side from working with competitors. Its duration was not disclosed. It is not clear how involving Waymo might affect the existing alliance between Renault and Nissan, which has been strained since the departure earlier this year of longtime chief executive Carlos Ghosn, or a proposed merger between Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. FCA and Renault reached a preliminary agreement in late May to pursue a $35 billion merger. But FCA Chairman John Elkann abruptly withdrew the offer on June 6 after the French government, Renault’s biggest shareholder, blocked a board vote and demanded more time to win backing from Nissan. Waymo late last year began offering a self-driving service in Arizona called Waymo One, but with a human monitor on board. Waymo also has an existing partnership with FCA under which the automaker is supplying Chrysler Pacifica minivans for Waymo’s fledgling self-driving fleet in the United States and eventually may buy self-driving systems from Waymo for its own vehicles. FCA also agreed in early June to partner with Aurora, the Silicon Valley startup co-founded by former Waymo chief Chris Urmson and funded in part by South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co.      The alliance took an earlier step towards working with Alphabet last year, when it agreed to adopt the Google Android operating system in its future vehicles.

6027,"PARIS/BOSTON   - Franco-Israeli cable magnate Patrick Drahi made a surprise move into the art world by snapping up Sotheby’s in a deal worth $3.7 billion, marking the art auction house’s return to private ownership after 31 years. The acquisition allows Drahi to join French billionaire Francois Pinault - who owns Sotheby’s main rival Christie’s - at the top of the art world and New York society. Drahi joins an exclusive club of French billionaires active in the global art market, which also includes LVMH’s boss Bernard Arnault through his Louis Vuitton foundation. Drahi’s expansion in the United States also has echoes of former Vivendi boss Jean-Marie Messier, who turned a struggling French water company into a global media giant with stakes in established U.S. institutions. The deal also marks a new chapter for the 275-year-old auction house that became a destination for a new generation of wealth created on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley and around the world.  In many ways, being public put Sotheby’s at a competitive disadvantage to its main U.S. rival Christie’s, which was already private, art experts said.  “Now the company can become more flexible and nimble as a privately-held enterprise and it will be interesting to see the changes that will be made,” said Abigail Asher, a partner at international art consultants Guggenheim, Asher. Founded in London in 1744 before expanding overseas in the 20th century, Sotheby’s had the distinction of being the oldest company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Famous items sold by Sotheby’s include the collections of the late Duchess of Windsor, the personal collection of artist Andy Warhol and Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream”. Sotheby’s said BidFair USA, an acquisition vehicle set up by Drahi, had offered $57 in cash per share to buy it out. The offer represented a premium of 61% to Sotheby’s closing price on Friday, and gives it a market capitalization of $2.6 billion.  The art world has been a favorite in recent times for investors looking to make extra returns in a world of ultra-low interest rates, with the prices of many expensive works of art having steadily increased. A report published by Swiss bank UBS and Art Basel in March said that the global art market had enjoyed another uptick in 2018. Drahi - who is better known for engineering debt-fueled acquisitions in the cable and telecom business through the Altice group he controls - said he would be funding the takeover through financing arranged by French bank BNP Paribas and by equity provided by his own funds.  Drahi has also been selling non-core assets in recent years to ease concerns over the debt levels of his businesses. The businessman said he would not be selling shares in his Altice Europe business, but would be cashing in a small stake in his Altice USA division. Shares in Altice USA fell around 2% on Monday. Born in Morocco, Drahi, 55, was trained at the selective Polytechnique school in Paris, and holds dual French and Israeli citizenship.    Despite controlling influential French media outlets such as leftist bible Liberation and the country’s most-watched news channel BFM TV, Drahi has shied away from elite gatherings of France’s establishment and spends much of his time between Switzerland, the United States and Israel. “This investment will further demonstrate the anchoring of my family in the United States, a country where we have been very welcomed since the successful acquisitions of Suddenlink in 2015, Cablevision in 2016 and just recently Cheddar,” Drahi said in a statement, referring to the two U.S. cable companies and an online news network respectively. He said he had full confidence in Sotheby’s management and did not expect any change to the company’s strategy. About five years ago, Sotheby’s ended a long-running fight with activist investor Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point, by asking Loeb and two associates to join Sotheby’s board, and Loeb was instrumental in hiring Smith as CEO. Loeb, a prominent art collector, on Monday praised the sale. The price “affirms the value we saw when we first invested in Sotheby’s, and rewards long-term investors like Third Point who believed in its potential,” Loeb told Reuters. BNP Paribas and Morgan Stanley advised Drahi, while LionTree Advisors worked on behalf of Sotheby’s.

6255,"WASHINGTON   - With congressional elections a week away, President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will seek to scrap the right of citizenship for U.S.-born children of non-citizens and illegal immigrants as he tries again to dramatically reshape immigration policies. Reviving his support for a legally questionable theory, Trump told the Axios news website he would issue an executive order on so-called birthright citizenship, an issue that has long rankled some conservative Republicans. Trump’s previous calls to end the practice have resonated with his political base, but moderate Republicans and some legal experts say Trump is running afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Under the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, enacted in the wake of the Civil War to ensure that black Americans previously subject to slavery had full citizenship rights, citizenship is granted to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.” It has been routinely interpreted over the years to confer citizenship to people born in the United States whose parents are illegal immigrants. Trump, who has made rhetoric against illegal immigrants a central plank of his presidency, originally spoke out against birthright citizenship when he first started running for president in 2015.  One Republican member of Congress, frequent Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham, said he would move to introduce legislation “along the same lines” as Trump’s order. Neither Graham nor Trump gave any details about the latest plan. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Other Republicans were critical. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said Trump could not scrap the right with the stroke of a pen.  “You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,” Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said in an interview with radio station WVLK, the Washington Post reported. In the run-up to the Nov. 6 congressional elections, Trump has seized on a caravan of migrants from Central America who are trekking through Mexico toward the United States, calling the migrants a threat. On Monday, the United States said it would send over 5,200 troops to help secure the border with Mexico. Bill Kristol, editor at large of the conservative Weekly Standard and a Trump critic, said in a Twitter post:  “The shrinking caravan of refugees isn’t a threat to the country or the constitutional order. A president who tries to end birthright citizenship by executive order is.”  Trump, whose hard-line stance against illegal immigration helped him win the White House, is emphasizing his policy to drum up support for fellow Republicans in the elections as  Americans are sharply divided and grappling with race and national identity. Opinion polls show Democrats have a chance at achieving the net gain of 23 seats they need to win a majority in the House but they have a longer shot at the Senate, where they need a gain of two seats. Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of trying to distract attention from healthcare policy, which Democrats have identified as a top election issue. “President Trump’s new claim he can unilaterally end the Constitution’s guarantee of citizenship shows Republicans’ spiraling desperation to distract from their assault on Medicare, Medicaid and people with pre-existing conditions,” Pelosi said in a statement.   The legal argument espoused by conservative activists for excluding children of illegal immigrants would likely be based around the language in the 14th Amendment that says people born in the United States are citizens if they are “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.  Activists seeking to limit immigration, including Michael Anton, who wrote an article on the subject for the Washington Post in July, argue that illegal immigrants are not under the jurisdiction of the United States and therefore their children born on U.S. soil should not be U.S. citizens.  Most legal scholars say the jurisdiction language denies citizenship only to those who are not bound by U.S. law, such as the children of foreign diplomats. Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute, said that although there is a debate in academic circles among conservatives on whether Congress could legislate on the issue without running afoul of the 14th Amendment, “it’s not something that can be done by executive action alone.”     At least since 2005, Republicans in the U.S. Congress have regularly offered legislation ending birthright citizenship for children born in the United States if their parents were in the United States illegally. But the legislation has never advanced, even when the House of Representatives or Senate was under Republican control.  Vice President Mike Pence said the plan may not be unconstitutional, telling Politico in an interview that while “we all cherish” the 14th amendment, the U.S. Supreme Court has not weighed in on the issue entirely. “But the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether or not the language of the 14th amendment, subject to the jurisdiction thereof, applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally,” Pence said.  The Supreme Court has not ruled specifically on the issue of whether illegal immigrants can be denied birthright citizenship. In 1898, however, in the case of a man born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants who lived permanently in the United States, the court ruled that the government could not deny him citizenship.  Saikrishna Prakash, a conservative legal scholar at the University of Virginia, said Trump faces long legal odds to ending citizenship as a birthright.  “We’re a nation of immigrants so if I were to bet I would think the president is going to lose,” he said.

unilaterally end the constitution s guarantee of citizenship shows republicans spiraling desperation to distract from their assault on medicare medicaid and people with pre existing conditions pelosi said in a statement the legal argument espoused by conservative activists for excluding children of illegal immigrants would likely be based around the language in the th amendment that says people born in the united states are citizens if they are subject to the jurisdiction of the united states activists seeking to limit immigration including michael anton who wrote an article on the subject for the washington post in july argue that illegal immigrants are not under the jurisdiction of the united states and therefore their children born on u s soil should not be u s citizens most legal scholars say the jurisdiction language denies citizenship only to those who are not bound by u s law such as the children of foreign diplomats ilya shapiro a lawyer with the libertarian cato institute said that although there is a debate in academic circles among conservatives on whether congress could legislate on the issue without running afoul of the th amendment it s not something that can be done by executive action alone at least since  republicans in the u s congress have regularly offered legislation ending birthright citizenship for children born in the united states if their parents were in the united states illegally but the legislation has never advanced even when the house of representatives or senate was under republican control vice president mike pence said the plan may not be unconstitutional telling politico in an interview that while we all cherish the th amendment the u s supreme court has not weighed in on the issue entirely but the supreme court of the united states has never ruled on whether or not the language of the th amendment subject to the jurisdiction thereof applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally pence said the supreme court has not ruled specifically on the issue of whether illegal immigrants can be denied birthright citizenship in  however in the case of a man born in san francisco to chinese immigrants who lived permanently in the united states the court ruled that the government could not deny him citizenship saikrishna prakash a conservative legal scholar at the university of virginia said trump faces long legal odds to ending citizenship as a birthright we re a nation of immigrants so if i were to bet i would think the president is going to lose he said ,Boeing Crisis,0.19463758170604706
6264,"PARIS   - French President Emmanuel Macron has turned down a request to meet Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, who is furious over the government’s interference at the carmaker, sources told Reuters, raising questions over Senard’s future.  News of the rebuff came as Renault shareholders voted on Wednesday to endorse Senard’s January appointment to replace Carlos Ghosn, the ousted leader of the Renault-Nissan alliance.  Senard, whose bid to merge with Fiat Chrysler (FCA) over Nissan’s reservations was thwarted by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, unsuccessfully sought a meeting with Macron to appeal for his support, four government and company sources said. Seven months after Ghosn’s arrest on financial misconduct charges - which he denies - the alliance he forged is on life support. Nissan refused to study a full Renault tie-up proposed by Senard, and wants to weaken its 43.4% shareholder’s grip. Instead, Senard then tabled an FCA-Renault deal proposal developed without Nissan’s knowledge. But FCA Chairman John Elkann withdrew the offer after France, Renault’s biggest shareholder, blocked the June 5 board vote and demanded more time to secure Nissan’s endorsement. Days later, in a third risky move that caused outrage in Japan, Senard vowed to block governance reforms introduced by Nissan after the Ghosn scandal unless Renault gets more seats on the Japanese firm’s powerful new board committees. Renault sources say Senard’s exasperation deepened when Le Maire, seeking to smooth tensions from the sidelines of a weekend G20 meeting in Japan, publicly discussed a possible cut to France’s 15% Renault stake or even Renault’s Nissan holding. Senard felt further undermined by Le Maire’s surprise pronouncements and told colleagues he expected to be “backed up from the highest level of government”, according to one. But Macron’s office declined a proposed sit-down, the sources said.  “There is no meeting with Senard on the president’s agenda,” an Elysee official said on Wednesday. Renault declined to comment. But sources close to the chairman played down the rebuffed meeting request and said he was determined to stay put. Senard and Macron “communicate regularly by text message”, one said, and the French head of state is extremely busy with other matters. “Senard is on top form for his shareholders’ meeting and is resolved to continue.” France is not seeking to replace Senard, another government source said. “He may have taken some bad advice, and he should clearly have made more personnel changes for Renault to move on” from the Ghosn era, he added. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa and Renault CEO Thierry Bollore, Ghosn’s former second-in-command who was promoted in January, barely speak and are now seen as clear irritants to the relationship, French official and company sources say. “Senard has become well aware of this,” said a person familiar with his thinking. “So we’ll see how things evolve after the shareholder meeting.” Saikawa’s position also appears more fragile, after two leading investment advisory firms recommended a vote against his reappointment at the Japanese carmaker’s June 25 shareholder gathering. The recommendations may boost the chances of Saikawa’s exit, although a vote against him remains unlikely. Under a 2015 amendment to alliance shareholder pacts, Renault is required to support the Nissan board’s proposal to renew his mandate. Senard told Renault shareholders on Wednesday that he remained “distressed” that a board vote on the FCA merger had been prevented. “I don’t know what the future holds, but the proposal remains an exceptional one to my mind,” he said. Senard and Elkann have discussed ways to revive the deal with Nissan’s support, Reuters reported this week. Hewing more closely to the government’s line, however, Senard added that his priority was to strengthen the alliance. “Renault cannot succeed unless the alliance succeeds,” he said.

6345,"NEW YORK   - Ben Chico, 67, a Republican in California, says his annoyance with Democrats morphed into full-blown outrage when he heard they might try to impeach President Donald Trump after the Nov. 6 elections. Eden Stramer, 23, a North Dakota Democrat, says the possibility of abortions becoming illegal again leaves her fuming. And Pattie Blair, 74, a Democratic voter in Phoenix, says anger washes over her every time she sees Trump on television. “It’s the most negative, blackest place to find yourself,” Blair said. “It’s like being in a bucket you can’t get yourself out of – a hand keeps pushing you back in every time you try to surface.” Across the country, people are seething. After a vitriolic 2016 presidential election, anger continues to dominate public discourse, from raucous protests with huge crowds to incensed social media debates that tear families and friendships apart. That anger will drive voters to the polls in next month’s elections - and greater rage among Democratic voters could give the party’s candidates a boost, Reuters/Ipsos polling data shows. The poll, which gathered emotional responses from more than 21,000 people over two months, found Democrats are most angry about the Trump administration’s now abandoned practice of separating undocumented immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexican border, the potential for Russian interference in future U.S. elections and the Republican president himself. Republicans are most angry about the potential for Congress to try to remove Trump through impeachment, undocumented immigrants coming into the country and the mainstream news media. While the midterm elections are for thousands of posts from state officials to governors, the focus is on control of the U.S. Congress. Opinion polls show Democrats have a chance at achieving the net gain of 23 seats they need to win a majority in the House of Representatives. They have a longer shot at the Senate, where they need a gain of two seats, but are defending 26 seats, including 10 in states Trump won in 2016. Angry Americans will be more likely to vote, and Democrats are generally more angry about their hot-button issues than Republicans, according to the Reuters/Ipsos data. That is a change from two years ago, when Republicans and Democrats were equally furious, said Nicholas Valentino, a voter behavior expert at the University of Michigan who collaborated on the poll and analyzed the results for Reuters. The data suggests Democratic candidates could get a turnout boost that exceeds expectations, he said, possibly tipping the scale for them in tight races. “That’s what happened in 2016,” Valentino said. “A lot of people who were predicted to stay home were very angry at (presidential candidate) Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, and they showed up to the surprise of everyone.” In Arizona and other states with competitive races, voters interviewed by Reuters bemoaned rampant partisan anger. Many said it makes them more eager to vote. Tim Leatherby, 57, a former Marine, said he was concerned the country was plunging toward a “civil war.” “I did my time in the fight and I don’t want to fight again here,” said Leatherby, who said he would vote for Republican Martha McSally in Arizona’s Senate race, one of the key battles that will decide control of that chamber. Brian Carson, 46, a public speaking coach, echoed that sentiment. “We’re learning more efficient ways to hate each other more quickly, and that is disappointing to me,” he said. Valentino said this is true - Americans overall appear to have been angrier in 2016 and 2018 than they were in past election cycles, according to similar polling that dates back to 1980. “Other previous elections have been pretty intense,” he said. “But the emotions that people expressed were much more positive, even during years when the country was in recession.” The poll, conducted from Aug. 17 to Oct. 7, asked respondents to rate their emotional responses – including their level of anger, bitterness, worry, fear, hope, relief and satisfaction – toward Trump, the U.S. Senate’s confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the news media, immigration and other issues. It also collected respondents’ voting history and political interest.  On a scale of 1 to 10 - with 10 being extreme anger – college-educated Democrats registered an average 8.4 over the issue of family separations at the border, a policy the Trump administration discontinued in June after images of youngsters in cages sparked outrage at home and abroad. [nL1N1TM10P] Democrats in general were a 7.6 toward Trump, with Democratic women more angry than men. “Every time a woman comes up in conversation, he has to talk about their appearance,” said Lisa Mol, 58, a Democrat from Michigan. “I want to poke his eyes out so he can’t see.” Republicans aged 55 and older were an average of 7.9 in anger over illegal immigration, and Republican men were 7.6 over the possibility of Trump getting impeached. Although theoretically Democrats could start impeachment proceedings if they controlled the House, the party’s leaders have been clear this is not on the immediate agenda. [nL2N1WR1B0] Democratic women expressed a collective 7.3 in anger when asked about the possibility that abortion could become illegal in the United States, while Republican women polled at 4.1 on that question. Democrats’ concern was fired up by Kavanaugh’s arrival on the Supreme Court, where he could provide a decisive fifth vote on the nine-justice court if it were being asked to pare back abortion rights or even overturn the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion, Roe v. Wade. The survey period included the Senate committee hearing where Kavanaugh denied allegations by university professor Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school, and his confirmation by the Senate. Democrats were much more angry about the Senate’s handling of his confirmation than Republicans or independents, the poll found. Valentino said the data showed the controversy over Kavanaugh would energize Democratic voters more than Republicans in the midterm elections, despite assertions by Republican leaders that their base is more fired up about it. Anger is motivating voting interest more than hope or fear, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted online and in English throughout the United States. It collected 21,027 responses. In North Dakota, Stramer said her anger has pushed her to get more informed. She said she would vote next month for Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat struggling to defend her seat. Meantime, she fills her journal with her reflections and frustrations. “I tend to write about things that make me mad, and then I don’t have to have those arguments,” Stramer said. “I could fight with people, but in my opinion, it doesn’t change anything. Posting stuff online doesn’t change anything.” But, she added, “I am going to vote, of course.” GRAPHIC: American anger tmsnrt.rs/2yx11rw Reuters election coverage: here ",Americans' anger may help

6445,"SHANGHAI   - China is preparing to curb some technology exports to the United States, the chief editor of China’s Global Times newspaper said on Saturday. If enacted, the measures suggest Beijing would retaliate over U.S. restrictions imposed on Shenzhen-based Huawei Technologies Co Ltd due to what Washington said were national security issues. In a tweet, the pro-CCP paper’s editor-in-chief Hu Xijin said that China “is building a management mechanism to protect China’s key technologies.” “This is a major step to improve its system and also a move to counter U.S. crackdown,” he added. “Once taking effect, some technology exports to the U.S. will be subject to the control.” Hu did not cite any named sources in his tweet. The Global times is not an official mouthpiece for the Communist Party though its views are believed to at times represent those of its leaders. Around the time of Hu’s tweet, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) would organize a study to establish a “national technological security management list system.” These announcements come weeks after Washington placed Chinese network equipment maker and smartphone vendor Huawei on a blacklist that effectively bars U.S. companies from supplying it with goods and services. Soon afterwards, Beijing announced it would release its own list of “unreliable” foreign entities. It also has hinted that it will limit its supply of rare earths to the United States.

6563,"WASHINGTON   - The founder of a political research firm that hired former British spy Christopher Steele to compile a dossier on alleged contacts between presidential candidate Donald Trump and his advisers and Russia is refusing to testify to the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. A letter sent on Thursday to the committee by lawyers for Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson said their client will not give a deposition in response to a committee subpoena. “The committee’s inquiry is not designed to discover the truth,” Simpson’s lawyers said in the letter to the committee’s chairman, Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte. “The goal of this committee is to discredit and otherwise damage witnesses to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, all as part of an effort to protect” Trump, the letter said. Goodlatte announced the subpoena last month after Simpson refused the committee’s request for an interview. The deposition is scheduled for Oct. 16. The committee could vote to hold Simpson in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify.  The committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The letter said Simpson had voluntarily testified before three congressional committees. Fusion GPS was hired by lawyers for the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign to conduct research on Trump, her opponent. The firm in turn hired Steele, a former British intelligence officer, to produce a dossier that outlined alleged Russian financial dealings with Trump and included salacious personal details that remain unconfirmed. The dossier was sent to the FBI, which already had launched an investigation into whether Russia interfered with the election and whether Trump campaign officials worked with Moscow to try to sway the outcome. The Kremlin denies meddling in the election. Trump, who denies his campaign colluded with Russia, has called Steele’s work an “unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier” and has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia.

6994,"AMSTERDAM   - Oil and gas giant Royal Dutch Shell PLC will disclose how much tax it pays in every country in which it operates, an executive told a Dutch parliamentary panel on Wednesday, in a report to be published later this year. Shell’s vice president for taxation Alan McLean made the promise at a hearing on taxation of multinationals called by parliament after reports emerged last year that Shell does not pay any corporate tax in the Netherlands, despite being headquartered in The Hague. Ahead of Wednesday’s panel, Shell disclosed that it does not pay Dutch corporate taxes apart from at its NAM gas subsidiary, a joint venture with Exxon. Worldwide, Shell reported it paid $10 billion in corporate tax in 2018 and that it had an effective tax rate of 33 percent. However, in the relatively small Dutch market it was able to use deductions on loss-making operations elsewhere to reduce its corporate tax bill to zero. “When there’s a loss there’s no profit tax to be paid, so the arithmetic is simple,” Alan McLean told skeptical lawmakers. “I understand that for many people... being seen to make profits here in the Netherlands and not having any profit to pay tax on can be odd.” Among other Dutch multinationals, healthcare company Philips confirmed at Wednesday’s hearing that it did not pay any Dutch taxes in 2018, though it said it expects to pay around 100 million euros a year starting in 2021.  Paint maker Akzo Nobel, which also attended the hearing, did not disclose what portion of the 118 million euros in tax payments it made in 2018 went to the Netherlands. Unilever, which did not attend the hearing, routinely discloses its per-country taxation. It paid 2.29 billion euros in corporate tax in 2018, including 30 million euros in the Netherlands.   Asked by a lawmaker whether he thought it was moral that Shell paid no Dutch corporate tax, McLean said morality was “a very difficult word”.  “We understand at Shell that we have to have the support of the communities in which we operate,” he said.  “I think we also understand at Shell that some of the support that we’ve had from the broader Dutch community has diminished over time, and we’re working hard to rebuild that.” He said the company adheres to the letter of tax rules in all jurisdictions.

7205,"  - A U.S. judge on Wednesday appointed prominent attorney Kenneth Feinberg as mediator for court-mandated settlement talks in the federal litigation over allegations that Bayer AG’s glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer caused cancer. Feinberg has been instructed to meet with lawyers for Bayer and plaintiffs within the next 14 days, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said during a court hearing on Wednesday. Chhabria, who oversees some 900 federal Roundup lawsuits, on April 11 ordered the parties to start confidential mediation. He appointed Feinberg after the parties failed to agree on a mediator. Feinberg is well known for having facilitated dispute resolutions in high-stakes litigations in the past. He led mediation talks over the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, Volkswagen’s diesel emissions scandal and General Motors ignition switch litigation. Chhabria on Wednesday also scheduled the next federal Roundup trial for February 2020. The case would mark the second bellwether, or test trial, to help determine the range of damages and define settlement options for federal cases. The judge also wants to prepare some 20 cases currently pending before him for trial and send them to other courts across the country.  More than 13,400 plaintiffs nationwide allege Roundup caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and that the company failed to warn about that risk. The majority of lawsuits are pending in state courts across the country. Bayer, which acquired Roundup maker Monsanto in a $63 billion deal last year, denies the allegations, saying studies and regulators have deemed glyphosate and Roundup safe for human use. The company in the past said it would comply with Chhabria’s mediation order in good faith, while believing strongly in the “extensive body of reliable science supporting the safety of Roundup.” Bayer has also said it would defend itself in all cases and await the appeals process underway for the three cases that have gone to trial and resulted in jury verdicts against it. A California jury on May 13 awarded $2 billion to a couple alleging Roundup caused their cancer.  In March, a federal jury in San Francisco awarded $80 million to a California man after finding Roundup caused his cancer. That decision came after another California jury in August 2018 awarded $289 million to a groundskeeper in the first U.S. Roundup trial. That award was later reduced to $78 million.

7269,"PARIS   - The current status quo regarding the alliance between French carmaker Renault and its Japanese partner Nissan cannot continue and must be changed as it is currently weakening Renault, said French finance minister Bruno Le Maire. “The status quo is not possible, the status quo is weakening the overall group, we have to push forward, make progress and consolidate this alliance,” Le Maire told reporters at a meeting held at the OECD. Le Maire had earlier discussed the matter with Japanese industry minister Hiroshige Seko. Nissan said earlier this month that Hiroto Saikawa would stay on as chief executive, backing the protege of former boss Carlos Ghosn even as top shareholder Renault had earlier pushed for a change in the Japanese automaker’s leadership. The make-up of Nissan’s board has vast implications for the Nissan-Renault alliance.

7309,"CHICAGO   - Southwest Airlines Co’s mechanics union said on Tuesday its members had overwhelmingly voted to ratify a tentative contract agreement with the airline, ending seven years of labor negotiations fraught with legal disputes and flight disruptions. The agreement, which brought to a close one of the most disruptive labor disputes to hit a top-four U.S. airline in more than a decade, came a day after rival U.S. carrier American Airlines Group Inc said it was filing a labor-related lawsuit against its mechanics. Analysts have highlighted labor issues as a main concern for airlines this year, in addition to rising fuel costs and the grounding of Boeing MAX jets after two fatal crashes.  Mechanics at both American and Southwest have complained that the airlines are moving to outsource maintenance work that has traditionally been done in-house.  In a statement on its website, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, which represents around 2,500 Southwest mechanics, said about 95 percent of its members had voted to accept a labor agreement that includes significant pay increases and headcount protections. Southwest, which had been forced to cancel hundreds of flights earlier this year stemming from the mechanics dispute, welcomed the agreement. “Our mechanics will receive well-deserved pay increases, and the company will realize additional flexibilities necessary to compete in today’s airline industry,” Russell McCrady, vice president of labor relations, said in a statement. Separately on Tuesday, American Airlines’ mechanics union, the TWU-IAM Association, said it was “ready and willing” to return to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair contract, as long as it had a willing partner. The comment followed a federal lawsuit filed by American alleging an illegal slowdown by its mechanics aimed at disrupting operations to improve their position in labor talks, which began in 2015. “We would much prefer to be at the negotiating table than in a legal battle brought on by American,” the TWU-IAM Association said in a statement. American said the slowdowns had escalated following the last joint bargaining session on April 25, which was overseen by the National Mediation Board. The action has caused hundreds of flight cancellations and more than 1,000 maintenance delays, threatening further disruption during the busy U.S. summer, it said. TWU-IAM, formed in 2015 after the merger of US Airways and American Airlines, said it wants to keep the company from outsourcing more maintenance and repair work to South America, China and Europe, and is “standing strong” against cuts to medical benefits and retirement security.

7322,"LONDON   - Britain’s business ministry will consult further on sweeping reforms of the audit market, it told Reuters, stopping short of legislation demanded by lawmakers. Last month the Competition and Markets Authority proposed some of the biggest reforms to auditing globally since the aftermath of the Enron scandal, recommending new laws to force the so-called Big Four firms to separate their audit and consulting arms and requiring most listed companies to be audited by two different firms. Business minister Greg Clark had told parliament he would bring forward the legislation needed to implement the reforms before the end of this year, though a slot was needed in parliament’s Brexit-clogged calendar. Now the ministry has told Reuters that, while still committed to reforming the industry, it plans to consult further before considering any new laws. “We will publicly consult on any proposed changes,” it told Reuters. The reforms involve major change for the Big Four of EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC in Britain and come in the wake of the collapse of companies including construction group Carillion and retailer BHS, where auditors were criticised for not spotting looming problems.   The big accounting firms have lobbied strongly against the proposals, arguing they won’t necessarily raise audit standards. Now it looks like they will either have more time to influence the new rules or possibly not face any new legislation at all. With Britain’s departure from the European Union clogging up parliament, the ministry might ask the sector to change its practices voluntarily, industry officials said. “With the legislative focus on Brexit, the government could seek undertakings from the Big Four to voluntarily adopt some of its preferred measures rather than wait for a slot in the parliamentary calendar to become available,” said Michael Izza, chief executive of the ICAEW professional accounting body. A Big Four source said they now expect the government to look at voluntary changes because legislation could take until 2021 to come into effect, with a general election also likely between now and then.  Parliament’s business committee has said it wants change fast and its members could view voluntary changes instead of legislation as a fudge.  “I hope the government will rise to this challenge and resist the urge to kick audit reforms into the long grass,” the committee’s chair, Rachel Reeves, told Reuters KPMG’s UK arm, which audited Carillion, announced last week that there will be more separate performance management and governance of the audit business from June — steps that fall short of the full operational split proposed by the CMA. KPMG said it was looking closely at how it might introduce further measures in coming months. PwC, which audited BHS, said it was also taking steps to strengthen its governance and enhance audit quality. EY declined to comment and Deloitte had no immediate comment on whether it would take pre-emptive action. The government could also ask the Big Four to voluntarily divest a number of their audits, ICAEW’s Izza said, making room for smaller accounting firms such as BDO, Grant Thornton and Mazars to pick up more book-keeping work among blue-chip clients. The Big Four source said that voluntarily agreeing not to take on audits could be in breach of European Union competition law.

The market rout came after U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports and Beijing retaliated with tariffs of its own. As result, the yuan is now off 2.5% so far this month. (GRAPHIC: China's yuan, stocks fall amid trade tensions - tmsnrt.rs/2WNlItd) A weaker currency and trade uncertainties have intensified outflows of foreign funds from the A-share market since April. Foreign investors are a key part of the country’s equities market, holding a total of 1.68 trillion yuan ($244.41 billion) worth of A-shares as of end-March, up from 1.15 trillion yuan at end-2018, according to latest PBOC data.  As of May 17, foreign investors via the Stock Connect had sold about 36 billion yuan worth of mainland shares in May, snapping a five-month buying streak. (GRAPHIC: Foreign outflows via the Stock Connect intensified in May - tmsnrt.rs/2WU9WNE) Shares in the four biggest lenders have taken a beating on concerns they will be asked to lend more to prop up the growth.  “If there is no resolution to the trade dispute, the banks may need to increase lending while trying to maintain asset quality especially after the weak April data,” strategists at Jefferies said in a note.   Chinese banks cut back new lending in April after a record first quarter that sparked fears of more bad loans, but analysts say the central bank will have to sustain policy support through the year. (GRAPHIC: Shares in China's big 4 banks skid in past weeks amid trade dispute - tmsnrt.rs/2WLisPc) China’s information technology and telecommunications firms, which are heavily reliant on the global supply chain and hence seen as vulnerable to trade tensions, have seen a major correction since April.  As of Friday, the CSI IT index slumped 21.3% from an more than one-year high hit on April 2, while an index tracking China’s major telecoms firms declined 22.6% from a 16-month high hit on April 22.  Shares of Huawei suppliers slumped after the Trump administration hit Chinese telecoms giant Huawei with severe sanctions. China’s No. 2 telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp had tumbled as much as 67.4% in 2018 on a U.S. export ban that threatened to put it out of business. Firms heavily exposed to overseas markets also saw their share prices sinking, in particular electronics firms.  Chinese video surveillance products supplier Hangzhou Hikvision, which derived 30% of its 2018 revenue from overseas operations, tumbled about 25% from a 10-month high hit on April 2. Apple Inc. supplier Luxshare Precision Industry also retreated 25% from a record high as trade tensions threatened to disrupt the U.S. firm’s mainland supply chains.  China’s leading LED products maker Sanan Optoelectronics dropped nearly 30% in May alone, extending an 11% loss in April.

7427,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday declared that some imported vehicles and parts pose a national security threat but delayed a decision for as long as six months on whether to impose tariffs to allow for more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan. The unprecedented designation of foreign vehicles imported to the United States from some of its closest allies sparked anger from automakers, dealers and foreign governments after a White House document hinted it would seek voluntary export quotas on autos from U.S. trading partners. Toyota Motor Corp, which said in March it is investing $13 billion in U.S. operations through 2021, called the designation “a major set-back for American consumers, workers and the auto industry” and said it sent the message “our investments are not welcomed.” European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said on Twitter that “we completely reject the notion that our car exports are a national security threat. The EU is prepared to negotiate a limited trade agreement (including) cars, but not WTO-illegal managed trade.” World Trade Organization rules bar voluntary export restraints and the EU has repeatedly said it would not agree to any quotas on auto exports. Trump’s decision, at least for now, averts what was shaping up to be a new dramatic escalation in the Trump administration’s trade disputes around the world, including a trade war with China. On Friday, Trump continued his rhetoric attacking foreign imports from the EU. “They have trade barriers. They don’t want our farm products, they don’t want our cars. They send Mercedes-Benz’s in here like they’re cookies,” he told a group of real estate agents. “They send BMWs here. We hardly tax them at all.” The president had faced a Saturday deadline to make a decision on recommendations by the Commerce Department to protect the U.S. auto industry from imports on national security grounds and imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent. Trump directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to pursue negotiations with the EU, Japan and any other country he deemed appropriate and report back within 180 days. If no deal is reached, Trump will decide by then “whether and what further action needs to be taken.” In a proclamation released Friday, Trump agreed with a Commerce Department study that found some imported cars and trucks are “weakening our internal economy” and threaten to harm national security, but it stopped short of naming specific vehicles or parts. Automakers warned the tariffs cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically raise prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars. A group representing major German and Asian automakers including Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co, called the suggestion some auto imports are a national security risk “absurd.” The group added that “no one in the industry has asked for tariffs or other ‘protection’ from the government.” “The truth stands: imported autos and auto parts are simply not a national security threat,” said Cody Lusk, president of the American International Automobile Dealers Association. “Using this spurious claim as justification to force our trading partners into new negotiations will only create more uncertainty for America’s entire auto industry.” The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, VW, Ford Motor Co and others, said the companies remained “deeply concerned that the administration continues to consider imposing auto tariffs.” The group said that since 2017 automakers have invested $22.8 billion in new and existing facilities in the United States, but “increased auto tariffs threaten to undo this economic progress. At the end of the day, you can have tariffs or investment, but you can’t have both.” Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, criticized Trump’s finding and said his “petulant threats will only make it less likely our allies will work with us to confront our collective challenges with China and to fix real trade problems.” A revised U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada signed in November effectively shields existing imports from the two nations to the United States from national security tariffs. The auto tariffs face strong opposition in Congress, including from many prominent Republicans. The White House has refused to release the auto import study to Congress.  Trump’s proclamation said “domestic conditions of competition must be improved by reducing imports” and said a strong U.S. auto sector is vital to U.S. military superiority. The reports cited statistics that U.S.-owned companies’ share of the U.S. automobile market has declined from 67 percent, or 10.5 million units produced and sold in the United States, in 1985, to 22 percent, or 3.7 million units produced and sold in the United States, in 2017. At the same time, the Commerce Department report stated that imports nearly doubled - from 4.6 million units to 8.3 million units. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Trump that “successful negotiations could allow American-owned automobile producers to achieve long-term economic viability and increase R&D (research and development) spending to develop cutting-edge technologies that are critical to the defense industry.” The report called the European Union and Japan “protected foreign markets” that “impose significant barriers to automotive imports from the United States, severely disadvantaging American-owned producers.” The United States also has barriers to imports, most notably a 25 percent tariff on pickup trucks from outside North America.

7615,"YOKOHAMA   - Nissan Motor Co forecast a 28% plunge in its annual operating profit, putting it on course for the weakest earnings in 11 years and underscoring its struggle to turn the page after former Chairman Carlos Ghosn was ousted. The lackluster outlook from Japan’s No.2 automaker - hit by Ghosn’s arrest last year and troubles at its North American business - is likely to add to the pressure on CEO Hiroto Saikawa as he tries to overhaul corporate governance and put Nissan on a more equal footing with alliance partner Renault.   Nissan’s weakening profit and a growing number of departing executives and managers have raised concerns at Renault, which holds a 43% stake in the Japanese firm and has pushed for closer ties.  These issues could strengthen the argument for closer links between the two automakers, although some Nissan executives have opposed a full merger and what they see as an unequal partnership that gives smaller Renault more sway over Nissan. “Today we have hit rock bottom,” Saikawa told a news conference at the company’s headquarters in Yokohama on Tuesday, adding that he wanted the company to recover to its original performance level in next two to three years. “Most of the problems we are facing are the negative legacy of our old leader,” he said in a reference to Ghosn, adding that the company had been slow to move on from these problems. Nissan expects operating profit of 230 billion yen ($2 billion) for the year to March 2020, missing the 457.7 billion yen average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. The automaker reported an operating profit of 318 billion yen in the year just ended, down 45% from a year earlier. It also booked 4.4 billion yen in expenses to reflect previous misstatements involving Ghosn’s compensation. Sluggish profitability would likely result in a 30% cut to full-year dividend to 40 yen per share, Nissan said.  After Ghosn’s ousting as head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, the French automaker is set to discuss forming a joint holding company to give both companies equal footing, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Saikawa declined to comment on the progress of the discussions, but acknowledged a difference of opinion with Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard regarding a closer capital integration between the two companies. “I have been negative to the idea of a full merger,” he said. “Now is not the right time to discuss a merger. We have to focus on our recovery,” he said. Ghosn, out on bail and awaiting trial in Japan, has been charged on several counts of financial misconduct and of allegedly enriching himself at Nissan’s expense. He has denied all charges and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup. The scandal has rocked the global auto industry and raised concerns about Nissan’s ability to regain its footing following the departure of the charismatic leader and the architect of its alliance with Renault. Widely considered a protege of Ghosn before taking the reins at Nissan, Saikawa has now come under fire for not doing enough to limit Ghosn’s broad control over the company, and for the drop in the automaker’s performance since he took over in 2017. Saikawa has said that he planned to eventually hand over to a successor, but on Tuesday he gave no indication of when such a move may come. “Timing is a matter I need to decide,” he said, adding that he would step down “at the appropriate time”. The biggest blow to Nissan’s bottom line has come from the costly sales incentives in the United States, where its sales fell 9.3% to 1.44 million units in the year ended March 31. For years it has relied on heavy discounting in its biggest market to sell its Rogue compact SUVs and Altima sedans, under aggressive targets Ghosn set during his time as CEO. Saikawa has pledged to focus on improving U.S. profit margins, but it has been a slow process as Nissan continues to resort to discounting. The automaker also cut its mid-term revenue target to 14.5 trillion yen by 2022, from 16.5 trillion yen. It sees its annual operating margin at 6% by then, versus an earlier target for 8%.   Nissan shares are down around 2% this year, after losing a fifth of their value last year.

7666,"STOCKHOLM   - Sweden’s VOI Technology plans to put a new fleet of thousands of electric scooters on European streets this summer to fend off competition in an increasingly crowded market. U.S. tech giants Uber and Alphabet are among investors that have have been betting on the growing popularity of e-scooter sharing in Europe, where large commuter populations have lower car ownership levels than in the United States. VOI launched nine months ago and is now targeting 150 European cities. Germany is expected to give the green light to e-scooters this month and could become VOI’s biggest market, the company said. Its scooters are so far available in nine European countries, including France, Spain and Sweden, with plans to launch in Germany, Belgium, Poland and Italy this summer. But competition is fierce. Domestic start-ups such as Tier and Dott, as well as U.S. rivals Bird and Lime, are all expanding in Europe. VOI, backed by investors such as BlaBlaCar CEO Nicolas Brusson and venture fund Balderton Capital, said the number of rides on its scooters had more than doubled to over 2 million after reaching 1 million within six months. The company’s new scooters will be able to travel up to 50 km (31.1 miles) on a single charge, almost twice as far as earlier models, it said. Critics warn that operators could face similar issues as bike-sharing businesses. Forced into price wars and facing a backlash from authorities over rules and vandalism, bike operators GoBee and Mobike have both retreated from Europe.

7667,"BERLIN   - Volkswagen workers backed a restructuring of the world’s largest carmaker on Tuesday after Chief Executive Herbert Diess pledged to spend 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) on a new battery cell production plant near its headquarters in Lower Saxony. Diess needs the support of Volkswagen’s  powerful unions as he attempts to slim down and simplify the German company, which has 12 brands spanning trucks, buses, motorbikes, cars and electric bicycles. VW’s leadership has embraced a strategic shift towards e-mobility, which requires less manpower to produce cars, to help it shed the shadow of the diesel emissions test cheating scandal which damaged its finances and reputation. Labour opposition has stifled previous restructuring efforts at VW, which also said it plans to list its trucks business, integrating its MAN and Scania divisions to create a global challenger to Daimler and Volvo. “The employee representatives on the supervisory board welcome the decisions, which they expressly support. These decisions set the course for sustainable further development of secure jobs as well as profitability,” labor chief Bernd Osterloh said in a letter to VW’s employees on Tuesday. VW had said on Monday it would resume preparations for listing the trucks business, which is called Traton, before the summer break, reversing an earlier decision to postpone the listing due to shaky markets.  It also said it is exploring a sale of MAN Energy Solutions, which makes diesel engines for use in ships and power stations, as well as a full or partial sale, joint ventures or partnerships for transmissions maker Renk. Reuters reported earlier this month that VW had approached several companies to gauge their interest in buying MAN Energy Solutions, which is expected to achieve a valuation of about 3 billion euros in a potential sale. Threats by the United States to impose tariffs of up to 25% on Chinese imports sparked fears of a protracted global trade dispute which has rattled investors and sparked a sharp sell-off on equities markets in the past week.    Finance Chief Frank Witter said in a statement that “current market assessments” had encouraged VW to proceed with the Initial Public Offering (IPO), which could yield up to 6 billion euros if a 25 percent stake is listed. Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois estimated Traton was worth 15 billion to 16 billion euros.  “A listing should be positive as the current VW balance sheet is in our view a constraint on Traton’s ability to execute on its ‘Global Champion Strategy’.” Shares in VW, which Diess said would invest the proceeds of the IPO in creating a global trucks business, were up 1.1% at 1212 GMT. This could allow Volkswagen Truck & Bus to build a war chest to deepen its relationship with Navistar, a U.S. truckmaker in which it owns a 16.85% stake. Osterloh said talks between labor representatives and VW management over working conditions and restructuring plans were going well and a conclusion could be reached in May.  VW said it would seek to build a battery cell production factory in Salzgitter, Lower Saxony, if economic pre-conditions, such as subsidized electricity, could be met. And executive board member Stefan Sommer told journalists that VW was already looking into opening additional battery production sites in Europe. Diess’ predecessor Matthias Mueller failed to sell non-core assets like Ducati, stifled by supervisory board members from Lower Saxony and the company’s labor representatives who control more than half the seats on the 20-member board.  Osterloh said he would agree to divestments and a transformation if the terms and conditions for employees in units which have been earmarked for disposal are not watered down and if there is industrial logic behind the deal. “You can rely on one thing, there will be no lazy compromises here,” Osterloh said.

The retailer has struggled to keep pace with changing consumer tastes and shopping habits, reporting 1.1% growth in sales last year compared with over 22% in 2003, when Temares took over as CEO. The company’s shares have lost nearly 80% in the past five years. The stock was up 3% on Monday. The retailer named Mary Winston, currently a board member, as interim CEO.

7760,"PARIS   - A French probe into alleged emissions cheating by Renault is a step closer to possible court action, Le Monde reported on Monday, after a technical report confirmed that some of its diesel engines were configured to emit more pollutants outside official test conditions. Following Volkswagen’s 2015 admission that it had rigged engine software with “defeat devices” to cheat U.S. diesel tests, several European states launched investigations. They found on-the-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions more than 10 times above regulatory limits for some Opel, Renault and Fiat Chrysler models, and widespread use of devices that reduce or shut down exhaust treatment during normal use. French prosecutors opened criminal probes into Volkswagen, Renault, PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler in 2016-17 that remain ongoing. A Renault spokesman said the company could not comment on the latest report because it had not seen its findings. “Renault vehicles are not equipped with defeat devices and are homologated in conformity with the regulations in force,” the spokesman said. The study by ISAT, a French transport research institute, confirmed earlier findings that engine software in Renault’s Clio and Captur models shut down one form of emissions control outside a range of air temperatures covering official tests but not everyday use, Le Monde reported. Another anti-pollution technology, the “NOx trap”, did not run cleaning cycles below speeds of 50 kilometers per hour (31 miles per hour), according to the French daily. Without such periodic purges, the filters become clogged and ineffective.

7950,"TOKYO/ZURICH   - Novartis is buying dry-eye drug Xiidra from Takeda Pharmaceutical Co for up to $5.3 billion as the Swiss drugmaker refreshes its ophthalmic medicines portfolio with a potential blockbuster. The deal, announced early on Thursday, calls for $3.4 billion up front and milestone payments up to $1.9 billion, Novartis said. The acquisition from Takeda, which is jettisoning the medicine to reduce debt, adds to several big Novartis transactions over the last year as the Basel-based company both beefs up its portfolio and sheds non-core assets to focus on prescription drugs. It is also the latest Japanese-European deal in the pharmaceutical sector following British drugmaker Astrazeneca’s $6.9 billion agreement in January to work with Daiichi Sankyo on an experimental breast cancer drug.  Expected to close after July, the transaction includes 400 Takeda employees, which analysts from Bank Vontobel in Zurich said gives Novartis a marketing team to sell not only Xiidra but another prospective eye drug entrant, RTH258 for macular degeneration, now awaiting regulatory approval. “Despite generic competition...we think that Xiidra is sufficiently differentiated,” Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider said. “The market (is) big enough for it to reach blockbuster status, justifying the price.” Xiidra, with $400 million in 2018 sales and approval in markets including the United States, Canada and Australia, competes with Allergan’s older Restasis.  Generics maker Teva has a generic version of Restasis in Canada and is planning a launch in the United States, as is Mylan, pending resolution of legal disputes. Xiidra has yet to get European regulatory approval.  “Following closing, we will explore the opportunity for the other territories acquired,” a Novartis spokesman told Reuters. For Takeda, this is its first divestment since its leveraged takeover of Shire in January, part of a flurry of multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical deals as drugmakers seek to buy other companies to combat expiring patents on their blockbuster medicines and renew their drug pipelines.  Japan’s biggest drugmaker aims to dispose of $10 billion worth of assets to cut debt, and also said it is selling TachoSil, a surgical patch for bleeding control, to Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon for $400 million. “We are working to strategically simplify and optimize our portfolio, while also rapidly deleveraging,” Takeda CEO Christophe Weber said in a statement. For roughly 34 million U.S. dry eye sufferers, tears fail to adequately lubricate their eyes, and the condition can become painful, potentially leading to eye damage, Novartis said. Xiidra, which treats signs and symptoms of dry eye by controlling inflammation, won U.S. regulatory approval in 2016 under Shire’s watch and was considered then its most important new medicine. “We look forward to leveraging our well-established commercial infrastructure to bring this medicine to more patients,” said Paul Hudson, who heads Novartis’s drugs business, adding the company sees Xiidra “well positioned for blockbuster potential” topping $1 billion annual sales.

7969,"WASHINGTON   - Automakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump to delay a decision due next week on whether to impose steep tariffs on imported cars and auto parts on national security grounds for up to six months as talks continue with the European Union and Japan. In February, the Commerce Department submitted its “Section 232” national security report. Trump has until May 18 to act, but four auto executives who have spoken to administration officials say he is likely to extend that deadline by another 180 days. He may also announce a specific date to impose new duties if no deal is reached. Administration officials say Trump could still opt to impose the tariffs by May 18, but believe that after a series of investment announcements by automakers - including one by General Motors Co on Wednesday of $700 million in three Ohio plants - he will likely delay the tariffs amid a trade battle with China. The auto tariffs face wide opposition in Congress. The White House refuses to turn over the Commerce report to Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who has been demanding to see it.  On Wednesday, 159 House of Representatives members led by Ways and Means Committee Vice Chair Terri Sewell wrote White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow to urge him to advise Trump against “imposing trade restrictions that could harm the auto sector and the American economy.” The letter from 79 Democrats and 81 Republicans seen by Reuters warned that imposing tariffs on parts in cars “may overlap with motorcycles, recreational vehicles, construction equipment, heavy-duty trucks, farming equipment, powersports vehicles, and others.” The White House did not immediately comment. Administration officials have said tariff threats on autos are a way to win concessions from Japan and the EU. Last year, Trump agreed not to impose tariffs as long as talks with the two trading partners were proceeding in a productive manner. The industry says tariffs of up to 25 percent on millions of imported cars and parts would add thousands of dollars to vehicle costs and potentially lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses throughout the U.S. economy. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing GM, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp and others, said automakers adamantly opposed new tariffs. “At the end of the day, you can either have tariffs or investments, but you can’t have both,” she said. The Commerce Department started its investigation in May 2018 at Trump’s request to determine the effects of imports on national security. U.S. light-duty vehicle prices would increase by $2,750 on average, including U.S.-built vehicles, reducing annual U.S. sales by 1.3 million units and forcing many consumers to the used-car market, according to a think tank report released last year. Major automaker groups said last year the cumulative effect for the United States would be an $83 billion annual price increase and argued there was no evidence auto imports posed a national security risk.

8070,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT   - German prosecutors imposed a 535 million euro ($598 million) fine on German luxury carmaker Porsche AG, a unit of Volkswagen, as punishment for lapses in supervisory duties which allowed the company to cheat diesel emissions tests. Prosecutors in the southern city of Stuttgart on Tuesday said that the company’s development department had neglected its legal obligations, which ultimately led to the sale of diesel cars that spewed excessive pollution levels. The fine against Porsche follows a 1 billion euro penalty for management lapses imposed against Volkswagen by prosecutors in Braunschweig, and a fine of 800 million euros against Audi by prosecutors in Munich, Germany last year. U.S. authorities disclosed Volkswagen’s systematic emissions cheating on Sept. 18, 2015, sparking the biggest business scandal in the company’s history which has cost Volkswagen Group 30 billion euros in penalties and fines. VW, Porsche and Audi all sold diesel engine cars which failed to conform to clean air rules and cheated emissions tests. German prosecutors have pursued individual engineers and took action against the companies for lack of oversight because managers failed to prevent heavily polluting cars from hitting European roads. Prosecutors said Porsche had not appealed the findings by the prosecutor. Porsche confirmed the fine and said that prosecutors’ proceedings against the company had come to an end. The fine does not hinder ongoing proceedings against individual people in relation to Porsche’s diesel manipulations, the prosecutors added.

8121,"NEW YORK   - Wall Street’s indexes and bond yields ended down but well above their session lows while oil futures settled higher as investors bet that U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to raise tariffs on China would not materialize. Trump tweeted on Sunday that the United States would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week, causing investors to seek safety and flee from risky assets. On Monday, Trump sharply criticized China.   But as Monday’s session wore on, the initial shock from the threats appeared to wear off. U.S. Treasury yields pared some of their declines. Oil futures reversed course to settle slightly higher after a volatile day as rising tensions between the United States and Iran helped buoy prices. The futures had earlier touched a one-month low due to Trump’s tweets. [O/R]  In stocks, the S&P 500 closed down 0.4% after falling as much as 1.6% during the session.   “Investors are warming up to the idea that its more of a negotiation tactic than it is a petulant child screaming bloody murder,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. Fears about trade war escalation were also calmed somewhat by a statement from China’s foreign ministry on Monday that a Chinese delegation was still preparing to go to United States for trade talks. “Right now the contingent from China is still coming. If that changes, then the market narrative and the market reaction might also change,” said Nolte.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 66.47 points, or 0.25%, to 26,438.48, the S&P 500 lost 13.17 points, or 0.45%, to 2,932.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 40.71 points, or 0.5%, to 8,123.29. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.88% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.65%. In comparison, the Shanghai SE Composite had closed up 5.6% in its biggest one-day percentage drop since February 2016.  The U.S. dollar slipped to a five-week low against the yen and fell versus other currencies on Monday after Trump said he would sharply raise tariffs on Chinese goods this week, risking the derailment of the trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Volume, though, was thin overall with London and Tokyo markets closed for holidays. The dollar weakened 0.30% versus the yen to 110.89 per dollar.

8275,"  - Wearable device maker Fitbit Inc reported better-than expected first-quarter results and reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast on Wednesday, as it sells more smartwatches and wearable devices that track health at affordable prices. Shares of the company rose 1.5 percent to $5.45 in late trade. Fitbit, which helped pioneer the wearable devices craze, posted year-over-year trackers growth for the first time in three years, getting a boost from its new Inspire line. Smartwatch sales also more than doubled in the quarter. The San Francisco-based company said new devices launched in the past 12 months, including the Inspire brand, made up 67 percent of revenue in the quarter. Fitbit said it sold 2.9 million devices in the quarter, 36 percent higher than a year-ago. Average selling prices fell 19 percent to $91 per device as it focused on cheaper devices to compete with tech-heavyweights Apple Inc  and Samsung . Analysts expected the company to sell 2 million devices at an average selling price of $109.33, according to data from FactSet. To keep pace with rivals, Fitbit has focused on value prices - selling Inspire at $69.95 and the HR version, capable of heart rate monitoring, at $99.95. Apple’s smartwatches start at $279 and Samsung’s watches and trackers lead in at $200. Fitbit’s Health Solutions business grew 70 percent in the quarter and posted revenue of $30.5 million. The unit is focused on subscription-based fitness coaching services that connect users with doctors, hospitals and lifestyle coaches. “We think Fitbit is on the right track pushing to get its trackers and smartwatches on as many wrists as possible, and then ultimately leveraging the user-base and technology for its healthcare initiatives,” said Alicia Reese, senior associate, equity research, Wedbush Securities Inc.

8363,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.   - Talks between the United States and China aimed at resolving their trade dispute will likely be resolved “one way or the other” in the next two weeks, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said on Tuesday. “It won’t go on forever. I think, at some point, in any negotiation you realize we’re close to getting something done so we’re going to keep going,” Mulvaney said at the Milken  Institute Global Conference. “On the other hand, at some point, you can think this is not going to get anywhere. I think you will know, one way or the other, in the next couple of weeks.” Mulvaney spoke only days after data came out showing that the United States economy grew a stronger than expected 3.2 percent during the first three months of the year and said that strong growth is going to help support President Donald Trump as he prepares for the 2020 election. “We think the economy has been good for everyone,” Mulvaney said. “We can ride that to the 2020 election. People know what is good for them.” Mulvaney said policy makers are focusing on solving wage inequality. He said the White House plans to make strong economic growth, at a time the expansion is well into its 10th year, healthcare and trade into key topics for the campaign. He also said Trump, a Republican, will benefit from the fact that Democrats have more than a dozen candidates running for president and “we have weak competitors.” Mulvaney currently is acting chief of staff but he said he expects to keep the job permanently and that he has improved morale in the White House since replacing John Kelly in the job in January. He said he does not expect a lot of change in top administration positions before the election. The Trump administration has had an especially high rate of turnover with his homeland security secretary being among the most recent to leave.

8469,"LONDON/EDINBURGH   - Royal Bank of Scotland is searching for a new chief executive after Ross McEwan resigned, signaling a fresh start  as it heads for full private ownership after a state bailout. New Zealand-born McEwan, who has led RBS since October 2013, has a 12-month notice period and will remain in his position until a successor has been appointed and an orderly handover has taken place, the bank said on Thursday. RBS chairman Howard Davies said the company had started a worldwide search for a successor, which would include both internal and external candidates. Davies played down speculation that Alison Rose, the chief executive of RBS’s commercial arm and who was recently also promoted to the role of deputy CEO of NatWest, was in pole position for the job, seen as one of the toughest in UK banking. “There is no favorite, it’s an open process and we’ve only just begun,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the bank’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, adding that headhunter Spencer Stewart had been appointed to assist the search. McEwan told reporters that he felt it was the right time to leave after turning around the bank’s once-dire finances, resulting in two consecutive years of profit and the restoration of dividend payments a decade after the financial crisis. McEwan remains undecided on his next move but has not ruled out taking another role in finance. “We’ll keep our connections up here (in Britain). Our daughter and her husband and our grandson will be staying up here. Our other daughter will be heading back down.  “So to be honest we haven’t made any calls on what we’ll do next. I don’t think you can do that when you’re sitting in a job like this,” he said. McEwan said his “only regret” was falling short on targets to improve RBS’s customer service, with the bank languishing toward the bottom of customer satisfaction tables. But the bank remains 62 percent owned by the UK government more than 10 years after its 45 billion pounds taxpayer rescue at the peak of the 2008 credit crunch and is still fighting to restore its public image after a series of crisis-era scandals. Executives at the shareholder meeting faced fresh complaints over executive pay and alleged mistreatment of troubled borrowers by its controversial Global Restructuring Group. Despite being among the lowest in Britain’s banking sector, salary and bonus payments earned by the 61-year old have attracted considerable scrutiny, particularly in the years before RBS returned to profit. McEwan’s total remuneration was 3.58 million pounds in 2018, 97 times the pay of the bank’s median employee and 143 times its lowest paid staff. Under his watch, the bank also shelled out $4.9 billion to settle its largest-ever regulatory penalty for misselling of high-risk mortgage backed securities between 2005 and 2008, when it was one of the world’s biggest banks by assets. The shareholder meeting was also targeted by climate change activists carrying banners saying “Fossil Banks, No thanks” in an echo of the Extinction Rebellion protest which focused on the City of London earlier on Thursday. McEwan’s departure is the second major change in RBS’s senior executive team in fewer than six months following the appointment of Katie Murray as the bank’s chief financial officer last December. If Rose, a 20-year veteran of the bank, should succeed McEwan, RBS would become the first British bank to have two women in its highest ranking roles at the same time. There had been speculation about McEwan’s future since finance chief and fellow New Zealander Ewen Stevenson announced he was leaving last May. Some analysts suggested the CEO’s departure might not be ideal timing for the bank, just months before Brexit and with dark clouds looming over the UK housing market. Shares in the bank were trading down 2.7 percent to 249.7 pence by 1500 GMT. “We are disappointed by this news. RBS’s key financial target is delivery of 12 percent-plus “all-in” return on tangible equity next year, that is by any stretch demanding,” analysts at KBW said in a note. “Ross was adamant that the target would be delivered. Without his drive, the question must be far more open.” McEwan received warm praise from his chairman Davies but not all investors were impressed by his legacy. Retail investor George Fraser told Reuters his RBS shares were decimated by the financial crisis and he was indifferent to the CEO’s departure despite better results of late. “If I’m playing with Andy Murray in doubles you’ll know he’s the one carrying me - but in a board you’re not always sure. “I don’t think the shares will recover in my lifetime that’s for sure.”    ($1 = 0.7751 pounds) ",RBS begins global hunt for CEO to replace McEwan,"April 25, 2019 /  6:34 AM ",london edinburgh royal bank of scotland is searching for a new chief executive after ross mcewan resigned signaling a fresh start as it heads for full private ownership after a state bailout new zealand born mcewan who has led rbs since october  has a  month notice period and will remain in his position until a successor has been appointed and an orderly handover has taken place the bank said on thursday rbs chairman howard davies said the company had started a worldwide search for a successor which would include both internal and external candidates davies played down speculation that alison rose the chief executive of rbs s commercial arm and who was recently also promoted to the role of deputy ceo of natwest was in pole position for the job seen as one of the toughest in uk banking there is no favorite it s an open process and we ve only just begun he told reporters on the sidelines of the bank s annual meeting in edinburgh adding that headhunter spencer stewart had been appointed to assist the search mcewan told reporters that he felt it was the right time to leave after turning around the bank s once dire finances resulting in two consecutive years of profit and the restoration of dividend payments a decade after the financial crisis mcewan remains undecided on his next move but has not ruled out taking another role in finance we ll keep our connections up here in britain our daughter and her husband and our grandson will be staying up here our other daughter will be heading back down so to be honest we haven t made any calls on what we ll do next i don t think you can do that when you re sitting in a job like this he said mcewan said his only regret was falling short on targets to improve rbs s customer service with the bank languishing toward the bottom of customer satisfaction tables but the bank remains  percent owned by the uk government more than  years after its  billion pounds taxpayer rescue at the peak of the  credit crunch and is still fighting to restore its public image after a series of crisis era scandals executives at the shareholder meeting faced fresh complaints over executive pay and alleged mistreatment of troubled borrowers by its controversial global restructuring group despite being among the lowest in britain s banking sector salary and bonus payments earned by the  year old have attracted considerable scrutiny particularly in the years before rbs returned to profit mcewan s total remuneration was   million pounds in   times the pay of the bank s median employee and  times its lowest paid staff under his watch the bank also shelled out   billion to settle its largest ever regulatory penalty for misselling of high risk mortgage backed securities between  and  when it was one of the world s biggest banks by assets the shareholder meeting was also targeted by climate change activists carrying banners saying fossil banks no thanks in an echo of the extinction rebellion protest which focused on the city of london earlier on thursday mcewan s departure is the second major change in rbs s senior executive team in fewer than six months following the appointment of katie murray as the bank s chief financial officer last december if rose a  year veteran of the bank should succeed mcewan rbs would become the first british bank to have two women in its highest ranking roles at the same time there had been speculation about mcewan s future since finance chief and fellow new zealander ewen stevenson announced he was leaving last may some analysts suggested the ceo s departure might not be ideal timing for the bank just months before brexit and with dark clouds looming over the uk housing market shares in the bank were trading down   percent to   pence by  gmt we are disappointed by this news rbs s key financial target is delivery of  percent plus all in return on tangible equity next year that is by any stretch demanding analysts at kbw said in a note ross was adamant that the target would be delivered without his drive the question must be far more open mcewan received warm praise from his chairman davies but not all investors were impressed by his legacy retail investor george fraser told  his rbs shares were decimated by the financial crisis and he was indifferent to the ceo s departure despite better results of late if i m playing with andy murray in doubles you ll know he s the one carrying me but in a board you re not always sure i don t think the shares will recover in my lifetime that s for sure    pounds ,Boeing Crisis,0.23087799549102783

The agreement lifts a cloud that has hung over Musk as Tesla tries to ramp up production of its most important vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, and make a profit at the same time. “It could really have turned out far worse for him,” said Stephen Diamond, a professor of securities law at Santa Clara University. “The consequences of thumbing his nose at the SEC could have been far worse for him and the company.” Tesla has struggled with logistics difficulties in delivering its Model 3 to global customers, a declining share price and lingering questions about the sustainability of demand. Earlier this week, the electric vehicle maker posted a $702 million loss, and warned of a loss in the second quarter. Musk’s lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment. The SEC sued Musk last year after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The agency said the tweet, which sent Tesla’s share price up as much as 13.3 percent, violated securities laws. Musk’s privatization plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place. Musk settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company’s lawyers pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company. In February, the SEC accused Musk of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla’s production numbers that had not been vetted by the company’s attorneys, and asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan to hold him in contempt. At an April 4 court hearing, the judge declined to rule on the contempt motion and told the SEC and Musk to work out their differences and come to a settlement. Musk’s lawyers have argued that the February tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement. They also argued the settlement was too ambiguous for Musk to be held in contempt. The new agreement unveiled Friday addresses that ambiguity by listing what kinds of statements must be vetted. They include statements about Tesla’s financial condition, proposed or potential deals, production numbers, performance projections, financing or lending arrangements and Musk’s own transactions in the company’s securities. It also gives the company’s board of directors the right to seek preapproval about additional topics if they believe doing so would protect shareholders’ interests. Diamond said the new language adds clarity to the original agreement and places significant restraints on Musk’s use of Twitter. “Any attempt by Musk to circumvent the process will be much more easily policed,” he said.  Musk has been an outspoken critic of the SEC throughout his legal dispute with the SEC, which he once dubbed the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission.” In the early morning of Feb. 26, after the regulator filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: “Something is broken with SEC oversight.” Musk has been CEO of Tesla since 2008 and has more than 25 million followers on Twitter.

8505,"HOUSTON   - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp on Friday reported lower profits, citing lower margins and refining weaknesses, areas that have plagued the two oil companies off and on for more than a year. Exxon posted the first loss in its refining business since 2009, citing the worst refining margins on gasoline and other profits it had seen in a decade. Chevron reported its refining and chemical profits fell 65 percent. Both reported top-line figures that missed Wall Street expectations and were lower than year-ago levels due to weaker crude pricing.  Exxon’s 49 percent drop in first-quarter profit showed the turnaround at the largest U.S. oil producer remains a work in progress. “It was a tough market environment for us this quarter,” Exxon Senior Vice President Jack Williams said on a call with analysts. Exxon continued to spend heavily to boost output, with capital spending up 42 percent over a year ago as it poured new investment into its shale and offshore operations. Investors have been pressing oil companies to cut back on spending and increase returns to shareholders.  Its first-quarter profit fell to $2.35 billion, or 55 cents a share, from $4.65 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year ago. Analysts had expected Exxon to earn 70 cents per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon estimates. “Clearly, the corner is further away than we expected and we expect this to lead to underperformance in the near term,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a client note. At Chevron, investors ignored earnings that beat estimates and focused on its $33 billion bid for rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  Occidental Petroleum Corp on Wednesday sought to derail Chevron’s offer with a unsolicited, $38 billion bid for Anadarko. Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth told analysts on Friday joint integration planning to combine the two companies had begun. He declined to say if it would raise its offer for Anadarko, saying it had a signed agreement with Anadarko.  “We would not be surprised to see Chevron raise its offer,” wrote analysts at Edward Jones in a research note, saying they believed the company’s bid will “ultimately be the successful one.” Chevron’s production rose and achieved higher profit from its U.S. shale business, offsetting some of the drop in  international oil and gas  earnings. But sharp declines in overall refining and chemicals knocked first-quarter net to $2.65 billion, or $1.39 per share, from $3.64 billion, or $1.90 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street had expected $1.30 per share. Chevron’s daily production of oil and gas rose to 3.04 billion of barrels, from 2.85 billions of barrels in the year-ago period, boosted by a 55 percent increase in its Permian output.   The Anadarko takeover battle prompted analysts to ask Exxon about new acquisitions in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. shale field. “I would be surprised if over time we did not pick up some more Permian acreage,” Williams said. He added that Exxon “doesn’t need to.” Growing output in the Permian Basin was a bright spot at Exxon, rising to 226,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It remains on track to produce 1 million barrels by 2024, and would use half of its existing inventory by then, he said. Exxon’s oil and gas production rose 2 percent overall to 4 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 3.9 million bpd in the same period the year prior. Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon dipped 2.1 percent to close at $80.49 Friday. Shares of San Ramona, California-based Chevron slipped less than 1 percent to close at $117.10.

8531,"  - Initial optimism over first-quarter results from Starbucks Corp was waning fast on Wall Street on Friday, as analysts questioned the longer-term prospects of its new sales push given subdued overall customer traffic numbers especially in China. The company on Thursday beat brokerage estimates for quarterly same-store sales on the back of demand for its new Cloud Macchiato, Matcha tea and cold brews in the United States. However, BTIG’s Peter Saleh was one of a number of sector analysts who said while customers forking out for higher-priced new drinks had helped drive growth in same-store sales, “anemic” traffic at cafes remained a concern. He and others pointed to a 1 percent decline in footfall at cafes in the Chinese market, viewed as crucial to the chain’s growth for the foreseeable future.  More broadly, transaction numbers, the substitute analysts use for customer traffic, were unchanged in all three of the company’s global regions. Shares in the company, which hit a record high after the results on Thursday, fell 1 percent in morning trade. “We remain cautious given near-term headwinds surrounding China, including cannibalization, increasing competition (and) a slowing economy,” Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan said.      Starbucks has also poured money into beefing up its delivery network in China as it battles with local startup Luckin Coffee, whose speedy growth led it to file for an IPO in the United States earlier this week. New menu items and partnerships with delivery services, the heart of the company’s strategy to win back customers lost to artisanal coffee shops and cheaper fast-food rivals, did help Starbucks’ sales in its home market. However, analysts said growth in China may continue to be subdued.  Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she expects store expansion in China to take priority over comparable sales growth.  She downgraded her rating on Starbucks’ to “market perform” from “outperform”, arguing that the company facing tough sales comparisons later on in 2019 from last year and the current rich valuation of shares meant the stock had limited room to rise. “Investors will be hesitant to invest new money in a stock with a topline that, while still strong, is unlikely to meaningfully accelerate,” Herzog said.    Still, the company’s solid same-store growth in the United States, improving profit margins and a lower tax rate for the rest of the year led at least 6 Wall Street brokerages to raise their price targets on the stock to as high as $81. 11 of 29 brokerages rate Starbucks “buy” or higher, 17 “hold” and 1 “sell” or lower. Their median price target is $75.

8561,"TOKYO   - Nintendo Co Ltd’s shares fell as much as 5 percent in early Tokyo trading, a day after the gaming company offered conservative earnings guidance and urged caution on the roll-out of its Switch console in China. Nintendo’s shares were down 2 percent at 1106 local time (0206 GMT), underperforming the benchmark index which was down 0.8 percent. The Kyoto-based gaming company said on Thursday it expected to shift 18 million Switch hardware units this financial year, which would give the console a total install base of 53 million units. Despite this, Nintendo is forecasting a meager 5.4 percent rise in Switch software sales on a year earlier to 125 million units. That is seen as conservative by many analysts, with the Switch’s games pipeline this year including two full Pokemon titles and the latest in the popular Luigi’s Mansion and Animal Crossing series. “Whether it would reach its targets became a big theme last year so Nintendo has released figures it can be confident of hitting,” said analyst Hideki Yasuda at Ace Securities. The guidance creates “a very low bar for the rest of the year,” Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note. Nintendo's stock price is subject to intense scrutiny by analysts, investors and fans, with its up and downs inspiring heated debate on social media.

8569,"MEXICO CITY   - Uber, Didi Chuxing and other ride-hailing firms on Thursday criticized a host of new regulations of the sector in Mexico’s capital city, which include a ban on cash fares that could exclude many potential customers who lack bank accounts.  Mexico City’s government on Wednesday issued rules that prohibit cash payments for ride-hailing services, require drivers to register with the city, and ban the use of cheaper cars, among other measures. The regulations mark a setback for San Francisco-based Uber in one of its largest markets ahead of a planned initial public offering. The company has fought hard for the right to accept cash fares in Mexico, arguing that it is a critical tool to reach the millions of Mexicans who do not use credit or debit cards. In a joint statement, Uber, China’s Didi, Spain’s Cabify and Greece’s Beat said Mexico City’s government agreed in February to work with the sector as it updated regulation. But the new rules were issued “unilaterally and without prior dialogue,” the firms said. “We are concerned that, as it stands, this reform creates a series of barriers to entry,” the companies said in a joint statement, which was also signed by Estonia’s Bolt and Mexico’s Laudrive. They said drivers could see a hit to their earnings. Mexico City’s transport ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Minister Andres Lajous told a news conference that the rules were aimed at rooting out corruption and leveling the playing field for ride-hailing firms and taxi drivers.  The regulations also prohibit pre-paid cards, which are frequently used by tech companies in Mexico to reach customers who do not have credit or debit cards. Uber began accepting cash in Mexico City last year after Mexico’s Supreme Court struck down a ban on cash fares in the western state of Colima.  Uber said in a separate statement on Wednesday that the Mexico City regulation contradicts the Supreme Court’s decision, which it has argued should be used as a precedent nationwide.  Didi said in a statement on Thursday that banning cash payments would affect the unbanked population and potentially worsen mobility throughout Mexico City.

8634,"BEIJING   - German automaker Volkswagen AG’s joint venture with China’s Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co (JAC) plans to invest 5.06 billion yuan ($750.8 million) in a new electric car factory in eastern Hefei city, according to local authorities. A document posted online by the Hefei Economic and Technological Development Area on Monday showed that Volkswagen and JAC had obtained approval from environmental authorities to build a plant capable of producing 100,000 all-electric battery cars a year. Volkswagen Group China on Thursday confirmed the numbers that had been included in previous official documents and said JAC-Volkswagen would launch its first model soon. A spokesperson for the joint venture confirmed plans for the plant, saying the approval represented an “orderly advancement of the project”, and the venture’s first electric model, the E20X, will be launched this year. The German company, China’s largest foreign automaker with sales of 4.21 million cars on the mainland and Hong Kong in 2018, has pledged to ramp up production of zero-emission vehicles as part of its growth strategy in the country. Volkswagen has said it plans to produce more than 22 million electric cars in the next 10 years, with over half of them built in China. It plans to launch 14 new energy vehicle models in China this year. VW’s joint venture with JAC, approved in 2017, said last year it would launch a research and development center. It also planned to introduce the SEAT brand to China by 2020-2021. Reuters reported this month that Volkswagen is in talks with South Korean battery maker SK Innovation to accelerate electric vehicle development.  China’s car market, the world’s largest, contracted for the first time last year since the 1990s. However, the new energy vehicle segment is still growing rapidly and NEV sales jumped 61.7 percent to 1.3 million units in 2018. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers has said new energy vehicle sales could hit 1.6 million units this year. Volkswagen has started building a $2.5 billion new energy vehicle plant in Shanghai with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, which will make VW’s luxury Audi AG brand cars.

8647,"PARIS   - Peugeot maker PSA Group reported a 1.1 percent decline in first-quarter revenue, as a sales decline outside Europe and currency challenges outweighed pricing improvements. The French carmaker’s shares fell on Thursday after it said revenue dropped to 17.98 billion euros ($20.05 billion) in the January-March quarter from 18.2 billion a year earlier. PSA “remains fully focused” on its medium-term performance plan while pursuing the integration of the Opel-Vauxhall business acquired from General Motors in 2017, Chief Financial Officer Philippe de Rovira said. While the Opel deal has bolstered PSA’s European position, overseas sales have suffered from a sustained collapse at its Chinese joint ventures and have been compounded by the carmaker’s withdrawal from Iran last year. Revenue at the core automotive division fell 1.8 percent to 14.16 billion euros, as vehicle sales by Opel to its former parent tailed off. Exchange-rate setbacks also weighed on revenue to overcome a 3.6 percent boost from improved pricing and mix, which reflects a sales shift to plusher models. Those metrics, driven by PSA’s performance in Europe, bode well for its future earnings, some analysts said. “Investors might be willing to look through the weak headline figure, given how key mix is for profitability,” Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a note to clients. The carmaker’s shares nonetheless fell in early trading, and were 1.9 percent lower at 23.82 euros as of 0725 GMT, paring their 30 percent gain this year. Global sales volumes fell 15.7 percent to 886,400 vehicles in the quarter. Excluding Iran, deliveries fell 6.1 percent, weighed down by a 30 percent decline in Latin America. Overall revenue was broadly in line with analyst estimates in an Infront Data poll, and PSA reiterated its medium-term guidance for an average 4.5 percent automotive operating margin over the 2019-2021 period. The company said it now expects the Latin American auto market to shrink 2 percent in 2019. PSA saw the European market as being stable, while it saw China falling by 3 percent and Russia growing 5 percent.

8723,"  - Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp is looking to acquire a 5 percent stake in German payments company Wirecard AG, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. SoftBank has engaged financial advisers and is working on a deal to acquire bonds that can be converted into Wirecard shares, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. A deal could be announced as early as this month, if an agreement is reached, the report added.

8745,"  - Lyft Inc received some badly needed support on Tuesday, as analysts at banks that had worked on its initial public offering urged clients to buy the ride-hailing company’s beleaguered shares.    Following the required 25-day wait for deal underwriters to issue an investment opinion following an IPO, at least 10 of the banks that brought Lyft public gave positive recommendations on a stock that has slumped 30 percent from its opening price on March 29, its first day of trading. KeyBank appeared to be the only bank launching coverage on Tuesday that did not recommend buying Lyft, instead assigning it a “sector weight” rating and warning of slowing growth. As of Tuesday, 14 out of 22 analysts covering Lyft recommended buying the stock, seven were “neutral” and one recommended selling. Lyft’s stock slump since its IPO has raised concerns about the valuation of larger rival Uber Technologies Inc as it prepares to promote its own long-anticipated public listing, expected next month.  Both companies have warned they may never become profitable, making it difficult for investors to estimate how much they might be worth. “Uber’s filing has added pressure, and we acknowledge that the upcoming roadshow could create more near-term uncertainty, but we believe Lyft continues to execute well,” JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in his research report, assigning Lyft a $82 price target. The stock was trading Tuesday afternoon at $60.79. Before Tuesday, only banks that had not worked on Lyft’s IPO were permitted to offer recommendations on the stock, and the balance of opinion in that group was decidedly more skeptical. Just four of them had recommended Lyft’s shares, while six initiated the stock as a “hold” and one as a “sell.” Despite regulations that separate investment banking and research operations, it is rare for analysts at banks that have participated in an IPO to recommend selling that stock when they issue their initial opinions. Even after Tuesday’s “buy” ratings, the stock dipped 0.5%. Due to its lack of profitability and dual class share structure guaranteeing insiders control of the company, Lyft is not eligible to be included in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index. But if it were, its poor average analyst rating would rank it in the bottom 10% of the benchmark index, among companies including Kraft Heinz Co and Gap Inc, according to Refinitiv data. “We expect steady deceleration in market growth and Lyft’s pace of share gain, which seems likely to prevent revenue and adjusted EBITDA from meaningfully exceeding our expectations,” KeyBank analyst Andy Hargreaves. Piper Jaffray expected “solid near-term top line results,” saying Lyft had been gaining market share in recent quarters, but that the path to positive net income would be a “multi-year journey.” It initiated coverage with an overweight rating and target price of $78. Most of the analysts were confident of Lyft’s long-term fortunes, despite the competition from Uber. Reuters has reported that Uber plans to sell around $10 billion worth of stock at a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. Its IPO is on track for some time in May. Lyft has a stock market value of around $17 billion.  At least six of Lyft’s underwriters, including Canaccord, Cowen and JMP Securities, are also backing the Uber deal, according to SEC filings.

8825,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled a new direction in U.S.-China trade talks and said any deal would need “a different structure,” fueling uncertainty over current negotiations.  In an early Wednesday morning post on Twitter, Trump said the current track appeared “too hard to get done” and cited difficulties such as verification, but he gave no other details about what he or his administration was looking for amid ongoing negotiations.  Representatives for the White House did not respond to a request for more information about the president’s statement.  “Our trade deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion,” Trump wrote in his post.  U.S. stocks slipped after his comments, but ended Wednesday up after release of the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, which indicated a gradual approach to interest rates hikes. [nL2N1SU26Q] On Thursday, the Trump comments on China trade talks and the launch of a U.S. national security probe into U.S. auto imports dented shares of Asian automakers. [nL5N1SV0CC] Trump’s statement comes amid the negotiations between the world’s two largest economies after potential tariffs on both sides raised fears of a trade war, even as some tensions have eased over signs of some possible progress.  Both sides claimed victory on Monday and pledged to continue talking after last week’s round in Washington produced pledges that China would import more American energy and agricultural commodities so as to trim the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China, although there were no specifics. [nL3N1SS1VH] “China unswervingly defends its core interests, and did not make any promise on cutting its trade surplus with the U.S. by a specific figure,” Gao Feng, spokesman at the Chinese commerce ministry, said on Thursday.  But both sides are willing to strengthen cooperation in agricultural, energy, medical, high-tech products as well as the financial sector, Gao told reporters at a regular briefing in Beijing.  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was expected to visit China next week to help finalize an agreement. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that Ross aimed to negotiate “a framework” that could then turn into “binding agreements ... between companies.”  “China welcomes the U.S. in sending senior trade delegations to China soon, and hopes China and the U.S. can work together to actively implement the measures specified in the joint statement according to the understanding both sides achieved recently in D.C.,” Gao said.  Trump on Tuesday, however, told reporters he was not pleased with recent talks, calling them “a start”. [nW1N1R101T]     China hopes both sides will move to push bilateral trade cooperation to achieve “positive” and “realistic” goals, the Chinese commerce ministry spokesman said.  Any firm deal is likely to take a long time, according to most observers, and U.S. officials have threatened to return to tariffs, which prompted the current standoff, if needed.  Trump threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese goods.  Trade talks have also been clouded by separate negotiations over the nuclear weapons program in North Korea, which counts China as its sole major ally.  Trump is seeking to win a major deal with Pyongyang to denuclearize and is eyeing a June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. On Tuesday, however, Trump raised doubts the meeting would take place as planned, and suggested Kim’s recent meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping had influenced Kim to harden his stance.

8889,"  - Missouri legislators convened on Friday to weigh the possible impeachment of Governor Eric Greitens, who has been embroiled in separate sex and fundraising scandals that have led to mounting pressure for his resignation. The Republican-controlled Missouri General Assembly began a special session in Jefferson City, Missouri, the state capital, to consider what disciplinary steps to take against the first-term Republican governor, including impeachment, after hearing the recommendations of a special House of Representatives investigative panel. Greitens has vowed to remain in office while he fights to clear his name. No Missouri governor has ever been impeached. Greitens, a 44-year-old former Navy SEAL commando once seen as a rising star in the Republican Party, was previously charged with felony invasion of privacy in connection with an admitted extramarital affair in 2015 with a hairdresser before he was elected. He has said he is innocent, the relationship was consensual and he was the subject of a political witch hunt.  On Monday, however, St. Louis prosecutors dropped the charge before his trial got under way after a state judge agreed to allow the defense to call as a witness Circuit Attorney for the City of St. Louis Kim Gardner, a Democrat whom defense attorneys accused of misconduct. Prosecutors said they would refile the case.    Greitens was accused of taking a photo of his lover in a state of undress without her consent and making it accessible by computer to use as retaliation should she divulge their relationship. He has denied threatening to blackmail her and his attorneys have noted the alleged photograph has never been produced.  Meanwhile, the governor faces a separate trial on an unrelated charge of computer tampering. St. Louis prosecutors allege he obtained and transmitted a donor list from a military veterans charity he founded in 2007, without the charity’s consent, to aid his political fundraising.  Greitens’ attorney has called the charge “absurd” and said his client is innocent. In Cole County, which also received information on the case, prosecutor Mark Richardson said on Friday he had decided not to file a criminal charge. Jefferson City is in Cole County. State officials expect the special House investigative committee, formed in February to examine misconduct allegations against Greitens, to complete its work and present a final report to the Assembly during the special session, which began at 6:30 p.m. local time (2330 GMT) Friday and could last 30 days. The House and Senate are expected to complete their action on the panel’s findings in that time frame.   Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, among others, has said that findings presented in the House committee’s initial report on April 11, detailing allegations of sexual coercion and physical abuse by Greitens, were grounds for impeachment.  The Missouri Constitution counts “moral turpitude,” among other things, as impeachable conduct.

L’Oreal said his departure was “due to the recent announcement by Hermes of the launch of a cosmetics line that may represent a possible conflict of interest.” Dumas confirmed in March that Hermes, which is principally known for its leather handbags but also already operates in perfumes, was due to branch into make-up by 2020, with skincare products due later.  It will do its own manufacturing rather than license out production, leaning on suppliers in France and Italy.

9122,"NEW YORK   - Wall Street lost ground on Monday, dragged down by financials as underwhelming bank earnings curbed investor enthusiasm. But while all three major U.S. stock indexes edged lower, the S&P 500 remained within a percent of its record high. Following a January-March rally that marked the U.S. stock market’s best quarterly performance in nearly a decade, stocks had been in a holding pattern in April ahead of first quarter reporting season.  Goldman Sachs dipped 3.8% after the investment bank’s first quarter revenue came in below analyst expectations. Citigroup Inc posted higher-than-expected earnings as cost-cutting offset falling revenues. Its shares ended the session nominally lower, dropping 0.1%. “We’re coming off of a strong week last week,” said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. “So any bad news or earnings reports this week, such as we saw with Goldman and Citigroup, is going to take away some of that momentum.”  With first quarter reporting season shifting into high gear, analysts now see S&P 500 companies posting a 2.1% year-on-year decline in profits. While an improvement over recent estimates, it would still mark the first annual decline in earnings since 2016. “We’ll get a clearer sense as we move through the week,” Sroka added. “As we move into other sectors we’ll get a clearer picture of corporate earnings and the economy.”  Bank of America Co, Morgan Stanley, Netflix Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Textron Inc, Honeywell International Inc, Schlumberger NV and  American Express Co are among the closely-watched earnings expected this holiday-shortened week. Aside from earnings, “we still have to be watchful for global geopolitical events such as the U.S.-China trade discussion,” warned Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. Sources said U.S. negotiators have softened their demands that China curb industrial subsidies as a condition for a trade deal, marking a retreat from a core U.S. objective. “It’s a net positive,” Stovall said. “The president wants to get some sort of deal signed so he can move on.”   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.53 points, or 0.1%, to 26,384.77, the S&P 500 lost 1.83 points, or 0.06%, to 2,905.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.15 points, or 0.1%, to 7,976.01. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, six ended the session in the red. Financials were the biggest percentage losers, closing down 0.6% and snapping their three-day winning streak.  Waste Management Inc rose 2.4% following its announcement that it would buy smaller rival Advanced Disposal Services Inc for about $3 billion. Boeing Co slid 1.1% after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the planemaker should fix and “rebrand” its 737 MAX jet. Lyft Inc extended its slide, falling 6.3%. The ride-hailing platform, which had its market debut in March, is now trading about 22% below its $72 offer price. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.57-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 56 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 79 new highs and 46 new lows.

9289,"SAN FRANCISCO   - SoftBank Group Corp has agreed to give up board seats and access to sensitive information, take a more passive role in startups and make other concessions to get government clearance for its technology deals in the United States. These maneuvers come as the Japanese investor confronts a new U.S. law aimed at cracking down on foreign investors. SoftBank’s investment style has made it a frequent visitor of a U.S. government group known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), charged with reviewing foreign investment for national security and competitive risks. “We know the deals are going to be reviewed,” Marcelo Claure, chief operating officer of SoftBank Group Corp, said in an interview with Reuters this week. “We have abided by what the U.S. government wants.” SoftBank likes to take large stakes in companies working on artificial intelligence, data analytics, financial services and self-driving cars - technologies increasingly viewed as critical to national security. This puts them in the crosshairs of a law signed by U.S. President Donald Trump last year expanding the powers of CFIUS. Giving up board seats and access to private information would make SoftBank less of a threat in the eyes of CFIUS, giving its deals a better chance of approval. “We would not accept this if we were in the business of running companies,” Claure said of the concessions. “We’re not. We are in the business of investing.”      Claure declined to provide specifics on investments where SoftBank has had to make concessions or give up board seats and the U.S. government does not comment on CFIUS reviews.  The regulations have deterred many foreign investors from even attempting investment in U.S. tech companies. “Everything is a conversation with the government so you figure you are going to pick your battles,” Claure said. One regulatory battle SoftBank has chosen, so far, to sit out is regarding Uber Technologies Inc’s board seats. As part of an $8 billion investment SoftBank closed in January 2018, which gave it a 16 percent stake in Uber and made it the largest shareholder, SoftBank was supposed to get two board seats. SoftBank successfully completed its investment in Uber, but has not yet completed the formal CFIUS review necessary for the two board seats, Claure told Reuters. As a result, more than a year later, Claure and Rajeev Misra, who oversees SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund, have not taken their board seats. The result is that Uber on Thursday kicked off its initial public offering with a board of 12 directors, not the 17 members long ago agreed upon. Another three independent directors cannot be appointed until after Misra and Claure join the board.    By the time Uber’s shares start trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May, SoftBank may have missed its opening. When it becomes public, Uber’s bylaws will change, erasing old agreements with its directors, according to Uber’s IPO filing posted Thursday. Claure said SoftBank may still follow through with seeking CFIUS approval, but added that “it hasn’t been a priority for us” and SoftBank still has the access it wants to Uber’s executives without the board seats. After becoming chief operating officer in May of 2018, Claure increased SoftBank’s presence and lobbying power in Washington. “The first job was to change the conversation with the U.S. government and explain to the U.S. government what is SoftBank,” Claure said. It hired former Ford Motor Co lobbyist Ziad Ojakli to improve relations with regulators. SoftBank added a former White House staffer and a Department of Commerce deputy to its Washington staff last fall, and hired Jeffrey Dressler, previously a national security adviser to members of the U.S. Congress, as its national security policy director in January. Even without board seats or more control in a company, SoftBank still wields a lot of influence. SoftBank at times requires companies to meet performance goals before receiving money and generally prohibits founders and employees from selling their company shares.     SoftBank last month unveiled a $5 billion fund to invest in technology companies in Latin America, where it will be well outside of CFIUS’ control. Claure said SoftBank has already looked at more than 140 companies for possible investment and closed a few deals. But Claure said SoftBank is not retreating from CFIUS. “We will find ways to invest in the United States,” Claure said.

9346,"  - Royal Dutch Shell on Thursday agreed to sell its 22.45 percent stake in the Caesar Tonga field in the Gulf of Mexico for $965 million in cash to a subsidiary of Israeli energy conglomerate Delek Group. Located in the Gulf of Mexico, 300 km south of Louisiana, the field’s current production rate is 71,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent, with 90 percent of the output being oil. The Caesar Tonga field has 30 more years of life and assuming no change in the rate of production, Delek’s interest reflects 78 million barrels of oil equivalent reserves, Delek, Israel’s government-owned gas retailer, said. As part of the deal, Delek will sign a long-term agreement with a Shell affiliate to purchase oil produced from the field for 30 years at either market prices or prices matched to third-party offers. Delek Chief Executive Asaf Bartfeld said the deal, along with exploration in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, would boost its position in the international energy market. Shell said the deal was likely to close by the end of the third quarter and the latest stake sale would contribute to its ongoing divestment program. The Anglo-Dutch oil company last year sold its Danish upstream business to Norwegian Energy in a deal valued at $1.9 billion.  Shell reported a sharp rise in cash generation in 2018 and said in January it would stick to spending discipline this year even as it looks to divest around $5 billion a year. Its 2018 profit jumped by more than a third to $21.4 billion, the highest since the 2014 oil market downturn. The deal for Caesar Tonga is subject to the right of refusal by Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Equinor ASA and Chevron Corp, which own the rest of the field.

9749,"NEW YORK   - Oil prices edged down on Wednesday after U.S. government data showed a surprise build in crude inventories, but futures held near their highest in almost five months as OPEC-led output cuts and sanctions on Iran tightened the supply outlook.  Brent futures settled at $69.31 a barrel, losing 6 cents. Their session high was $69.96, the strongest since Nov. 12, when they traded above $70. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $62.46 a barrel, falling 12 cents after briefly hitting $62.99, the highest since Nov. 7.   Crude stocks in the United States rose 7.2 million barrels last week, as net imports climbed, production edged higher to a new record and refining rates slowed, the Energy Information Administration said. Analysts had forecast a decrease of 425,000 barrels. [EIA/S] “Crude imports rose and crude exports fell, which translates into considerably higher net imports. Crude oil processing remained lower than usual. Crude oil production increased to a new record level of 12.2 million barrels per day,” said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. “All of this contributed to the large stock build.”  Despite the sharp increase in U.S. crude inventories, market participants said prices were positioned to move up on tightening global supply and signs of demand picking up. “Those are the issues that have supported the market here,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York. “At the end of the day, this market is really bulled up and it wants to trade higher.” Crude oil futures were supported by ongoing efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, a group known as OPEC+, to reduce oil output by about 1.2 million bpd this year.  Supply from OPEC countries hit a four-year low in March, a  Reuters survey found this week. [OPEC/O]  Oil production from Russia fell to 11.3 million bpd last month, but missed the country’s target under the supply deal. In a signal that supply may tighten more, a U.S. official said on Tuesday that three of eight countries granted waivers by Washington to import oil from Iran had cut such purchases to zero, adding that improved oil market conditions would help reduce Iranian crude exports further. But despite also being under U.S. sanctions, Venezuela’s state-run energy company, PDVSA, kept oil exports near 1 million bpd in March, PDVSA documents and Refinitiv Eikon data showed. Signs of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations and positive Chinese and U.S. factory activity data in recent days has also helped market sentiment by easing fears about weakening global oil demand.

9764,"  - Blackstone Group LP, the world largest alternative asset manager, has raised over $22 billion for its latest buyout fund, setting it on course to be the private equity industry’s biggest ever, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The strong fundraising underscores how investors are brushing aside concerns over the private equity sector overheating, as they search for returns that beat the stock market by a wide margin. The industry has raised some $3 trillion from investors since 2012, according to industry tracker Preqin. New York-based Blackstone, led by co-founder Stephen Schwarzman, expects to conclude the fundraising for what will be its eighth buyout fund later this year, said the source, requesting anonymity as the details are confidential.  Blackstone has not set a fundraising target, but it anticipates the buyout fund will overtake Apollo Global Management’s $24.6 billion fund as the largest ever, the source added.  This is a departure from the traditional fundraising model, whereby managers set caps on the size of the fund targeted to allay investor concerns over amassing more capital than they can prudently invest. Blackstone President Jon Gray had said in January the firm expected the fund to exceed $20 billion in size. A Blackstone spokeswoman declined to comment on the progress of the fundraising, which was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.  Blackstone has a target of reaching $1 trillion in assets under management by 2026. At the end of 2018, it had $472.2 billion in total assets under management.  Blackstone, which had $44.4 billion in private equity funds it had raised but yet to invest at the end of 2018, has been pursuing several large leveraged buyouts in recent years.  Last year, it purchased a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp, the parent company of Reuters News, in a $20 billion deal.  Acquisition prices in leveraged buyouts are rising on the back of increased competition for deals, setting off alarm bells among private equity backers. According to Cambridge Associates, a private equity investment adviser, the U.S. industry’s average internal rate of return (IRR), a key benchmark for private equity returns, was just under 10 percent in 2015, the most recent year for which it compiled data.     Blackstone’s seventh flagship buyout fund, which raised $18.6 billion in 2016, has so far posted a net IRR of 21 percent. Its sixth fund, raised in 2011, has a total net IRR of 13 percent.

9772,"TOKYO   - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn’s sudden appearance on Twitter on Wednesday was a surprise move by the businessman that perplexed people and sent journalists scrambling, and not for the first time.  The first tweet from the @carlosghosn account on the social network at 12:51 p.m. (0351 GMT) read, “I’m getting ready to tell the truth about what’s happening. Press conference on Thursday, April 11.”  It did not specify a time or place. Featuring a photo of a smiling, grey-haired Ghosn standing in front of a tree with seasonal cherry blossoms, the account initially lacked the blue tick mark to show it had been verified by the social network.  That left journalists unsure of its authenticity - particularly as the conditions of Ghosn’s $9 million bail preclude him from using the internet. Forty minutes later, when the blue tick appeared, the tweet swept across social media and the account’s followers swelled to almost 20,000, from just a handful earlier.   Some of the replies appeared sympathetic to Ghosn, with others carrying photos of his now-famous exit from a Tokyo detention center last month. “Stood right alongside you with #GiveGhosnBail. Looking forward to hearing your side,” wrote one Twitter user with the name @highmileage.  Ghosn had also caught media off guard when he disguised himself in a workman’s uniform, cap and face mask to try and give waiting reporters the slip on leaving the detention center after his release on bail.   The architect of the Nissan and Renault SA global alliance was then pursued by media as he rode away in a small work van, a Suzuki, topped with a ladder. Ghosn’s dramatic fall from grace began with his arrest in November after getting off a private plane at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. He has since been charged with financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust.  On Wednesday, the Yomiuri newspaper said Tokyo prosecutors will soon decide whether to prosecute Ghosn on further charges. A further arrest could jeopardize the planned news conference.  It remains unclear if Ghosn sent the tweet or it was sent on his behalf. His bail conditions allow him to access a computer at his lawyer’s office but forbid him to use the internet.

9783,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO   - The U.S. Justice Department sued California over a state law that aims to stop the Trump administration from selling or transferring federal lands to private corporations, hitting the state with yet another legal challenge. The lawsuit, filed in federal court on Monday in Sacramento, the state capital, comes less than a month after the Justice Department brought a legal action targeting three California laws largely aimed at protecting illegal immigrants from deportation. “California has once again passed an extreme statute found in no other state to obstruct the federal government, this time by interfering with the conveyance of federal land,” the Justice Department’s acting No. 3 official, Jesse Panuccio, told reporters. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement that his office is prepared to protect the state’s resources. “Our public lands should not be on the auction block to the highest bidder,” Becerra said. Governor Jerry Brown accused the Trump administration last month of declaring war on the most populous U.S. state after the Justice Department sued over the California immigration laws. A hearing in that case is set for June.  The latest legal action involves California’s Senate Bill 50, which was signed into law in October and gives the state right of first refusal over many federal land conveyances.  If the California State Lands Commission waives its right of first refusal, it issues a compliance certificate. Without this document, the land transfer cannot be legally recorded in a county property office. The Justice Department in its lawsuit argues that Senate Bill 50 is preempted by federal law.

9816,"LONDON   - Royal Dutch Shell Plc on Tuesday became the first major oil and gas company to announce plans to leave a leading U.S. refining lobby due to disagreement on climate policies, citing its support for the goals of the Paris climate agreement. In its first review of its association with 19 key industry groups, Shell said it had found “material misalignment” over climate policy with the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) and would quit the body in 2020. The review is part of Shell’s drive to increase transparency and show investors it is in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement’s goals to limit global warming by reducing carbon emissions to a net zero by the end of the century. It is the latest sign of how investor pressure on oil companies, particularly in Europe, is leading to changes in their behavior around climate. Last year, Shell caved in to investor pressure over climate change, setting out plans to introduce industry-leading carbon emissions targets linked to executive pay. Its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, has since repeatedly urged oil and gas producers to take action over climate and pollution, staking out a more radical position than the heads of other major oil companies.      “AFPM has not stated support for the goal of the Paris Agreement. Shell supports the goal of the Paris Agreement,” the Anglo-Dutch company said in its decision. “The need for urgent action in response to climate change has become ever more obvious since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015. As a result, society’s expectations in this area have changed, and Shell’s views have also evolved,” van Beurden said in the report. The company has disagreed with AFPM on a number of issues for some time, according to two lobbying sources. Shell said it also disagreed with AFPM’s opposition to a price on carbon and action on low-carbon technologies.  Shell and AFPM have also been at odds in recent months over regulation over the use of renewable fuels. While Shell and other large refiners invested in cleaner fuel technology, AFPM has fought hard against standards requiring refiners to blend or subsidize the blending of biofuels into the gasoline pool - saying it hurts independent refiners. Shell and rivals Exxon and BP have in recent years left the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative political group, over its stance on climate change.  AFPM Chief Executive Chet Thompson thanked Shell for its “longstanding collaboration.” “We will also continue working on behalf of the refining and petrochemical industries to advance policies that ensure reliable and affordable access to fuels and petrochemicals, while being responsible stewards of the environment,” Thompson said in a statement.     AFPM counts around 300 U.S. and international members including Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Total SA that operate 110 refineries and 229 petrochemical plants, according to its 2018 annual report. French oil major Total said in a statement to Reuters that consensus required by organizations such as AFPM does not always reflect its position, and that it regularly monitors the relevance of its participation. “In this case, Total takes a pro-active approach in order to convince its peers, particularly on climate issues. In case of differing points of view, Total publicly defends its position, and is ready to reconsider its participation in case of disagreement,” the company said. Total said it was fully aware of climate issues, has publicly recognized them and takes them into its strategy.   Shell’s review was welcomed by Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, which invests in Shell and led discussions with the company over its climate policy. “This is an industry first,” Matthews said. “With this review Shell have set the benchmark for best practice on corporate climate lobbying not just within oil and gas but across all industries. The challenge now is for others to follow suit.” Shell also found “some” misalignment with nine other trade associations, including the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s main lobby.  Shell said that while it had some climate-related differences with the API, it welcomed the lobby’s advocacy on a range of state and federal issues such as trade and transport, as well as the API’s efforts to reduce methane emissions.

10094,"WASHINGTON   - The United States slapped sanctions on Russian individuals and entities for U.S. election meddling and cyber attacks but put off targeting oligarchs and government officials close to President Vladimir Putin, prompting lawmakers in both parties to say President Donald Trump needs to do much more. With the United States under pressure to act, the steps announced by the U.S. Treasury Department represented the most significant taken against Moscow since Trump assumed office in January 2017. Along with imposing sanctions on 19 individuals and five entities including Russian intelligence services, the Trump administration publicly blamed Moscow for the first time for a campaign of cyber attacks stretching back at least two years that targeted the U.S. power grid including nuclear facilities. The United States also joined Britain, Germany and France in demanding that Russia explain a military-grade nerve toxin attack in England on a former Russian double agent, with Trump saying: “It certainly looks like the Russians were behind” the incident. But congressional critics called the administration’s action a woefully inadequate retaliation for Russia interference in the 2016 U.S. election and other actions. “The sanctions today are a grievous disappointment and fall far short of what is needed to respond to that attack on our democracy let alone deter Russia’s escalating aggression, which now includes a chemical weapons attack on the soil of our closest ally,” said Adam Schiff, top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. “Today’s action, using authorities provided by Congress, is an important step by the administration. But more must be done,” Republican House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce added. He later urged Trump to sanction Russia for the poisoning in Britain. Trump has faced fierce criticism in the United States for doing too little to punish Russia for the election meddling and other actions, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russians, an allegation the president denies. Sixteen of the Russian individuals and entities sanctioned were indicted on Feb. 16 as part of Mueller’s criminal investigation. “They didn’t hit Putin’s power structure and they didn’t team up with Europe,” Brian O’Toole, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and a former senior adviser at the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, said of the administration’s actions. A senior administration official told Reuters that Trump, who campaigned on warmer ties with Putin, had grown exasperated with Russian activity. “A classic bully,” the official said of Putin. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, asked if Russia was a friend or foe, told reporters: “Russia is going to have to make that determination. They’re going to have to decide whether they want to be a good actor or a bad actor.” In Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was preparing retaliatory measures, as U.S.-Russian relations plunged again. The Treasury Department said the sanctions were also meant to counter cyber attacks including the NotPetya attack that cost billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia and the United States. The United States and Britain last month blamed the Russian military for that attack. Trump has frequently questioned a January 2017 finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign using hacking and propaganda in an effort eventually aimed at tilting the race in Trump’s favor. Russia denies interfering in the election.  But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was unequivocal in saying that Thursday’s action by his department “counters Russia’s continuing destabilizing activities, ranging from interference in the 2016 election to conducting destructive cyber-attacks.” “Putin constantly attacks our friends. So, President Trump, are you going to get smart about the threat Russia poses to the United States and our allies?” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked. Mnuchin said there would be additional sanctions against Russian government officials and oligarchs “for their destabilizing activities.” Mnuchin did not give a time frame for those sanctions, which he said would sever the individuals’ access to the U.S. financial system.  Democratic Senator Robert Menendez said he was glad to see the administration act but noted that Democratic former President Barack Obama’s administration had already imposed sanctions on many of the people and entities targeted on Thursday. Russian government hackers since at least March 2016 “have also targeted U.S. government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors,” a Treasury Department statement said. A senior administration told reporters on a conference call that Russian actors infiltrated parts of the U.S. energy sector. “We were able to identify where they were located within those business systems and remove them from those business systems,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump told reporters during a White House event with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar that “it certainly looks like the Russians were behind” the use of a nerve agent to attack Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent in England. Trump called it “something that should never, ever happen, and we’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.” The new sanctions include Russian intelligence services, the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), and six individuals working on behalf of the GRU. Thursday’s action blocks all property of those targeted that is subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits American citizens from engaging in transactions with them. Russian businessman Evgeny Prigozhin, one of those indicted by Mueller and hit with sanctions on Thursday, said in comments cited by RIA news agency that he already had been hit with U.S. sanctions “maybe three or four times - I’m tired of counting.” “I’m not worried by this,” Prigozhin was quoted as saying. “Except that now I will stop going to McDonald’s.” ","U.S. sanctions Russians for

10152,"NEW YORK   - Lawyers for Elon Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will square off in a Manhattan courtroom next week over whether the Tesla Inc chief executive should be held in contempt over one of his tweets. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan scheduled oral argument on an SEC contempt motion for April 4 at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), after both sides said they saw no need for an evidentiary hearing. Musk was accused by the SEC of violating his October 2018 fraud settlement with the regulator by tweeting on Feb. 19 to his more than 24 million Twitter followers that Tesla could build around 500,000 vehicles in 2019.  The SEC said that tweet was improper because Musk did not get advance approval from Tesla.  Musk’s lawyers have said the tweet was not material, and merely restated a target for his Palo Alto, California-based electric car company that he had discussed publicly in January. John Hueston, a lawyer for Musk, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a similar request. The settlement was intended to resolve a lawsuit over a Twitter post last Aug. 7 in which Musk said he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share. It called for Musk and Tesla to each pay $20 million civil fines, and for Musk to step down as Tesla’s chairman. Legal experts have said a contempt finding could subject Musk to a higher fine, further restrictions, or even removal from Tesla’s board or as chief executive.    Tesla shares closed Tuesday up $7.35, or 2.8 percent, at $267.77 on the Nasdaq. The case is SEC v Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-08865.

10229,"SEATTLE/LONDON   - A Boeing Co software fix for the grounded 737 MAX will prevent repeated operation of an anti-stall system at the center of safety concerns and deactivate it altogether if two sensors disagree widely, two people familiar with pilot briefings said. The anti-stall system - known as MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System - has been pinpointed by investigators probing October’s fatal Lion Air crash and faces new scrutiny in the wake of another fatal accident in Ethiopia. Those accidents, which killed nearly 350 people, triggered the worldwide grounding of Boeing’s flagship 737 MAX aircraft     and ignited a debate over the proper balance between man and machine in piloting the latest version of the 50-year-old 737. The MAX has bigger engines, mounted further forward, which can force the plane’s nose higher, threatening a stall. MCAS was designed to counter this but some experts say it overcompensated and the latest changes give some authority back to the pilot. Airline briefings on the software upgrade, which is designed to address the situation faced by pilots of the doomed Lion Air jet last October, started on Saturday. Pilots have been told that the MCAS system - which forces the nose downwards to avoid a stall, or loss of lift - will only operate one time for each event rather than impose repeated corrections like those believed to have pushed the Lion Air jet into a dive, the two people familiar with the briefings said. Additionally, MCAS will be disabled whenever two sensors that measure the ‘angle of attack’ - a parameter that determines how close a plane is to an aerodynamic stall - differ too much. “Otherwise it would be garbage in, garbage out,” a third person familiar with the briefings said.  This is a change from the previous set-up which only linked MCAS to one sensor at a time, ignoring the other, and which may have resulted in a single point of failure on Lion Air 610. The pilot will be able to deduce that MCAS is no longer working in the background because the system will show a warning message labeled “AOA disagree”, indicating the two sensors are producing values that differ by an excessive margin. Previously the “AOA disagree” warning would not have halted the MCAS software because the system was designed to focus on either the left or right sensor, alternating between flights. It was oblivious to whether readings from the sensors were aligned. Boeing said on Monday its software patch would incorporate more than one angle of attack input, limit trim commands and limit authority but gave few details. “We’ve been working diligently and in close cooperation with the FAA on the software update. We are taking a comprehensive and careful approach to design, develop and test the software that will ultimately lead to certification,” a statement said. The change sheds light on Boeing’s previously reported decision to make the warning light a standard feature, since the change in flight control laws now makes it indispensable. The third person said Boeing would need to give pilots in their training a full explanation of what the fix is and why it is being implemented. Both the software fix and the training have to be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. Other methods for holding the nose of the aircraft in the right position, known as manual or electric trim, are unchanged as is the ability to cut out the automated trim system altogether using a standard step-by-step checklist. Boeing has previously said that existing crew procedures, which include using a pair of cut-out switches, would have addressed a condition known as a stabilizer trim runaway and by doing so, automatically deal with any problem with MCAS. But it has faced criticism for designing a system that potentially out-runs the ability of pilots to recover by repeatedly forcing the nose down using hefty forces, as the pilots in the doomed Lion Air flight experienced.

10271,"HONG KONG   - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Monday it was understandable for markets to be nervous when the yield curve flattened, though he was still confident about the U.S. economic growth outlook. In what many see as a bad omen for the economy, yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year treasury notes fell below three-month rates on Friday for the first time since mid-2007, an inversion that has in the past signaled the risk of recession. After an unexpected rise in the Ifo Institute’s March business climate index in Germany, spreads between U.S. three-month and 10-year Treasury yields turned positive. Evans described the inversion as “pretty narrow”. “We have to take into account that there’s been a secular decline in long-term interest rates,” Evans said in comments at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong, days after the Fed signaled an end to its tightening and abandoned plans for further rate hikes in 2019.. “Some of this is structural, having to do with lower trend growth, lower real interest rates,” he said. “I think, in that environment, it’s probably more natural that yield curves are somewhat flatter than they have been historically.” On the sidelines of the conference, Evans told CNBC in an interview that he could understand why investors were more “watchful, waiting and looking,” adding the Fed was doing the same. But, he added, economic fundamentals were “good” and he expected growth to be around 2 percent this year. “Your first reaction is gonna (be) ‘wow, this is less than what we had’ and I think this is missing the message.” The risk of a shock hitting the economy was not unusually higher or lower at the moment, he later told reporters. Speaking at the same event, former Fed chair Janet Yellen said the yield curve may signal the need to cut interest rates at some point, but it does not signal a recession. “In contrast with times past, there’s a tendency now for the yield curve to be very flat,” Yellen, who led the Fed between 2014 and 2018, said. On the monetary policy outlook, Evans told the conference it was a good time for the U.S. central bank to pause and adopt a cautious stance, adding he did not expect any interest rate hikes until the second half of next year. He said the labor market remained strong, but noted inflation expectations had edged lower and there were risks related to weaker economic activity in China and elsewhere, uncertainty over Brexit, and a waning impact of U.S. fiscal stimulus. Softening his tone from a few months ago, Evans, who votes on interest rate policy this year, said monetary policy was neither accommodative, nor restrictive at this point. “I see things impeding inflation a bit, and I want to see inflation get up. So my own path is not to expect a funds rate increase until next year, probably, the second half,” Evans said. And even if prices do start to rise, he said, “given how muted inflationary pressures appear today, a rise to 2.25 to 2.5 percent is not a big concern to me at the moment.”  That assessment suggests Evans has set the bar fairly high for further rate hikes, considering that inflation by the Fed’s preferred gauge has not been that much above the Fed’s 2-percent goal since before the financial crisis. He added that with downside risks looming and uncertainties rife, it is prudent for the Fed to wait for more economic data. He also said a rate cut was a possibility if the economy softened even more or inflation ran too low. That echoed the view of fellow policymaker Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who on Friday said both possibilities are on the table for him. In January, Evans said the Fed could hike interest rates three times in 2019 assuming the U.S. economy remained reasonably strong.     Last week, the U.S. central bank left rates steady in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. Fresh forecasts showed 11 of 17 Fed policymakers expected no rate change for the rest of the year, up from just two in December.

10435,"WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES   - U.S. solar and wind power companies may have the most to gain from the Green New Deal, an ambitious proposal backed by several Democratic presidential candidates to end U.S. fossil fuel consumption within a decade. But do not expect the renewable energy firms to endorse it. Representatives of America’s clean energy companies are withholding their support for the climate-fighting plan, calling it unrealistic and too politically divisive for an industry keen to grow in both red and blue states. The cool reaction reflects the difficulty that progressive politicians vying for the White House may have in selling aggressive global-warming policy to the business community and more moderate voters. It also underscores a new reality for U.S. solar and wind power companies long associated with the environmental left: As they have improved technology and lowered prices, their growth is shifting from politically liberal coastal states to the more conservative heartland, where skepticism of climate change and government subsidies runs high.   “If you just broadly endorse the Green New Deal, you are liable to upset one side of the aisle or the other. And that’s not constructive,” said Tom Werner, the CEO of SunPower Corp, one of the nation’s biggest solar power companies. “The idea that you could go 100 percent (clean energy) in 10 years would require a lot of things happening perfectly, simultaneously,” he said. “You’d have to have bipartisan support, 52-state support.” The Green New Deal was introduced last month by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat Congresswoman from New York, along with fellow Democrat Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts. It has since become the center of a renewed debate in Washington about how vigorously the government must act to address climate change. The Congressional resolution, which has no force of law, calls for the federal government to make investments to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in a decade by meeting 100 percent of America’s power demand with clean, renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, or geothermal energy. It also calls for massive investments in green infrastructure projects like “smart grids” to improve efficiency, along with a guarantee of millions of high-wage jobs with paid vacations, medical leave and retirement security. The resolution does not get into detail about how subsequent legislation would achieve these goals. So far, at least eight Democratic presidential hopefuls – including senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota – have endorsed the plan as they seek to stand in stark opposition to the pro-drilling policies of President Donald Trump. Trump’s fellow Republicans have widely panned the Green New Deal, saying it would cost trillions of dollars of taxpayer money, may be technically unfeasible, and smacks of radical socialism.  Rhiana Gunn Wright, founder of the think tank New Consensus, which is drawing up Green New Deal policies, said her group will not estimate costs of the plan until it is more fully drafted next year. She said opponents’ estimates are premature and do not account for the benefits of climate action and the costs of inaction. The feasibility of the proposal has been a source of concern for the clean energy industry, too.   “We love the enthusiasm the Green New Deal has brought to the climate issue ... but we need to operate in political reality,” said Dan Whitten, vice president of public affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association, the solar industry’s main lobby group.  Another concern is the fact that the plan extends beyond energy and climate policies to include guarantees of jobs, training and healthcare for communities affected by climate change, said Greg Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, a non-profit organization promoting renewable energy industries.  “It creates controversy and complexity, tying this to issues that are not in our sphere,” he said. Representatives of renewable energy firms Sunrun and Sunnova Energy said they were happy the Green New Deal was drawing so much attention to clean industry but stopped short of endorsing the plan. “The Green New Deal has sparked an important conversation, and we’re excited to be part of it,” said Alex McDonough, Vice President of Public Policy at Sunrun.  The U.S. solar and wind industries have expanded over the last decade, thanks to lucrative government subsidies, and now employ some 350,000 workers nationwide - more than four times more than the coal sector, according to the 2019 U.S. Energy and Employment Report released this month.  While the growth began in liberal-leaning regions such as California and New England, it has more recently come in states that voted heavily for President Donald Trump in 2016, including Texas, North Carolina, Iowa and Florida, according to data from the American Wind Energy Association, Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables and SEIA. That has helped strengthen the industry’s appeal to Republican lawmakers, allowing it to rebrand as a jobs engine in addition to a tool for combating global warming. And during the last election cycle in 2018, solar and wind companies contributed significantly more money to Republican candidates than to their traditional Democratic allies. “We have raised these industries above science experiments and feel-goodery, and we are now real businesses and can’t just play to one half of the country,” said one renewable sector lobbyist, who asked not to be named discussing the topic. “Staying out of the line of fire is the goal of most companies and trade associations,” said another clean energy industry representative. “There will be a real danger for our industry and companies if they are shouting out about the Green New Deal from the rooftops.” The Sunrise Movement, a grassroots group that brought the Green New Deal into the national spotlight by holding demonstrations and confronting lawmakers on video, said it was aware of the reticence of green energy companies to back their proposal. “We’ve met with companies and industries who could have a lot to gain from the Green New Deal, but the politics at this stage are too difficult to navigate,” Sunrise co-founder Evan Weber said.  He said Sunrise had met with the SEIA and AWEA, along with other executives. Weber said industry support for the Green New Deal would be welcomed but is not vital: “We don’t expect all of them to be a strong advocate for the Green New Deal until the politics shift.” ",Solar

10632,"ADDIS ABABA/WASHINGTON   - The crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane that killed 157 people had “clear similarities” with October’s Lion Air crash, Ethiopia said on Sunday, shown by initial analysis of the black boxes recovered from the wreckage of the March 10 disaster. The crash has generated one of the most widely watched and high-stakes inquiries for years, with the latest version of Boeing’s profitable 737 workhorse depending on the outcome. Both planes were MAX 8s, and both crashed minutes post take-off after pilots reported flight control problems. Concern over the plane’s safety led aviation authorities to ground the model, wiping billions of dollars off Boeing’s market value.     “It was the same case with the Indonesian (Lion Air) one. There were clear similarities between the two crashes so far,” Ethiopian transport ministry spokesman Muse Yiheyis said. “The data was successfully recovered. Both the American team and our (Ethiopian) team validated it,” he told Reuters, adding that the ministry would provide more information after three or four days. In Washington, however, U.S. officials told Reuters the FAA and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had not yet validated the data.  Boeing’s safety analysis of a new flight control system known as MCAS on MAX jets had several crucial flaws, one of which was that it understated the power of the system, the Seattle Times said on Sunday. The FAA also did not delve in detailed inquiries and followed a standard certification process on the MAX, the paper said, citing an FAA spokesman. The FAA declined to comment on the report but referred to previous statements about the certification process. It has said the process followed FAA’s standard process. Citing people familiar with the inquiry, the Wall Street Journal said Department of Transportation officials are scrutinizing the FAA’s approval of MAX jets and a Washington, D.C. grand jury issued a subpoena to at least one person involved in the MAX’s development. The subpoena dated March 11 - a day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash - listed as a contact a prosecutor from the Justice Department’s (DoJ) criminal division and sought documents to be handed over later this month, the paper said. It was not immediately clear whether the DoJ subpoena was related to the DoT’s inquiry, which focuses on MCAS, implicated in the Lion Air crash that killed 189 people, the WSJ added. Boeing and the FAA declined to comment on the WSJ report. Two government officials briefed on the matter told Reuters it would not be surprising for the Transportation Department to investigate a major safety issue, but could not immediately confirm the report. An official told Reuters that when investigators - after reviewing black box data from the Ethiopian Airlines crash - return to Addis Ababa to conduct interpretive work, the NTSB and FAA will assist in verification and validation of the data. A second source said little information had been circulated  between parties about the contents of data and voice recordings. It was not clear how many of the roughly 1,800 parameters of flight data and two hours of cockpit recordings, spanning the doomed six-minute flight and earlier trips, had been taken into account in the preliminary Ethiopian analysis. International rules require a preliminary report on the crash to be released within 30 days. Previous air crash reports show that in such high-profile cases there can be disagreements among parties about the cause. In Paris, France’s BEA air accident investigation agency said data from the jet’s cockpit voice recorder had been successfully downloaded. The French agency said on Twitter it had not listened to the audio files and the data had been transferred to Ethiopian investigators. In Addis Ababa, a source who has listened to the air traffic control recording of the plane’s communications said flight 302 had an unusually high speed after take-off before it reported problems and asked permission to climb quickly. Last Monday, Boeing, shares of which have fallen 10 percent in the week since the crash, said it would deploy a software upgrade to the 737 MAX 8, hours after the FAA said it would mandate “design changes” in the aircraft by April. Boeing was finalizing the software change and a training revision and would evaluate new information as it became available, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement on Sunday, after the Ethiopian transport ministry’s comments.   A Boeing spokesman said the 737 MAX was certified in line with identical FAA requirements and processes that governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives. The spokesman said the FAA concluded that MCAS on 737 MAX met all certification and regulatory requirements.

10709,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump’s trade battles cost the U.S. economy $7.8 billion in lost gross domestic product in 2018, a study by a team of economists at leading American universities published this week showed. Authors of the paper said they analyzed the short-run impact of Trump’s actions and found that imports from targeted countries declined 31.5 percent while targeted U.S. exports fell by 11 percent. They also found that annual consumer and producer losses from higher costs of imports totaled $68.8 billion. “After accounting for higher tariff revenue and gains to domestic producers from higher prices, the aggregate welfare loss was $7.8 billion,” or 0.04 percent of GDP, the researchers said. The study was authored by a team of economists at the University of California Berkeley, Columbia University, Yale University and University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and published by the National Bureau of Economic research. www.nber.org/papers/w25638 Having dubbed himself the “tariff man,” Trump pledged on both the campaign trail and as president to reduce the trade deficit by shutting out unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements. Trump has pursued a protectionist trade agenda to shield U.S. manufacturing. Washington and Beijing have been locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle for months as imposing unilateral tariffs to combat, and Trump has imposed tariffs that have roiled the European Union and other major trading partners.  The authors said while U.S. tariffs favored sectors located in “politically competitive” counties, the retaliatory tariffs imposed on U.S. goods have offset the benefits to these areas. “We find that tradeable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties were the most negatively affected by the trade war,” the researchers said.

10765,"OTTAWA   - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s  Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou had been looking for another job when she was arrested in Canada last December on a U.S. warrant, the firm’s founder said in an interview aired on Thursday. Ren Zhengfei, who is Meng’s father, also told Canada’s CTV that the two had become closer since she was detained in Vancouver on Dec. 1 last year. The United States wants Meng to be extradited to face charges that she engaged in bank and wire fraud in violation of American sanctions against Iran. She denies wrongdoing. “One month before that arrest, she wanted to resign and find a job elsewhere. She was not happy working here but after being arrested this matter improved our relationship and now she understands how difficult life can be,” Ren told CTV. “In the past she had a smooth path. She couldn’t take the setbacks very well ... you have to suffer a lot before becoming a hero and if you don’t have scars, you won’t have tough skin,” he added in comments that were translated into English. Relations between Canada and China deteriorated sharply after Meng’s arrest. China has arrested two Canadians on national security grounds and retried another citizen who had already been convicted on drugs charges, this time sentencing him to death. “Meng Wanzhou has committed no crime. She didn’t violate any Canadian rules and I think both Canada and Huawei are victims because this case hurts people in both countries and bilateral relations also suffered setbacks,” said Ren. He also said he had previously only communicated infrequently with Meng, given how busy the two were. “Now, every other day we have phone calls, we shoot the breeze, tell jokes, I tell her some anecdote I read on the internet. The case in Canada made my bonds deeper with my daughter,” he said. Huawei is a major manufacturer of equipment for 5G, the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. Canada is studying whether the firm will be able to bid for 5G contracts, given concerns about how secure the technology is. Washington said last month that it would not be able to partner with or share information with countries that adopt Huawei systems. “Meng Wanzhou is an individual case and I don’t think it should influence in any way the relationship Canada has with Huawei,” said Ren.

10888,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Justice Department’s third-ranking official, Rachel Brand, will resign and take a senior job at Walmart Inc (WMT.N), with sources familiar with her decision saying on Friday that she had grown increasingly uncomfortable with President Donald Trump’s attacks on her department and the FBI. The department said Brand will be leaving her post in the coming weeks. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, himself repeatedly criticized by Trump, praised her “critical role in helping us accomplish our goals as a department.” Brand, 44, was next in line of succession to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for oversight of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia and whether the Republican president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the ongoing probe. She became the latest senior law enforcement official to either resign or be fired since Trump took office in January 2017, a list that includes a Federal Bureau of Investigation director and deputy director, and an acting attorney general. Trump also ousted all remaining U.S. attorneys, the chief federal prosecutors in each state, who had served under Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Brand’s resignation is different in that she was hand-picked for the job by Trump, assuming her post just five days after Mueller’s appointment in May 2017. News of Brand’s departure came a week after Trump approved the release of a previously classified memo written by Republican lawmakers that portrayed the Russia investigation, initially handled by the FBI and now headed by Mueller, as a product of political bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department. After just nine months on the job, Brand had become more and more uneasy with Trump’s escalating attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI, which she and other law enforcement professionals feared was beginning to undermine the rule of law, according to sources familiar with her thinking. In a statement, Brand defended her department, saying, “The men and women of the Department of Justice impress me every day.” The attacks have escalated in recent weeks as Republicans in Congress have criticized the handling by the Justice Department, FBI and the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court of warrants for surveillance of a Trump campaign advisor, Carter Page, who had ties to Russia. Trump called the matter “a disgrace.” In a statement, Walmart said Brand will join the company as executive vice president for global governance and corporate secretary. “We are fortunate to have a leader of Rachel Brand’s stature join the company,” President and CEO Doug McMillon said. Mary McCord, who served as acting head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division from October 2016 until April 2017 and helped oversee the FBI investigation into the collusion matter, said Brand’s resignation would further shake morale at the department. “When the associate attorney general steps down after just nine months in the midst of a barrage of attacks on the department from the White House and Capitol Hill, it is another blow to the career women and men of the department who have been doing their jobs diligently while trying to block out the turmoil around them,” said McCord, now a visiting professor at Georgetown University’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. The department is also facing a major backlog on leadership positions that still need confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Rosenstein oversees Mueller’s investigation because Sessions recused himself from the matter last year. Trump also has criticized Sessions for recusing himself. Brand on Friday lauded Sessions’ “commitment to the rule of law.” Rosenstein is the only official with legal authority to fire  Mueller, and it is widely believed he would resign if ordered to do so without good cause. If Rosenstein resigned, that authority would have fallen to Brand under the department’s succession line. With her gone, the next person in line is Solicitor General Noel Francisco. Any permanent replacement for Brand would have to be confirmed by the Senate and would likely face tough questioning about their willingness to preserve the Russia probe’s independence.  Trump could use a 1998 law on executive branch vacancies to appoint a temporary replacement of his choice, as long as that person was an experienced Justice Department employee or another administration official already confirmed by the Senate. Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the agency’s Russia investigation, in May 2017, saying he took the action because of “this Russia thing.” The FBI’s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, stepped down in January after Trump repeatedly criticized him on Twitter. McCabe’s wife previously ran as a Democrat for a seat in Virginia’s state Senate and received donations from then-Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a close ally of Hillary Clinton and former president Bill Clinton. Brand oversees the Justice Department’s civil, antitrust, tax and environmental and natural resources divisions. She played a crucial role in helping push for Congress to reauthorize the National Security Agency’s warrantless internet surveillance program after it faced opposition from some privacy-minded lawmakers in both parties. The measure passed, and Trump signed it into law in January. A Justice Department official said that Jesse Panuccio, the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General, will temporarily take over Brand’s job until a replacement is named. He previously served as acting associate attorney general until Brand was confirmed and sworn in.

10931,"  - JPMorgan Chase & Co’s consumer banking unit said on Wednesday it will open up to 90 branches in new U.S. markets, in the face of intensifying competition for loans and deposits among the country’s three biggest banks.  JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp, and Wells Fargo & Co are nip and tuck in deposits. Bank of America, in early 2018, had decided to open more than 500 new branches across the United States by 2021. Chase said it will also hire up to 700 employees in the markets, which include Charlotte, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from this summer. The company will also open some of these branches in the cities of Philadelphia, Boston and the Greater Washington area in the District of Columbia - markets it recently entered into.   JPMorgan had said last year that it was planning to open 400 new branches, of which 30 percent would cater to low-to-moderate income communities, and hire as many as 3,000 employees in new markets over the next five years.  In its latest quarterly report, JPMorgan showed that consumer and community banking deposits grew 3 percent to $673.78 billion. JPM’s Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said last month that she expects growth in deposits to slow and the interest it pays for them to rise, reducing profit margins on its loans.

10932,"  - Ford Motor Co confirmed on Wednesday it is cutting an unspecified number of U.S. salaried jobs as part of a global reorganization announced last year. Said Deep, a spokesman for the second largest U.S. automaker, declined to say how many jobs are being slashed but said the company expects the process to be completed by the end of June. He said the restructuring “has resulted in some separations of salaried employees and the reassignment of others.” Ford said last year it was working to reorganize its global salaried workforce that will “result in headcount reduction over time, and this will vary based on team and location.” Last month, Ford said it would close its oldest factory in Brazil. It also said it would get out of its heavy commercial truck business in South America, a move that could cost more than 2,700 jobs. Ford has said its global reorganization will involve thousands of jobs and possible plant closures in Europe and result in $11 billion in charges. In January, Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett told employees that 2018 had been “mediocre” and added it was “time to bury the year (2018) in a deep grave, grieve over what might have been and become super focused on meeting, and, in fact, exceeding this year’s plan.” Automakers are reducing costs amid fears of a slowdown in auto sales.

10944,"FRANKFURT   - The German government has pressured Deutsche Bank into merger talks with state-backed Commerzbank amid concerns for the health of the country’s flagship bank, according to officials familiar with the matter. Deutsche, the largest bank in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, emerged unscathed from the financial crash but later lost its footing. In 2016, the International Monetary Fund called the bank the world’s biggest potential risk among peers to the financial system because of its links to other banks. German officials fear that a recession or big fine, for example, could derail the bank’s fragile recovery.  Berlin wants a reliable national banking champion to support its export-led economy, known for cars and machine tools. Deutsche and other European banks have taken longer to recover from the financial crisis, losing ground to stronger rivals from the United States. Other than Deutsche, Commerzbank is Germany’s only remaining big bank, after a series of mergers. The government holds a 15 percent stake after bailing it out during the crisis, giving it an important voice.  Commerzbank, like Deutsche, has struggled to rebound, and German officials say it is vulnerable to a foreign takeover. If an international rival snapped it up, that would increase competition for Deutsche on its home turf.   Berlin also wants to keep Commerzbank’s specialty -  the funding of medium-sized companies, the backbone of the economy - in German hands.  The merged bank would have roughly 1.8 trillion euros in assets, such as loans and investments, and a market value of about 25 billion euros ($28 billion).  It would have one fifth of the German retail banking market.  Together, Deutsche and Commerzbank operate 2,500 branches in Germany and employ 140,000 people worldwide. A merger puts at least 10,000 jobs at risk, according to unions.  Proponents of a merger include the German government and U.S. investor Cerberus, which is a shareholder in both banks. Opponents include some other shareholders in Deutsche Bank and labor unions.  Deutsche’s chief executive officer Christian Sewing would prefer to have more time to stabilize the bank before taking on a merger, people familiar with the matter have said. In February, Deutsche’s management board gave Sewing the go-ahead for exploratory talks with Commerzbank, a person with knowledge of the matter said. There have been contacts among a small circle of executives. Talks could end without a deal, the person said. With the talks now out in the open, and Berlin still pushing for a deal, the companies are under pressure to figure out the mechanics of a fusion and decide whether or not it is workable. That decision is seen within weeks. One of the biggest risks is how to fill what one German official has told Reuters will be a multi-billion-euro financial hole because a merger could trigger an adjustment to the valuation of some bank investments. Commerzbank, for example, has about 30.8 billion euros of debt securities such as Italian bonds that now have a value of 27.7 billion euros - a drop of 3.1 billion euros. A tie-up could crystallize this loss. Deutsche has such securities at market value in its accounts. The deal would make the German government a shareholder in the country’s largest bank and executives would want to curb its influence. The two banks could also get bogged down with restructuring, such as integrating different technology systems, losing ground to rivals. OTHER THAN A MERGER, ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS FOR DEUTSCHE BANK?  German officials have held exploratory talks about merging Deutsche and UBS but there was little interest in Switzerland, people familiar with the matter have said. These officials believe that sticking with Deutsche’s current course of cutting back costs and scaling back high-risk banking offers scant hope of a turnaround.  The continued pressure from Berlin makes it harder for Deutsche to go it alone. Merging with a state-owned lender, in the officials’ view, offers a safe harbor. If talks do unravel, however, Deutsche could respond to pressure from some investors to make further cuts to the investment bank, especially in the United States. Deutsche has long been unpopular with ordinary Germans because it was seen by many as a symbol of capitalist excess. Its image has been tarnished by numerous lawsuits and billions of dollars in fines.  These included alleged “conspiracy” to rig the price of financial market bets and sham trades between Moscow and London that moved money from Russia abroad. In its latest financial report, Deutsche has set aside 1.2 billion euros for litigation. That is a fraction of earlier years but nonetheless more than three times its 2018 profit.  The bank has dealt with the bulk of legal action going back to the economic crash, and has improved its finances. Announcing the first profit since 2014 last year, CEO Sewing said the group was “on the right track”. But German officials were not convinced and continued to push for talks with Commerzbank. He has now bowed to that pressure.

10973,"  - Ride-hailing startup Uber Technologies Inc has hired a string of investment banks to its syndicate of initial public offering underwriters, as it ramps up preparations for a stock market debut, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Smaller rival Lyft Inc is racing to list in the stock market at the end of March. While Uber will not beat Lyft to an IPO, the preparations are aimed at giving it the flexibility to go public as early as the first half of 2019, the sources said. Uber has added more than half a dozen investment banks, including Bank of America Corp, Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc, Allen & Company, Deutsche Bank AG and JMP Securities, to its IPO underwriting lineup, the sources said.  These banks will support Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which Uber hired late last year to lead its public offering, the sources added. Uber will make additional bank hires in the coming weeks to complete the IPO syndicate, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup and JMP Securities declined to comment. Uber, Allen & Company and Deutsche Bank did not immediately return requests for comment.  Several investment banks held off pitching Lyft for an IPO role in order to be hired by Uber, a more lucrative and high-profile assignment given its size and status. However, JMP Securities managed to get on both Uber and Lyft’s IPO syndicates, showing that such overlap is possible, albeit mainly with more junior underwriting roles.  Lending relationships between the companies and the banks have also proved important in winning IPO roles.  Lyft’s top-tier of seven underwriters was responsible for around a quarter of capital raised through last year, compared to more than 40 percent for the six top-tier banks that Uber has hired so far, according to Dealogic.  Like Lyft, Uber filed confidentially for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December. Its bankers have indicated it could be valued at as much as $120 billion, though some analysts have pegged its value closer to $100 billion based on the earning figures it discloses.  Lyft could be valued close to $25 billion in its IPO, according to the sources. Earlier on Tuesday, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle a lawsuit brought nearly six years ago by drivers who claimed they are employees, not independent contractors. Uber still faces thousands of arbitration claims from drivers who are not covered by the settlement.

10974,"SAN FRANCISCO   - A trial in which a California man alleged his use of Bayer AG’s glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer caused his cancer went to a federal U.S. jury after lawyers for both sides delivered their closing arguments on Tuesday. The closely-watched case brought by plaintiff Edward Hardeman is only the second of some 11,200 Roundup lawsuits to go to trial in the United States. Another California man was awarded $289 million in August after a state court jury in August found Roundup caused his cancer, sending Bayer shares plunging.  Hardeman’s case has proceeded differently from the earlier trial, with an initial phase exclusively focused on scientific facts while omitting evidence of alleged corporate misconduct by company representatives.  Following the first phase, the six jurors in San Francisco federal court were asked by U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria to decide whether Roundup was a “substantial factor” in causing Hardeman’s cancer. If the jury finds Roundup to have caused Hardeman’s cancer, the trial will proceed into a second stage, where his lawyers can present evidence allegedly showing the company’s efforts to influence scientists, regulators and the public about the safety of its products. Hardeman’s lawyer, Aimee Wagstaff, during her closing arguments on Tuesday said Hardeman had “extreme” exposure to Roundup, spraying the chemical more than 300 times over 26 years. “The dose makes the poison. The more you use, the higher the risk,” Wagstaff said. She urged jurors to consider all studies, including of rodents and cells, which she said showed an elevated cancer risk. Bayer, which acquired Monsanto for $63 billion, denies allegations that Roundup, or glyphosate, cause cancer. It says decades of studies and regulatory evaluations, primarily of real-world human exposure data, have shown the weed killer to be safe for human use regardless of exposure levels. Wagstaff criticized the epidemiological studies as flawed. Brian Stekloff, a lawyer for Bayer, in his closing statement  said the cause of Hardeman’s cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma generally, was not known.  “No one can tell you the cause,” Stekloff said, adding that Hardeman had some risk factors, such as old age and a history of hepatitis. Chhabria decided in January to split Hardeman’s case into two phases. He called evidence of alleged corporate misconduct “a distraction” from the scientific question of whether glyphosate causes cancer.  Hardeman’s trial is a test case for some 760 cases nationwide consolidated before Chhabria in federal court. Evidence of corporate misconduct was seen as playing a key role in the earlier state court case. The verdict in that case was later reduced to $78 million and is on appeal.  Plaintiff lawyers called Chhabria’s decision to exclude similar evidence from the first phase of Hardeman’s case “unfair,” saying their scientific evidence was inextricably linked to Monsanto’s alleged attempts to manipulate, misrepresent and intimidate scientists.

10989,"  - Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and Wall Street’s Bond King, called the increasingly popular Modern Monetary Theory backed by progressives a “crackpot” idea.  Gundlach, who oversees more than $123 billion, said on an investor webcast on Tuesday that Modern Monetary Theory is “complete nonsense, yet it is being used to justify a massive socialist program.”    Modern monetary theorists argue government spending, and deficits as needed, should be used to meet the full employment and inflation mandates currently tasked to the U.S. Federal Reserve. Taxes may not be needed to support all spending since the government can create more money and inflation is the main restraint on government spending, according to the theory. The ideas have gained currency with some economists and Democratic Party politicians but have also been met with fierce criticism. A leading proponent of Modern Monetary Theory, State University of New York at Stony Brook economics professor Stephanie Kelton, advised democratic socialist U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 run for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also expressed openness to the idea. “What happens when the economy turns down?” he asked. Gundlach added that the “ridiculous” MMT is a way of monetizing debt and could lead to a significant boycott of long-term bonds. The ideas could gain popularity if the United States enters a recession in 2020, ahead of the next presidential election. Populist discontent has struck a nerve with some voters in the United States, with liberals calling for higher taxes on the rich and more spending to promote economic equality. Gundlach said the timing of a college bribery scandal reinforces that populist narrative.     Federal authorities arrested dozens on Tuesday for a $25 million scheme to help wealthy Americans, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin and some finance executives, cheat their children’s way into elite universities, such as Yale and Stanford. Gundlach said: “It really doesn’t do all of us in the world of finance a lot of reputational good...look at these people, turning the table in their favor. It’s really pretty horrifying.” Gundlach said the college bribery scandal “really helps the Elizabeth Warren crowd.”    Warren vowed on Friday to break up Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc if elected U.S. president to promote competition in the technology sector. Addressing the run-up in the U.S. stock market, Gundlach said he still thinks stocks are in a bear market. “The stock market was and is in a bear market,” he said, adding stocks could go negative again this year.  Gundlach said the market rebound stemmed from the “remarkable 180-degree turn” from the Federal Reserve, which is straying away from quantitative tightening. He said the Fed will likely keep $3.5 trillion in assets on its balance sheet. “Maybe they realize that there really isn’t anybody to buy all the bonds that appear to be potentially in prospect other than the central bank,” Gundlach said.

11014,"SAN FRANCISCO   - Uber Technologies Inc has agreed to pay $20 million to settle a lawsuit brought by drivers nearly six years ago, according to court filings, resolving one of its many legal battles with drivers ahead of a hotly anticipated initial public offering this year.  Drivers for the ride-hailing company argued in the lawsuit that they are employees, not independent contractors, as Uber has classified them, and therefore entitled to certain wage protections and reimbursement for their expenses.  The settlement amount is one-fifth of the settlement offer Uber proposed in 2016 to resolve the case, valued at up to $100 million, which U.S. District Judge Edward Chen at the time rejected as inadequate.  The new settlement, which still must be approved by Chen, was filed in federal court in San Francisco late on Monday night. The lawsuit is central to a widely held debate over so-called gig-economy workers, the workforce relied on by technology platforms such as food-delivery and ride-hailing services. Gig-economy workers have often argued they should receive better pay and benefits, and be treated as employees.  A California Supreme Court ruling last year made it much more difficult for companies like Uber to argue that their drivers are independent contractors, a decision that poses a threat to Uber’s business model. In a statement, a company spokesman said “Uber has changed a lot since 2013,” and highlighted new programs and technology improvements to help drivers. “We’re pleased to reach a settlement on this matter and we’ll continue working hard to improve the quality, security and dignity of independent work,” the spokesman said. The settlement covers drivers in California and Massachusetts who drove for Uber from August 2009 through February of this year, according to the filing. The class is much smaller than in 2016 when the initial settlement offer was made — about 13,600 drivers between the two states compared to roughly 385,000 drivers covered by the original class-action lawsuit.  Following Chen’s rejection of the $100 million settlement offer, Uber won an appeals court ruling that upheld the company’s arbitration agreements as largely valid and enforceable. That forced most drivers into arbitration, and reduced the class size to those drivers who had opted out of the agreements or otherwise were not bound by them. According to the court filing, drivers will individually walk away with more money under the proposed settlement offer than they would have under the 2016 settlement offer. Chen had called the offer of up to $100 million for the larger class neither fair nor adequate; some drivers would have made as little as $12. Uber in December filed confidentially for an initial public offering, and is seeking a valuation of up to $120 billion when it lists shares later this year. It is trying to resolve a long list of lawsuits, disputes, investigations and other legal risks before starting the process of trying to woo prospective investors.  However, Uber still faces thousands of arbitration claims from drivers who are not covered by this settlement. Uber has been accused of refusing to pay the legal fees required to initiate settlement of those claims, and attorneys for one group of drivers have asked a judge to compel Uber to pay those fees. In an effort to resolve the disputes more quickly, the company in January offered some drivers with arbitration claims a settlement of 11 cents for each mile they drove for the ride-hailing app, which could result in a payout of a few thousand dollars for individual drivers.  But this is a fraction of what other drivers have been reimbursed in earlier claims. One driver was reimbursed at 64 cents per mile in early 2018, according to settlement documents shared with Reuters.

11040,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. consumer prices rose for the first time in four months in February, but the pace of the increase was modest, resulting in the smallest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years. The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed benign underlying inflation last month, which together with slowing economic growth support the Federal Reserve’s “patient” approach towards further interest rate increases this year. “We view the risks to the inflation outlook as weighted to the downside as the domestic economy has slowed more quickly than we had expected,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “The Fed is on pause for the foreseeable future.” The Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent, lifted by gains in the costs of food, gasoline and rents. The CPI had been unchanged for three straight months.  In the 12 months through February, the CPI rose 1.5 percent, the smallest gain since September 2016. The CPI increased 1.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in January. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent, the smallest increase since August 2018. The so-called core CPI had increased by 0.2 percent for five straight months.  In the 12 months through February, the core CPI rose 2.1 percent. The core CPI had increased by 2.2 percent for three consecutive months on an annual basis.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI and the core CPI edging up 0.2 percent in February. The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, tracks a different measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, for monetary policy. The core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in December after a similar gain in November. It hit the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent inflation target in March last year for the first time since April 2012. The economy lost momentum at the end of last year, a trend that appears to have persisted through early 2019, with manufacturing production plunging and retail sales rising slightly in January after December’s sharp drop.  First-quarter growth estimates have been cut to as low as a 0.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter.  Slowing domestic and global growth are keeping inflation in check even as a tight labor market is driving up wages. Annual wage growth jumped 3.4 percent in February, the biggest increase since April 2009, from 3.1 percent in January. “That is partly because a modest pick-up in productivity growth has kept a lid on unit labor costs and partly because the rising dollar has started to put downward pressure on imported goods prices,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, but Boeing’s fall for a second straight session pressured the Dow Jones Industrial Average and capped gains in broader markets. The dollar slipped against a basket currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. A New York Fed survey of consumer expectations published on Monday showed a drop in inflation expectations in February. In a wide-ranging interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes television news program, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Sunday reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see approach to further monetary policy tightening this year. Powell said the Fed did “not feel any hurry” to change the level of interest rates again. The Fed hiked rates four times in 2018. The January PCE price data will be released on March 19 after being delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. In February, gasoline prices rose 1.5 percent after three straight monthly declines. Food prices increased 0.4 percent, the biggest rise since May 2014, after gaining 0.2 percent in January. Food consumed at home rose 0.4 percent last month, boosted by more expensive dairy products, fresh vegetables, cereals and meat. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3 percent in February, as it did in January. Apparel prices rose 0.3 percent after surging 1.1 percent in January. Consumers paid more for motor vehicle insurance, airline fares, household furnishings and personal care products. But consumers got some relief from healthcare costs, which fell 0.2 percent after five straight monthly increases. Healthcare costs were held down by a record 1.0 percent decline in the price of prescription medication and a 0.7 percent drop in the cost of hospital services.  Prices for new motor vehicles, used cars and trucks, as well as recreation fell. Some economists believed the declines in healthcare and motor vehicle prices were temporary, noting that these two categories tended to be volatile, and expected the core CPI to tick higher in the months ahead. “I don’t think the softness this month is a harbinger of slower inflation in the next few months,” said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein in New York.

11064,"NEW YORK   - It seemed like an opportunity a lender would not want to miss. The loan paid 10.25 percent interest which would go up if a benchmark rose. The borrower was Trident USA Health Services, a growing company which provided bedside medical testing in nursing and assisted living centers. Trident was buying similar companies across the country targeting cost savings from consolidation. Trident filed for bankruptcy last month. It had taken on too much debt to cope with reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments, equipment upgrades and other issues. A new billing system for the expanded company failed and it never collected millions of dollars. Trident’s lenders face estimated losses of 50 to 100 percent. “We were wrong,” Michael Mauer, chief executive of CM Finance Inc, CMFN.O one of the lenders, said in a Feb. 7 call with stock analysts. After the Great Recession, regulators squeezed much of the risk out of U.S. banks. But risk has not gone away. Much of it now resides in non-bank financial entities, including commercial loan companies, such as CM Finance, private credit funds, and structured finance vehicles, many of which have yet to be tested by a broad recession after a nearly decade-long expansion. The borrowers include mid-sized, speculative-grade companies that have loaded up on debt to fund their expansion. Sometimes one setback can push them over the edge, as happened with Trident’s botched billing system roll out. “We think credit losses will rise,” said Matt Carroll, a credit analyst at S&P Global Ratings. His reasons: A lot of money has flowed into private credit, pushing down lending standards in a benign economy. Some $900 billion in non-bank loans to mid-sized companies sit alongside another $1.1 trillion of speculative-grade loans that have been made by bank syndicates to larger companies and mostly resold to institutional investors. These amounts are dwarfed by the $11 trillion in outstanding U.S. home mortgage loans and probably are not enough to drag down the financial system, as mortgages did during the 2007-2009 crisis. However, rising non-bank debt has fueled concerns it could make a recession worse because loan losses could cripple many non-bank lenders, leaving companies most in need without access to credit. “When you have a real recession, the lender will not be there. So, a lot of these borrowers will be stranded,” JPMorgan Chase & Co chief Jamie Dimon told analysts in January. The publicly listed funds that lent to Trident are among several dozen known as business development companies. BDCassets have quadrupled since the crisis to $100 billion, according to data from Wells Fargo analysts.  Those funds attracted investors by offering yields topping 10 percent because they were making loans that were riskier than those banks were allowed to make. BDCs hold special status under a 1980s federal law designed to support small business. The law limits their leverage. They are allowed to bypass taxes by paying out 90 percent of profits to shareholders. Unlike most non-bank lenders, business development corporations must disclose estimated values for each loan and say which ones are going bad. Their reports give analysts looking for signs of trouble in commercial lending a glimpse into a bigger pool of an estimated additional $800 billion in unlisted funds and private accounts managed by many of the same firms. “You can learn a lot by looking at the BDCs for what they might mean for other private credit,” said Carroll of S&P Global Ratings. In 2013, for example, one such investor called THL Credit Inc (TCRD.O) made loans, starting at 9 percent, for Charming Charlie, a retailer of women’s fashion accessories arranged by color in as many as 26 different hues. The founder used the loans to buy shares of the business from a private equity firm and add more stores, according to S&P Global. But the company went too far in stocking the stores with items of different colors and got stuck with unsold merchandise. Constrained by its debt, the company ran short of cash to properly stock the stores and filed for bankruptcy in December 2017. THL declined to comment for this story, but in a March 7 call its executives told investors they have diversified their portfolio to include 42 companies and reduce the risk of losses like those on Charming Charlie. These days some BDCs are doing better than others. Six of 39 BDCs tracked by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods recently traded at premiums of more than 10 percent to net asset value, a sign of good lending records. Eight, however, traded for less than 75 cents for each dollar of net asset value - suggesting they had enough problems with loans to make investors doubt the values shown will hold up. As BDCs doubled in size since 2013, Refinitiv data shows levels of debt relative to profits have risen to 4.75 times from 4.2 times for mid-sized companies that borrowed to finance buyouts, according to Refinitiv data. That, combined with some lenders willingness to dial up the risk to boost returns, could spell more trouble ahead. “It has become harder for BDCs to deliver compelling returns without taking more risk,” Finian O’Shea, a BDC analyst at Wells Fargo, said. CM Finance, for example, in the last half of 2018 acquired loans coming due within two years and issued by low-rated Techniplas, a supplier of highly engineered plastic parts to the auto industry. The appeal of the loans? A 14 percent yield. Yet, last month Standard & Poor’s put a negative outlook on the loans because of the risk that company will not be able to refinance them in time.

China and Indonesia grounded their fleets of Boeing’s 737 MAX 8 aircraft after the fatal crash. Ryanair has ordered 135 of the 737 MAX 200 planes, a modified version of the MAX 8, and has options on 75 more. “We wouldn’t take any action at the moment,” O’Leary told the Irish Independent newspaper in an interview. “We need to wait and see what the outcome of the investigation will be.” A Ryanair spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Ryanair is due to take delivery of the first 737 MAX in April, two in May and two in June. It will then take 50 more deliveries before the 2020 summer season.  “They’ve recovered the black box this morning I understand, so we’ll wait and see what Boeing and the safety agencies [say],” O’Leary was quoted as saying.  O’Leary said he was “not particularly” concerned and that he expected the investigation into the crash to have been completed before the first delivery is made.

11109,"PARIS   - French prosecutors have opened a preliminary inquiry into how former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn financed his 2016 wedding, the Figaro newspaper and Agence France-Presse said on Monday. The French carmaker said last month it had found evidence, following an internal probe, that it had footed some of the bill. It established in its own investigation that a 2016 Renault sponsorship deal with the Chateau de Versailles outside Paris included a 50,000 euro ($56,000) personal benefit to Ghosn, and said it would alert prosecutors.  The prosecutor’s office in Nanterre near Paris, which the reports said was handling the investigation, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Ghosn was ousted as the head of Nissan and later removed as Renault CEO after his arrest in Japan last November over allegations of financial misconduct linked to his salary. He was released on a $9 million bail only last week. In the wake of the scandal, Renault began its own review of payments to Ghosn.  The former executive has denied any wrongdoing associated with the wedding.      “The event space at Versailles was made available to him without charge, and Mr Ghosn was unaware that the use of the space would be charged against Renault’s allotted usage,” his French-based lawyer Jean-Yves Leborgne said in February when the allegations came to light, adding that Ghosn had paid for all of his wedding expenses.  Renault declined to comment on Monday.  The carmaker had agreed before the wedding to sponsor 2.3 million euros of renovations at the historic Versailles palace in return for a credit granting it services from the chateau worth 25 percent of that amount, or 575,000 euros, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The rental fee was deducted from Renault’s credit for use of the Grand Trianon building at Versailles on Oct. 8, 2016, when Ghosn and his second wife, Carole, hosted their wedding reception, the source said.  The event had already attracted public attention for its opulence and Marie Antoinette-themed costumes.

11110,"NEW YORK   - Global equity markets surged on Monday, lifted by talk of more stimulus from China and by a broad rally on Wall Street that overcame a plunge in Boeing shares after one of its newest jets crashed, while U.S. debt yields rose on improved risk appetite. China’s main bourses clawed back almost half the 4 percent they lost on Friday as the country’s central bank chief pledged billions of dollars of cuts to taxes and fees to shore up an economy growing at its slowest pace in almost three decades. U.S. stocks followed strong gains in Europe with the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising 2 percent and the benchmark S&P more than 1 percent after Wall Street posted losses every day last week. MSCI’s gauge of global markets posted its biggest gain in seven weeks while European shares notched their best day in four weeks.  “This market, it comes in waves. Everybody who missed the rally in January and February is looking to buy the dip,” said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader who is head of market structure at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. “It’s buy the dip, it’s back,” Dick said. The rally on Wall Street given the decline in Boeing’s shares was especially impressive, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. “It’s a very strong sign of overall market strength,” James said. “After the weakness in the markets last week, things have gotten a little bit oversold,” he said. The Dow rebounded after Boeing Co, the index’s best performing component this year, pared steep losses after some airlines grounded the company’s new 737 MAX 8 passenger jet following a second deadly crash of the airliner in five months. Boeing shares dropped 5.3 percent, paring losses of about 13.5 percent shortly after the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 200.64 points, or 0.79 percent, to 25,650.88. The S&P 500 gained 40.23 points, or 1.47 percent, to 2,783.3 and the Nasdaq Composite added 149.92 points, or 2.02 percent, to 7,558.06. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.76 percent, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.2 percent. European shares rose on merger chatter in the battered banking sector, which along with talk of new Chinese stimulus, helped ease worries over a slowdown in the global economy. In China, the Shanghai Composite index rose 1.92 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 gained 1.98 percent. The dollar weakened after mixed U.S. retail sales data and sterling jumped as investors braced for parliamentary votes on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal that could decide the terms on which Britain leaves the European Union. May’s failure to win last-minute concessions from the European bloc regarding the Irish border set the stage for another humiliating defeat in parliament. Sterling fell in early trade but later erased its losses to trade at $1.3145, up 1.0 percent on the day. The dollar index fell 0.11 percent, with the euro up 0.05 percent to $1.1244. The Japanese yen weakened 0.09 percent versus the greenback at 111.24 per dollar. Norway’s crown gained after strong inflation data  raised interest rate hike expectations, with some strategists saying a March move by the Norges Bank was a done deal. With market volatility low, investors have rushed to buy currencies where central banks are still raising rates or economic data has pointed to a brighter economic outlook. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.6411 percent. Oil prices rose 1 percent on Monday, lifted by comments from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih that an end to OPEC-led supply cuts was unlikely before June. U.S. crude rose 72 cents to settle at $56.79 per barrel and Brent settled 84 cents higher at $66.58.  Gold fell, moving further off the key $1,300-per-ounce mark it briefly surpassed last week.  U.S. gold futures settled 0.6 percent lower at $1,291.10 an ounce.

11137,"  - China and Indonesia have grounded Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by their airlines in reaction to the fatal crash of a plane of the same type operated by Ethiopian Airlines on Sunday.  Ethiopian Airlines has also grounded its MAX 8 jets.  Boeing has said the investigation into the crash remains in its early stages and it has no basis to issue new guidance to operators. Other airlines continue to operate the narrowbody jet. Here is what airlines and regulators have said so far: “We have offered our assistance and are following closely the investigation. We have operated this aircraft type since 2017 and currently have 24 in our fleet. These aircraft have performed excellently from a safety, reliability and customer satisfaction perspective.” The company said it remained fully confident in the aircraft and that it was closely monitoring the investigation.     The Vietnamese airline, which announced last month it was in talks to buy 25 Boeing 737 planes, declined to comment.    The regulator said it was not grounding the aircraft and that it was following the investigation.  The airline said it had grounded both of its MAX 8 jets until it got more information on the crash. The regulator grounded 96 MAX 8s including those operated by Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines. The South African airline said it would monitor investigations into Sunday’s crash. It has ordered eight models of the aircraft and took delivery of the first one last month.  The airline said it was confident in the jet.     “We are monitoring the situation and continue to be in touch with Boeing. We remain confident in the airworthiness of our fleet. The safety of our passengers and crew is our first priority.”    The regulator said it would issue additional safety instructions to Indian carriers operating the MAX 8. Jet Airways and SpiceJet Ltd operate the plane.  South Korea is conducting an emergency inspection on Eastar Jet’s two MAX 8 jets, a ministry official said. The airline could not immediately be reached for comment. The airline said it remained fully confident in the aircraft and was closely monitoring the investigation The Indian airline said all 13 of its MAX 8s were currently flying. “From our experience we can operate the aircraft safely.” “We are in contact with Boeing, the aircraft producer, on the operations of the Boeing 737 Max,” CEO Bilal Eksi tweeted.  “Flight safety is our priority. We are closely monitoring developments. We are carrying out all our operations by keeping flight safety at the highest level.”   “We are monitoring the situation closely and will not speculate on the cause of the incident at this time.

11146,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI   - China’s aviation regulator on Monday grounded nearly 100 Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by its airlines, more than a quarter of the global fleet of the jets, after a deadly crash of one of the planes in Ethiopia.  However, a U.S. official said it was unclear what information the Chinese regulator was acting on because the investigation of Sunday’s crash, the second involving the latest version of the narrowbody jet, was in the early stages.  Speaking on condition of anonymity as the topic is sensitive, the U.S. official said there were no plans to follow suit, as the jet had a stellar safety record in the United States and there was a lack of information on what caused the Ethiopian crash.      Boeing, whose shares dropped 9 percent in U.S. pre-market trade, said the investigation remained in its early stages and it had no basis to issue new guidance to operators. It was unusual to ground a plane type unless a specific mechanical issue or component failure had been identified and could be inspected, said Andrew Herdman, director general of the  Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. “In this case it is not clear what the action item is, having done the suspension,” he said. “What is lacking now is what happened in this case. “That means finding the black boxes and piecing together other circumstantial evidence from air traffic control recordings and so on.” Most other Boeing 737 MAX operators globally told Reuters their planes would keep flying and they had no plans to cancel orders. Sunday’s crash, minutes after take-off, of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 bound for Nairobi, killed all 157 on board and prompted the carrier to ground the rest of its 737 MAX jets. In October, a 737 MAX 8 operated by Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air crashed 13 minutes after take-off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on a domestic flight, killing all 189 on board. The 737 MAX 8 first entered service in 2017.  The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said it would notify airlines when they could resume flying the jets, after contacting Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure flight safety. “Given that two accidents both involved newly delivered Boeing 737-8 planes and happened during take-off phase, they have some degree of similarity,” the CAAC said, adding the step was in line with its principle of zero tolerance of safety hazards. The 737 MAX 8 is sometimes referred to as the 737-8. The grounding was due to safety concerns and not related to trade friction between the United States and China, Li Jian, the deputy head of the Chinese regulator, told reporters, the Yangcheng Evening News said. “These are two separate issues,” the newspaper, which is backed by the government of the southern province of Guangdong, quoted Li as saying on the sidelines of a parliament meeting in Beijing.      Chinese airlines have 96 737 MAX 8 jets in service, the state company regulator said on Twitter-like Weibo, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines. Chinese aviation data firm Variflight said at least 29 international and domestic flights on Monday had been canceled and that airlines had swapped out the plane on 256 other flights that had been scheduled to use it. China Eastern’s chairman, Liu Shaoyong, told financial publication Caixin on the sidelines of the Beijing meeting that it would only consider resuming 737 MAX 8 flights once Boeing issued a safety commitment for the jets and proved there was no aircraft design link between the two crashes.  The cause of the Indonesian crash is still being investigated. A November preliminary report, before the retrieval of the cockpit voice recorder, focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but gave no reason for the crash.  Ethiopian Airlines said it had grounded its 737 MAX 8 fleet until further notice as an “extra safety precaution” even though it did not know the cause of Sunday’s crash. The airline has a remaining fleet of four of the aircraft, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 says. Cayman Airways said it had grounded both of its new 737 MAX 8 jets until it got more information. But no other airlines with 737 MAX 8s in their fleets or on order, or their regulators, told Reuters they were grounding the aircraft or cancelling orders. By January-end, Boeing had delivered 350 of the 737 MAX family jets to customers, with 4,661 more on order. Western industry sources say China has been at pains in recent years to assert its independence as a safety regulator as it negotiates mutual safety standard recognition with regulators in the United States and Europe. In 2017, it signed a mutual recognition deal with the FAA, but industry sources say it has struggled to gain approval from the FAA that would allow it to sell its self-developed C919 airliner to Western airlines. The grounding was “reasonable and justified”, said Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin but added that he did not anticipate a major problem, as Chinese airlines operated fewer than 100 of the aircraft, among a combined fleet of more than 2,000 planes.

11147,"OSLO   - Norwegian Air’s shares fell sharply on Monday as investors worried over weaker-than-expected passenger income and the potential impact of the crash of an Ethiopian Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 passenger jet the previous day. While Norwegian said its ‘MAX’ aircraft fleet remained in operation, China’s aviation regulator grounded nearly 100 similar jets operated by the country’s airlines. Norwegian Air had 18 ‘MAX’ jets in its fleet of 164 aircraft at the end of 2018 and is expected to take delivery of dozens more in coming years, taking the total to more than 70 by the end of 2021, the company has said in recent announcements. The move by China, and the possibility the ban could spread to other countries, was the main point to focus on for investors, brokers Pareto Securities said in a research note. “We expect the share to trade down today,” it said ahead of the market open. Ethiopia also halted the use of the ‘MAX’, as did Cayman Airways, even though aircraft maker Boeing said it saw no need to change its guidance for use of the plane. Norwegian’s shares fell 8.2 percent in early trade before a partial recovery to trade down 4.8 percent at 0952 GMT. The Oslo-based carrier has raised 3 billion Norwegian crowns ($345 million) from shareholders in recent months and said it would cut costs and curb its rapid growth to regain profitability. Norwegian, which has bet heavily on the transatlantic market, last week completed a share issue first announced in January, and said demand had exceeded its sale by 110 percent as the deep discount on offer attracted investors. “With a stronger financial position and lower cost going forward, we are well positioned to continue to attract new customers, not least in the long-haul market,” Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement on Monday. Norwegian’s yield, a measure of revenue per passenger carried and kilometers flown, grew to 0.32 Norwegian crowns from 0.31 crowns a year earlier, while a Reuters poll expected a rise to 0.33 crowns. Its capacity expansion, as measured by available seat kilometers (ASK), peaked at 51 percent growth year-on-year last June but has since declined, hitting 15 percent in February, less than the 19.2 percent that analysts forecast. Load factor, a measure of how many seats are sold on each flight, fell to 81.5 percent for the month, beating a forecast of 80.6 percent but down from 84.3 percent a year earlier. In a further boost to its profits and balance sheet, Norwegian said its fuel hedge contracts had so far this year resulted in gains of 917 million Norwegian crowns, partly reversing losses sustained last year. British Airways owner IAG, which in 2018 attempted to buy Norwegian, last week said it would not rule out another bid but added that it was unlikely.

11171,"  - The sex abuse scandal roiling USA Gymnastics could become the United States’ equivalent of the doping controversy involving Russian athletes at the last Winter Games, senior International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound said on Friday. The sentencing of former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar on Wednesday to 175 years in prison for molesting athletes including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney, Simone Biles and Jordyn Wieber, has sparked outrage and multiple investigations into sexual abuse in sports. A week of gut-wrenching courtroom revelations by gymnasts has led to separate investigations by the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. Department of Education. Those investigations seek to establish if other sports officials turned a blind eye to Nassar’s abuses and to examine allegations of harassment by officials in other sports, including swimming and taekwondo. Pound, who oversaw the IOC investigation of the bribery scandal surrounding the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics and set up the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said the IOC was unlikely to get directly involved in any investigation or to sanction the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) for failing to act faster. But he said the issue could find its way onto the agenda of next week’s IOC session in South Korea ahead of the Pyeongchang Winter Games, and that he might raise the topic if no one else does. “This is kind of the U.S. equivalent in abuse of the Russian doping ... It might well (become the next big issue),” Pound told Reuters in a telephone interview from Florida.  He said that the scandal had not been on the IOC’s horizon when the agenda for next week’s meeting was drawn up. “Certainly if there is no indication that anybody is going to do it there is always the opportunity under ‘other business’ to say, ‘Hey, maybe perhaps we haven’t had a chance to get the right back swing in here, but what is the IOC going to do with the whole problem?” he said. The IOC banned Russia last month from Pyeongchang over “systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system at the 2014 Sochi Games. It left the door open to athletes with no history of doping to compete as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.”  A total of 169 Russian athletes have been cleared to compete at the Pyeongchang Olympic Games. With Nassar condemned to spend the rest of his life behind bars, the focus has shifted to the coaches, federations and institutions, including the USOC, that allowed the abuse in U.S. gymnastics to go unchecked. On Wednesday, the USOC threatened to decertify USA Gymnastics unless the 18 members on the board of directors were replaced. Several resigned as a result of the scandal, and USA Gymnastics said on Friday that its remaining directors would also step down. The USOC itself has also been attacked by some of gymnastics’ biggest names. Raisman, a triple Olympic gold medalist, said that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC had been quick to capitalize on and celebrate her success. “But did they reach out when I came forward? No,” she said in court this week. The outspoken Pound, who spearheaded the initial WADA investigation into widespread state sponsored doping in Russia, said the IOC was limited in what pressure it can bring to bear directly on the USOC. For the moment, he said, it would probably be content with monitoring the situation in the United States. “I think they (the IOC) would probably sit on the sidelines and see what happens,” said Pound. “You’ve got to be careful about interfering in other countries where you have no legal rights ... If they got involved it would be pretty informally.” Pound said the USOC had now jumped into the difficult and painful issue “with both feet,” a situation that he described as “better late than never.” ",Gymnastics abuse scandal could be U.S. equivalent to Russian doping -Pound,"January 26, 2018 /  11:45 PM ", the sex abuse scandal roiling usa gymnastics could become the united states equivalent of the doping controversy involving russian athletes at the last winter games senior international olympic committee member dick pound said on friday the sentencing of former usa gymnastics team doctor larry nassar on wednesday to  years in prison for molesting athletes including olympic gold medalists aly raisman gabby douglas mckayla maroney simone biles and jordyn wieber has sparked outrage and multiple investigations into sexual abuse in sports a week of gut wrenching courtroom revelations by gymnasts has led to separate investigations by the u s house of representatives the u s senate and the u s department of education those investigations seek to establish if other sports officials turned a blind eye to nassar s abuses and to examine allegations of harassment by officials in other sports including swimming and taekwondo pound who oversaw the ioc investigation of the bribery scandal surrounding the  salt lake city olympics and set up the world anti doping agency wada said the ioc was unlikely to get directly involved in any investigation or to sanction the u s olympic committee usoc for failing to act faster but he said the issue could find its way onto the agenda of next week s ioc session in south korea ahead of the pyeongchang winter games and that he might raise the topic if no one else does this is kind of the u s equivalent in abuse of the russian doping it might well become the next big issue pound told  in a telephone interview from florida he said that the scandal had not been on the ioc s horizon when the agenda for next week s meeting was drawn up certainly if there is no indication that anybody is going to do it there is always the opportunity under other business to say hey maybe perhaps we haven t had a chance to get the right back swing in here but what is the ioc going to do with the whole problem he said the ioc banned russia last month from pyeongchang over systematic manipulation of the anti doping system at the  sochi games it left the door open to athletes with no history of doping to compete as olympic athletes from russia a total of  russian athletes have been cleared to compete at the pyeongchang olympic games with nassar condemned to spend the rest of his life behind bars the focus has shifted to the coaches federations and institutions including the usoc that allowed the abuse in u s gymnastics to go unchecked on wednesday the usoc threatened to decertify usa gymnastics unless the  members on the board of directors were replaced several resigned as a result of the scandal and usa gymnastics said on friday that its remaining directors would also step down the usoc itself has also been attacked by some of gymnastics biggest names raisman a triple olympic gold medalist said that both usa gymnastics and the usoc had been quick to capitalize on and celebrate her success but did they reach out when i came forward no she said in court this week the outspoken pound who spearheaded the initial wada investigation into widespread state sponsored doping in russia said the ioc was limited in what pressure it can bring to bear directly on the usoc for the moment he said it would probably be content with monitoring the situation in the united states i think they the ioc would probably sit on the sidelines and see what happens said pound you ve got to be careful about interfering in other countries where you have no legal rights if they got involved it would be pretty informally pound said the usoc had now jumped into the difficult and painful issue with both feet a situation that he described as better late than never ,Boeing Crisis,0.29148322343826294

Atlanta-based Delta is “the leader in fare segmentation, international alliances, and technology, as well as maintenance and repair,” Ross Margolies, who heads Stelliam Investment Management, said in the article. The article noted rumors that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc could be interested in buying an airline, noting Berkshire already owned about 10 percent of each of the four major U.S. carriers: Delta, Southwest Airlines Co, United Continental Holdings inc, and American Airlines Group Inc. The article said that “Buffett appears to be most enamored” with Delta. In a filing on Friday, Berkshire disclosed it recently lifted its stake in Delta by 5.4 million shares and now holds 70.9 million shares, a 10.4 percent stake. Officials at Delta said the company did not have any comment on the Barron’s article beyond Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian’s quotes in the story. Bastian told Barron’s that “investors want to see our margins expand.” Delta aims to boost margins this year and increase earnings per share by 15 percent, he said. As for the potential Berkshire Hathaway interest, Bastian said: “We’re open for sale every day of the year.

11188,"NEW YORK   - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp is nearing a deal to acquire peer Mellanox Technologies Ltd for more than $7 billion in cash, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday.      The deal would be Nvidia’s biggest-ever acquisition and boost its business of making chips for data centers, allowing it to reduce its reliance on the video game industry, for which it is best known as a major technology vendor.     Nvidia has outbid Intel Corp in the auction for Mellanox and could announce a deal as early as Monday, the person said. The source asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Intel and Mellanox did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. Financial news website Calcalist had reported earlier on Sunday that Nvidia had outbid Intel for Mellanox.     Mellanox’s chips power high-speed networks connecting servers. The company, which is based in Israel and the United States, had a market capitalization at the end of trading on Friday of about $5.9 billion.      Data center revenue accounts for nearly a third of Nvidia’s sales. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California has grown at a rapid pace in the past few years, under CEO Jensen Huang, but a slowdown in China and a fading cyrptocurrency craze have started to weigh on its sales in recent quarters. In January, Nvidia, which has market capitalization of $91 billion, cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars because of weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data center sales. Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox would also represent a win for activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, which is a shareholder of the company and reached a deal with it last year over the composition of its board.

11195,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump last June ordered Special Counsel Robert Mueller fired but backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than follow his directive, The New York Times reported on Thursday, citing four people told of the matter. White House lawyers and press officials did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment. Mueller, who is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, learned of the incident in recent months as his investigators interviewed current and former senior White House officials in an inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice, the Times reported. Amid media reports that Mueller was looking into a possible obstruction case, Trump argued that the former Federal Bureau of Investigation director had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the probe, two of the people said, according to the Times report. First, Trump said that a dispute years ago over fees at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, had led Mueller to resign his membership, the newspaper reported.  The president also said Mueller could not be impartial because he had most recently worked for a law firm that previously represented the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Trump also said Mueller had been interviewed to return as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation the day before he was appointed special counsel in May, the Times reported, citing the two people. White House counsel Donald McGahn said he would quit rather than follow through on the order to fire Mueller, the Times reported, citing the people. McGahn disagreed with the president’s case for dismissing Mueller and told senior White House officials that firing him  would have a catastrophic effect on Trump’s presidency and raise questions about whether the White House was trying to obstruct the Russia probe, according to the people cited by the Times. McGahn also told White House officials that Trump would not follow through on the dismissal on his own, and the president then backed off his demand, according to the people, who the Times said spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation. Mueller was appointed special counsel in May by the Justice Department after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the agency’s Russia investigation. Russia has denied any meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.  Comey’s firing is central to whether Trump may have committed obstruction of justice. Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to be interviewed under oath by Mueller, and according to sources with knowledge of the investigation, Trump’s attorneys have been talking to Mueller’s team about an interview.

11241,"STOCKHOLM   - Several European banks are facing allegations of being involved in a Baltic money laundering scandal and failing to prevent tainted Russian money from flowing through their branches across the world. The scandal first came to light via investigations by U.S. authorities into Latvia’s ABLV bank, which they accused of institutionalized money laundering, and Pilatus Bank in Malta, whose chairman was charged in the United States over money laundering and bank fraud. The first major bank to face questions, however, was Danske Bank, when Danish newspaper Berlingske said in 2017 a whistleblower had raised suspicions over the origins of billions of euros that had flowed through the Estonian branch of the Denmark’s biggest bank. Since then, a number of other European banks have been drawn into the scandal by various media organizations and a collective of European news outlets called the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). Another central player in the saga is Bill Browder, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has successfully lobbied for U.S. sanctions against Moscow over the killing of his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009. Browder has brought criminal complaints against banks in various countries, including the United States, over alleged money laundering relating to a tax fraud exposed by Magnitsky. Denmark’s biggest bank admitted in September that 200 billion euros ($226 billion) of suspicious transactions originating from Russia, former Soviet states and elsewhere flowed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. The bank is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and France. Browder has been key to triggering some of these investigations, having most recently filed a criminal complaint with U.S. authorities. Money laundering could have occurred in relation to at least 40 billion Swedish crowns ($4.3 billion) transferred between Baltic accounts at Swedbank and Danske between 2007 and 2015, Swedish TV alleged on Feb. 20. Sweden’s and Estonia’s financial watchdogs have opened a joint investigation into Swedbank, while Lithuania’s financial regulator is separately examining Swedbank’s local operations. Browder is planning to file criminal complaints against Swedbank in several countries where it has operations, starting with a complaint with Swedish authorities. Swedbank has hired external investigators to look into the matter. Its CEO Birgitte Bonnesen has said she is confident about the bank’s actions to prevent money laundering but could not promise that nothing had slipped through the net. The Nordic region’s largest bank handled about 700 million euros in suspicious transactions between 2005 and 2017, with funds heading to shell companies in countries such as the British Virgin Islands and Panama, a Finnish broadcaster alleged on March 4. The bank said the information in the report had been covered previously and when it found suspicious behavior it reported it to the relevant authorities. “We recognize that our systems in the past may not have been robust enough to counter this sort of financial crime. For that we are truly sorry,” the bank said. Browder filed complaints against Nordea with authorities in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland in October. Sweden decided not to investigate, but Finland and Norway are yet to give any update. Danish police had already started an independent investigation in 2016 after the Danske scandal broke. Nordea was in 2015 fined 50 million Swedish crowns, the maximum penalty at the time, by the Swedish regulator for breaching anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism rules. Germany’s biggest bank helped to process the bulk of the payments involved in Danske’s money laundering scandal, a source with direct knowledge of the case said on Nov. 21. It was also named as a receiving counterparty to potential money laundering transactions in an OCCRP report on Monday. A Deutsche Bank spokesman confirmed to Reuters that it acted as a correspondent bank for Danske Bank in Estonia, but said it ended the relationship in 2015 after identifying suspicious activity. On Nov. 19, the bank’s regulation chief said it played only a secondary role as a so-called correspondent bank to Danske Bank, limiting what it needed to know about the people behind the transactions. Germany’s financial watchdog in September ordered Deutsche Bank to do more to prevent money laundering and “terrorist financing”. The bank has publicly said it agreed it needed to improve its processes to properly identify clients. The bank has also been fined reut.rs/2tTuDwD nearly $700 million for allowing money laundering through artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York and an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice is ongoing.  The French bank, through its private banking subsidiary Indosuez, has allegedly been involved in money laundering, French newspaper Les Echos said on Tuesday, saying it was among the banks mentioned in Monday’s OCCRP report.  The OCCRP said its report was based on leaked documents detailing transactions worth more than $470 billion sent in 1.3 million transfers from 233,000 firms. A Credit Agricole spokeswoman said its Indosuez unit had “fulfilled all its obligations regarding anti-money laundering” when asked about the matter. The Netherlands’ largest financial services provider admitted on Sept. 4 that criminals had been able to launder money through its accounts and agreed to pay 775 million euros to settle the Dutch case. The bank was aware of the potential involvement in money laundering to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros by one of its clients at its Moscow branch, newspaper Trouw reported, citing Monday’s OCCRP report.  ING said the bank always takes such allegations seriously, but could not comment on the specifics of the report. Browder’s company filed a report in February to Austrian prosecutors containing allegations the bank was the top recipient in a list of 78 banks in Austria that received funds allegedly linked to money laundering. RBI, one of the biggest foreign lenders in Russia, was also named in Monday’s OCCRP report, which alleged the bank was a counterparty in a money laundering scheme. The bank said it was “not familiar with the concrete allegations and does not have any further information on the content of the complaint”.  “RBI takes the allegations in the media very seriously and is conducting an internal investigation,” it said. Austrian anti-corruption prosecutors said they were examining money-laundering allegations after receiving a complaint against unknown parties, a spokeswoman said.  Monday’s OCCRP report also named Dutch lenders ABN Amro and  Rabobank as having facilitated several hundred million euros in improper payments and said counterparties on these transactions included U.S. bank Citigroup. Majority state-owned ABN Amro, which in February said it had stepped up efforts against money laundering and other criminal activities, said the reports were not related to its business now. Rabobank, which was fined 1 million euros in February by the Dutch central bank for failing to catch money laundering by clients, said it would not comment on specific transactions. It said it adheres to international anti-money laundering rules. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which acquired a business from ABN Amro in 2008, said it could not comment on specific transactions but took allegations of money laundering seriously.  “We are committed to combating financial crime and money laundering in line with our regulations and have controls and safeguards in place to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate these risks,” RBS said in a statement. Citigroup declined to comment on the report.

11252,"WASHINGTON   - Marriott International Inc Chief Executive Arne Sorenson apologized on Thursday before a U.S. Senate panel for a massive data breach involving up to 383 million guests in its Starwood hotels reservation system and vowed to protect against future attacks. Sorenson told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that the hacking, which occurred over a four-year period, that he did not know if China was behind the hacking attempt but said it was fully cooperating with the FBI, which is trying to determine who was responsible. “The short answer is we don’t know,” Sorenson said. “We’ve simply been focused on making sure the door is closed.” Reuters reported in December that hackers left clues suggesting they were working for a Chinese government intelligence gathering operation, according to sources familiar with the matter. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested in December China was behind the attack. He said the company first became aware of a security issue in September 2018, notified the FBI in October and disclosed the issue publicly on Nov. 30. Sorenson prompted Marriott to accelerate the retirement of the Starwood reservation system, a step that was completed in December. Committee Chairman Rob Portman noted that Starwood said it had discovered malware in November 2015 - before Marriott purchased it - on some systems designed to steal credit card information but Starwood said at the time it “did not impact its guest reservation database.” Sorenson said there was evidence of an unauthorized party on the Starwood network since July 2014 but “our investigators had found no evidence the attacker had accessed guest data” until mid-November 2018. Sorenson said since October Marriott has provided the FBI with “several updates and ready access to forensic findings and information to support their investigation.” Sorenson said the company has not received any substantiated claims of loss from fraud attributable to the incident and had increased security by adding “protection tools” to determine suspicious behavior, as well as two-factor authentication and keeping valuable more secure. Marriott disclosed on Nov. 30 it had discovered its Starwood hotels reservation database had been hacked over a four-year period in one of the largest breaches in history. At least five U.S. states and the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office are investigating the attack. Marriott offered to buy Starwood in 2015, a year before the hack started, and closed the $13.6 billion deal in September 2016. Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the panel, said the “incident also raises questions about the degree to which cybersecurity concerns do and should play a role in merger and acquisition decisions.” Carper said Marriott acquired a company with “serious cybersecurity challenges and had actually been attacked before” but chose to initially leave Starwood’s security system in place after acquiring it.

11276,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING   - China’s crude oil imports rose to the third-highest volume on record on a daily basis on increasing purchases by new private refineries, while natural gas imports eased as demand dropped amid warmer temperatures, customs data showed on Friday.  China, the world’s biggest crude oil importer, took in 39.23 million tonnes of crude oil last month, the data from the General Administration of Customs showed.  That is the equivalent of 10.23 million barrels per day (bpd), up 21.6 percent from 8.41 million bpd during the same period the year before. This the fourth month in a row that China’s crude imports held above the 10 million bpd mark. Last month’s crude arrivals also rose from January’s 10.03 million bpd. Hengli Petrochemical, the operator of China’s first privately-owned large-scale refinery, said on Jan. 28 that the plant is set for full operation by the end of March. Zhejiang Petrochemical has also begun test runs at some units at its refinery in east China though full pilot production is expected only during the second quarter.    “The new plants are one factor...The strong crude imports are also a reflection of fundamental demand support from the property sector and the speed-up in infrastructure building,” said Seng-Yick Tee of consultancy SIA Energy. Imports for the first two months of 2019 gained 12.4 percent from a year ago at 81.83 million tonnes, or 10.12 million bpd.  Natural gas imports in February fell from a month ago as temperatures rose but were up from the same time in 2018.  Total natural gas imports including both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline gas were at 7.57 million tonnes last month, down from 9.81 million tonnes in January, but up 9.2 percent from a year earlier, the customs data showed. With the heating season ending in mid-March, China’s LNG import demand, which hit record in January, will ease, said Lu Xiao, an analyst with IHS Markit.  “We’re expecting slower demand growth in total gas consumption and LNG imports this year,” said Lu.  Gas imports for the first two months of 2019 reached 17.36 million tonnes, up 18.5 percent from a year earlier, the data showed. Data also showed China’s refined fuel exports were up 9.4 percent from a year ago at 3.81 million tonnes while imports fell 10 percent from a year earlier to 2.35 million tonnes.

11277,"TOKYO   - Downside risks in the global economy are likely to persist over the medium to long term, pressured by the Sino-U.S. trade war and a slowdown in China, Japan’s top financial diplomat said. Masatsugu Asakawa, vice finance minister for international affairs, said he hoped Washington and Beijing would resolve their trade dispute by tackling not just trade issues but China’s structural problems. Asakawa’s comments came just days after China set an economic growth target of 6.0 to 6.5 percent in 2019, below the 6.6 percent gross domestic product growth reported last year. “It’s inevitable for Chinese economy to slow, with its potential growth lowering as a trend,” Asakawa told Reuters. “It is unlikely to falter greatly as there’s room for authorities’ stimulus measures.” Global trade has slowed over the past year as Washington and Beijing have been locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle for months. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that trade talks with China were moving along well and predicted either a “good deal” or no deal. Asakawa said the trade war and China’s slowdown meant the risks to global growth remain over the medium to long term, although the world economy is still in recovery mode.   Asakawa said he wanted the world’s two largest economies to address China’s structural problems over intellectual property, technology transfer and state-owned enterprises. Tokyo and Washington are set to enter bilateral trade talks in the coming months, with currency issues likely in focus. Asked if Trump’s past criticism against Japan for keeping the yen low through the Bank of Japan’s “money supply” could tie Tokyo’s hands in coping with a spike in the currency, Asakawa said he saw no problem as long as monetary policy is not targeting currencies “G7 and G20 have constantly agreed that excess currency volatility and disorderly movement are undesirable for economy and financial stability,” he said. “Japan can act as appropriate based on the G7/G20 agreement in case disorderly moves like “flash crash” occurs in the market.” Asakawa took up his post in July 2015, overseeing currency issues and international affairs such as G7 and G20 meetings. He has become the longest serving top financial diplomat, exceeding the previous record set by BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who served as vice finance minister for international affairs for 3 1/2 years to Jan 2003. Under Japan’s chair, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors will meet in Fukuoka in western Japan on June 8-9, followed by a leaders’ summit in Osaka on June 28-29. Japan hopes to deepen debate on global imbalances, including widening income gaps and the distribution of wealth, as well as  the management of fiscal and monetary policies in the face of aging populations around the world, he said. He added that Japan would lead the G20 debate on free trade, adding that the global body would lose its influence if trade issues aren’t discussed in a comprehensive manner. Asakawa justified Japan’s hefty current account surpluses, running about 20 trillion yen for a third straight year to 2018, which mostly consist of income gains from overseas investment. Japan’s current account surplus is in part backed by a rise in savings for the future as the population ages, he said.  “Japanese direct investment overseas has helped create jobs in the United States and Europe.” ","Japan sees global growth risks persisting on trade war, China slowdown","March 8, 2019 /  3:50 AM ",tokyo downside risks in the global economy are likely to persist over the medium to long term pressured by the sino u s trade war and a slowdown in china japan s top financial diplomat said masatsugu asakawa vice finance minister for international affairs said he hoped washington and beijing would resolve their trade dispute by tackling not just trade issues but china s structural problems asakawa s comments came just days after china set an economic growth target of   to   percent in  below the   percent gross domestic product growth reported last year it s inevitable for chinese economy to slow with its potential growth lowering as a trend asakawa told  it is unlikely to falter greatly as there s room for authorities stimulus measures global trade has slowed over the past year as washington and beijing have been locked in a tit for tat tariff battle for months u s president donald trump said on wednesday that trade talks with china were moving along well and predicted either a good deal or no deal asakawa said the trade war and china s slowdown meant the risks to global growth remain over the medium to long term although the world economy is still in recovery mode asakawa said he wanted the world s two largest economies to address china s structural problems over intellectual property technology transfer and state owned enterprises tokyo and washington are set to enter bilateral trade talks in the coming months with currency issues likely in focus asked if trump s past criticism against japan for keeping the yen low through the bank of japan s money supply could tie tokyo s hands in coping with a spike in the currency asakawa said he saw no problem as long as monetary policy is not targeting currencies g and g have constantly agreed that excess currency volatility and disorderly movement are undesirable for economy and financial stability he said japan can act as appropriate based on the g g agreement in case disorderly moves like flash crash occurs in the market asakawa took up his post in july  overseeing currency issues and international affairs such as g and g meetings he has become the longest serving top financial diplomat exceeding the previous record set by boj governor haruhiko kuroda who served as vice finance minister for international affairs for    years to jan  under japan s chair g finance ministers and central bank governors will meet in fukuoka in western japan on june   followed by a leaders summit in osaka on june   japan hopes to deepen debate on global imbalances including widening income gaps and the distribution of wealth as well as the management of fiscal and monetary policies in the face of aging populations around the world he said he added that japan would lead the g debate on free trade adding that the global body would lose its influence if trade issues aren t discussed in a comprehensive manner asakawa justified japan s hefty current account surpluses running about  trillion yen for a third straight year to  which mostly consist of income gains from overseas investment japan s current account surplus is in part backed by a rise in savings for the future as the population ages he said japanese direct investment overseas has helped create jobs in the united states and europe ,Boeing Crisis,0.2922602891921997

11289,"  - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has opened up a new front in its battle with the U.S. government by filing a lawsuit challenging a congressional ban on federal agencies’ use of the Chinese technology company’s products. Legal experts said the firm is likely to lose its case because U.S. courts tend to avoid second-guessing Congress’ actions relating to national security, including the ban enacted in August as part of a defense spending bill. But some lawyers said that Huawei might be hoping to score public relations points against the U.S. government even if it knows its chances of winning are slim. The following explains the measures against Huawei, the nature of the lawsuit, and why it will likely be dismissed. What is Huawei and why is it at odds with the U.S. government? Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s biggest producer of telecommunications network equipment and it also competes with Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co as a smartphone maker.  The company and its founder Ren Zhengfei have long been suspected of having close ties with China’s military and intelligence agencies. Huawei denies that it works with the Chinese government and that its products are designed to facilitate spying. Separately from the legislation at issue in the lawsuit, the United States is also considering a ban on the use of Huawei telecom equipment by U.S. companies in the construction of 5G wireless networks, and is urging its allies to do the same.  Washington has also accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is also Ren’s daughter, was arrested in December in Canada at the request of the U.S. Justice Department, which claims she orchestrated the violations.  Huawei says the U.S. actions are politically motivated, coming at the same time as the Trump administration is holding high-stakes trade negotiations with Beijing. U.S. demands include that China change its laws and practices to protect intellectual property and end forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms. What is Huawei’s complaint? Huawei’s primary argument is that the ban on its products is a “bill of attainder” - a legislative act condemning a particular person or group of people and punishing them without a trial. Bills of attainders are specifically banned in the U.S. Constitution. In one of the most well-known cases involving a bill of attainder, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court in 1946 struck down as unconstitutional an act of Congress that stripped three government employees of their salaries for allegedly supporting “subversive activities.”   More recently, a federal judge ruled a North Carolina bill limiting funding to the women’s health organization Planned Parenthood was an unconstitutional bill of attainder because it was “adopted specifically to penalize” the group. Huawei is also alleging a violation of its due process rights, and argues that Congress violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers by exercising authority reserved for the judicial system. Does Huawei have a case? Most U.S. legal experts say no, since ruling for Huawei would likely require the courts to decide there was no legitimate basis for Congress’ inclusion of the ban in its bill. In general, U.S. courts are reluctant to second-guess national security determinations by Congress and the executive branch, who are viewed as being in a better position to make such decisions. Several legal experts pointed to a November 2018 decision by a federal appeals court rejecting a similar bill of attainder claim by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, whose anti-virus software was banned from U.S. government networks by legislation in 2017. The court in that case said national security concerns about Kaspersky were supported by “ample evidence” and that it needed to give Congress “latitude” to craft measures to protect national security. The Texas court hearing Huawei’s case will not be bound by that decision, but will certainly consider its reasoning closely because of the similarities in the two disputes.  Why would Huawei bring a lawsuit it is unlikely to win? Huawei may figure the potential benefits in terms of public opinion are worth a legal fight, no matter what the outcome. The firm has launched a massive public relations offensive over the past two months.  If Huawei’s case survives a motion to dismiss, the Chinese company would be allowed to demand discovery from the U.S. government, including documents and possibly the testimony of officials. Those documents could provide evidence for its position that Washington is motivated more by politics than any real national security concerns.  But legal experts said Huawei faces long odds getting past a motion to dismiss, noting the Kaspersky case was thrown out before discovery. The centralized nature of the Chinese government, with its close ties to industry, and the many well-documented cases of Chinese hacking would all support the position that the U.S. law has a reasonable basis. Some legal experts said a case involving a wind energy company owned by Chinese nationals might offer Huawei a slender hope for precedent.  Ralls Corp sued after the Obama administration moved in 2012 to block it from building wind turbines close to a military site in Oregon on natural security grounds. A federal court ruled the government violated Ralls’ due process rights by not giving it an opportunity to rebut the unclassified evidence the government relied upon to reach its decision. The case was resolved in 2015 in a confidential settlement, after which Ralls sold the wind farms.

11301,"LONDON   - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited the new $1 billion U.S. embassy in London on Monday, just days after his boss Donald Trump criticized the move to new diplomatic premises as part of a bad deal agreed by the administration of Barack Obama. Trump earlier this month canceled a trip to London to open the new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for “peanuts”. Tillerson was greeted by U.S. Ambassador Woody Johnson as workmen finished planting shrubs in the grounds of the new embassy. America’s top diplomat then met some of the marines who are stationed at the embassy. “The embassy actually, is gonna really work,” U.S. Ambassador Johnson said ahead of Tillerson’s arrival. Asked when there would be a ribbon cutting ceremony, Ambassador Johnson said: “At some point we’re going to do it, but there’s no urgency to that. We’ll do it when the time is right.” The decision to move the U.S. Embassy from its current Grosvenor Square location in the exclusive Mayfair area of London and to a site on the south bank of the Thames was agreed in 2008 under the presidency of George W. Bush.  The American flag was this month removed from Grosvenor Square where the U.S. embassy has been based since 1938 with the area known as “Little America” during World War Two, when the square also housed the military headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The new embassy is a veritable fortress set back at least 100 feet (30 meters) from surrounding buildings - mostly newly-erected high-rise residential blocks - and incorporating living quarters for U.S. Marines permanently stationed inside. The $1 billion construction was funded by the sale of other properties in London.

11302,"NEW YORK   - General Electric Co will invest more heavily in junk bonds, private equity and other high-yield investments to boost returns at its ailing insurance business, company executives said on Thursday. Seeking to calm investors about its insurance liabilities, GE said its insurance investments are too conservative compared with competitors. The change will allow for better returns that help reduce the amount of reserves it must set aside for claims, Anthony Grandolfo, the chief investment officer of GE’s insurance business, told analysts on a conference call. Asked about increased risk, he said GE was still being prudent. “We’re starting from a point where we think (the portfolio) is quite conservative and we expect to continue to maintain a portfolio that is quite conservative,” said Grandolfo, who was hired as GE’s first dedicated chief investment officer for insurance in October. Only 2 percent of GE’s insurance assets are currently in non-investment-grade investments - much less than the 12 percent average in the industry, Grandolfo said, citing a Goldman Sachs study. GE plans to gradually increase its level to 8 percent by 2024, he added. GE has also hired two other executives to run its insurance unit: Chief Executive Officer Tim Kneeland, who formerly handled long-term care policies at Transamerica, and Managing Director Bob Deutsch, former chief financial officer at CNA Financial. In a presentatihere that repeated information GE supplied in its annual report last week, the Boston-based conglomerate said it has achieved about $500 million worth of premium increases that it is in the process of putting in place. It is also pressing for $1.2 billion in further increases to help stem losses on some 300,000 long-term care insurance policies, which cover costs for services such as in-home or nursing-home care. GE shares were up 2.3 percent at $9.32 on Thursday.  Investor focus now turns to GE’s presentation of its full-year forecast, scheduled for March 14.  GE shocked investors when it took a surprise $6.2 billion after-tax charge last year and began setting aside $15 billion - one of the largest such amounts ever - to cover the policies that were underwritten more than a decade ago, when actuaries did not yet know how costly the claims would become.  GE’s insurance losses are among a host of problems the 127-year-old company is facing as it attempts a breakup under new Chief Executive Larry Culp in an effort to restore profit and buoy its stock, which has tumbled to less than a third of its value in mid-2016. The company also said it is looking at “options” to reduce its insurance risk, adding to hints from Culp on Tuesday about possible sales of parts of the business.  GE’s massive power-plant business is hemorrhaging cash and contending with falling sales and technical problems, while the company is selling assets to pay down its outsized debt. Since last year, GE has reduced the total amount of insurance reserves it plans to set aside to $14.5 billion by 2024 after completing an analysis of the policies.  But some analysts have said GE may need to nearly double that amount because assumptions it used to calculate the exposure are optimistic.  As a reinsurer, GE cannot seek premium increases directly.

11310,"COPENHAGEN   - Compliance and anti-money laundering staff are in hot demand in the Nordic financial sector following tougher regulations and a string of scandals involving the region’s top banks Danske Bank, Nordea and Swedbank. Compliance officers ensure banks meet industry regulations that have mushroomed since the financial crisis a decade ago, and most global financial hubs have been through a hiring boom. The recruitment drive in the Nordic region, however, has been given extra impetus by a money laundering scandal at Denmark’s Danske Bank, which has spread to some other lenders in Sweden and Finland. “We’ve become the new ‘business rock stars’,” a Copenhagen-based compliance professional told Reuters.  He saw a 50 percent jump in wages the last time he changed job to almost 1.2 million Danish crowns ($182,000) per year and is regularly contacted by headhunters.  “Money-laundering was the buzzword of the year last year, and I wouldn’t be surprised if compliance officer became the buzzword this year,” he said. The highest paid 10 percent compliance managers in Copenhagen’s financial sector now earn more than 1.2 million crowns per year, almost twice the average for law and economy graduates, figures from trade union DJOF show.    Danske Bank said last month it would take on an extra 600 compliance and anti-money laundering staff this year. It has already quadrupled the number since 2015 to 1,200. “There is great competition for the skilled employees, and we can feel that,” said Ole Bech-Petersen, head of Joining & Leaving at Danske, adding it would be impossible for the bank to find enough trained staff in Denmark.  The bank is expanding its search to include new graduates from many different fields of study, experienced customer-oriented bankers, and compliance experts who could be recruited outside Scandinavia, he said. Compliance professionals are also in demand in other industries, such as drugmaking, software development, law and manufacturing, as regulations proliferate and companies seek to reduce legal risks.  “The perception has been that we can just get someone from outside the financial sector. But they’re not there. Many companies need these people,” said Michael Budolfsen, president of Nordic Financial Unions, a labor group for financial staff. Jobindex, a major Danish job site, posted almost 1,500 job adverts containing the word “compliance” last quarter, up from less than 200 per quarter a decade ago. “Many companies are interested in these employees, so the recruitment process often happens very fast, especially for young, well-educated people,” said Soren Billeschou Christiansen, partner at Proselection, a large recruitment specialist within accounting and finance.  Finland-based Nordea, the largest bank in the Nordics, said it had invested more than 730 million euros ($825 million) in the last three years in areas such as fighting financial crime and compliance, and now has over 1,500 staff in such fields.  Because of local skills shortages and rising wages, Nordic banks are looking at alternative ways to manage risks.  Sweden’s Handelsbanken, for example, said that as well as hiring more people banks could develop IT systems and use artificial intelligence in areas such as fraud prevention.  The largest Nordic banks have in recent years also increasingly moved administrative and service tasks to Baltic countries, where wages are generally lower. Danske’s Bech-Petersen said most of its 600 new jobs would be in either Denmark or Lithuania, where the bank set up a service center in 2012 that has more than 2,300 employees. But such steps have so far done little to temper demand for local compliance specialists, as some of the region’s financial regulators can testify.  “Ironically, when we ask the banks to bolster anti-money laundering we know that they start looking at our personnel,” said Erik Thedeen, head of Sweden’s Financial Supervisory Authority “This has been a major problem ... We are a state agency, we can’t pay the kind of wages they pay in the private sector.

11315,"FRANKFURT   - The European Central Bank slashed its growth and inflation forecasts for 2019 and lowered those for 2020 and 2021 on Thursday, acknowledging that Europe’s slowdown was longer and deeper than earlier thought. ECB President Mario Draghi said that, unusually, the central bank had not changed its assessment that risks were balanced to the downside despite the policy changes.  He said that was because, although Thursday’s decisions would increase the resilience of the euro zone economy, it could not affect external factors such as rising protectionism and the still-uncertain course of Brexit.   However, the bank’s governing council rated the probability of a euro zone recession as “very low”, he told a news conference.  With a global trade war weighing on confidence, industrial production and exports have slipped, exacerbated by a string of domestic difficulties, from German industry’s struggle to adapt to new auto emissions regulations to protests in France.  Germany, the bloc’s biggest economy, stagnated in the fourth quarter and Italy is in outright recession, raising the risk that a temporary slowdown will become a more lasting downturn as business confidence is sapped by a steady flow of negative news.

11322,"BERLIN   - German fashion house Hugo Boss said it expected its operating profit to rise faster than sales in 2019, predicting strong momentum in its online business and Asia.   Known for its smart men’s suits, Hugo Boss has introduced more casual and sportswear styles to appeal to a younger audience and invested heavily in its online offer after a bid to go upmarket backfired a few years ago. The company said it expected a high single-digit percentage increase in operating profit for 2019 and a mid single-digit percentage rise in currency-adjusted sales. “We are ensuring profitable growth in 2019 and beyond. Strong momentum in our own online business and in Asia will make a significant contribution this year,” Chief Executive Mark Langer said in a statement. Investors are worried about slowing demand for luxury goods as the economy stalls in China, but Hugo Boss forecast “overproportionate growth” in the Asia-Pacific region. The company said it expected strong double-digit growth to continue in its online business, after it reached sales of more than 100 million euros in 2018 for the first time.

11367,"  - Dollar Tree Inc announced plans to close hundreds more Family Dollar stores on Wednesday as it wrote off $2.7 billion, or nearly a third of the value of the struggling discount chain it bought for $9 billion four years ago. Shares of the company rose 2 percent as it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter same-store sales, along with the results of its full strategic assessment of the Family Dollar business. Hedge fund investor Starboard Value LP in January urged Dollar Tree to explore all alternatives for its Family Dollar business, including a sale, after years of weakness that has hurt the company’s overall profitability.  Though Family Dollar has remodeled some stores and expanded its product range, same-store sales growth has been nearly flat on average in the past two years, pushing down the parent company’s shares 7 percent in the last 12 months.  Same-store sales rose 1.4 percent at the smaller chain in the fourth quarter, the strongest in a year and pushing overall numbers up 2.4 percent, above an average analyst estimate of 1.5 percent rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company said it would shut 390 Family Dollar stores, besides planned remodeling of 1,000 stores this year to add $1-only items. Dollar Tree had already closed 122 Family Dollar stores in the fiscal year ending Feb. 2. The Chesapeake, Virginia-based company, which took a $2.73 billion one-time charge for the decline in the chain’s value in the fourth quarter, also said it would explore pricing some goods above the $1-mark, as Starboard has demanded. “We are confident we are taking the appropriate steps to reposition our Family Dollar brand for increasing profitability as business initiatives gain traction in the back half of fiscal 2019,” Chief Executive Officer Gary Philbin said in Wednesday’s statement. The restructuring will weigh on operating income in the first half of 2019 fiscal year, it said, but lead to material improvement in the second half. The company forecast first quarter earnings of $1.05-$1.15 per share, below analysts’ expectation of $1.29 per share. It said its forecast takes into account a possible rise in U.S. tariff on Chinese products to 25 percent in 2019.

11382,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI   - Tesla’s upcoming vehicle assembly facility in Shanghai is expected to be completed in May this year, a Shanghai city government official said on Wednesday.  Chen Mingbo made the comments on the sidelines of an annual parliamentary meeting in Beijing, adding that part of the facility’s production line would be put into operation by the end of the year.  Chen, who heads the city’s economic and information technology commission, did not provide any further details.  The U.S. electric carmaker broke ground on the Shanghai factory in January and its CEO Elon Musk has said the firm aims to finish initial construction this summer and start production of the Model 3 toward the end of the year.  A full-fledged auto assembly factory can take about two years to build but the Shanghai government has thrown its support behind the Tesla project, which would be China’s first wholly foreign-owned car plant and a reflection of the government’s broader shift to open up its car market.  Tesla has been pushing forward its plans for the 500,000-vehicle-capacity plant after it secured a site in October, hiring staff, starting procurement for building materials and setting up a local financial leasing company. Producing cars locally is also likely to help Tesla minimize the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war, which has forced the car maker to lower prices of its U.S.-made cars in China - which has becoming increasingly important as the company seeks to offset softening demand in the United States.  On Tuesday, Tesla’s shares fell more than 5 percent in early trade after Chinese media reported Shanghai customs had suspended clearance for a batch of Tesla’s cars.  The company said that authorities have accepted its plan to resolve the clearance problem. Chinese customs confirmed in a statement on its official WeChat account on Wednesday that it had stopped the Tesla Model 3 imports and was now monitoring the firm’ rectifications.  It said the Model 3 cars were stopped because they did not have Chinese language-warning signs and had missing or incorrect nameplate labels. It added, however, that the nameplates could be replaced at the port.

11439,"GENEVA   - Two of Europe’s best-selling cars, the Renault Clio and Peugeot 208, go head-to-head at the Geneva motor show on Tuesday, as the auto market they dominate faces transformative pressures on its future profits and jobs. As industry executives gather to discuss trade-tariff threats, new emissions rules and fines, or waning ambitions for autonomous driving, the two staple subcompacts will be wheeled out in apparent defiance of the profound changes underway. In other ways, though, they show an industry fast adapting. Both models are poised to abandon what remains of their French production, completing a once controversial shift to lower-cost plants in Turkey, eastern Europe and Morocco. Both will also introduce electric and hybrid drivetrain options - which themselves pose a further challenge to supplier jobs reut.rs/2wrsoPT. “There’s an ongoing need for compact, efficient urban models,” said Jean-Philippe Imparato, head of the Peugeot brand. “The market is robust.” Small certainties are welcome in an industry facing hard-to-quantify strains including Britain’s planned exit from the European Union, a U.S.-led assault on trade liberalization and the many billions spent developing a new generation of electric vehicles for which mass demand remains largely unproven. Major auto markets are now in decline or stagnating, and hopes for a lucrative self-driving car boom have also receded as costs and technical hurdles stay stubbornly high. While higher-riding SUVs are on a relative upswing, compact hatchbacks such as the Clio and 208 are still Europe’s biggest vehicle category by volume, accounting for 3.5 million annual sales for an 18 percent market share. “There’s plenty of room for both” cars and SUVs in Europe’s small-car market, said Denis Schemoul, an auto production analyst with forecaster IHS Markit. “The small hatch remains an excellent compromise in terms of size and versatility.” Both the 208 and the Clio, which has notched up 15 million vehicle sales since its 1990 debut, deliberately shun modish bulk in their latest incarnations, for a lower, more aerodynamic stance that can only help fuel-economy. Carmakers risk hundreds of millions of euros in fines for missing the EU’s 2020-21 emissions goal averaging 95 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilometer. The bloc’s parliament and member states have agreed on a further 37.5 percent cut by 2030.    According to new industry data published on the eve of the show, European new-car CO2 emissions actually rose in 2018 for a second consecutive year, as sales of relatively efficient diesels continued to collapse. “Instead of moving forwards, the industry is regressing at a time when emissions targets are getting tougher,” said analyst Felipe Munoz of consulting firm JATO, which compiled the data. PSA Group’s Peugeot and Citroen line-ups came in below 108 grammes of average CO2 emissions last year – just behind hybrid leader Toyota’s 99.9 grammes – while the Opel division acquired from General Motors in 2017 topped 125 grammes. Fourth-placed Renault averaged 109.1 grammes. Strong sales of the new 208 will not be enough to avoid the early retirement of some Opel models before the new rules take effect, a PSA source told Reuters. “Expect some announcements later this year.” With its lower, wider, longer 208, Peugeot has adopted the lighting signature and other design cues from its 3008 and 5008 SUV siblings, whose runaway success has lifted pricing power and driven PSA Group to record profits. Assembly of the 208 will end at the group’s Poissy plant west of Paris, which had handled overflow production of the current model built mainly in Trnava, Slovakia. The new vehicle will also be produced in Kenitra, Morocco, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. Renault’s Flins plant is similarly unlikely to keep the Clio as the model upgrades, industry sources said. The factory now has a growing output of Zoe electric cars and alliance partner Nissan’s Micra to keep its lines humming and unions happy. A new affordable Renault hybrid drivetrain will launch in the Clio next year, as Peugeot debuts its pure-electric 208 – both part of the industry’s scramble to electrify, cut emissions and avoid fines. But the abrupt shift from combustion engines to batteries, which can account for 40 percent of the final price of a car, has sparked fears and warnings about the fallout for jobs in Europe, which lacks battery makers to compete with Chinese, South Korean and Japanese groups. To avoid “ruinous” fines, PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview with Le Figaro on Monday that carmakers were forced to “reserve battery volumes with Asian suppliers who only are happy to see us coming” and extract high prices. “The European Parliament’s decision is quite simply forcing the auto sector to export 40 percent of its vehicles’ value to Asia,” he said.

11441,"HARRISBURG, Pa.   - Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices on Wednesday grilled a lawyer who defended the way state congressional districts are apportioned, a design opponents have challenged as illegally skewed to benefit Republicans who hold 13 of its 18 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The majority of the court, which has five Democrats and two Republicans, appeared sympathetic to the argument that Pennsylvania’s congressional districts are illegally gerrymandered. A civic group and some Democratic voters brought the challenge, one of several such lawsuits nationwide.  If the court ordered lawmakers to draw a new map, it could help Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. The party needs to flip two dozen seats nationwide to win control of the House, and Pennsylvania is a key battleground.  Jason Torchinsky, a lawyer representing Republican legislative leaders, endured tough questions from the justices over his contention that lawmakers can legally draw the map to protect partisan interests. Justice Max Baer, a Democrat, questioned Torchinsky’s claim that district maps can connect disparate neighborhoods using “land bridges,” sometimes no wider than a single property. “So if you took the Democratic areas of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and connected them via the Pennsylvania Turnpike, that’s okay?” he asked. Torchinsky replied yes. During the 2-1/2-hour hearing, several justices expressed uncertainty about whether the map could be redrawn in time for fall elections, with some candidates already on the campaign trail. “We could agree with your argument and still deny a remedy that puts the state into a tailspin,” said Justice Debra Todd, a Democrat. The League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania filed the lawsuit challenging a 2011 redistricting by the Republican-led  Pennsylvania legislature. The suit claims the legislature violated the state constitution by contorting the map to favor Republicans with some of the most gerrymandered districts in the country. “We’re not doing it to equalize population or make the districts more compact or contiguous,” David Gersch, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said of Republican legislators. “We’re doing it because we don’t like the way you vote.” Similar challenges nationwide include a case involving Wisconsin currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has previously suggested extreme partisan gerrymandering may be unconstitutional.  Still, the U.S. high court has never articulated a specific standard, a point some of the Pennsylvania justices noted. “You are asking us to go further than any court has gone before,” Todd said. A lawyer for Democratic Governor Tom Wolf told the court the governor supports a new map for 2018 and that primary elections in May could be postponed if needed.

11484,"  - The Trump administration is working on a new payment approach for treating kidney disease that favors lower cost care at home and transplants, a change that would upend a dialysis industry that provides care in thousands of clinics nationwide. The goal is to reduce the $114 billion paid by the U.S. government each year to treat chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, a top area of spending. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which provides Medicare health benefits to more than 55 million Americans, is looking at a trial payment design that would improve care in the early stages of kidney disease, increase access to kidney transplants and favor home dialysis over clinic-based treatment, CMS head Seema Verma told Reuters in an interview.  “A lot of the way the program has been set up, it creates a lot of perverse incentives to actually keep people in an institutional setting,” said Verma, who first signaled in a speech this year that CMS wanted to curb costs and improve quality of life for kidney disease patients through a new payment structure. Indeed, consultants say home dialysis has been slow to take off because doctors prefer to send patients to clinics. The changes pose a particular risk to DaVita Inc and Fresenius Medical Care AG, which operate more than 5,000 U.S. dialysis clinics and control around 70 percent of the market.  Shares of DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care both fell, with DaVita off 3 percent at $55.36. Fresenius Medical Care closed down 2.2 percent in Frankfurt. They could also provide an opening for new rivals, including CVS Health Corp, which seeks to offer lower-cost home dialysis, and startups Cricket Health and Somatus, which focus on early intervention to slow progression to kidney failure. “We have to be open to what I’m hearing coming out of (CMS), that they want to look at different ways for us being paid and how can we really try to create more opportunities for these patients to be better served,” Fresenius Medical Care Chief Executive Rice Powell told analysts. The company is expanding in home dialysis with its $2 billion purchase of NxStage, a U.S. maker of home-use dialysis machines. Fresenius Medical Care said it plans to convert some  dialysis clinics into “transitional care units” to train people for care at home. It aims to boost the percentage of its U.S. customers using home dialysis to more than 15 percent by 2022 from around 12 percent currently. DaVita recently launched new technology, including remote monitoring and telehealth, to improve the patient experience at home and “champions” home dialysis, a company spokeswoman said. Nearly 15 percent of the U.S. adult population was suffering from chronic kidney disease in 2018, fueled by growing rates of diabetes and hypertension, according to the government’s U.S. Renal Data System. In 2016, more than 720,000 people were estimated to have progressed to kidney failure. That is forecast to climb as high as 1.26 million people by 2030. Without a transplant, patients with end-stage kidney disease require dialysis to clear their blood of waste and excess fluid, which involves spending three-to-five hours hooked up to a machine three times a week.     Home dialysis would not only be cheaper, since it would not require nursing assistance once a patient is properly trained, but could be done at night, freeing people for a regular work schedule. DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care offer two forms of home dialysis: hemodialysis, which requires a machine and special filter much like in clinics, and peritoneal dialysis, which utilizes the lining of the abdomen to filter waste from the blood. CMS is considering the benefits of peritoneal dialysis, which is used more widely outside the United States. Peritoneal dialysis machines are around the size of a desktop printer, smaller than home hemodialysis machines. DaVita believes home dialysis could eventually account for up to 25 percent of treatments if physicians are educated on its merits, and it plans to build fewer new clinics. Meanwhile, U.S. pharmacy chain CVS is preparing to enter the dialysis business and has more retail outlets than Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita clinics combined, as well as deep enough pockets to drive disruption.    CVS said last April its kidney care plans involve a program to identify the disease early and delay the need for dialysis. It will also seek regulatory approval for its own home dialysis device.    CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo, in an interview, said it wants a home care solution “which is going to be more patient friendly and we believe lower cost than the therapies that exist today.”  Medicare pays for home dialysis, but adoption has been slow. Only around 8 percent of end-stage renal disease patients were on home dialysis in 2016.     The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees CMS, is also seeking to increase the number of kidney transplants through proposals it hopes will expedite access to organs. More than 20,000 people received kidney transplants in the United States in 2018, a fraction of the more than 100,000 people on the waiting list.  HHS Secretary Alex Azar plans to speak to kidney patients on Monday afternoon in Washington D.C. CMS has also finalized new rules that beginning next year  will offer financial incentives for new drugs to treat kidney failure. Proponents of home care say more frequent dialysis can improve patient outcomes by avoiding the so-called “killer gap” – a two-day wait between clinic sessions associated with increased hospitalization and death. Hospitalization accounts for about 40 percent of Medicare spending on dialysis patients. “Imagine if we could keep patients out of the hospital by dealing with this killer gap ... giving them the tools to treat themselves,” said John Milad, CEO of Britain-based Quanta Dialysis Technologies, which is working on a simpler dialysis machine for home use. “The savings that are available there are as big as everything that is being spent on dialysis.” CVS is working on its home hemodialysis device with DEKA Research & Development Corp, a New Hampshire-based company owned by Segway scooter inventor Dean Kamen, according to sources familiar with the arrangement. Startups including Quanta, France’s Physidia and California-based Outset Medical, are working on user-friendly dialysis machines for home use. U.S.-based Cricket Health and Somatus use data analysis to detect high-risk chronic kidney disease patients earlier, educate them on treatment options and provide home dialysis services.    Cricket CEO Arvind Rajan said the government could save money via a flat fee to manage patients earlier in the disease and reward providers who keep costs down.    “The most profitable thing you can do is keep a patient from kidney failure and the least profitable thing you can do is have the patient on in-center dialysis,” he said.

11488,"LONDON   - Top Barclays executives worried that investors in the bank’s 2008 emergency fundraising would go “nuts” if Qatar was given a better deal unfairly, a London court heard on Monday.  Richard Boath, one of four former Barclays bosses on trial over fraud charges, told the bank’s former Middle East head Roger Jenkins that they had to be careful to ensure the legality of a plan to pay Qatar extra fees it was demanding in the form of a separate advisory agreement. “We can’t do a capital markets transaction in which we give one set of fees to one set of investors, and a different set of economics for another set of investors because if they found out they’d go nuts,” Boath said he told Jenkins in a recording of a 2014 interview with Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) played to the jury. An unfairly preferential deal could also have risked trouble for the executives who planned it, Boath said he told Jenkins. “He said well fuck that I am not taking a hit to save John and Bob’s jobs,” Boath reported Jenkins as replying, referring to Barclays’ former chief executive John Varley and former investment banking chief Bob Diamond. The SFO contends that Boath, Jenkins, Varley and former head of wealth management Tom Kalaris misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds ($424 million) to Qatar through so-called “advisory service agreements” (ASAs) at the height of the credit crisis. All four men, the most senior to face a criminal trial over crisis-era conduct, deny wrongdoing. Qatar has not been accused of any misconduct. Diamond is not involved in the trial. The agreements were entirely legal and authorized by the bank’s internal and external lawyers, board and compliance department, Kalaris said last week in a prepared statement read out to the jury by prosecutors. Boath likewise on Monday said in recorded statements played to jurors that, after raising concerns about the ASAs, he became comfortable that they were legal and approved by the relevant authorities within the bank. The prosecution alleges that concerns about the deal expressed by the defendants show they thought or knew what they were doing was wrong. Whereas the bankers say it just shows they were being careful to remain within the rules.  China Development bank and Singapore’s Temasek were among the other investors in the eventual deals in 2008 that meant Barclays avoided a state bailout, unlike rivals Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. The trial continues this week.

11523,"LONDON   - The usual mix of sports cars, offroaders and family saloons will be on display at the Geneva motor show this week, but with one big difference from previous years - they may be about to become harder and costlier to make, and more expensive to buy.  If Britain leaves the European Union on March 29 without a withdrawal deal, all bets are off on what will happen to the just-in-time production system on which the European auto industry relies, or to demand for vehicles across the continent. And the situation has just got more complicated. Last week, British Prime Minister Theresa May raised the prospect of a short delay to Brexit, potentially disrupting the plans that carmakers have put in place to cope with a no-deal divorce.  “I’m sure I speak for most of the country when I say, we just want to get it done. We just want to know where we are and get on with it,” Andy Palmer, the chief executive of British sports car maker Aston Martin, told Reuters.  His company has said it will spend up to 30 million pounds  ($40 million) on preparing for a potentially disorderly Brexit, including stocking more components and potentially flying in parts if ports are clogged up. The stakes are high. Britain is Europe’s second-biggest buyer of cars and fourth biggest manufacturer, meaning disruption to supplies - and possible tariffs of up to 10 percent on vehicles moving between Britain and the European Union - will have repercussions across the industry.  With less than a month to go, May is trying to renegotiate a withdrawal deal with the EU that British lawmakers have so far refused to approve.  The timing could hardly be worse for a car industry already struggling with a slowdown in China, the world’s biggest autos market, a plunge in demand for diesel vehicles and costly investments in electric as well as self-driving cars. Britain’s once booming car industry is already recording drops in sales, investment and output, with Japan’s Honda delivering the biggest blow so far by announcing plans to close its British factory. But carmakers cannot suddenly stop plans which have been years in the making.  British supercar maker McLaren will display its Speedtail in Geneva, while fellow British luxury brand Bentley will show off the Bentayga Speed and Aston Martin its Lagonda all-terrain concept vehicle.   Meanwhile, Japan’s Toyota has just begun churning out its new Corolla car at its English factory.  But others are staying away from Europe’s top car show. These include Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which is belt-tightening, and U.S. manufacturer Ford, which is making cuts to its European operations.   JLR has said it faces a more than 1.2 billion pound hit to its profits if there is a “bad Brexit deal”, which would involve tariffs on cars of up to 10 percent and between roughly 2 and 4 percent on components and engines.  Ford, which does not make cars in Britain but builds nearly 1.3 million engines there, has said a no-deal Brexit could cost up to $1 billion.  It fears delays and tariffs before the engines can be fitted into vehicles in Germany, Turkey, the United States and elsewhere. Ford also has the most exposed overseas plant, with nearly one in three cars rolling off the production line in its Cologne plant in Germany destined for Britain, the company’s third-largest market, according to researchers LMC Automotive.  Seven of the top 10 factories that export the highest volumes to Britain are in Germany, which itself is teetering on the edge of recession.  Ford said last month it would take “whatever action is necessary to preserve the competitiveness of our European business.” But moving production can takes years, meaning firms would have to manage a no-deal Brexit, at least in the short term. Honda’s plant closure announced last month will not take place until 2021.  A delay to Brexit could also ruin some contingency plans.  JLR, Honda and BMW’s Mini and Rolls-Royce brands - together accounting for around 55 percent of UK car output - all plan to shut down in April from between a week to up to a month in case of any disruption from a no-deal Brexit.  Shutdowns are generally organized months in advance so employee holidays can be scheduled and suppliers can adjust volumes, making them hard to move.  The uncertainty leaves automakers grappling to address a huge range of potential problems, from recertifying models to investing in more pallets to transport German-made engines.   “We can listen to the rhetoric of British politicians saying ‘we’ll make the Dover port flow, we’ll let the stuff in’ but what they fail to realise is that for every time you bring in an engine, you’ve got to send a pallet back to Germany,” said Aston Martin’s Palmer. “If the French aren’t opening up their border, very soon you run out of pallets.”  (The refiled story adds dropped word in paragraph 16.)

11549,"MEXICO CITY   - Mexico’s government on Friday threatened to slap duties on new U.S. products in retaliation for the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs as it seeks to turn up pressure on Washington to exempt it from the measures. U.S. President Donald Trump set tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum last June, prompting Mexico and other trade partners to hit back. Mexico has consistently argued that the tariffs only damage commerce within North America and should be withdrawn. Mexican Deputy Economy Minister Luz Maria de la Mora told Reuters in an interview that if the U.S. government did not repeal the tariffs, her government would have a revamped list in its “carousel” of U.S. targets ready in about two months. “We’re carrying out an evaluation and there are products from the agricultural sector - we’re probably going to bring in some new ones and take some others out - as well as in the industrial sector and the steel industry,” de la Mora said. The value of the goods targeted under the list would remain equivalent to the impact of the Trump tariffs, de la Mora said, estimating the damage they caused at $2.7 billion. Mexico’s previous government retaliated almost immediately against the metal tariffs, slapping measures on agricultural goods including pork legs, apples and cheese as well as various steel products. Even if the value of the goods targeted by Mexico remained the same, swapping in new products could encourage more U.S. businesses to lobby Washington against the tariffs. The new Mexican government of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December, and de la Mora said the country would continue to reject Trump’s measures. “We should not fall into this protectionist trap,” said de la Mora, who brought years of experience working in international trade for the Mexican government to the post. Noting that Trump had tried to use the metal tariffs as leverage during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), de la Mora said now that since a new deal had been agreed last year, the argument was no longer valid. “Mexico is not a national security threat for the United States,” she said. “This is really important; it really needs to be understood that Mexico is a partner, Mexico is an ally.” Known as the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA), the new North American trade deal is still awaiting ratification by lawmakers in the three countries. De la Mora said Mexico’s Congress would likely first pass a new labor bill designed to strengthen the rights of unionized workers, fulfilling a commitment made with the USMCA deal. She expressed hope that law would be approved before the current session of Congress concludes on April 30. Lawmakers would likely move on to USMCA ratification during the following session due to begin in September, she added. Uncertainty over Mexico’s access to the U.S. market has been a worry for business, while Lopez Obrador’s decision-making and attacks on the “neo-liberal” policies he said his predecessors pursued have also left some investors unimpressed. Still, de la Mora said that after her meetings with investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, she believed levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) “very similar” to the past few years could be maintained in Mexico. “All the companies indicated to me they have faith in Mexico,” she said. Mexico’s full-year 2018 FDI totaled $31.6 billion, preliminary official data showed this week.

11605,"SINGAPORE   - Dianrong, one of China’s biggest peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders, is shutting down 60 of its 90 offline stores and laying off an estimated 2,000 employees, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday. The shrinking of Shanghai-based Dianrong comes amid Beijing’s multi-year crackdown on risky practices and excessive leverage in the financial system that has seen a wave of P2P company collapses and triggered protests by angry investors who lost their savings. The company was co-founded by Soul Htite, who was also behind U.S. online lender LendingClub Corp. It is backed by Singapore sovereign fund GIC Pte Ltd and Standard Chartered Private Equity. When asked for a response to the store closures and layoffs, Dianrong said it would comment later. P2P platforms gather funds from retail investors and loan the money to small corporate and individual borrowers, promising high returns. At its peak in 2015, the sector had about 3,500 businesses in China. The P2P industry had outstanding loans of 1.49 trillion yuan ($217.96 billion) last year, far larger than the combined sector outside China. Dianrong’s investors also included CMIG Leasing, a unit of China’s biggest private investment conglomerate, China Minsheng Investment Group (CMIG), Tiger Global Management, Japan’s Orix Corp and CLSA, part of China’s CITIC Securities.

11630,"  - Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft plan to offer cash bonuses to some of their most active drivers with the option to purchase shares in the ride-hailing firms’ highly anticipated Wall Street debuts, a bold effort to improve driver relations as the companies transition to the public markets. Both programs will offer drivers who have driven the longest and logged the most miles for the companies the rare chance to purchase stock at the initial public offering, before shares begin trading on public stock exchanges, according to four  sources with knowledge of the matter. Such transactions are normally unavailable to retail investors. The move is the latest bid by Uber and Lyft to improve relations with drivers who have long contested their classification as independent contractors and what they have claimed are low wages and poor treatment by the companies. Both companies still face thousands of driver arbitration claims over their employment status. Lyft plans to give drivers who have logged at least 10,000 rides on the platform $1,000 that can be kept as a cash bonus or used to buy the IPO shares, one of the sources said on Thursday. The plan is an effort to reward the longest-serving and most active drivers, who do not enjoy employee benefits such as health insurance and reimbursement for expenses. A driver who has completed 20,000 rides would be eligible for $10,000 in cash or an equivalent amount of stock, the person said. It was not clear how many drivers would qualify, but there is no cap on the program. Many drivers in urban areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles drive for both Uber and Lyft, and some could stand to benefit from both stock programs. The Wall Street Journal first reported Uber and Lyft’s driver stock plans earlier on Thursday. Lyft plans to launch its “roadshow,” when the company will pitch prospective investors to buy stock in the offering, the week of March 18, Reuters reported last week. The roadshow is expected to last about two weeks, likely making Lyft the first Wall Street debut from a group of highly valued, venture-backed companies all expected to go public this year. Both Uber and Lyft confidentially filed for an IPO in December. Lyft is expected to publicly release its regulatory paperwork this week, and it likely will contain details on the driver stock reward program. Uber, Lyft’s much larger rival, still needs several more weeks to prepare for its IPO. The company is working out the details on a broad program for drivers that would give a significant portion of its 3 million active drivers and couriers globally a cash bonus, which they can use to purchase shares at the IPO price, according to three of the people with knowledge of the matter.  The stock program will be much more complicated than Lyft’s since it involves many more drivers and countries with different securities laws, and it will run into the millions of dollars, one of these people said. For drivers in overseas markets where securities laws will prohibit them from purchasing shares, keeping the cash will be their only option, another of the sources said.  The cash bonuses will be doled out on a sliding scale based on the driver’s length of service and number of trips or deliveries, this person said. The target numbers and the cutoff date to meet those targets are still being worked out and will be set prior to the IPO. Stock prices often pop after trading begins, making for a lucrative payday for shareholders who are able to buy at the IPO price. However, many drivers are likely to keep the cash, said Harry Campbell, creator of the Rideshare Guy blog and podcast, which offers advice to drivers.  “Most drivers are on a pretty tight budget so I think it will be tempting for them to take the cash bonus,” he said. Uber last year sent a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asking for a rule change so the company could award shares to drivers while it was still privately held. Such programs had been problematic in the past. New York-based ride-hailing startup Juno promised equity to drivers, which drew SEC scrutiny. Juno ended up voiding the equity program after it was acquired, prompting a lawsuit from drivers. Lyft expects to be valued at between $20 billion and $25 billion in its IPO, up from its current $15 billion valuation. Uber is seeking a valuation that could reach $120 billion, up from its $76 billion valuation in the private market.

11660,"ZURICH   - Novartis’s shift into high-tech drugs won praise for providing patients with new options but criticism over prices that may run into the millions of dollars at the Swiss drugmaker’s annual general meeting on Thursday.  Shareholders at the event in Basel also approved Novartis’s planned spin-off of its Alcon eyecare unit, due for coming months, with investors with five Novartis shares due to receive one share of Alcon stock. Swiss shareholder group Actares said insurance systems are being “taken hostage” by high prices for life-saving drugs. It called out Novartis’s $475,000 cancer cell therapy Kymriah and its still-unapproved gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy that Novartis contends is cost-effective at $4-$5 million per patient, while independent groups have concluded its value is less than that. Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, who did not testify this week before the U.S. Senate with other global drug industry executives also facing criticism for drug prices, said he seeks to price medicines based on their value, adding Novartis needs a fair return to further research and development. “With respect to pricing in cell and gene therapies, I think what’s often lost in the discussion is the remarkable impact of these medicines,” Narasimhan said. “These are true breakthroughs that come from a single infusion of a medicine that don’t require lifelong therapy.” Actares President Veronika Hendry said high drug prices present society with difficult questions over access.  “With this business model you are taking hostage an insurance system that depends on solidarity,” Hendry said. “There’s currently a broad discussion going on over exorbitant drug prices, and this discussion is creating resentment and disbelief.” ",Novartis faces shareholder criticism over drug prices at AGM,"February 28, 2019 /  10:41 AM ",zurich novartis s shift into high tech drugs won praise for providing patients with new options but criticism over prices that may run into the millions of dollars at the swiss drugmaker s annual general meeting on thursday shareholders at the event in basel also approved novartis s planned spin off of its alcon eyecare unit due for coming months with investors with five novartis shares due to receive one share of alcon stock swiss shareholder group actares said insurance systems are being taken hostage by high prices for life saving drugs it called out novartis s   cancer cell therapy kymriah and its still unapproved gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy that novartis contends is cost effective at   million per patient while independent groups have concluded its value is less than that chief executive vas narasimhan who did not testify this week before the u s senate with other global drug industry executives also facing criticism for drug prices said he seeks to price medicines based on their value adding novartis needs a fair return to further research and development with respect to pricing in cell and gene therapies i think what s often lost in the discussion is the remarkable impact of these medicines narasimhan said these are true breakthroughs that come from a single infusion of a medicine that don t require lifelong therapy actares president veronika hendry said high drug prices present society with difficult questions over access with this business model you are taking hostage an insurance system that depends on solidarity hendry said there s currently a broad discussion going on over exorbitant drug prices and this discussion is creating resentment and disbelief ,Boeing Crisis,0.13824188709259033

11675,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ended the first legal challenge to a Republican-backed Mississippi law that permits businesses and government employees to refuse to serve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people because of their religious beliefs. The justices left in place a June ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the plaintiffs - same-sex couples, civil rights advocates including the head of the state NAACP chapter, a church and others - did not have legal standing to bring the lawsuit.  The law, passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature and signed by Republican Governor Phillip Bryant with the backing of conservative Christian activists, has not yet been implemented and more legal challenges are expected, according to gay rights lawyers. “We will keep fighting in Mississippi until we overturn this harmful law, and in any state where antigay legislators pass laws to roll back LGBT civil rights,” said Beth Littrell, a lawyer with gay rights group Lambda Legal. People who are refused service once the law is in place may be more likely to be judged to have legal standing to sue. The 2016 law was passed in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.  Supporters call it a religious liberty law that protects the sincerely held religious beliefs and moral convictions of individuals and businesses. Opponents said it authorizes discrimination against LGBT people in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s guarantees of equal protection under the law and the separation of church and state. Conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom is helping the state defend the law. “Good laws like Mississippi’s protect freedom and harm no one,” said Kevin Theriot, one of the group’s lawyers. Mississippi’s law was one of a series of measures proposed in socially conservative, Republican-dominated states that gay rights advocates viewed as an attempt to undermine the high court’s gay marriage ruling. The law, called the Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act, protects the beliefs that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, sex outside such a marriage is improper and gender is determined by anatomy and genetics at birth and cannot change. Among other things, the measure lets businesses refuse to provide marriage-related services to same-sex couples and allows judges, magistrates and justices of the peace to refuse to perform same-sex weddings. The measure was blocked in 2016 by a Mississippi-based federal judge who said it unconstitutionally allowed “arbitrary discrimination” against LGBT people and unmarried people.

11695,"NEW YORK   - JPMorgan Chase & Co on Wednesday named half a dozen people to a commercial banking team in Europe and new international and Asia-Pacific regional leaders, as the U.S. bank closes in on business clients it hopes to poach from rivals abroad. For two years, JPMorgan’s commercial banking business has been building a list of around 1,500 middle-market European companies that it wants to attract through its global approach to investment banking, credit, hedging and treasury services. The targets are companies with between $500 million to $2 billion in annual revenue and international ambitions, including known  brands that already use JPMorgan for their U.S. business and companies whose owners are JPMorgan private wealth clients. “We see a lot of opportunity for local corporations in these markets to grow, and they can benefit from working with a global banking partner,” Rob Holmes, head of the bank’s corporate client banking & specialized industries (CCBSI) group, said in a statement.  Andrew Kresse was named head of CCBSI international banking. Kresse comes from JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank and he will build local teams to expand commercial banking activity in European and Asia-Pacific markets, where the investment bank already has a foothold.  Bertrand Cousin was named head of CCBSI Europe and will be based out of Paris, managing bankers in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, France and the UK.  His team includes Claude Craciun in Paris, who joined from Societe Generale SA, Bernhard Brinker in Frankfurt, who joined from UniCredit Bank AG, Marco Mariano in Milan, who joined from HSBC, and Hein Broerse in Amsterdam, previously of Citigroup Inc.  Ignacio Álvarez-Cedrón, previously head of global markets for Iberia for JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank, will be based in Madrid.

11696,"NEW YORK   - Oil futures gained about 2 percent on Wednesday after U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly plummeted and as Saudi Arabia brushed aside comments from U.S. President Donald Trump seeking to keep oil prices from climbing. U.S. crude stockpiles  fell 8.6 million barrels last week, in contrast to expectations for an increase of 2.8 million barrels, government data showed.  The drawdown, which breaks five consecutive weeks of  builds, was due to net crude imports slowing to a record low of 2.6 million barrels per day in the wake of declining OPEC production and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela.  U.S. crude futures settled at $56.94 a barrel, up $1.44, or 2.6 percent, the biggest daily percentage rise in nearly four weeks. Brent crude futures rose $1.18, or 1.8 percent, to end at $66.39 a barrel.      “Overall it’s a very positive report with stronger demand, and I do think you’re already seeing the impact from OPEC cuts,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners were already “taking it easy” in response to a tweet from Trump on Monday, who told the group to “relax” on production cuts.  “The 25 countries are taking a very slow and measured approach” Falih said in Riyadh when asked to comment on Trump’s tweet, CNBC reported. “Just as the second half of last year proved, we are interested in market stability first and foremost.”  Oil prices have risen more than 20 percent so far this year after OPEC and non-member producer allies agreed to cut output for six months starting in January to avoid the build-up of a global surplus particularly as U.S. crude production booms. Falih said the group may need to extend its agreement to curb output until the end of 2019. U.S. crude output has set record highs for two straight weeks, hitting 12.1 million bpd last week, according to government data. Also in Riyadh, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo commented that managing world supply is difficult when two members - Iran and Venezuela - are under sanction from the United States. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak also said this week the oil market was more or less stable and price volatility, which is unwelcome to both producers and consumers, was low.

11697,"NEW YORK   - WeWork is expanding an effort to retain mid-sized businesses which had been leaving the shared office space manager after they grew past the small-company phase, and to catch up with rivals already catering to these clients. HQ by WeWork, launched in San Francisco and New York in August to provide enhanced services for businesses with 11 to 250 employees, is targeting 11 overseas markets including London and Shanghai and other U.S. hot spots such as Boston and Denver, said executives at WeWork, a unit of The We Company. The $42 billion New York-based “unicorn” in 2010 helped pioneer “coworking,” or shared desk-space, with a focus on  startups, entrepreneurs and freelancers. WeWork has been losing clients as they grew to more than a dozen or so employees and found that sharing office space no longer suited their needs. “Those companies were within the platform, but we weren’t going out of our way to serve them,” David Fano, chief growth officer at WeWork, said in an interview. “Some of the companies were saying, ‘Look, we really just want our own space.’” The new service aims to help fill that gap between WeWork’s signature coworking platform and its offering for large companies with more than 1,000 employees.  “That’s our ultimate dream, that companies stay with us for life. From being a single-person start-up to the day that they’re Airbnb,” WeWork’s Fano said. HQ by WeWork marks a departure from its coworking model of shared space as companies seek to build their own identity and environment, a service that Knotel, but few others operating flexible office space, has seized on exclusively. Flexible office space gained its name from shorter-term leases than landlords typically offer, and their operators build out spaces that have services and are more fashionable. Minimum leases for HQ by WeWork are two years and companies gain Wi-Fi, IT and audiovisual systems, along with access to WeWork’s global network of shared space and conference rooms. Knotel recently said it has completed more than 2 million square feet of deals in Manhattan, or double that of HQ by WeWork. Industrious, a rival flex-space startup, in January said teams of 20 or more people make up its fastest-growing segment. The initiative marks a shift where WeWork is no longer seen as taking incremental space from landlords with its coworking model but is competing with them for traditional clients even as they still lease the property owner’s space. About 13 percent of HQ by WeWork members are previous clients. WeWork was unable to say how many potential HQ clients had left its operations. But WeWork expects the HQ segment to account for some 70,000 of a projected overall membership base of 800,000 by year’s end, or double WeWork’s 400,000 members in January. A member is any individual working in a WeWork location. WeWork last year became the largest private leasor of office space in Manhattan and operates almost 100 sites in New York City. WeWork told bond investors in November it was on track to post revenue of $2.3 billion in 2018. “The marketplace is being disrupted, the most telling sign for that is landlords are starting to bring their own product into the market,” said Dom Harding, head of Workthere Americas, a new unit of brokerage Savills Plc that provides consulting for companies seeking flexible office space. Many mainstream real estate companies, such as developer Tishman Speyer, brokerage CBRE Group Inc and Washington Real Estate Investment Trust, have spawned their own flexible office units to tap the demand for shorter-term leases. HQ by WeWork has grown to 30 locations with almost 1 million square feet under lease in its two launch cities. The unit expects to have 270 locations open worldwide by the end of 2019 as it also targets office markets in Berlin, Toronto, Amsterdam, Jakarta, Sao Paulo, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. “WeWork continues to take bigger bites out of the existing tenant base instead of just pulling people out of coffee shops,” said Alexander Snyder, senior analyst at real estate-focused CenterSquare Investment Management in Philadelphia.

11700,"WASHINGTON   - The Senate Intelligence Committee probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election is nowhere near over, as lawmakers probe issues including a June 2016 meeting between top aides to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and a Russian lawyer, the panel’s top Democrat indicated on Friday. Senator Mark Warner said committee staff have interviewed everyone at the meeting, where President Trump’s son Donald Jr. expected to be given derogatory information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, with the exception of “one or two individuals who are Russian.” “But I feel very strongly that you can’t, you could never conclude without the senators themselves being able to talk to the principals involved,” Warner said. “We have not gotten there yet.” Warner, in an interview with Reuters, said the Senate investigation has made progress on several fronts. It has, he said, “re-validated” a Jan. 6, 2017, U.S. intelligence assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign aimed at the 2016 presidential election, with the goal of undermining Americans’ trust in their institutions and denigrating Clinton. In an effort that has been “frustratingly slow,” Warner said, the investigation also prompted the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to warn 21 U.S. states whose election systems were the subject of tampering attempts by Moscow. “DHS has upped its game. The state election officials have upped their game. And I think we are – not as fast as I’d like – but I think electoral systems are going to be on better guard” for congressional elections in November this year, Warner said. Warner and fellow Democrats have worked closely with the Senate panel’s Republican chairman, Senator Richard Burr. The bipartisanship contrasts with a parallel investigation by the House Intelligence Committee, where inter-party feuds have imperiled the effort, and may lead committee Republicans and Democrats to issue competing reports. In the interview, Warner repeated a warning that he made in a Dec. 20 Senate floor speech that any move by Trump aimed at firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller would provoke a “constitutional crisis.” Mueller is conducting a criminal probe of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, something the White House denies. Two Trump campaign associates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and aide George Papadopoulos, have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in Mueller’s probe. Warner said his concern that Trump might take a step to dismiss Mueller was confirmed by news reports on Thursday detailing steps the president reportedly took to blunt the Russia investigation. Trump, the reports said, ordered White House counsel Donald McGahn to convince Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Justice Department’s Russia probe, so Sessions could remain in charge of it. Sessions recused himself anyway. “If true, it’s one more example of this president’s unusual behavior,” the senator said.  “And it’s one of the reasons why I don’t take as absolute the White House’s assurances, ‘oh no, we have no plans’” to fire Mueller. “Because clearly this is based upon the president’s actions on a variety of topics – things can change on a dime.” ",Senate's Trump-Russia probe not close to ending: top Democrat,"January 5, 2018 /  10:44 PM ",washington the senate intelligence committee probe of russian meddling in the  election is nowhere near over as lawmakers probe issues including a june  meeting between top aides to then republican candidate donald trump and a russian lawyer the panel s top democrat indicated on friday senator mark warner said committee staff have interviewed everyone at the meeting where president trump s son donald jr expected to be given derogatory information about democratic candidate hillary clinton with the exception of one or two individuals who are russian but i feel very strongly that you can t you could never conclude without the senators themselves being able to talk to the principals involved warner said we have not gotten there yet warner in an interview with  said the senate investigation has made progress on several fronts it has he said re validated a jan   u s intelligence assessment that russian president vladimir putin ordered an influence campaign aimed at the  presidential election with the goal of undermining americans trust in their institutions and denigrating clinton in an effort that has been frustratingly slow warner said the investigation also prompted the u s department of homeland security to warn  u s states whose election systems were the subject of tampering attempts by moscow dhs has upped its game the state election officials have upped their game and i think we are not as fast as i d like but i think electoral systems are going to be on better guard for congressional elections in november this year warner said warner and fellow democrats have worked closely with the senate panel s republican chairman senator richard burr the bipartisanship contrasts with a parallel investigation by the house intelligence committee where inter party feuds have imperiled the effort and may lead committee republicans and democrats to issue competing reports in the interview warner repeated a warning that he made in a dec  senate floor speech that any move by trump aimed at firing special counsel robert mueller would provoke a constitutional crisis mueller is conducting a criminal probe of whether the trump campaign colluded with russia something the white house denies two trump campaign associates former national security adviser michael flynn and aide george papadopoulos have pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi in mueller s probe warner said his concern that trump might take a step to dismiss mueller was confirmed by news reports on thursday detailing steps the president reportedly took to blunt the russia investigation trump the reports said ordered white house counsel donald mcgahn to convince attorney general jeff sessions not to recuse himself from the justice department s russia probe so sessions could remain in charge of it sessions recused himself anyway if true it s one more example of this president s unusual behavior the senator said and it s one of the reasons why i don t take as absolute the white house s assurances oh no we have no plans to fire mueller because clearly this is based upon the president s actions on a variety of topics things can change on a dime ,Boeing Crisis,0.4109385311603546
11710,"  - Best Buy Co Inc shares surged 16 percent on Wednesday after it gave an upbeat profit forecast for the year and reported better-than-expected holiday-quarter sales. The company, which cited the frenzy for battle royale game “Fortnite” for a boost in sales of gaming gear, also announced an 11 percent boost to its quarterly dividend and a plan to buy back $3 billion of stock.  Best Buy’s report comes after a largely disappointing holiday season for retailers, which have struggled to compete with online sellers such as Amazon.com Inc. Best Buy has managed to ward off pressure from Amazon by focusing on customer services that has helped drive both store and online sales.  Investments in its online business and expansion of services that encourage customers to set up smart homes and provide advice on purchase of televisions and appliances have resonated with consumers and boosted sales. A $199-per-year “Total Tech Support” program launched in May, which includes unlimited support online and in stores, saw 1 million members sign up by the end of the year, the company said. “We continued to drive efficiencies and reduced cost in order to find investments and offset pressure,” Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said on a post-earnings call. During fiscal 2019, the company achieved $255 million in cost reductions, adding to its fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million in savings. “The key is that Best Buy has matched its operating expenses with its revenues, has focused on share repurchases, and is managing to grow same-store sales through increases in appliance sales and the offering of value added services,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.  The company also benefited from the bankruptcy of Sears Holdings Corp and J.C. Penney Co Inc’s exit from the appliance business. Best Buy’s domestic online revenue surged 9.3 percent to $2.96 billion in the fourth quarter on a comparable basis. Domestic comparable sales rose by a better-than-expected 3 percent in the three months ended Feb. 2, with growth across wearables, appliances, smart home and gaming, being partially offset by a decline in sales of mobile phones. Best Buy forecast fiscal 2020 adjusted profit of $5.45 to $5.65 per share, the mid-point of which was above analysts’ expectations of $5.49. Excluding items, it earned $2.72 per share, while analysts expected $2.57. Revenue fell 3.7 percent to $14.80 billion, as the year-ago quarter had an extra week, but still came above expectations of $14.70 billion.

11736,"LONDON   - Standard Chartered is targeting more trade-focused business from Chinese companies by hiring around 15 bankers worldwide, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters. The move forms part of a broader StanChart strategy announced on Tuesday to boost profits in its corporate and institutional banking division by focusing on its network of 63 countries, mainly in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  The London-based bank is pursuing the plan despite trade tensions between the United States and China and the new Chinese-speaking hires will be based in countries including Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates, the source said on Wednesday. They will work in StanChart’s Global Subsidiaries team to bank Chinese companies with business in those markets. StanChart Chief Executive Bill Winters said a network was vital to financing trade and investment between regions, after analysts questioned why it remains in markets such as Indonesia and Korea where returns have been weak for years. Around 20 of its 63 markets are delivering substandard returns, Winters said, but maintaining a presence in them is worthwhile for the ability to help global companies expand, invest and trade in those countries. The corporate banking unit added more than 6,400 customers last year and ‘network’ income from firms operating outside their home market grew to 70 percent of the investment banking division’s total income, head of that division Simon Cooper told staff in a memo seen by Reuters. The bank’s emerging markets and trade-focused business model has been hit hard in recent years by rising Sino-U.S. trade tensions and slowing growth in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, but Cooper said the bank will keep pursuing its strategy. “We’ve talked a lot about trade tensions recently and they continue to be a concern. However, we might see some new winners emerge: Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand have great potential to capitalize on the shifting trade landscape,” he said in the memo to around 12, 000 staff in the investment bank.

11776,"RIO DE JANEIRO   - A manager at Brazilian iron ore miner Vale SA told authorities that the company’s executive board knew there had been a “decrease in security” at the dam that burst in January, killing hundreds, according to a newspaper report on Tuesday. The manager told authorities he had discussed the dam with his superiors, a columnist at newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported, without saying how the information was obtained. Vale denied the report, saying that none of the company’s managers had made statements on a decrease in security at the dam, nor had they said that the company’s board received information suggesting an imminent risk to the structure. Technical evaluations of the dam had not indicated an immediate risk that it would burst, Vale said in a statement. In the month since the dam burst in the town of Brumadinho, likely killing over 300 people, prosecutors and media have raised questions about the security measures that were in place to prevent such a burst. Earlier in February, Reuters reported that internal Vale documents showed the dam had an elevated risk of rupture.

11819,"MOSCOW   - Russia’s President Vladimir Putin will not intervene in the case of a prominent U.S. investor arrested over embezzlement accusations, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, playing down pressure to release him before trial.  The detention of Michael Calvey, a founder of Baring Vostok Capital Partners, has rattled foreign investors in Moscow and is likely to further strain U.S.-Russian ties already under pressure over everything from Syria to espionage claims. Calvey was held earlier this month along with three other executives from his private equity group after investigators accused them of stealing 2.5 billion roubles ($38.09 million). Calvey denies that, saying the allegations are intended to pressure him in a business dispute over a Russian bank where he is a board member. The head of sovereign wealth fund Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), its biggest state bank, and a former finance minister have all called for a softer approach. And Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, in comments reported by the RBC media portal late on Monday, said businessmen should not be held in jail while under investigation without guilt proven. House arrest was a more appropriate alternative, he said. Asked for reaction to Siluanov’s remarks, the Kremlin said Putin believed the Calvey case should be allowed to run its course despite Baring Vostok’s appeal for him to get involved. “The president cannot interfere in any way in investigative processes,” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Every investigation should be viewed on its own merits without drawing wider conclusions about the business climate or such cases in general, he added.  “We can hardly speak about this (alleged heavy-handed treatment) being systemic in this case because the questions are to do with observing the law. These are questions that law enforcement authorities should deal with,” Peskov said. Putin has not yet spoken publicly about the Calvey case in detail, but told a closed door meeting of Russian journalists that security services should be given a chance to prove their case, according to someone at the meeting.   One source close to the Kremlin, who declined to be named because of the matter’s sensitivity, suggested the government was less of a bystander, however, and was trying to work towards having Calvey moved to house arrest.       Calvey, who began working in Russia in 1994 and is well-known in financial circles, is due to appeal his detention later this week.  Baring Vostok has invested in successful Russian brands such as the Yandex search engine. According to its web site, it has over $3.7 billion of committed capital with an investor base of pension funds, university endowments, sovereign wealth funds, and other funds from North America, Western Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said on Tuesday that one of its diplomats had finally been allowed to see Calvey in custody 12 days after his detention to offer him support. It had previously complained multiple requests to see him had not been satisfied.

11827,"BEIJING   - A top U.S. business lobby in China said on Tuesday that a majority of its member companies favored the United States retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while Washington and Beijing try to hammer out a deal to end a months-long trade war. The American Chamber of Commerce in China also said that over the past year substantially more of its members want the U.S. government to push Beijing harder to create a level playing field for U.S. businesses.  U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he may soon sign an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to end the trade dispute if their countries can bridge remaining differences, saying negotiators were “very, very close” to a deal.  That followed Trump’s announcement a day earlier that he would delay a tariff hike on $200 billion of Chinese goods and extend his March 1 deadline for a deal. Washington is demanding an end to the theft of trade secrets and practices that coerce U.S. companies to turn over technology to Chinese firms. China has given few details about the latest talks. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters that as talks were still on-going, his understanding was that many of the details could not yet be revealed. Lu noted that Xi has told Trump that he is willing to keep holding meetings between them. “I believe that both countries’ teams will make full preparation for matters related to a meeting between the two heads of state,” Lu added, without elaborating.      About 10 percent of the chamber’s members favored raising tariffs rates on those $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent after the original March 1 deadline agreed to by Trump and Xi in December.   Another 43 percent advocated maintaining tariffs at 10 percent and delaying the increase for 60 days while negotiations continued, the chamber said at a briefing on its annual China business climate survey. “There are mixed feelings about the tariffs, but a majority are in support of the tariffs continuing at the present time,” chamber chairman Tim Stratford said at the briefing. “People don’t like tariffs, and that’s truly understandable. But they also think that maybe the tariffs have done some good in provoking very serious negotiations between the two sides,” Stratford told Reuters earlier. Chamber president Alan Beebe said 47 percent of members wanted the U.S. government to “advocate more strongly” for a level playing field for U.S. businesses in the world’s second-largest economy. “That figure is almost twice what it was a year ago,” Beebe said. The chamber said 19 percent of its companies were adjusting supply chains or seeking to source components and assembly outside of China as a result of tariffs. Twenty-eight percent were delaying or cancelling investment decisions in China.  Trump’s decision to delay the tariff increase has been greeted with a mixture of relief and dread among U.S. industry groups and lawmakers, many of which are increasingly fed up with what they say is China’s failure to live up to its World Trade Organization commitments. Some have expressed concerns that after nearly eight months of tit-for-tat tariffs roiling global financial markets, disrupting manufacturing supply chains, and shrinking U.S. farm exports, Trump could end up settling for a deal that increases commodity sales to Beijing while doing little to change China’s underlying trade practices and industrial policies.  In his Feb. 5 State of the Union address, Trump said a China trade deal “must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.” But as the March 1 deadline drew closer, Trump has appeared increasingly eager to make a deal, causing concerns among trade watchers that he was eroding U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s leverage in the talks.

11832,"LONDON   - Saudi Aramco’s chief executive said on Tuesday the oil industry is facing “a crisis of perception” and the views of some observers that the end of oil is near with the rise of electric vehicles are illogical and not based on fact. Amin Nasser, CEO of the national oil company of the world’s top crude-exporting country, told an industry event in London that demand for oil is expected to increase substantially, driven mainly by the transportation sector.  “Important stakeholders believe that the entire world will soon run on anything, but oil. These views are not based on logic and facts, and are formed mostly in response to pressure and hype,” he said in a rare, strongly worded remarks. “Our industry faces a crisis of perception with multiple stakeholders. Our traditional qualities of ample, reliable and affordable supply are not enough to meet society’s expectations today.” He said passenger vehicles made up just 20 percent of oil demand, while the rest came from other sectors such as planes, ships, trucks and petrochemicals, for which there was no alternative to oil yet to meet expected growth in demand.  He called for more investment in the oil and gas sector to meet future growth and said the oil industry must “push back on exaggerated theories like peak oil demand”. Oil demand is expected by many to peak in coming years as emissions standards around the world tighten and demand grows for more fuel-efficicent vehicles and renewable sources of  energy.

11835,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla.   - Long-time rivals Barrick Gold Corp and Newmont Mining Corp renewed their animosity on Monday with their chief executives trading insults after Barrick launched an $18 billion hostile bid for the U.S. company, presaging an aggressive battle.     The tough talk underscored deep personality and cultural differences between the world’s two biggest gold producers. Their past attempts to merge ended in acrimony in 2014, and the frictions could scuttle a deal this time too.  Newmont’s financial returns in recent years show its CEO, Gary Goldberg, is a “loser,” Barrick CEO Mark Bristow told Reuters.  Goldberg, for his part, told Reuters that Bristow’s “credibility and experience” and performance at Randgold, which he led until last month when it was acquired by Barrick, was “anemic.” Adding to the residue of resentment at the mining companies from past merger failures, the current hostile climate between the companies reflects animosity between the CEOs, opposing management styles and clashing visions for how to achieve maximum shareholder value. The animus between Bristow and Goldberg extended to a dispute over who extended his hand first for a handshake at a BMO Metals & Mining Conference in Florida on Monday.      For investors, a Barrick-Newmont merger would bring under one roof some of the world’s most compatible gold mines and plants, which sit side by side in Nevada, and create a company likely to appeal to top shareholders seeking a haven for long-only money. Barrick said there is more logic in a tie-up between the two than in Newmont’s planned $10 billion merger with Goldcorp.  “I think in an environment of lower gold prices, everyone needs more synergies and the synergies of Nevada - Barrick and Newmont - should have been done a long time ago,” said Greg Taylor of Purpose Investments, which holds Newmont shares. Newmont rejected the Barrick bid, saying a joint venture was a better way to extract value from the two companies’ mines in Nevada. The two CEOs said they have not met to compare financial records on the other’s Nevada assets. Each blamed the other for not being willing to share information.  “I drive trucks past ... processing plants in Nevada, because Gary won’t share with me,” Bristow said. Goldberg questioned when he was in the state “given that Bristow’s not really spent much time in Nevada to begin with.”  The Newmont CEO was adamant the Goldcorp deal was best for his company, contrasting it with what he described as Bristow’s short-sighted reliance on cost-cutting to pump profits. “We see great value,” he said. “It feels to us that wherever Mark (Bristow) goes, he seems to be just firing people in order to boost returns.”     David Neuhauser of Livermore Partners, which holds Barrick shares, said the no-premium bid could “over time suggest a premium multiple, given the long life and cash-generating abilities” of the combined assets. Van Eck and BlackRock, two large shareholders in both names, did not respond to requests for comment. Major investors have taken on extra weight in the gold sector since many of the smaller metals funds disappeared after the 2015 to 2016 commodity slump. Those long-only funds, which do not invest in small companies, have largely driven the need for gold consolidation.   “Passive investors will seal the fate of this deal,” said Brian Madden of Goodreid in Toronto. The bid now goes to shareholders, with Barrick asking Newmont’s investors to approve bylaw changes that would ultimately make its hostile bid easier.     The big loser would be Goldcorp, only just enjoying a share rally on the prospect of a tie-up with Newmont, which could be left without any potential buyers.  Goldcorp’s best hope is that it gets swept up in the next wave of activity, which many investors and analysts predict as a mighty Barrick sheds some of its assets. “There is nothing Goldcorp can do to avoid the collapse of their deal,” a banker who worked on the Randgold-Barrick deal said on condition of anonymity. “Newmont and Barrick is the deal that should have always happened, at least for the past 20 years.” ",'Loser' vs 'Anemic': Barrick's Newmont bid starts on toxic note,"February 26, 2019 /  12:59 AM ",hollywood fla long time rivals barrick gold corp and newmont mining corp renewed their animosity on monday with their chief executives trading insults after barrick launched an  billion hostile bid for the u s company presaging an aggressive battle the tough talk underscored deep personality and cultural differences between the world s two biggest gold producers their past attempts to merge ended in acrimony in  and the frictions could scuttle a deal this time too newmont s financial returns in recent years show its ceo gary goldberg is a loser barrick ceo mark bristow told  goldberg for his part told  that bristow s credibility and experience and performance at randgold which he led until last month when it was acquired by barrick was anemic adding to the residue of resentment at the mining companies from past merger failures the current hostile climate between the companies reflects animosity between the ceos opposing management styles and clashing visions for how to achieve maximum shareholder value the animus between bristow and goldberg extended to a dispute over who extended his hand first for a handshake at a bmo metals mining conference in florida on monday for investors a barrick newmont merger would bring under one roof some of the world s most compatible gold mines and plants which sit side by side in nevada and create a company likely to appeal to top shareholders seeking a haven for long only money barrick said there is more logic in a tie up between the two than in newmont s planned  billion merger with goldcorp i think in an environment of lower gold prices everyone needs more synergies and the synergies of nevada barrick and newmont should have been done a long time ago said greg taylor of purpose investments which holds newmont shares newmont rejected the barrick bid saying a joint venture was a better way to extract value from the two companies mines in nevada the two ceos said they have not met to compare financial records on the other s nevada assets each blamed the other for not being willing to share information i drive trucks past processing plants in nevada because gary won t share with me bristow said goldberg questioned when he was in the state given that bristow s not really spent much time in nevada to begin with the newmont ceo was adamant the goldcorp deal was best for his company contrasting it with what he described as bristow s short sighted reliance on cost cutting to pump profits we see great value he said it feels to us that wherever mark bristow goes he seems to be just firing people in order to boost returns david neuhauser of livermore partners which holds barrick shares said the no premium bid could over time suggest a premium multiple given the long life and cash generating abilities of the combined assets van eck and blackrock two large shareholders in both names did not respond to requests for comment major investors have taken on extra weight in the gold sector since many of the smaller metals funds disappeared after the  to  commodity slump those long only funds which do not invest in small companies have largely driven the need for gold consolidation passive investors will seal the fate of this deal said brian madden of goodreid in toronto the bid now goes to shareholders with barrick asking newmont s investors to approve bylaw changes that would ultimately make its hostile bid easier the big loser would be goldcorp only just enjoying a share rally on the prospect of a tie up with newmont which could be left without any potential buyers goldcorp s best hope is that it gets swept up in the next wave of activity which many investors and analysts predict as a mighty barrick sheds some of its assets there is nothing goldcorp can do to avoid the collapse of their deal a banker who worked on the randgold barrick deal said on condition of anonymity newmont and barrick is the deal that should have always happened at least for the past  years ,Boeing Crisis,0.3407870829105377
11841,"WASHINGTON   - An appeals court on Monday upheld a judge’s decision dismissing a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to fight the practice of brand-name drug companies using a government petition system to delay cheaper, generic drugs from coming to market. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a federal court in Delaware had been correct in dismissing the FTC’s lawsuit against Shire. Shire was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co last month. The agency had objected to ViroPharma, which Shire acquired in 2014, filing 46 “citizen petitions” and other filings between 2006 and 2012 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding generic equivalents to its antibiotic Vancocin HCl, on the grounds that it resulted in delayed sale of a generic version. But while the appeals court acknowledged that the delayed entry meant “hundreds of millions of dollars in profits,” it said that the petitioning activity had ceased and thus the company was not in violation of the law. This ruling agreed with what the lower court had said in March 2018. The FTC said it “regrets the court’s decision and is considering its options.” Shire owner Takeda did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

11913,"BARCELONA   - South Korea’s LG Electronics unveiled a 5G smartphone on Sunday with a dual screen, the latest handset maker to pitch a new design feature in an effort to revive flagging sales. The two screens on the new V50ThinQ work independently, so a user can watch a film on one screen while browsing the Internet on the other. LG, the world’s No.7 smartphone maker, saw its sales decline by a quarter last year as Chinese rivals Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi  grabbed market share in a slightly weaker global market. Both announced 5G phones in Barcelona on the eve of the Mobile World Congress, the telecoms industry’s main annual get together, with Xiaomi pitching a $680 model and Huawei smashing the price ceiling with $2,600 folding phone. LG nevertheless retains a following among those who value good video and audio quality. Addressing those users, LG launched a second phone, the G8ThinQ, which can be unlocked without touching the screen. The handset instead uses light sensors to scan the veins in a user’s hand or to recognize their face. The phone’s front-facing camera, which uses a sensor chip developed by Germany’s Infineon Technologies , can scan in three dimensions - making it more secure than existing biometric methods of unlocking phones such as fingerprints. LG product evangelist David Montanya told a launch event it would be harder to ‘spoof’ than the FaceID feature used in Apple’s  iPhone X because the vein structure in a user’s hand has less than one chance in a billion of being the same as anyone else’s.  Users can also activate features with gestures - for example to play or pause a song or video, or adjust the volume, by twisting their fingers, emulating the character played by Tom Cruise in science-fiction detective thriller Minority Report. LG did not set release dates or announce prices for the new phones, but said the 5G model should hit stores in the first half of the year.

11922,"  - Sinking stocks and deteriorating prospects from an investment in Kraft Heinz Co pummeled the bottom line of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which on Saturday reported a huge quarterly net loss even as operating profit soared. The fourth-quarter net loss was $25.39 billion, or $15,467 per Class A share, reflecting more than $27.6 billion of investment losses, including from stocks Berkshire still owns. That compared with a year-earlier profit of $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, most of which resulted from a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate. Results included a $3.02 billion writedown for intangible assets that Buffett said was “almost entirely” attributable to Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire owns a 26.7 percent stake. The packaged food company on Thursday shocked investors when it reported its own $15.4 billion writedown for Kraft, Oscar Mayer and other assets, and said U.S. securities regulators were examining its accounting practices. Buffett also released his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, which did not discuss Kraft Heinz’s recent travails or the day-to-day management of the company by his business partner, the Brazilian firm 3G Capital. Net results suffered because many of Berkshire’s common stock holdings saw double-digit price declines, including a 30 percent decline in Apple Inc, its largest holding. Accounting rules require Berkshire to report unrealized stock gains and losses with net income. This causes huge swings in net results, and Buffett has urged investors not to use them as a measure of Berkshire’s business performance. Quarterly operating profit rose 71 percent to $5.72 billion, or about $3,484 per Class A share, benefiting from improved results in many businesses including the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad. Analysts on average expected operating profit of $3,349.04 per share, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data. The decline in stock prices also pummeled Berkshire’s book value per Class A share, which fell 7.1 percent in the quarter to $212,503. Buffett had long used book value as a gauge of Berkshire’s intrinsic worth. But he told shareholders on Saturday it has “lost the relevance it once had,” citing changes in Berkshire’s business and investment mix, accounting rules, and the likelihood of additional stock buybacks that could depress it. Book value, he said, has become “increasingly out of touch with economic reality.” Berkshire ended the year with $111.9 billion of cash and equivalents. For all of 2018, Berkshire’s operating profit rose 71 percent to $24.78 billion, while net income tumbled 91 percent to $4.02 billion. Berkshire Class A shares closed at $302,000 on Friday, about 10 percent below its October record high.

11933,"WASHINGTON   - Prominent Republican senators on Thursday embraced a push to overhaul rules for addressing sexual harassment in the U.S. Congress, signing on to a bill that would protect victims and require lawmakers to pay for their own settlements. The legislation builds on demands to lift the veil of secrecy around sexual harassment and misconduct on Capitol Hill, and has gained steam in recent months as a wave of women have come forward with accusations against prominent American men in politics, media and entertainment. The bipartisan push signaled momentum in the Republican-led U.S. Congress for overhauling a process for handling misconduct allegations that many lawmakers say is antiquated and stacked against victims. The Senate bill, called the Congressional Harassment Reform Act, draws from proposals that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Jackie Speier, both Democrats, have been developing. “Congress is really behind the eight-ball. I think that, in many respects, the private sector has acted more swiftly than we have in terms of addressing sexual harassment,” Speier said in an interview. High-profile Republican senators co-sponsoring the bill include John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican; Ted Cruz; Joni Ernst and Lisa Murkowski. The legislation would require any member of Congress found liable for harassment to pay settlements themselves, rather than with taxpayer funds, as the current process allows. “Congress is not above the laws, and secret settlements with taxpayer money to cover up harassment should no longer be tolerated,” Cruz said in a statement. Settlements would be made public automatically unless victims choose to keep them private. Outrage over sexual misconduct in politics helped to fuel an upset victory by Democrat Doug Jones in the U.S. Senate race in deeply conservative Alabama on Tuesday. Voters rejected the Republican candidate in the race, Roy Moore, who had been accused by multiple women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore denied the allegations but many prominent Republicans distanced themselves from Moore, although President Donald Trump backed him. In Washington, allegations of sexual misconduct prompted the resignations last week of three lawmakers - Democratic Senator Al Franken, Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks. On Tuesday, Republican Representative Blake Farenthold said he would not seek re-election in November. Politico reported that the congressional Office of Compliance had paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of Farenthold to settle a sexual harassment claim in 2015. Reuters has been unable to verify the allegations against Farenthold, who has said that the charges were false and has denied wrongdoing. The 1995 law governing the process for complaints in Congress - created in the wake of a harassment scandal - has been criticized as ineffective. The lengthy and cumbersome process requires victims to go through mandatory mediation and requires complete secrecy. “It created a protective blanket around the harasser and left the victim out in the cold,” Speier said. Speier, who has worked on the issue since 2014, came forward in October with her own story of unwanted sexual contact from the chief of staff for the lawmaker she worked for as a congressional aide. “He kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth,” said Speier, who has become a resource from women seeking advice on how to handle similar situations. “When it happened to me, it disgusted me. I kind of recoiled.” Speier’s proposals for reforms have attracted support from more than 100 members, including 19 Republicans. A group of conservative Republicans have championed a separate bill focused on banning the use of taxpayer dollars for settlements, and requiring past settlements to be disclosed and reimbursed. “What we do agree is that taxpayers should not be on the hook for misbehavior and for those settlements that are made,” said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative who has advocated for the proposal. “We need to use that to make certain that workplaces are respectful,” Blackburn said in an interview. A House committee is reviewing reforms with an eye to making recommendations in coming weeks. “I think that what we are doing is taking the best of all the ideas out there and putting them into one package,” a senior House Republican aide said.

11965,"  - General Motors Co said on Friday it had extended the production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, against an earlier plan to discontinue production in June this year. The No.1 U.S. automaker is revamping its operations, which include plant closures and thousands of job cuts, as it looks to boost profitability in the wake of declining U.S. auto sales. The Hamtramck plant will continue to produce the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac CT6 sedans until early next year, the company said. “We are balancing production timing while continuing the availability of Cadillac advanced technology features currently included in the CT6-V - the Blackwing Twin-Turbo V-8 (engine) and Super Cruise (driver assistance system),” GM said. The plant has already discontinued production of the Buick LaCrosse sedan and Chevrolet Volt electric hybrid car. Detroit-based union United Auto Workers’ President Gary Jones said GM’s decision to continue production at the plant was a relief for the workers as well as their families. “We commend GM for today’s decision and we reiterate the importance of a collective bargaining process in times like these,” Jones said.

11968,"PARIS   - UBS was warned numerous times over a period of at least six years that its French private bank risked breaking local tax laws, according to the written judgment in a case where the Swiss bank faces a 4.5 billion euro ($5.10 billion) penalty. The hefty sanction — a 3.7 billion euro fine and 800 million euros in damages — has stunned the European banking world and raised questions over how the bank handled the process. UBS consistently denied wrongdoing and immediately appealed the verdict, describing the court’s decision as “incomprehensible”.    The judgment, published late on Thursday, said UBS staff of different levels of seniority in the bank’s French business told management that they had concerns about its practices. The judgment showed that as early as 2003, Eric Dupuy, the legal department’s director at UBS’ French business, warned his bosses that staff were not respecting all compliance proceedings when registering risks associated to new customers. Others came forward in 2006, 2007 and 2009, the court documents showed. Jean-Frederic de Leusse, the head of UBS’s French unit, on Thursday dismissed the content of those warnings as “unsubstantiated gossip”. “Every time there was an accusation like that, we carried out thorough investigations, but no specific facts were presented,” de Leusse told reporters at a news conference in Paris. He reiterated that the bank had done nothing wrong.  But financial regulators expressed concerns about the thoroughness of UBS’ internal investigations. The judgment said UBS’s auditing of the whistleblower reports was a “superficial work that led to erroneous conclusions,” an inspector for the banking regulator said in 2011.    According the judgment, UBS employees said Swiss bankers from the group signed up wealthy clients in France at golf tournaments, classical music concerts and hunting parties in a breach of French rules on soliciting new business. French regulations stipulate that only employees of banks registered in France can solicit potential clients. The judgment said that Dupuy, the former legal department director, said French salespeople were encouraged to help Swiss colleagues, who were instructed to encrypt their agendas, use acronyms and codes for clients to hide their dealings.     According to the judgment, the bank kept track of customers brought to Switzerland though French salespeople via so-called “milk notebooks.” The judgment said the notebooks were later replaced by an excel file named “cow” which included the names of clients, the names of the salespeople from France and Switzerland and the amounts collected by the bank. The notebooks also were used to calculate French salespeople’s bonuses, the judgment said.

11982,"WASHINGTON   - Top U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators haggled on Thursday over the details of a set of agreements aimed at ending their trade war, just one week before a Washington-imposed deadline for a deal expires and triggers higher U.S. tariffs. Reuters reported exclusively on Wednesday that the two sides are starting to sketch out an agreement on structural issues, drafting language for six memorandums of understanding on proposed Chinese reforms. If the two sides fail to reach an agreement by March 1, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent. Tit-for-tat tariffs between the world’s two largest economic powers have disrupted international trade and slowed the global economy since the trade war started seven months ago. Negotiators have struggled this week to overcome differences on specific language to address tough U.S. demands for structural changes in China’s economy, two sources familiar with the talks said. The issues include an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China complies with any agreements.  “It’s not surprising that this week has been more challenging,” said an industry source familiar with the talks. “Once you move from putting together outlines to filling out the details, that is where things would naturally become more challenging.” Chinese officials did not answer questions as they left the U.S. Trade Representative’s office on Thursday evening after more than nine hours of talks on Thursday. The discussions began with a photo opportunity where U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He faced each other silently across a table in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door to the White House. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Liu at the Oval Office on Friday, the White House said late on Thursday. The two also met at the end of talks during Liu’s last visit to Washington in late January. Trump, who has embraced an “America First” policy as part of an effort to rebalance global trade, has said the March 1 deadline could be extended if enough progress is made. Sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters the memorandums would cover forced technology transfer and cyber theft, intellectual property rights, services, currency, agriculture and non-tariff barriers to trade.  The two sides remain far apart on demands by Trump’s administration for China to end practices on those issues that led Trump to start levying duties on Chinese imports in the first place. Chinese President Xi Jinping would need to undertake difficult structural economic reforms to meet U.S. demands. The United States is offering no real concessions in return, other than to remove the tariff barriers Trump has imposed to force change from China. One of Trump’s demands that is easier to fix for Beijing is to reduce the trade imbalance between the two nations. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached a record $382 billion through the first 11 months of 2018. The two sides have reached consensus on how to alleviate the trade imbalances, several Chinese government sources said. Washington and Beijing are looking at a 10-item list for that, including additional Chinese purchases of agricultural produce, energy and goods such as semiconductors. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue called China’s pledges to purchase U.S. agricultural produce premature. “Those proposals are all contingent upon a grand deal,” he said on the sidelines of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s annual forum in Washington. “The real issue is structural reforms regarding intellectual property, enforceability of those types of provisions.” The United States could quickly recover its lost agricultural markets in China if a deal is struck, he said. Perdue has overseen $12 billion in federal aid to U.S. farmers for losses they have sustained because of the trade war. China had all but halted purchases of U.S. soybeans, which were the single biggest U.S. agricultural export, worth around $12 billion in 2017.

12018,"NEW YORK   - Wall Street stocks fell on Thursday due to a deteriorating economic outlook that was only partially offset by signs of trade progress between China and the United States, while gold and oil prices retreated from their recent peaks. The dollar held steady against most major currencies, while the Australian dollar tumbled on jitters about a ban on that country’s coal by a key Chinese port.  Signs of positive developments in U.S.-Sino trade talks and a possible Brexit compromise between Britain and the European Union spurred selling of U.S. and core European government debt, pushing their yields higher. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday domestic orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.7 percent. Moreover, the U.S. Mid-Atlantic factory sector fell into contraction territory in February for the first time since May 2016, data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed. “Mainly it’s about the bad economic reports and intensifying recession fears,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. The grim economic data was offset by signs of progress in trade talks between Beijing and Washington. The world’s two biggest economies have started to outline commitments in principle on the most contentious issues in their trade dispute, marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.81 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,850.63, the S&P 500 lost 10.42 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,774.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.01 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,459.06. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.28 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.47 percent. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was up over 3 basis points at 2.686 percent, while the German 10-year Bund yield rose 3 basis points to 0.13 percent. Safe-haven demand for bonds cooled a bit as diplomats said Britain and the EU were moving closer to a legal compromise that Prime Minister Theresa May hopes will gain approval from the British parliament.   In the currency market, an index that tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies rose nearly 0.2 percent, while the Aussie dollar was down 1 percent at $0.7092. China’s northern Dalian port has put an indefinite ban on coal imports from Australia since the start of February, a port official told Reuters on Thursday. In the commodity market, crude prices pulled back from their highest levels of 2019 on hopes that oil supplies will balance later this year.

12022,"PARIS   - Airbus has begun lining up tentative orders for a longer-range version of its A321 jetliner, seeking to exploit signs of hesitation at arch-rival Boeing over whether to develop a new model in a hotly contested niche of the airplane market. The European firm is in detailed talks with airlines over the price and timing of the longer-range design - known as A321XLR - and has penciled in some orders subject to a formal launch later this year, industry sources said. Airbus is looking for 200-300 draft orders before committing to build the A321XLR, aiming to limit the space available for a mid-market alternative that Boeing hopes to launch in a gap between medium-haul and long-haul jets. “Every A321XLR that Airbus sells, means one less potential sale for the NMA (Boeing’s proposed New Mid-sized Airplane),” an industry source said. An Airbus spokesman said the planemaker is “always talking to customers” and declined further comment. The middle of the jet market is at the center of one of the most widely watched airplane battles for years, with potential sales valued at hundreds of billions of dollars over 20 years. Boeing is aiming its potential new 220 to 260-seat NMA at a niche previously served by two models: its own 757, a long-range single-aisle jet, and its 767, a larger twin-aisle model. Boeing dominates the upper end of that spectrum but has come under mounting pressure from Airbus at the lower end. Last month it postponed a decision on whether to launch the NMA to 2020 from 2019, though it said it could still decide whether to offer the plane on a preliminary basis this year. It maintained its goal of seeing any new jet enter service in 2025. Facing a potential new competitor, Airbus plans a defensive pincer move with derivatives of two existing models: the A321neo and its souped-up sister versions - the A321LR and the proposed A321XLR - at the lower end and an upgraded A330 at the top end. Unlike the smaller A321neo, the upgraded A330neo has been selling poorly but received a hefty Emirates order last week. The A321XLR would have a higher maximum take-off weight of 101 tonnes and 400-500 nautical miles more range than the 4,000-mile A321LR, Airbus’ longest-range single-aisle. Under current plans, it would not carry any extra passengers, sources said. That’s where rival Boeing could decide to hit back. Experts say Boeing will likely argue that such a plane would have worse economics. That’s because its special new fuel tanks would make the jet heavier and costlier to fly, but without the compensation of extra seats. That would drive up operating costs per seat, the airline industry’s most important yardstick. But Airbus is gambling that some airlines will be swayed by earlier availability - with the A321XLR reaching the market 2-3 years before the NMA - and greater certainty as Boeing takes its time to evaluate the business case for its ambitious new jet. Its strategy is to try to pick off one or two potential NMA customers, especially in the United States, and encourage Boeing to think again about launching a jet that could disrupt the market and dent a record run of sales for the A321 family. Boeing has said its potential new plane will fly similar ranges or more but with greater comfort and at a lower cost.  “The XLR is not in the same ballpark,” a U.S. source said.

12023,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. House Republicans proposed on Tuesday to delay or suspend several taxes under former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, including a tax on medical devices and the so-called “Cadillac” tax on generous health insurance plans. The move represents a new Republican attempt to roll back provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act widely known as Obamacare, after repeated failures by Congress’ majority party this year to repeal the law. Republicans in the House and Senate are also in the final stages of reconciling tax overhaul legislation, including a proposal to scrap Obamacare’s individual mandate, which imposes a tax penalty on Americans who do not obtain health insurance.  A spokeswoman for the House Ways and Means Committee said the additional proposed healthcare tax rollbacks would not be part of the broader tax overhaul bill. Republicans could try to merge the healthcare tax proposals with a must-pass government funding bill that is expected to be passed by Dec. 22, when current funding runs out. But to succeed, Republicans in the Senate, who hold a slim majority of seats, would need an assist from Democrats to get past procedural hurdles.  In a statement, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady announced five new Republican-sponsored bills to provide targeted relief from Obamacare taxes, saying he looked forward to “advancing legislation in the weeks ahead.” One proposed bill would retroactively eliminate Obamacare penalties for employers who did not offer health insurance to their employees over the last three years, as well as for next year. The bill would also delay for one year the Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance, which is otherwise scheduled to go into effect in 2020. Labor unions oppose this tax because their members often receive more generous healthcare plans, and they fear it would increase their costs. Another bill would suspend for five years the tax on medical devices, such as pacemakers and artificial hips. It was first imposed in January 2013 as a funding mechanism for Obamacare, a law that has brought medical coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans. The medical device tax has powerful opponents in both parties and manufacturers have lobbied heavily against it. Other proposals in the package would suspend a tax on health insurers for two years, and provide two years of relief from a tax on over-the-counter medications.

12029,"LONDON   - Sainsbury’s planned 7.3 billion pound ($9.5 billion) takeover of Walmart’s Asda can only be salvaged if Britain’s competition regulator fundamentally changes its analysis of Britain’s grocery market, experts said on Thursday. That’s unlikely, say competition lawyers, analysts and company insiders, so the proposal will most likely fail. The Competition and Market Authority’s (CMA) provisional view, published on Wednesday, was the deal should be blocked in the absence of the sale of a large number of stores, or even one of the brands.    It acknowledged the two companies were unlikely to be able to address its concerns.  “The only way you get there is you have to have the CMA do a fundamental u-turn on the way they’ve appraised it,” said one person familiar with Sainsbury’s thinking. “And if they (the CMA) are playing the politics, then there’s no chance they’re going to do that.” Sainsbury and Asda have until March 13 to respond to the CMA’s provisional findings and until March 6 to respond to its suggested divestment remedies. The CMA will then publish its final report by April 30. Competition lawyers said there are few precedents for the CMA to dramatically revise its findings between provisional and final reports. Sainsbury and Asda’s key argument has been that Britain’s grocery market is changing rapidly, driven by the growth of online and a broader range of competitors, most notably discounters Aldi and Lidl. However, the CMA effectively said that while new entrants are a force, it is the big four grocers - market leader Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons - who are most in competition with each other, making the Sainsbury-Asda deal a “four to three” merger. Lawyers said Sainsbury and Asda would have to come up with new evidence to change the CMA’s thinking. “Sainsbury’s-Asda would need to pull something out of the bag, or they’d need to show that the CMA has completely got its figures wrong,” said Alex Haffner, partner and head of competition at law firm Fladgate LLP.     “All they can realistically hope to achieve between now and the CMA’s reporting deadline is to eat away at the size of the divestments required. They are undoubtedly facing an uphill challenge to make it work,” Haffner said. Analysts at Barclays said prior to Wednesday’s ruling they had assumed a 67 percent chance of the deal proceeding. They now see a minimal chance of success. They highlighted the CMA’s view that any “remedy stores” would have to be sold to a single buyer, would have to be solely Sainsbury’s or solely Asda’s, not a mix, and be accompanied by the sale of either the Sainsbury or Asda brand name. “Any one of these constraints would be painful - together they leave us skeptical that any viable package could be found,” they said, arguing Amazon was the only company they could imagine being interested in buying so many stores.  But they cautioned that facilitating Amazon’s scaling up in UK grocery might cost Sainsbury more in the long term. Amazon declined to comment. If the CMA’s final report differs little from its provisional findings, Sainsbury’s and Asda’s last chance would be to challenge the ruling through the Competition Appeal Tribunal, a specialist judicial body. Sainsbury Chief Executive Mike Coupe has said the company would take that route if it believed any ruling was not backed up by published evidence. Coupe, as the architect of the deal, could come under investor pressure if it fails. However, analysts speculated Sainsbury would be reluctant to jettison him given Chairman David Tyler is due to step down in March, or soon after, to be succeeded by Martin Scicluna. Meanwhile failure of the deal would block one potential exit route from Britain for Walmart. Analysts have said the U.S. group might instead consider a stock market listing of Asda or try to sell it to private equity.

12112,"  - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Wednesday that activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP intends to nominate five directors to the U.S. drugmaker’s board, one month after it announced a $74 billion deal to acquire peer Celgene Corp. Reuters reported last week that Starboard was working with a proxy solicitor to gauge the level of support among Bristol-Myers shareholders for the Celgene deal. If it finds enough discontent, Starboard could agitate against it. Bristol-Myers said Starboard informed the company it had bought roughly one million of its common shares. That is equivalent to a roughly $50 million stake, a small sliver of the company’s $84 billion market capitalization.  Starboard has submitted regulatory filings that would allow it to acquire additional stock. In the meantime, its small position in Bristol-Myers’ stock and its proposed director slate give the fund the option to explore other changes at the company. “Starboard Value sent Bristol-Myers Squibb a notice of nomination in connection with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s 2019 annual meeting of stockholders,” Bristol said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, adding that the hedge fund proposed five directors, including Starboard co-founder Jeffrey Smith. Besides Smith, the hedge fund proposed the following as directors: pharmaceutical industry veteran Janet Vergis; James Tyree, an adviser to Starboard; healthcare and technology veteran Steven Shulman; and John Leonard, who had been chief scientific officer at global pharmaceutical company AbbVie. The hedge fund asked to speak with Bristol-Myers management when it submitted its nomination notice and also requested that any meetings and its notice be kept confidential. Bristol said the two sides have met “on multiple occasions.”  Bristol-Myers shareholders will vote on the Celgene deal in April. Starboard did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Bristol-Myers shares dipped 0.5 percent to $51.09.  The presence of an activist investor can encourage potential deal interlopers to step in. However, no rival suitor has so far emerged publicly, either for Bristol-Myers or for Celgene. Starboard has a track record of opposing deals. It tried to block Virginia-based meat giant Smithfield Foods’ sale to Chinese company Shuanghui International in 2013, as well as aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins Inc’s acquisition of B/E Aerospace two years ago.

12117,"  - Tesla Inc said on Wednesday its general counsel Dane Butswinkas is leaving the electric carmaker just two months into the job, the latest in a string of top-level departures at the company. Butswinkas, who joined Tesla in December and was reporting to Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, will return to his previous role as the company’s outside counsel at law firm Williams & Connolly.     Jonathan Chang, Tesla’s vice president of legal department, will replace Butswinkas effective immediately, the company said in an email statement to Reuters. Before joining Tesla in 2011, Chang was its outside counsel at law firm Latham & Watkins. Tesla hired Butswinkas as an outside counsel last year to help settle a case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Musk later settled the charges with the U.S. regulator by agreeing to pay a $20 million fine and relinquishing his position as Tesla’s chairman for three years. Butswinkas is the latest among the dozens of high-profile executives to leave Tesla over the past two years even as the carmaker struggles to ramp up production of Model 3 sedans, which is seen as crucial for the its long-term profitability. Tesla, which last month missed Wall Street profit targets for the last quarter of 2018, said Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja would leave after 11 years with the company. Tesla is facing increased competition from new electric vehicle entrants and was last month forced to cut U.S. prices for all its vehicles to offset lower green tax credits, a move that could impact its margins.  In a bid to save capital and produce cheaper Model 3 cars, Tesla has cut jobs and ended a customer referral program. Investors continue to worry whether Tesla, which has never posted an annual profit, would be able to ramp up production of Model 3 cars.  In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk estimated that Tesla would make around 500,000 Model 3s in 2019. He quickly clarified that the delivery target this year would be 400,000 cars.

12135,"  - Qualcomm Inc is urging U.S. trade regulators to reverse a judge’s ruling and ban the import of some Apple Inc iPhones in a long-running patent fight between the two companies.     Qualcomm is seeking the ban in hopes of dealing Apple a blow before the two begin a major trial in mid-April in San Diego over Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has sought to apply pressure to Apple with smaller legal challenges ahead of that trial and has won partial iPhone sales bans in China and Germany against Apple, forcing the iPhone maker to ship only phones with Qualcomm chips to some markets.  Any possible ban on iPhone imports to the United States could be short-lived because Apple last week for the first time disclosed that it has found a software fix to avoid infringing on one of Qualcomm’s patents. Apple asked regulators to give it as much as six months to prove that the fix works. Qualcomm brought a case against Apple at the U.S International Trade Commission in 2017 alleging that some iPhones violated Qualcomm patents to help smart phones run well without draining their batteries. Qualcomm asked for an import ban on some older iPhone models containing Intel Corp chips. In September, Thomas Pender, an administrative law judge at the ITC, found that Apple violated one of the patents in the case but declined to issue a ban. Pender reasoned that imposing a ban on Intel-chipped iPhones would hand Qualcomm an effective monopoly on the U.S. market for modem chips, which connect smart phones to wireless data networks.  Pender’s ruling said that preserving competition in the modem chip market was in the public interest as speedier 5G networks come online in the next few years.  Cases where the ITC finds patent violations but does not ban the import of products are rare. In December, the full ITC said it would review Pender’s decision and decide whether to uphold or reverse it by late March.  In filings that became public late last week ahead of the full commission’s decision, Apple for the first time said that it had developed a software fix to avoid running afoul of Qualcomm’s patent. Apple said it did not discover the fix until after the trial and that it implemented the new software “last fall.”  But Apple said that it would need six months to verify that the fix will satisfy regulators and to sell its existing inventory. Apple asked the full commission to delay any possible import ban by that long if the commission reverses the judge’s decisions.  In a filing late on Friday, Qualcomm argued that Apple’s disclosure of a fix undermined the reasoning in Pender’s decision and that the Intel-chipped phones should be banned while Apple deploys its fix. “Pender recommended against a remedy on the assumption that the (Qualcomm) patent would preclude Apple from using Intel as a supplier for many years and that no redesign was feasible,” Qualcomm wrote. “Apple now admits—more than seven months after the hearing—that the alleged harm is entirely avoidable.” ",Qualcomm urges U.S. regulators to reverse course and ban some iPhones,"February 20, 2019 /  2:17 AM ", qualcomm inc is urging u s trade regulators to reverse a judge s ruling and ban the import of some apple inc iphones in a long running patent fight between the two companies qualcomm is seeking the ban in hopes of dealing apple a blow before the two begin a major trial in mid april in san diego over qualcomm s patent licensing practices qualcomm has sought to apply pressure to apple with smaller legal challenges ahead of that trial and has won partial iphone sales bans in china and germany against apple forcing the iphone maker to ship only phones with qualcomm chips to some markets any possible ban on iphone imports to the united states could be short lived because apple last week for the first time disclosed that it has found a software fix to avoid infringing on one of qualcomm s patents apple asked regulators to give it as much as six months to prove that the fix works qualcomm brought a case against apple at the u s international trade commission in  alleging that some iphones violated qualcomm patents to help smart phones run well without draining their batteries qualcomm asked for an import ban on some older iphone models containing intel corp chips in september thomas pender an administrative law judge at the itc found that apple violated one of the patents in the case but declined to issue a ban pender reasoned that imposing a ban on intel chipped iphones would hand qualcomm an effective monopoly on the u s market for modem chips which connect smart phones to wireless data networks pender s ruling said that preserving competition in the modem chip market was in the public interest as speedier g networks come online in the next few years cases where the itc finds patent violations but does not ban the import of products are rare in december the full itc said it would review pender s decision and decide whether to uphold or reverse it by late march in filings that became public late last week ahead of the full commission s decision apple for the first time said that it had developed a software fix to avoid running afoul of qualcomm s patent apple said it did not discover the fix until after the trial and that it implemented the new software last fall but apple said that it would need six months to verify that the fix will satisfy regulators and to sell its existing inventory apple asked the full commission to delay any possible import ban by that long if the commission reverses the judge s decisions in a filing late on friday qualcomm argued that apple s disclosure of a fix undermined the reasoning in pender s decision and that the intel chipped phones should be banned while apple deploys its fix pender recommended against a remedy on the assumption that the qualcomm patent would preclude apple from using intel as a supplier for many years and that no redesign was feasible qualcomm wrote apple now admits more than seven months after the hearing that the alleged harm is entirely avoidable ,Boeing Crisis,0.413934588432312
12143,"LONDON   - The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has lost its bid to cancel  a lease on its office in London’s Canary Wharf financial district due to Brexit, in a landmark ruling that lawyers said could stave off similar such claims by other tenants. A judge in London on Wednesday ruled against the EMA, which had argued Britain’s forthcoming exit from the European Union was an unexpected event that “frustrated” its 25-year lease on a building in Canary Wharf. The EMA was hoping to escape an overall rent bill estimated at around 500 million pounds ($650 million) it is contracted to pay to landlord Canary Wharf Group, as the European agency shifts to Amsterdam due to Brexit. “The judge has ruled that Brexit does not amount to an event of frustration of the EMA’s lease and this result will be welcome news in the property and legal market, bringing greater certainty as to the impact of Brexit on contracts,” said Ben Hatton, a lawyer for Clifford Chance which represented Canary Wharf Group.      The EMA employs around 900 staff and is the biggest EU institution affected by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. It said it would take some time to carefully study the implications of the decision. While it respected the ruling of the High Court, the EMA reiterated that it had “no choice” but to leave London and believed that a preliminary reference to the Court of Justice of The European Union was still “the most appropriate way forward.” “The judgment confirms the possibility for EMA to sublet or assign the premises at 30, Churchill Place subject to the landlord’s consent,” it said in a statement. “The Agency continues to trust in the cooperation and goodwill of the Canary Wharf Group to find a mutually satisfactory solution before the end of March 2019.” The EMA’s move to a new home has sparked concerns among drugmakers, which fear potential disruption to medicines regulation. It will also require a significant redistribution of supervisory work, following the loss of UK experts from the regulatory system.

12166,"WASHINGTON   - Less than 24 hours after Donald Trump took office, his presidency started generating controversy.  Photographs showing that the crowd at Trump’s swearing-in was smaller than at Barack Obama’s first presidential inauguration in 2009 caused the first ruckus in his administration - but not the last.  Trump’s first year in office was colored by an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the Russian government to affect the election outcome, insults and threats of war with North Korea, and an effort to pass business-friendly legislation.  From the start, the White House took a combative approach, accusing the media of framing photographs of the inauguration in a way that appeared to understate the crowd size.  Press Secretary Sean Spicer argued that the images were not what they seemed and that crowds of historic size watched Trump take the oath of office. Protests would become a hallmark of Trump’s first year. On Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, hundreds of thousands of women jammed the streets of Washington to demonstrate opposition to Trump. A week after taking office, the Republican president signed an executive order to prevent citizens of seven predominately-Muslim countries from traveling to the United States. Known by critics as the “Muslim ban,” protesters quickly demonstrated at airports in opposition.   Trump would ignite protests again in August, when he was asked to respond to white nationalists marching in Charlottesville, Virginia, including one who drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman. The president argued there were bad people “on both sides.”  Following his remarks, business leaders resigned from Trump’s business councils and the panels were disbanded.     A defining feature of Trump’s first year in office was the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia during the election. Trump ignited a political firestorm in May when he fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into possible collusion by the Trump 2016 presidential campaign with Russia to influence the election outcome. Russia has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied any collusion. Soon afterward, the Justice Department named former FBI chief Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation. Paul Manafort, who had briefly served as Trump’s campaign manager, and his business associate Rick Gates were indicted by Mueller’s team in October, accused of illegally lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. A month later, Michael Flynn, who briefly served under Trump as U.S. national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations last December with Russia’s then-ambassador in Washington just weeks before Trump took office. Trump has also found himself embroiled in a war of words with North Korea over its missile program, exchanging insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. At home, Trump has struggled to enact sweeping changes he promised on the campaign trail.  He threatened to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but business lobbyists persuaded him to renegotiate it. Trump signed an executive order setting up talks on the trilateral trade deal, which has hit roadblocks with Mexico and Canada.     Trump’s team also failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare despite Republican control of the White House and Congress. It was not until December that Trump made headway on major legislative change as both chambers of Congress passed a sweeping tax overhaul.  The bill must be reconciled with a different version approved by the House of Representatives, but the Senate bill is expected to remain largely intact.

12244,"WASHINGTON   - Embattled Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore led his Democratic opponent by six percentage points in a CBS News poll released on Sunday, with most Alabama Republicans saying the allegations of sexual misconduct against him are false. Moore was leading Democrat Doug Jones 49 to 43 percent among voters likely to cast ballots in the Dec. 12 special election, CBS said. The contest was even among registered voters, it said. Republican lawmakers in Washington, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, have distanced themselves from Moore and called for him to step down from the race after he was accused by several women of sexual assault and misconduct when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations. But McConnell said on Sunday that if Moore is elected, the Senate will swear him in and then the Senate ethics committee would decide whether to investigate the allegations. “We’ll swear in whoever’s elected and see where we are at that point,” McConnell said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “We can’t stop him from being seated,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who was also interviewed on CBS. “If there was an (ethics) investigation and all six members of the committee said they believe he was a child molester, that would be a problem.” According to the CBS poll, 71 percent of Alabama Republicans say the allegations against Moore are false, and believe that Democrats and the media are behind the accusations. Another poll a day earlier had Jones barely ahead. The Washington Post-Schar School poll said Jones’ support among likely voters stood at 50 percent, versus Moore’s 47 percent. President Donald Trump originally backed Moore’s opponent in the Republican primary, Senator Luther Strange. But Trump has since defended Moore, noting Moore has denied allegations of sexual misconduct. The president says he does not want Moore’s Democratic opponent to win. Trump is slated to travel to a rally in Pensacola, Florida on Friday — a city just across the state line from Alabama — just days ahead of the Alabama election. The timing and location gives Trump an opportunity to express support for Moore. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate and are eager to maintain their advantage to advance Trump’s legislative agenda on taxes, healthcare and other priorities.

12247,"London   - Hopes for progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks and expectations of policy stimulus from central banks lifted world stocks to 2 1/2- month highs on Monday, though European gains were held back by concern over the outlook for auto makers.  MSCI’s All-Country World Index rose 0.4 percent after Japan’s Nikkei closed up 1.8 percent at its high for the year and MSCI’s index of Asian equities rose almost 1 percent. Shanghai blue chips surged 2.7 percent to their highest finish in more than six months.  Wall Street futures suggested that U.S. stocks would maintain last week’s gains when trading starts again on Tuesday, after Monday’s holiday.  The Dow and the Nasdaq had boasted eight consecutive weeks of gains on wagers the United States and China can resolve their protracted trade dispute. [.N]  Negotiations will resume this week, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying he may extend a March 1 deadline for a deal. Both sides reported progress at last week’s talks in Beijing. The mood was more subdued in Europe, where a pan-European equity index inched to a four-month high. Gains were capped by auto makers, who were hit by data showing Chinese car sales fell 16 percent in January, their seventh straight month of decline. The autos index, a bellwether for Europe’s economy, fell 0.4 percent. The industry was also weighed down by fears that a U.S. Commerce Department report would lead to tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. German shares slipped 0.1 percent lower. “The optimism on trade has been strong, but the underlying economic data has been a lot of weaker - so you have some push and pull factors,” said David Vickers, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments. Much focus was now on flash PMI data due out this week, he said.  “As the bounce-back from the December lows fades ... the fundamentals now reassert (themselves),” Vickers added.  Bad economic data has fueled expectations that the world’s most powerful central banks would deliver reflationary policies and provide support for markets.  The need for stimulus was highlighted by data showing a slide in Singapore exports and a big drop in foreign orders for Japanese machinery goods. Beijing is already taking action, with China’s banks making the most new loans on record in January in an attempt to revive sluggish investment. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting are due on Wednesday and should provide more guidance on the likelihood of rate increases this year. There is also talk the bank will keep a much larger balance sheet than previously planned. “Given the range of speakers since the January meeting who support `patience’, the Fed minutes should reiterate a dovish message overall,” analysts at TD Securities said in a note. The dollar was steady against the yen at 110.58, having backed away from a two-month top of 111.12. Sterling rose after three consecutive weeks of losses as investors waited for the outcome of Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union. British Prime Minister Theresa May plans to speak to every EU leader and the European Commission chief to seek changes to her EU withdrawal agreement, after another defeat by her own lawmakers last week. That left the dollar a shade lower at 96.731 against a basket of currencies and away from last week’s top of 97.368.

The jury awarded $100 million in punitive damages and the rest in compensatory damages after finding on Friday that the 1998 Ford Explorer did not meet Ford’s own safety guidelines and that Ford “acted wantonly” in designing the vehicle, according to a court document seen by Reuters and lawyers for plaintiff Travaris “Tre” Smith. Smith was riding in the SUV when its driver swerved to avoid an animal and the vehicle rolled over twice, attorneys at law firms Beasley Allen and Gamble, Gamble, Calame and Jones said in a statement. Ford said it plans to appeal. “Our sympathy goes out to Travaris Smith and his family. At the same time, we disagree with the jury’s conclusion in this case as well as with a series of rulings by the Alabama court that kept the jury from hearing critical evidence – and will appeal,” Ford spokeswoman Monique Brentley said in a statement to Reuters.   Ford said it has redesigned the Explorer since 1998.

12255,"MOSCOW   - Russian lender Gazprombank  has decided to freeze the accounts of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA and halted transactions with the firm to reduce the risk of the bank falling under U.S. sanctions, a Gazprombank source told Reuters on Sunday.  While many foreign firms have been cutting their exposure to PDVSA  since the sanctions were imposed, the fact that a lender closely aligned with the Russian state is following suit is significant because the Kremlin has been among Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s staunchest supporters. “PDVSA’s accounts are currently frozen. As you’ll understand, operations cannot be carried out,” the source said. Gazprombank did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment. PDVSA brandished the story as “fake news” on its Twitter account in capital red letters, but did not reply to a request for comment. Reuters reported this month that PDVSA was telling customers of its joint ventures to deposit oil sales proceeds in its Gazprombank accounts, according to sources and an internal document, in a move to try to sideline fresh U.S. sanctions on PDVSA.   Washington says the sanctions, imposed on Jan. 28, are aimed at blocking Maduro’s access to the country’s oil revenue after opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself interim president and received widespread Western support. Gazprombank is Russia’s third biggest lender by assets and includes among its shareholders Russian state gas company Gazprom.  The bank has held PDVSA accounts for several years. In 2013, PDVSA said it signed a deal with Gazprombank for $1 billion in financing for the Petrozamora company. The source said that Petrozamora accounts were frozen, too. Russian officials have said they stand by Maduro and have condemned opposition actions as a U.S.-inspired ploy to usurp power in Caracas. But Russian firms find themselves in a quandary, caught between a desire to endorse the Kremlin line and back Maduro, and the fear that by doing so they could expose themselves to secondary U.S. sanctions which would harm their businesses.

12262,"TOKYO   - A Nissan Motor governance committee will recommend the appointment of an external director as board chairman, a role distinct from company chairman, in a move to decentralize power at the top level, the Nikkei business daily reported on Sunday. Under Nissan’s current corporate charter, the position of board chair is automatically appointed to head the company board, the Nikkei said citing a source. Former Chairman Carlos Ghosn had filled both roles prior to his arrest in November for under-reporting his salary for eight years. The issue of Nissan’s chairmanship is now particularly important after the Japanese firm identified the concentration of power in one executive as one of the reasons Ghosn was able to carry out his alleged fiscal misconduct. Speculation has swirled about whether the newly appointed chairman of France’s Renault, Jean-Dominique Senard, would assume the chairmanship of the Japanese automaker. The Nikkei report comes after the governance committee said in a statement that the separation between operation and oversight was among topics discussed on Friday at the committee’s third meeting since it was formed in December after Ghosn’s arrest. The panel, comprising three Nissan external board directors and four third-party members, is scheduled to make recommendations to Nissan’s board in March on how to tighten lax governance and approval processes for matters including director compensation and chairman selection. A spokeswoman for the committee said it could not comment on potential recommendations before they are submitted to the Nissan board. Nissan did not immediately reply to emailed request for comment.

12264,"MOSCOW   - A Russian court on Saturday ordered Michael Calvey, the U.S. founder of one of Russia’s biggest private equity firms accused of fraud, to be kept in custody until April 13.  Calvey, a senior partner at Baring Vostok and among Russia’s most prominent investors, was detained on Thursday along with other executives after investigators accused them of embezzling 2.5 billion roubles ($37.73 million). Calvey denies the accusations. On Friday, Moscow’s Basmanny court ordered Calvey to be detained for 72 hours, but said the court would consider on Saturday if he should continue to be kept in custody.     Judge Artur Karpov extended the custody until April 13 after listening to the prosecutors, Calvey’s lawyers and Calvey himself at Saturday’s hearing. A U.S. embassy official was present.  Explaining his decision, the judge said that Calvey was accused of a “serious” crime and could try to flee.  Baring Vostok has over $3.7 billion of committed capital, according to its website. It has stakes in a number of Russian companies from online video services to internet and cable TV providers.  The company was also an investor in Yandex, now Russia’s biggest internet search engine, during its build-up. Yandex, also known as ‘Russia’s Google’, currently has a market capitalization of $10.3 billion.  Prosecutors said on Friday that Calvey and other executives at his fund were suspected of embezzling the money by persuading shareholders in a Russian bank to accept a stake in another firm at an inflated price. The alleged scam occurred in 2017 and involved Vostochny Bank, a mid-sized lender in which Baring Vostok has a controlling stake. It concerned the transfer of equity in Luxembourg-based International Financial Technology Group. Calvey, speaking calmly from a locked glass-walled space inside the court room on Saturday, repeated he disagreed with prosecutor’s asset valuation but said he was “ready to cooperate with the investigation”. “I’m not going to run,” he told the court via his lawyer who translated his speech into Russian.  The judge asked the prosecutors to bring a document from the Russian central bank to support their 2.5 billion rouble estimate of the alleged fraud.     Russian President Vladimir Putin was informed of the detention, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by RIA news agency late on Friday.  Lending support to Calvey by issuing written statements on Saturday were Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, and German Gref, head of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest state bank.  Calvey’s lawyer, Dmitry Kletochkin, told reporters after the decision that his client was innocent. Russian news agencies reported separately that Calvey would appeal the decision.

12276,"  - Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP has asked a proxy solicitor to probe the level of support among Bristol-Myers Squibb Co shareholders for the U.S. drug maker’s $74 billion deal to buy Celgene Corp, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The acquisition would be the biggest pharmaceuticals deal ever and would unite two major sellers of cancer drugs. Starboard has not decided whether it would oppose the Celgene deal, the sources said. The fund, run by Jeff Smith, may take no action, the sources added. Bristol-Myers shareholders will vote on the Celgene deal in April. While Celgene shares are pricing in some uncertainty over whether it will be completed, no major Bristol-Myers shareholder has voiced opposition publicly to the deal so far.  As of the end of trading on Friday, Bristol-Myers’ cash-and-stock offer valued Celgene at $101.67 per share. Celgene shares ended trading at $90.69. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Bristol-Myers and Starboard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Last week, Smith told CNBC in an interview that Starboard was “certainly interested in the story at Bristol-Myers.” He declined to say whether the firm had a position it the stock. “We evaluate those situations to determine whether we can have a positive impact. Bristol-Myers might fit that profile. It might not fit that profile. We haven’t made that decision,” Smith said. Starboard has a track record of opposing deals. It tried to block Virginia-based meat giant Smithfield Foods’ sale to Chinese company Shuanghui International in 2013, as well as aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins Inc’s acquisition of B/E Aerospace two years ago. Both deals were done. The presence of an activist investor can encourage potential deal interlopers to step in. However, no rival suitor has so far emerged publicly, either for Bristol-Myers or for Celgene. “Our impression from (Bristol-Myers) management’s long-term focus and biopharma executive commentary is that the probability of a third party buyer for Bristol-Myers before the Celgene vote in April is very low,” BMO analysts wrote in a research note on Thursday. “We do not believe an activist can change that.” Starboard is known for being an influential investor that often pushes for operational improvements. It scored a boardroom coup at Darden Restaurants where it ousted all board members five years ago.

12279,"  - Mattel Inc on Friday issued a disappointing 2019 forecast and said demand for its iconic Barbie doll was slowing, triggering an 18 percent drop in its shares, their worst day in nearly two decades. The forecast comes barely a week after the company said strong holiday sales of Barbie drove a surprise fourth-quarter profit, which sent its shares up 23 percent the following morning.  On Friday, the El Segundo, California-based toymaker said gross sales for 2019 would be flat on a constant-currency basis, with weakness in Thomas & Friends and American Girl offsetting comparatively stronger sales of Barbie and Hot Wheels. Even then, Barbie and Hot Wheels won't sell as much as they did in 2018, Chief Financial Offer Joe Euteneuer said in an investor presentatihere Both Mattel and rival Hasbro Inc have continued to be haunted by the collapse of Toys “R” Us as they have failed to find newer avenues to sell their toys. They also face pressure as more children shun traditional toys to play games on tablets and mobile phones. For the first quarter, Mattel said it expects lower gross sales, blaming the liquidation of the world’s biggest toy retailer and currency fluctuations. It also expects adjusted earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)of $350 million to $400 million for 2019, below estimates of $480.18 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Gross profit margins for 2019 are expected to come in the “low 40s” range, while analysts were expecting margins of 44.2 percent. Mattel has been aiming to cut at least $650 million in net costs by the end of 2019 through job cuts and other means. The company said it expects to keep reducing manufacturing costs, the benefit of which will be first seen in 2020.  The company’s shares closed at $13.82.

12339,"KUALA LUMPUR   - Roger Ng, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker caught up in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fraud scandal, will be allowed to return to the United States to face criminal charges against him there, a Malaysian court ruled on Friday. Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1, shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against him for allegedly laundering funds siphoned off from the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund. He left Goldman Sachs in 2014. Ng had agreed to waive extradition and would be sent to the United States pending an order from the Malaysian home affairs ministry, judge Edwin Paramjothy Michael Muniandy said in a Kuala Lumpur court on Friday. His lawyer, Tan Hock Chuan, asked for the order to be issued within 30 days. It must be issued within three months under Malaysian law. Ng had reached an agreement with the DoJ on bail and other terms, Tan said. “The respondent intends to defend the case on its merits in the court of the Eastern District of New York, the United States,” Tan told the court.   Marc Agnifilo, Ng’s New York-based lawyer, told Reuters ahead of the hearing that his client intended to plead not guilty when he appeared in a U.S. federal court. Ng is facing separate criminal charges in Malaysia but it is unclear how they will affect his transfer. The attorney-general’s office did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Tim Leissner, another Goldman Sachs official, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB. Leissner has pleaded guilty.  A Goldman Sachs spokesman, asked about Ng, said: “As we have said all along, we are outraged that any employee of the firm would undertake the actions detailed in the government’s charges.” Goldman Sachs is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the DoJ for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1Malaysia Development Berhad.

12351,"BENGALURU   - There is a one-in-four chance of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months, a scenario that should keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates next month, according to a Reuters poll of economists who now expect only one rate hike this year. Given a global economic slowdown and a dimming outlook for U.S. growth, economists said the Fed’s tightening cycle will likely draw to a halt before July. While financial markets have recovered from a deep sell-off late last year, the Feb 8-14 poll of over 110 economists showed a cut to the outlook for U.S. economic growth and the number of Fed rate hikes this year and next. “There is a lot of uncertainty and there are some good reasons to forecast a slowdown in 2019 as compared to in 2018,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “It certainly does makes sense for the Fed to take a pause on policy to see how things play out, because it is not impossible for the economy to slow down in 2019 between weakening global growth, tighter financial conditions and fading fiscal stimulus.” U.S. economic growth was forecast to slow and average 2.4 percent this year, a downgrade from January and the lowest since April last year. On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said trade talks with China were “going along very well” as the world’s two biggest economies try to resolve their tariff war ahead of a March 1 deadline. Reuters polls in recent months have repeatedly highlighted the U.S.-China trade war as the prominent downside risk for the American economy. Over half the economists who answered an extra question warned any further escalation in the trade war would bring the next U.S. recession. That compared to about 60 percent of economists in a July 2018 poll who said the trade war did not pose a significant risk.  (GRAPHIC: Reuters Poll - Impact of U.S.-China trade war - tmsnrt.rs/2EcK9th) The median probability of a recession in the next year rose to 25 percent from 20 percent in January. It held at 40 percent over the next two years, although the most pessimistic call was 75 percent. Expectations for Fed’s preferred inflation gauge were also slightly lowered from last month. All but a couple of economists polled forecast the Fed to keep rates on hold at 2.25-2.50 percent when it meets March 19-20, echoing Chairman Jerome Powell’s dovish tone. However, 51 of 101 economists said the Bank would take the fed funds rate to 2.50-2.75 percent next quarter, something over 75 percent of economists who answered an additional question said would not be a mistake. “The Fed is very focused on slowing growth. If anything, the bigger risk is if the Fed goes too late rather than too early,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Only one hike is expected from the U.S. central bank this year, compared with 2 hikes suggested by the U.S. central bank’s own “dot plot” projections and in January’s poll. After next quarter’s hike the Fed is expected to stay on the sidelines through to the end of 2021 at least. The outlook in Reuters polls for U.S. monetary policy tightening has been gradually cut since November, when the Fed was expected to raise rates three times in 2019. Twelve economists now expect the Fed will not hike at all this year compared to just four respondents in the previous poll, which lines up with the views of U.S. short-term interest rate future traders. “In light of some weaker economic data and comments from Fed Chair Powell, we did see the need to scale back our forecast on Fed tightening,” said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “Inflation pressures remain very subdued, a number of ‘so called’ cross-currents and headwinds are still important risks and until a lot of these issues are resolved, it is unlikely the Fed will raise interest rates. We see a lengthy delay right up to December and just one final rate increase this cycle.” ","Chance of a U.S. recession up, number of Fed rate hikes down: Reuters poll","February 15, 2019 /  12:11 AM ",bengaluru there is a one in four chance of a u s recession in the next  months a scenario that should keep the federal reserve from raising interest rates next month according to a  poll of economists who now expect only one rate hike this year given a global economic slowdown and a dimming outlook for u s growth economists said the fed s tightening cycle will likely draw to a halt before july while financial markets have recovered from a deep sell off late last year the feb   poll of over  economists showed a cut to the outlook for u s economic growth and the number of fed rate hikes this year and next there is a lot of uncertainty and there are some good reasons to forecast a slowdown in  as compared to in  said jim o sullivan chief u s economist at high frequency economics it certainly does makes sense for the fed to take a pause on policy to see how things play out because it is not impossible for the economy to slow down in  between weakening global growth tighter financial conditions and fading fiscal stimulus u s economic growth was forecast to slow and average   percent this year a downgrade from january and the lowest since april last year on wednesday u s president donald trump said trade talks with china were going along very well as the world s two biggest economies try to resolve their tariff war ahead of a march  deadline  polls in recent months have repeatedly highlighted the u s china trade war as the prominent downside risk for the american economy over half the economists who answered an extra question warned any further escalation in the trade war would bring the next u s recession that compared to about  percent of economists in a july  poll who said the trade war did not pose a significant risk graphic  poll impact of u s china trade war tmsnrt rs eckth the median probability of a recession in the next year rose to  percent from  percent in january it held at  percent over the next two years although the most pessimistic call was  percent expectations for fed s preferred inflation gauge were also slightly lowered from last month all but a couple of economists polled forecast the fed to keep rates on hold at     percent when it meets march   echoing chairman jerome powell s dovish tone however  of  economists said the bank would take the fed funds rate to     percent next quarter something over  percent of economists who answered an additional question said would not be a mistake the fed is very focused on slowing growth if anything the bigger risk is if the fed goes too late rather than too early said ethan harris head of global economics at bank of america merrill lynch only one hike is expected from the u s central bank this year compared with  hikes suggested by the u s central bank s own dot plot projections and in january s poll after next quarter s hike the fed is expected to stay on the sidelines through to the end of  at least the outlook in  polls for u s monetary policy tightening has been gradually cut since november when the fed was expected to raise rates three times in  twelve economists now expect the fed will not hike at all this year compared to just four respondents in the previous poll which lines up with the views of u s short term interest rate future traders in light of some weaker economic data and comments from fed chair powell we did see the need to scale back our forecast on fed tightening said sal guatieri senior economist at bmo capital markets inflation pressures remain very subdued a number of so called cross currents and headwinds are still important risks and until a lot of these issues are resolved it is unlikely the fed will raise interest rates we see a lengthy delay right up to december and just one final rate increase this cycle ,Boeing Crisis,0.2674091160297394
12352,"NEW YORK   - Prominent hedge fund managers sold out of Chinese technology stocks and dumped Silicon Valley majors such as Apple Inc and Facebook Inc while global stock markets cratered during the fourth quarter, according to securities filings released on Thursday. Activist hedge fund Jana Partners sold out of its position in major Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and reduced its stake in Apple by approximately 175,000 shares, slicing its position in the company by 63 percent. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc shrank its Apple stake to 249.6 million shares from 252.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Buffett’s assistant Debbie Bosanek said in an email to Reuters: “One of the managers other than Warren had a position in Apple and sold part of it in order to make an unrelated purchase. None of the shares under Warren’s direction have ever been sold.” Soros Fund Management and David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management sold out of their stakes in Apple. Third Point LLC sold all of its shares of Alibaba and in streaming company Netflix Inc, while reducing its stake in payments company Visa Inc by approximately 200,000 shares, or about 11 percent of its prior position.  Omega Advisors, run by billionaire Leon Cooperman, sold all of its approximately 88,000 shares of Facebook and reduced its stake in Google-parent Alphabet Inc by approximately a third by selling approximately 47,600 shares. The moves came during a volatile fourth quarter in which fears of slowing economic growth pushed the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index to the brink of a bear market while stock indexes in China and Germany finished the year down 20 percent or more.  Since then, shares have rebounded sharply on a broad global rally powered by hopes of a new trade deal between the United States and China and the Federal Reserve’s decision to slow its pace of U.S. interest rate hikes.  Alibaba is up nearly 23 percent since the start of January, while Netflix is up nearly 34 percent over the same time. Those gains helped power the average hedge fund in January to the largest monthly gain since September 2010, according to Hedge Fund Research. “While investor optimism dominated in January, significant macroeconomic uncertainty still exists, increasing the likelihood that recent trends toward elevated realized volatility will remain and continue to drive industry performance,” said Kenneth J. Heinz, president of HFR. Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings in 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are one of the few public ways of tracking what hedge fund managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Along with the sell-off among technology stocks, hedge fund managers added new positions in companies ranging from Mastercard Inc to Salesforce.Com Inc. Jana Partners added a new position in Salesforce.com by buying approximately 115,000 shares, while Third Point increased its stake in the company by 135 percent by adding another 675,000 shares. Shares of the company are up 16.6 percent since the start of the year.  Tiger Global added a new position in information technology infrastructure management company Solarwinds Corp. Shares of the $5.7 billion market cap company are up 35 percent for the year. Omega Advisors, meanwhile, doubled its stake in CVS Health Corp by buying approximately 401,000 shares. Shares of the company are up 3.7 percent for the year to date.

12394,"LONDON   - HSBC has reduced the cost of settling foreign exchange trades by a quarter through its blockchain-based system, an executive overseeing the project told Reuters, offering a glimpse of the savings the technology could offer banks. The bank processes between 3,500 and 5,000 trades a day on its “FX Everywhere” system, settling trades worth $350 billion, Mark Williamson, chief operating officer of FX cash trading and risk management, told Reuters.   The HSBC platform is a rare example of blockchain technology being put to practical use by a major bank. Last month the London-based lender said it had processed FX trades worth $250 billion on the platform since February last year. The fresh details of the scale of the HSBC project suggest that the potential of blockchain to make significant cost savings in the financial services industry - long touted by its proponents of the technology - is being realized.   “We going at a pace now,” Williamson said. “We’re able to demonstrate that this is not a one-off proof of concept or just one or two trades.”   HSBC would not give data on overall forex trades settled by traditional processes, saying only that those settled on the platform represented a “small” proportion. Supporters say blockchain - a shared database that can securely process and settle transactions without the need for third-party checks - could transform industries from finance to real estate by obviating cumbersome and inefficient processes.   That hype, though, has rarely been backed up by examples of large companies moving beyond tests on a limited scale.  Financial institutions have so far taken a cautious approach with the technology originally conceived to underpin of the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Many are concerned by uncertainty over security, regulation and the impact on existing systems.  HSBC coordinates payments across its Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific trading hubs on the platform, a type of blockchain known as a “shared permissioned ledger”, which allows approved multiple parties to amend and update in real time.  Williamson said that HSBC settles “billions of dollars” worth of payments every day, helping the bank to manage risk by allowing it to see real-time exposure across multiple balance sheets.

12435,"  - American International Group Inc on Wednesday reported a quarterly loss as the insurer was hit with catastrophe losses and made a lower return on investments in a volatile market.  Excluding realized investment gains and losses and some other items, AIG posted a loss of $559 million, or 63 cents per share, for the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with income of $526 million, or 57 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  On that basis, Wall Street analysts expected income of 42 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. AIG shares fell 3 percent to $42.80 in after hours trading. The company’s general insurance unit reported an underwriting loss of $1.1 billion, compared with a loss of $846 million a year ago, largely due to Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires.  Still, AIG said its general insurance accident year combined ratio - which excludes changes from losses incurred in past years - was 98.8 for the quarter, compared with 100.2 a year ago. A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. The accident year ratio is a measurement that AIG Chief Executive Brian Duperreault has cited as the best gauge of the unit’s long-term profitability. The number excludes catastrophe claims and reserve charges. Duperreault, who took the helm at AIG in May 2017, has pledged to turn the company around. His most critical task is a return to profitable underwriting, something that AIG, one of the largest U.S. insurers, has not achieved since 2007.  The combined ratio in AIG’s commercial insurance unit, which includes losses for catastrophes, was 115 compared to 113 in the year ago quarter. In December, Duperreault said that AIG expected to enter 2019 “with a slight underwriting profit” in its general insurance unit. That would be just a waypoint on a path to a double-digit return on equity, a process that could take up to three years, he said.  AIG remains on track to meet those objectives, Duperreault said in a statement on Wednesday. “It’s something that he’s been very vocal about and he really needs to deliver,” said James Breece, a portfolio manager and equity analyst for Spears Abacus Advisors LLC. The New York-based investment firm advises the Beehive Fund, which owned 150,250 shares of AIG as of Sept. 30. The 2018 fourth quarter was challenging for insurers, given the tumultuous financial markets. AIG’s shares plunged 26 percent, closing out the year at $39.41, while the S&P 500 Multi-line Insurance Index tanked by 19.5 percent, its biggest drop since 2012.  Insurance investors fretted about everything from the impact of mass catastrophes, such as California’s wildfires, on insurers’ bottom lines to how the market mayhem affected life insurers’ investment portfolios. The broader S&P 500, in comparison, fell 13.7 percent.  AIG’s life and retirement unit reported adjusted pre-tax income of $623 million, down 20 percent from $782 in the year-ago quarter. AIG’s total net investment income fell to $2.8 billion, in the quarter, from $3.5 billion, a year ago, reflecting a significant impact from market performance, the company said. The insurer added $365 million to its reserves in the quarter, following the completion of a review by AIG’s chief actuary, Mark Lyons, who was also named chief financial officer in December. AIG’s decision to boost funds for paying future claims was driven largely by insurance policies the company issued in 2016 and earlier, the company said.

12457,"WARSAW   - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence praised Poland on Wednesday for its commitment to “protecting the telecoms sector from China”, as part of a concerted push by the United States to convince its allies to exclude tech giant Huawei from telecoms projects. Fueled by concerns that Huawei products could be used by China for espionage, Pence and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stressed the dangers of collaborating with the Chinese firm during appearances in Poland and central European neighbors this week. Huawei has repeatedly denied that its products could be used for espionage. “We must continue to work so that all investment review mechanisms protect critical security and economic infrastructure going forward,” Pence said during a joint press conference in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda.  In January, Poland arrested a Chinese employee of Huawei and a former Polish security official on spying allegations. Poland’s government is also considering excluding Huawei equipment from its future 5G network, sources told Reuters. “The recent action your government has taken against a Huawei executive and a Polish national accused of cooperating with him demonstrate your government’s commitment to ensure our telecommunications sector is not compromised in a way that threatens our national security,” Pence said. The comments came as Poland seeks to convince the United States to increase its military presence in the country. The number of U.S. troops in Poland is capped at 4,500 but it fluctuates as formations rotate. Poland, alarmed by Russia’s assertiveness on NATO’s eastern flank, has lobbied hard for the stationing of NATO troops on its soil, especially since Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Duda told U.S. President Donald Trump in September on a trip to Washington that he would be willing to commit more than $2 billion to help facilitate the building of a permanent U.S. base on Polish soil. Austria’s technology ministry and Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel both said on Wednesday that an EU-wide agreement was needed on whether Huawei should be allowed to participate in building 5G networks in the bloc. The European Commission is considering a de facto ban on Huawei’s 5G network equipment due to security concerns.  But some European countries have been reluctant to follow U.S. demands straightaway, and Huawei is determined to stay in the race for lucrative infrastructure projects. The company is ready to face any extra security measures required to compete to develop next-generation 5G networks in central and eastern Europe, Andy Purdy, chief security officer at Huawei Technologies USA told Reuters on Wednesday. “The U.S. government is very persistent, very determined and very forceful in communicating the messages about Huawei,” Purdy said in an interview. He also said that Huawei is ready to work with the Polish government on additional steps to build trust. The company has not as yet seen a slowdown in its business in Poland, the company’s senior standards manager in Europe said on Wednesday. “We don’t see slowdown in sales on Huawei equipment here ... but if the situation continues, at some point it will impact our business as well,” Georg Mayer told a news conference in Warsaw.

12466,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON   - A battle between the White House and Democrats over warring appointments to head up the top U.S. regulator for consumer finance is likely headed for the courts, opening any interim actions by the agency to legal challenges, lawyers said on Saturday. Richard Cordray, a Democrat, stepped down on Friday as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was created after the financial crisis to protect consumers from abusive lending practices, and he named staffer Leandra English as acting director. A few hours later, President Donald Trump named someone else to lead the agency: Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director and one of the CFPB’s fiercest critics.  The CFPB, the brainchild of Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat and a liberal firebrand, has long been in the crosshairs of Republicans, who say it has had too much unchecked power. On Saturday, Trump tweeted that the CFPB - which has imposed steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies for predatory lending practices - had “devastated” financial institutions.  Democrats and Republicans agree that Trump may nominate a permanent CFPB chief, but they disagree over who may lead the agency in the interim, a dispute which could drag on for months until the Senate confirms a permanent Trump appointment. The dispute is over which federal law prevails in naming an interim director. According to Democrats, the relevant law is the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the CFPB, which stipulates that the agency’s deputy director is to take over in the short term.  Cordray, in announcing his resignation on Friday, said he had named English as deputy director and that she would become the acting director. But administration officials say the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives the president the power to temporarily fill agency positions, except for those with multi-member boards - an exemption they said did not apply to the CFPB. On Saturday evening, the Justice Department said in a memo that the White House was right to name a new CFPB director. The Dodd-Frank language about changing CFPB directors is “unusual” but the White House may name an interim chief, according to the memo. Such advice from the Justice Department is open to legal challenge. Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group for law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, said the issue will likely have to be decided in the courts. In the meantime, he said, “This enormous cloud of uncertainty” will hang over the CFPB. Kaplinsky said he believes that Dodd-Frank provides for the deputy director to take charge during the short-term, but Congress did not explicitly list the resignation of the director as a situation where the deputy would step up. “I think Trump wins, but unfortunately it is going to take a while,” Kaplinsky said. Quyen Truong, a partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until early 2016, said the industry should expect CFPB staff to continue their work, but that the “agency’s actions during this period almost certainly will be subject to legal challenge.” Despite the legal uncertainty, Mulvaney is expected to “show up Monday and he will go into the office and start working,” a senior administration official said on Saturday. White House officials said English was also expected to turn up on Monday and serve as Mulvaney’s deputy. English could not be reached for comment.  Cordray is the only person to have led the young agency, making this the first time that succession of the director has been tested. Administration officials said the appointment of Mulvaney was “routine” and that the White House had sought guidance from the Justice Department before Friday’s announcement.  “This needs to be decided in the courts,” Warren said in a tweet on Saturday.  Industry critics said the succession battle underlined that the agency lacks proper Congressional oversight.  “The CFPB’s current governing structure is a dictatorship, period,” Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for retail banking, said in a statement. Democrats and consumer advocates said it was unfair and inappropriate to put Mulvaney - who once described the CFPB as a “joke” - in charge. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee, said Mulvaney would have too much power, as the CFPB director also sits on the boards of two other financial regulatory agencies. “The White House would have an alarming degree of direct control over financial regulation, supervision, and enforcement,” Waters said in a statement.

12472,"PARIS   - Airbus is nearing a decision to ax production of the world’s largest airliner amid a downward revision in demand from the Gulf and is likely to give an update with its full-year earnings on Feb. 14, industry sources and analysts said. The move to shut production of the A380 superjumbo earlier than expected coincides with a review of purchases of very large aircraft by the plane’s biggest customer, Emirates, which has a fleet of 109 superjumbos and 53 left on order. Due to weaker demand, the Dubai carrier is expected to scale down these purchases and place greater focus on smaller models in a shake-up that could have implications for both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing, industry sources said. Airbus and Emirates declined to comment. The fate of the A380 superjumbo has been in doubt since a vital order from Emirates foundered over inconclusive engine talks, forcing the two sides to weigh an alternative that would trigger a premature halt to A380 production. Emirates is by the largest customer for the 544-seat aircraft and analysts say production is unsustainable beyond 2020 without the new Emirates order. Under the proposed reshuffle, first reported by Reuters, Airbus hopes to broker a deal that would see Emirates switch part of its order to smaller models like the A350 or A330, while eking out a few last-minute A380 orders from British Airways. The timing of any final announcement may be driven by the outcome of those talks, but Airbus will be under pressure to provide some clarity on its plans in time for Thursday’s earnings following mounting speculation over the plane’s future. “The A380 is the elephant in the hangar; it will be impossible to avoid saying something on the subject,” said Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa. The A380 is already on life support due to weak sales.  Any decision to pull the plug on the iconic European double-decker after just 12 years in service must be approved by the Airbus board, which meets on Wednesday.  The prospect of shutting output comes at an awkward moment for Airbus as rival Boeing celebrates the 50th anniversary of its 747 jumbo - the jet that revolutionized long-haul travel and which Europe’s A380 was designed to squeeze out of the market. The 747 survives mainly as a freighter and VIP transport, whereas a planned cargo version of the A380 has already been axed due to lack of interest and the sole VIP version of the A380 sold to a Saudi prince was canceled several years ago. That left the A380 reliant solely on passenger demand at a time when advances in twin-engined jets like the Boeing 777 and A350 made four-engined models like the A380 less popular.

12510,"  - Amazon.com Inc and General Motors Co are in talks to invest in Rivian Automotive LLC in a deal that would value the U.S. electric pickup truck manufacturer at between $1 billion and $2 billion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The deal would give Amazon and GM minority stakes in Rivian, the sources said. It would be a major boost for the Plymouth, Michigan-based startup, which aspires to be the first carmaker to the U.S. consumer market with an electric pickup. If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced as early as this month, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. There is always a chance that deal talks fall through, the sources cautioned. “We admire Rivian’s contribution to a future of zero emissions and an all-electric future,” GM said in an emailed statement, declining to specifically comment on any talks with Rivian. Amazon and Rivian declined comment. The Rivian deal would come as its much larger electric car manufacturing rival, Tesla Inc, struggles to stabilize production and deliver consistent profits as it rolls out its flagship Model 3 sedan. Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors last August that an electric pickup is “probably my personal favorite for the next product” from the company, though he has spoken only in general about a potential launch, saying that it would happen “right after” Tesla’s Model Y, which the company has targeted to start production in 2020. Rivian intends to begin selling its R1T, the pickup it  debuted in November, in the fall of 2020. The company was founded in 2009 by CEO R.J. Scaringe.  Scaringe has described the Rivian vehicle’s platform as a “skateboard” that packages the drive units, battery pack, suspension system, brakes and cooling system all below wheel height to allow for more storage space and greater stability due to a lower center of gravity.  He has also said the company plans to partner with outside firms to develop advanced self-driving technology, rather than try to do so on its own. Big automakers, including GM, have not jumped into the market for electric pickups thus far. GM CEO Mary Barra has said it has given a “tiny bit” of thought to developing all-electric pickups. The No. 1 U.S. automaker is counting on profit from sales of conventional large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America to fund its electrification push. GM said last November it was doubling resources allocated to developing electric and self-driving vehicles, as part of a significant restructuring that included ending production at five North American plants. GM last month announced a strategy to make its luxury Cadillac its lead electric vehicle brand, revealing it would be the first vehicle built on the Detroit automaker’s “BEV3” platform to challenge Tesla. GM has said one of the first fully electric Cadillac models using the new platform would hit the market around 2022. Amazon has also invested in self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation Inc, in a $530 million funding round announced last week. The world’s largest online retailer has steadily increased its logistics footprint, building warehouses around the world and inking deals with Mercedes as well as cargo airlines to help with delivery.

12566,"YOKOHAMA, Japan   - Nissan Motor warned its annual profit will plumb six-year lows on waning global sales, underlining the challenges it faces as it also grapples with the fallout from the shocking arrest and ouster of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn. The Japanese automaker, in its first results since Ghosn was detained in November, unveiled an $84 million charge linked to deferred compensation for the executive who has been indicted for under-reporting his salary at Nissan over 2010-2018.  The scandal has roiled global auto markets and created tensions between Nissan and its automaking partner France’s Renault, raising concerns about the future of the companies that Ghosn wanted to integrate. The dour outlook indicates an urgent need for Nissan and Renault to strengthen their partnership, but ties have been strained since the Japanese automaker moved first to remove Ghosn as chairman after his Nov. 19 arrest in Tokyo.  Nissan wants to stabilize alliance operations, said CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who is scheduled to meet newly appointed Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard this week in Japan as they look at ways to cement their partnership. Ahead of that meeting, the Nissan CEO said he wanted both companies to better leverage their scale to be more competitive and efficient in areas including manufacturing and procurement, while respecting each others’ autonomy.  “In the past few years there’s been a lot of talk about ‘convergence’ of the two companies’ operations,” Saikawa said, referring to one of Ghosn’s key aims for the alliance. “While stabilizing our operations, we need to re-examine whether investments (towards convergence) are the most efficient.” This could mean a reassessment of the alliance’s growth targets through 2022, Saikawa said at a briefing on Tuesday. Nissan, which is almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales, remains junior in their shareholding structure. Renault holds 43.4 percent of Nissan, whereas Nissan has just a 15-percent non-voting stake in Renault. Japan’s second-biggest automaker projected an operating profit of 450 billion yen ($4 billion) for the year to March, down 22 percent from the previous year and 17 percent below an earlier forecast, hurt by a slowdown in global sales.  This would be Nissan’s lowest operating profit since 2013. (For an interactive chart on Nissan's operating profit, vehicle sales, click on tmsnrt.rs/2POSji4)     Nissan cut its annual global retail vehicle sales view by 5.5 percent and projected weaker sales in China, its biggest market, and the United States.  Saikawa said Nissan will avoid trying to meet sales targets by using discounts, a strategy which has hurt its profitability in North America, the world’s No. 2 auto market. “We were only able to meet 60 percent to 70 percent of our (global) target for the year to the third quarter,” Saikawa said. “If we are not careful about how we make up for that shortfall in the fourth quarter we could find ourselves in similar situations we’ve seen in the past.” “So we want to raise our performance by improving the quality of sales,” he added. Nissan expects to sell 5.6 million vehicles worldwide in the year to March, versus a previous target for 5.93 million.  While it still sees sales growing in China, the world’s top auto market, it trimmed its forecast for the country to 1.56 million units from 1.70 million units. In the United States, it now sees sales tumbling 8.6 percent on the year to 1.46 million units, from 1.55 million last year.  (For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' vehicle sales in the U.S., China, see tmsnrt.rs/2RjnBuA) Nissan and its domestic rivals, including Toyota Motor Corp, have struggled with sluggish sales and falling profit in North America. Their margins have been squeezed as they resorted to steep discounts to drive up demand in a competitive U.S. market where sales have plateaued near record highs. While it has been able to repair some of its profits in North America as inventory reduction of older models enabled it to dial back on heavy U.S. discounting, falling demand will test Nissan’s ability to be disciplined with its incentives.      (For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' annual global vehicle sales, see tmsnrt.rs/2RnFOr2) The bleak outlook comes as Nissan also grapples with the Ghosn scandal and the resulting scrutiny of its corporate governance.   Nissan said it had recognized around 9 billion yen ($84 million) in additional expenses linked to payments to Ghosn. This announcement comes after it was indicted alongside Ghosn with failing to disclose the compensation.  While it is possible that a Japanese court could order Nissan to pay Ghosn that amount, Saikawa said it was “unlikely” the expense would be realized. This provision refers roughly to the amount Ghosn has been charged of under-reporting in his 2010-2018 salary at Nissan. Ghosn has denied all charges against him.

12578,"HELSINKI   - Finnish mobile game maker Supercell reported a 26 percent drop in 2018 core profit on Tuesday due to falling revenue for its ageing hit games Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. Supercell, founded in 2010 and valued in 2016 at around $10 billion, grew for years on the back of the success of its few hit games. Its biggest hit, Clash of Clans - the world’s fourth-largest game in 2018 - was launched in 2012. The Helsinki-based firm, majority owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to 537 million euros ($605.15 million) from 729 million a year earlier. Company revenue dropped 24 percent to 1.37 billion euros from 1.8 billion a year ago. Chief Executive Ilkka Paananen said the company had high hopes for its fifth game, Brawl Stars, which it launched globally mid-December. The game has topped the charts in more than 50 countries, including Japan and Korea. “Throughout history Asian markets have been difficult to conquer for Western game developers,” Paananen said. The bulk of its 2018 profit came from Supercell’s four games - Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Boom Beach and Hay Day - which have each generated more than $1 billion in revenue from in-game purchases since their launch. The company did not disclose sales figures for its titles, but Paananen said its biggest titles, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale, saw the deepest declines. Supercell slipped last year to the No 7 spot in the global mobile game publisher rankings, based on revenue collected on Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play stores, according to research company App Annie. It was ranked No 2 in 2016. Supercell’s Clash of Clans was the fourth most widely played game in 2018 - according to App Annie data - after Happy Elements’ Anipop, Tencent’s Honour of Kings and Activision Blizzard’s Candy Crush Saga. Supercell, which has kept its operational independence and Helsinki headquarters, first sold a stake to Japan’s Softbank in 2013. Tencent bought Softbank’s stake in 2016 for $8.6 billion and has increased its shareholding to 88 percent.

12623,"ZURICH   - Airopack’s (AIRN.S) recapitalization plan collapsed as lenders including Apollo Global Management (APO.N) demanded repayment following the discovery of “inadequate sales and accounting practices”, the Swiss aerosol packaging maker said on Monday. Shares in the company, which makes plastic aerosol dispensers for Procter & Gamble’s (PG.N) Gillette shaving cream, fell as much as 60 percent and have lost almost all their value since hitting 13.5 Swiss francs ($13.46) three years ago. Airopack, whose net loss topped 40 million euros ($45.3 million) in 2017, has been seeking to slash debt via a recapitalization plan announced on Nov. 30.  Its largest lender, U.S.-based private equity firm Apollo (APO.N), was to have received a controlling share in the deal. But developments since then, including the discovery of what Airopack described as “excessively overstated” sales forecasts by former managers, now make the recapitalization plan “completely unachievable”.  Airopack’s lenders, including Apollo and a major bank, on Saturday demanded repayment of loans in excess of $100 million. Airopack said it would seek a short period of debt relief with Swiss courts in order to gain breathing room, negotiate with lenders and seek to avoid bankruptcy proceedings. An Airopack spokeswoman said a court in Zug, near the company’s headquarters in Baar, would consider the request. There was no projected deadline for a decision.  The company said its major lenders did agree to extend a 15 million euro loan, with a possibility of 10 million more, to keep operating units afloat in the short- and mid-term.  An Apollo spokesman in London did not immediately comment. Problems intensified as Airopack merged its manufacturing at a new plant in 2017, taking on more and more debt from Apollo to help keep things running. Production of aerosols trailed expectations, however, as it tripled employees to 180 last year.  Financing costs escalated and losses ballooned, requiring the recapitalization deal that collapsed amid rising concerns over accounting practices. Airopack said that in addition to inflated sales forecasts, a review started by PriceWaterhouseCoopers in December found “certain inadequate sales and accounting practices that will lead to corrections in the accounting and caused a severe lack of cost-control in the months prior to the announced recapitalization plan”. The board “is preparing the adequate procedural steps against former management and will coordinate such steps with the court-appointed administrator”, the company said.  It did not provide contact details for Airopack co-founder Quint Kelders, who resigned as CEO last year as the recapitalization plan was announced. He could not immediately be reached for comment via email and LinkedIn.  Kelders’s family owns 30 percent of Airopack, while Apollo controls about 23 percent of shares.

12715,"NEW YORK   - Stocks pulled back sharply around the world on Thursday on fears of a global growth slowdown spreading to Europe and worry about the chances for a resolution of U.S.-China trade tensions anytime soon, while the U.S. dollar strengthened for a sixth session against a basket of currencies. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.98 percent as it receded from two-month highs reached earlier in the week. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.49 percent after disappointing corporate updates from Publicis and other companies, while Wall Street’s S&P 500 benchmark index dropped 0.9 percent. The European Commission sharply cut its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next on expectations the bloc’s largest countries will be held back by global trade tensions and domestic challenges. Germany’s DAX stock index tumbled 2.7 percent as industrial output in  Europe’s biggest economy unexpectedly fell in December for the fourth consecutive month. Safe-haven assets gained, including Japan’s yen and gold. “Even though we are in the midst of earnings season, the macro environment is really impacting global risk sentiment,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management in Chicago.  “Fears of a more dramatic slowdown in Europe are being joined with the fears around a slowdown in China. And the broad slowdown in global trade is having a direct impact on some of these economies and some of the results.” Heightened concerns about U.S.-China trade relations also rattled investors after President Donald Trump said he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline to achieve a trade deal. “Any concern that the stalemate won’t be overcome by China and the U.S. is going to create negative sentiment for the markets just because trade is the single largest overhang,” said Mike Loewengart, vice-president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial in New York. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 220.77 points, or 0.87 percent, to 25,169.53, the S&P 500 lost 25.56 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,706.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 86.93 points, or 1.18 percent, to 7,288.35.

12734,"WASHINGTON   - The Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that repealing the Obamacare individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured by 13 million by 2027 and reduce the federal budget deficit less than initially forecast. The CBO, the nonpartisan budget-scoring agency, said that eliminating the Obamacare mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine would lower the deficit by $338 billion over the next decade, not $416 billion as it estimated in December. The agency found that health insurance premiums would rise by about 10 percent in most years over the next decade in the individual market created by the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. It noted that markets in most areas of the country would remain stable. President Donald Trump and some Republicans favor including a repeal of the mandate in tax overhaul legislation. But lawmakers, Republican aides and lobbyists have said it would be difficult to include a repeal in a tax effort complicated by intraparty differences and intense business lobbying. The U.S. House of Representatives unveiled its tax plan last week, and the Senate’s plan is expected to be released on Thursday. The individual mandate is a central tenet of Obamacare that health policy experts and proponents say is essential to making the law work. It compels young and healthy people to join health insurance markets and help lower premiums by offsetting the costs of sicker patients. Americans must note on their tax returns whether they have health coverage. Yet it has proved to be among the most controversial portions of the law as Republicans, who say Obamacare is too expensive and an example of government overreach, argue that the federal government should not be able to require people to buy health insurance if they do not want it. The CBO said in its December report that the individual mandate increases the federal deficit by encouraging people to buy subsidized coverage, either through Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, employer-provided plans, or through the Obamacare individual health insurance market.  Eliminating the mandate would lower the deficit by reducing federal spending on subsidized health insurance coverage, it said.

12792,"TOKYO   - Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp announced a $5.5 billion share buyback on Wednesday as it reported a 60 percent increase in quarterly operating profit buoyed by rising valuations for its technology investments. Funded by proceeds from the bumper IPO of its domestic telco, founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said the buyback - its largest ever - was driven by what he sees as a chronic undervaluation of SoftBank’s shares.  The tech and telecoms conglomerate said from Thursday it would repurchase 112 million shares worth 600 billion yen in the next 11 months, or about 10.3 percent of its total outstanding shares, excluding treasury stock.  The company raised 2.35 trillion yen in December by listing about a third of the shares in SoftBank Corp, which on Tuesday reported a 24 percent jump in quarterly operating profit. Son said about one third of the IPO proceeds will be used for the buyback, one third to repay debt and the remainder on its investing activities. SoftBank Group shares closed up 0.6 percent at 1,322 yen before the announcement. “I think they’re too cheap,” Son told an earnings briefing.    SoftBank Group’s operating profit in the October-December quarter rose to 438.3 billion yen ($3.99 billion) from 274 billion yen a year earlier, which was reported under previous accounting standards. The company’s profits are increasingly affected by the valuations of its technology investments through its own activities and its Saudi-backed Vision Fund, which launched last year with over $90 billion in capital.  Income from the Vision Fund and the smaller Delta Fund more than tripled from a year ago. But the funds’ profit more than halved from the previous quarter, underscoring the volatility of Son’s investment strategy.  At the end of the October-December period, which saw weakness in technology stocks and fears of a China slowdown, the Vision Fund had invested $45.5 billion in 49 firms, up from $28 billion in 38 firms as of end-September. Those investments - including ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies, shared workspace provider WeWork Cos, and chip designer ARM - are valued at $55.3 billion, it said. Among SoftBank’s stakes in listed companies, weak demand for gaming chips in China helped to push down the share price of U.S. chipmaker Nvidia by 50 percent from its October peak.    SoftBank Group said it had offset most of the fall in Nvidia’s share price through derivatives contracts and sold its stake in January.  Among the stakes taken by Vision Fund in the quarter included e-commerce firms like South Korea’s Coupang and Indonesia’s Tokopedia, and media and advertising companies such as Chinese startup Bytedance. But China’s slowing growth and its trade war with the United States are affecting valuations of unlisted technology firms that account for many of SoftBank’s portfolio companies. “The exact manner in which SoftBank determines the value of its investments remains murky,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Chris Lane said in a note ahead of the earnings announcement.  “Without a ‘down round’ we doubt any of the unlisted investment will be revalued,” Lane said, referring to when a company’s valuation is reduced in a subsequent financing round.     Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing, which is backed by SoftBank Group, has traded at prices implying a valuation of $40-44 billion. That compared to a valuation exceeding $65 billion after its 2018 funding round. WeWork’s higher valuation is based on a further investment by SoftBank, which has injected more than $10 billion into the loss-making office-sharing firm now valued at $47 billion. As the valuations of the technology bets increase, investors are looking at SoftBank’s exit strategy.  A successful IPO by Uber, which is expected this year, will bolster Vision Fund’s strategy and serve as a model for other portfolio companies, analysts say. SoftBank’s shares have risen 16 percent this year but are still 26 percent below their September peak, having tumbled on concerns about financial ties to Saudi Arabia following the murder of a Saudi journalist.  SoftBank did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors.

Siemens and Alstom’s plan to create a European rail champion collapsed on Wednesday after EU anti-trust regulators rejected the deal, saying that it would have hurt competition and led to higher prices for consumers. “We do respect the decision and the authority of the European Commission, but we are convinced that we must think about and decide on future changes of European competition rules,” Altmaier told reporters in Berlin. “I’ve agreed with my French colleague Bruno Le Maire that we will prepare a joint Franco-German initiative that is aimed at getting an up-to-date adjustment of European competition law.” Altmaier said he did not want to elaborate on competition issues in the specific case of Siemens and Alstom just hours after the European Commission’s decision on the case, but he hinted that he would like to see a second push for the merger. “I’ve been in contact for many weeks now with my French colleague, with the people in charge at the Commission as well as with the companies, and we will continue this work, and I am convinced that there is still a chance for a good and sustainable solution,” Altmaier said. “We still think it’s right for Europe to join forces, and we think it’s right that the two big companies work together in the field of rail technology and signaling technology in the railway sector, because only then are they will be big and strong enough to compete with other competitors worldwide,” Altmaier said.

12808,"BRUSSELS   - The United States sees the European Union as its top priority in a global effort to convince allies not to buy Huawei equipment for next-generation mobile networks, a U.S. State Department Official said on Tuesday. After meetings with the European Commission and the Belgian government in Brussels, U.S. officials are set to take a message to other European capitals that the world’s biggest telecommunications gear maker poses a security risk, said the official, who declined to be named.  “We are saying you need to be very, very cautious and we are urging folks not to rush ahead and sign contracts with untrusted suppliers from countries like China,” the official said. The United States fears China could use the equipment for espionage - a concern that Huawei Technologies Co. says is unfounded. The push to sideline Huawei in Europe, one of its biggest markets, is likely to deepen trade frictions between Washington and Beijing. Washington is using “multiple tracks”, the U.S. official said, including talks at the U.S.-led NATO alliance in Brussels and at international conferences in Barcelona and Munich: “Europe is definitely where we see this as the top priority.” Huawei gear is widely used in Europe but the push is aimed at equipment for the new fifth generation mobile technology, which promises to link up everything from vehicles to factories at far greater speeds. While Washington has largely barred Huawei from supplying its government and contractors, it sees advanced European preparations for 5G networks as a security risk that could also endanger the United States. “Going with an untrusted supplier like Huawei or ZTE will have all sorts of ramifications for your national security and ... since we are military allies with almost all members of the European Union, on our national security as well,” the official said. Asked for evidence of intelligence work by Huawei or its rival ZTE, the U.S. official said American alarm stemmed more from China’s status as a one-party state, a series of Chinese laws approved in 2017, and counter-terrorism legislation.    The official cited language in the National Intelligence Law that directs individuals and companies to aid China’s intelligence-gathering and keep such work secret.   “Huawei and ZTE ... are ensconced in a one-party state where they are simply not equipped to resist directions from Beijing.” The official also pointed to vulnerabilities found in older networks built by Huawei in Britain, even when they were monitored by a laboratory overseen by British intelligence. Reuters reported exclusively on Jan. 30 that the European Commission, the EU executive, was considering proposals that would ban Huawei from 5G networks, but that work was at an early stage. Concern is also growing in Germany. But France is walking a fine line, with parliament reviewing a provision that would increase government powers to make checks on 5G equipment. “We may not have all the information the United States has. But we take decisions based on what we know. And at this stage, we have not decided to ban Huawei in France,” a French official said this week.

12810,"WOLFSBURG, Germany   - If Volkswagen realizes its ambition of becoming the global leader in electric cars, it will be thanks to a radical and risky bet born out of the biggest calamity in its history. The German giant has staked its future, to the tune of 80 billion euros ($91 billion), on being able to profitably mass-produce electric vehicles - a feat no carmaker has come close to achieving.  So far mainstream automakers’ electric plans have had one main goal: to protect profits gleaned from high-margin conventional cars by adding enough zero-emission vehicles to their fleet to meet clean-air rules. Customers have meanwhile largely shunned electric vehicles because they are too expensive, can be inconvenient to charge and lack range. The biggest strategy shift in Volkswagen’s 80 years has its roots in a weekend crisis meeting at the Rothehof guesthouse in Wolfsburg on October 10, 2015, senior executives told Reuters. At the meeting hosted by then VW brand chief Herbert Diess, nine top managers gathered on a cloudy Saturday afternoon to discuss the way forward after regulators blew the whistle on the company’s emissions cheating, a scandal that cost it more than 27 billion euros in fines and tainted its name. “It was an intense discussion, so was the realization that this could be an opportunity, if we jump far enough,” said Juergen Stackmann, VW brand’s board member for sales. “It was an initial planning session to do more than just play with the idea of electric cars,” he told Reuters. “We asked ourselves: what is our vision for the future of the brand? Everything that you see today is connected to this.”  Just three days after the Rothehof meeting of the VW brand’s management board, Volkswagen announced plans to develop an electric vehicle platform, codenamed MEB, paving the way for mass production of an affordable electric car. For months after the Volkswagen scandal blew up in 2015, rival carmakers treated diesel-cheating as a “VW issue”, according to industry experts. But regulators have since uncovered excessive emissions across the sector and unleashed a clampdown that undermines the business case for combustion engines, forcing a sector-wide rethink. Now the “villain” of dieselgate is likely to become the largest producer of electric cars in the world in coming years, analysts say, putting it in pole position to flood the market - should the demand materialize. “Decisions to convert the Emden factory (in Lower Saxony) to build electric cars, would never have happened without this Saturday meeting,” said Stackmann, one of five senior VW executives who spoke to Reuters. However the full scale of VW’s ambitions were only revealed two months ago when it took the industry by surprise by pledging to spend 80 billion euros to develop electric vehicles and buy batteries, dwarfing the investment of rivals. It plans to raise annual production of electric cars to 3 million by 2025, from 40,000 in 2018. It’s a risky bet. With regulators and lawmakers, rather than customers, dictating what kind of vehicles can hit the road, analysts at Deloitte say the industry could produce 14 million electric cars for which there is no consumer demand. It’s also an all-or-nothing bet in the long run. VW, whose ID electric car will hit showrooms in 2020, has set a deadline for ending mass production of combustion engines. The final generation of gasoline and diesel engines will be developed by 2026. Arndt Ellinghorst, analyst at Evercore ISI, said betting on electric vehicles (EVs) could be risky because customers did not want to own cars dependent on street-charging facilities. “What if people are still not ready to own EVs? Will adoption be the same in the U.S., Europe and China?” he said. But he added that EU and Chinese emissions regulations made electric vehicle adoption inevitable and that being an early industry mover in that direction offered a “positive risk-reward”. Another by-product of dieselgate that quickened VW’s electric drive, according to the senior executives, was a purge of the company’s old guard, who became the focus of public and political anger. This empowered Diess, a newcomer who had joined as VW brand boss shortly before U.S. regulators exposed the carmaker’s emission test cheating. Diess, who joined from BMW where he helped pioneer a ground-breaking electric vehicle, has since been appointed CEO of Volkswagen Group, a multi-brand empire that includes Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Seat, Skoda, Lamborghini and Ducati. Carmakers have failed to mass-produce electric cars profitably largely because of the prohibitive cost of battery packs which make up between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cost of an electric vehicle. A 500 km-range battery costs around $20,000, compared with a gasoline engine that costs around $5,000. Add to that another $2,000 for the electric motor and inverter, and the gap is even wider. Even electric start-up Tesla’s cheapest car, the Model 3, is on sale in Germany at 55,400 euros, priced just below a base model Porsche Macan, a compact SUV. In the United States, Model 3 prices start at $35,950. VW believes its scale will give it an edge to build an electric vehicle costing no more than its current Golf model, about 20,000 euros, using its procurement clout as the world’s largest car and truck maker to drive down the cost. “We are Volkswagen, a brand for the people. For electric cars we need economies of scale. And VW, more than any other carmaker, can take advantage of this,” a senior Volkswagen executive told Reuters, declining to be named. The carmaker’s electric-vehicle budget outstrips that of its closest competitor, Germany’s Daimler, which has committed $42 billion. General Motors, the No.1 U.S. automaker, has said it plans to spend a combined $8 billion on electric and self-driving vehicles. Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi said in late 2017 they would spend 10 billion euros by 2022 on developing electric and autonomous cars. “On a 2025 view, we expect Volkswagen to be the number one electric vehicles producer globally,” UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said. “Tesla is likely to remain a niche player.” VW’s test cheating using engine management software - “defeat devices” - resulted in the introduction of tougher pollution tests which revealed in 2016 and 2017 that emissions readings across the industry were up to 20 percent higher under real-world driving conditions compared with lab conditions. This has raised the bar on the auto sector’s efforts to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, blamed for causing global warming. EU lawmakers in December agreed a cut in carbon dioxide emissions from cars of 37.5 percent by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. This was after the European Union forced a 40 percent cut in emissions between 2007 and 2021. “This goal is no longer reachable using combustion engines alone,” Volkmar Denner, chief executive of Bosch, the world’s biggest auto supplier, said about the 2030 proposals. Every gram of excessive carbon dioxide pollution will be penalized with a 95 euros fine from this year onwards. Strategy firm PA Consulting forecasts VW will face a 1.4-billion-euro penalty for overstepping average limits in Europe by 2021, while Ford and Fiat-Chrysler face fines of 430 million euros and 700 million euros respectively. Daimler, BMW, PSA, Mazda and Hyundai will miss their 2021 average emissions targets, PA Consulting forecasts. Toyota, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, Volvo, Honda and Jaguar Land Rover are on track to meet their goals. PA Consulting’s forecasts were extrapolated using 2017 registration data for each powertrain type and consumer buying trends, but do not include more recent sales trends. Ford, VW and BMW said they would meet their targets because of a push to sell more hybrid and electric cars in 2018. Daimler said it aimed to meet the targets, PSA said it would respect the targets while Fiat-Chrysler declined to comment. Mazda had no immediate comment, while Hyundai did not respond to a request for comment. Carmakers have struggled to lower their average fleet emissions because of a shift in customer taste toward heavier, bigger SUVs (sports utility vehicles), which make it harder to maintain the same levels of acceleration and comfort without increasing fuel consumption and pollution. SUVs are now the most popular vehicle category in Europe, commanding a market share of 34.6 percent, according to JATO Dynamics. Even Porsche, which makes lightweight sportscars, relies on sports utility vehicles for 61 percent of sales. As the industry-wide scale of excessive emissions prompted Brussels to push through tougher laws late last year, VW executives concluded that purely electric cars were the most efficient way to meet carbon dioxide goals across its fleet. This was the point of no return, according to executives, when the company made the final electric investment decisions and committed to staying the course it had plotted after dieselgate. “After evaluating alternatives, we opted for electromobility,” chief operating officer Ralf Brandstaetter told Reuters about VW’s deliberations in November.

12826,"WASHINGTON   - The former head of the U.S. Democratic National Committee on Sunday defended her assertion that she had seriously considered proposing to replace Hillary Clinton as the party’s 2016 presidential nominee, and said her critics could “go to hell.” Donna Brazile has written in a soon-to-be-published book that she thought about working to replace Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden after the nominee almost collapsed at an event on Sept. 11, 2016. In an interview on Sunday with ABC’s “This Week,” Brazile said she had supported Clinton but felt under pressure to come up with a “Plan B” after the candidate collapsed and many people were calling the DNC to ask about the incident. “I wanted her to win, but we were under pressure,” Brazile said. “For those who are telling me to shut up ... you know what I tell them? Go to hell. I’m going to tell my story.” Her book, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that put Donald Trump in the White House,” is set for release on Tuesday by Hachette Books. About 100 former Clinton campaign staffers have signed an open letter saying they were shocked to learn in Brazile’s upcoming book that she considered trying to replace both Clinton and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine. Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, beat Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump in November 2016. She nearly fainted at a New York memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Her doctor said she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier, and she took several days off from campaigning. Brazile’s comments on ABC revealed tensions with Clinton’s  campaign staff. “I got sick and tired of people trying to tell me how to spend money,” she said. “ ... I wasn’t getting a salary. I was basically volunteering my time. “I’m not Patsey the slave,” Brazile said, referring to a character in the film “12 Years a Slave.” But Brazile said she had found no evidence that the Democratic primaries were rigged, a comment at odds with an article she wrote in Politico this week saying the process had been fixed in favor of Clinton, who had signed a fundraising agreement with the DNC in 2015. Leaked emails in 2016 suggested the party had favored Clinton over Sanders. Brazile replaced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz last year after a furor over the emails’ contents.

Trump is ending the program in March 2018. “I don’t think any Republican would vote for anything having to do with leaving chain migration.

12879,"WASHINGTON/PHNOM PENH   - Just days after the killing of a prominent Cambodian government critic last year during a crackdown by the country’s longtime leader, President Barack Obama dispatched Washington’s chief human rights envoy to Phnom Penh to attend the activist’s funeral. In meetings with Cambodian authorities, then-Assistant Secretary of State Tom Malinowski warned the military not to intervene in the political turmoil or else crucial U.S. ties would suffer, sending a clear message that America stood behind the opposition. It was one example of the kind of high-level, rapid-response U.S. diplomacy that President Donald Trump has so far avoided in Cambodia even as the Southeast Asian nation – together with many of its neighbors - has lurched increasingly away from the democratic path. As Trump prepares to depart on his first Asia tour, which will bring him face-to-face with a number of leaders with poor human rights records, his administration has been taking a more muted approach than his predecessor to such concerns, said current and former U.S. officials, rights activists and diplomats. In addition to the situation in Cambodia, they cite what they see as a slow, overly cautious response to Myanmar’s Rohingya crisis, Trump’s failure to publicly call out autocratic leaders he meets over rights abuses, an eagerness to engage with the Philippines’ controversial president, Rodrigo Duterte, and a less vocal approach to human rights in China.  National security adviser H.R. McMaster pushed back against the notion that Trump would downplay human rights on his Nov. 3-14 trip, saying he would speak out “about the importance of promoting freedom and individual rights.” When asked why Trump condemns U.S. adversaries such as Syria and Venezuela on human rights grounds but not the Philippines, Turkey and Russia, McMaster told reporters on Thursday: “How much does it help to yell about these problems? It hasn’t really delivered in recent history anyway.” The dominant view within Trump’s White House is that under his “America First” world-view human rights concerns related to allies and strategically important countries should be managed gently to avoid impeding job-creating business deals or undercutting security efforts such as isolating North Korea, several Trump aides said. Soft-pedaling human rights may also help Washington avoid alienating countries in Southeast Asia that it wants to keep from moving further into China’s orbit, those aides said.  Beijing puts little pressure on its neighbors over such issues. This approach, however, has sown frustration among some U.S. diplomats who deal with human rights and disappointed dissidents in several countries, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen people involved in these matters in Washington and Asian capitals. The failure so far to fill several senior Asia and human rights posts at the State Department is a further handicap, they say. Obama’s former top Asia adviser, Evan Medeiros, is one of those critical of what he sees as the Trump administration’s lower-key approach to human rights. “It’s a false dichotomy to say that somehow a focus on human rights detracts from American security or economic well-being,” he said. Even under Obama, however, there were some in the human rights community who at times found fault with U.S. actions.  While the Nobel Peace Prize laureate was praised for stressing human rights in Asia-Pacific trade negotiations, he faced criticism that he suspended sanctions on Myanmar prematurely and lifted a ban on the sale of lethal arms to Vietnam. “He spoke eloquently and sometimes delivered,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “But he also didn’t fully use the carrots and sticks of American power.” Though Trump has said little on human rights beyond condemning adversaries such as North Korea and Venezuela, United Nations envoy Nikki Haley has been one of the few top aides who have spoken out more broadly. She visited sub-Saharan Africa and pressed leaders to tackle political and humanitarian problems. Trump set the tone in Saudi Arabia in May when he told an audience that included monarchs and strongmen from the Muslim world: “We are not here to lecture.” He has hosted several autocratic leaders - including Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who had been frozen out of White House visits since leading a 2014 military coup - but has steered clear of publicly criticizing their records on human rights. Such visits under Obama usually included addressing rights concerns, the Democratic president’s former aides said. McMaster insisted that Trump preferred to deal with such issues “quietly in every relationship.” One closely watched meeting will be with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Trump praised him in a phone call in April for a bloody anti-drugs campaign. An administration official told reporters human rights would be part of their “frank and friendly discussions.” But the government in Manila has been feeling less heat from the Trump administration about extrajudicial killings linked to drugs crackdown, according to a foreign ministry official. “It’s a very different White House under President Donald Trump, not like under President Barack Obama, who pushed human rights hard during his term,” the official told Reuters. “We are not hearing this from the White House.”   Another issue expected to be front and center is Myanmar’s Rohingya crisis. Trump’s critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have chided the administration for what they have seen as a halting response. U.S. officials have been reluctant to label the situation as “ethnic cleansing” even though the United Nations has used the term. Myanmar rejects that accusation, saying  action was needed to combat terrorism. Two months after an outbreak of violence that sent more than half a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing into Bangladesh, Washington has now sent a senior delegation, announced a planned visit by Tillerson on Nov. 15, and is threatening modest sanctions. When Kem Ley, a popular Cambodian political commentator, was killed by a gunman in July 2016, Malinowski, the State Department official, flew to Phnom Penh just days later and met top aides to Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled for more than three decades. Malinowski’s stern words helped give local diplomats leverage to press rights concerns behind the scenes, said one U.S. official involved in Southeast Asia diplomacy. This year Hun Sen has intensified his crackdown, including the arrest of opposition leader Kem Sokha, while also stepping up rhetoric against Washington.  The State Department has largely limited its response to statements of “deep concern.” Cambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan said Cambodia had not felt pressure from Washington and Trump was clearly taking a different approach than Obama. “Their tone is lighter. Before, they would bully,” said ruling party parliamentarian Sok Eysan. The change under Trump, he added, “means we are on the right path towards democracy,” an assertion that contradicts human rights advocates who say the political climate has deteriorated. In Vietnam, dissident Nguyen Quang A expressed pessimism about Trump’s visit. Nguyen, who was detained by authorities on his way to meet Obama during a visit last year, said: “I don’t think Trump will talk about human rights. Just look at his words and actions.” The White House has not signaled that Trump plans to meet any dissidents during his Asia trip, something Obama frequently did in his foreign travels. There has been frustration among some U.S. diplomats in Beijing over perceptions that botched messaging from the United States signaled a retreat on human rights. But some U.S. officials said that behind the scenes the administration has been supportive of work in China on behalf of Chinese dissidents. A Beijing-based diplomat from another Western country said, however, that U.S. participation in meetings between Western allies to coordinate strategy on human rights was much reduced, for example, when it came to putting out joint statements on issues of concern. China has been “relieved” to see Trump giving human rights less weight, according to a Chinese diplomat in Washington. But Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: “As for human rights, we are always willing to have constructive dialogue with countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect.” ","With

Republicans pushing the tax bill will have to accept the assessments of budget analysts who may not share the White House’s views on how the tax bill could increase some tax revenues by fostering growth in the economy, Cohn said. “We have to accept the score to get the legislation through,” he said. “We will legislate to a bill to get the score that we need to get it through the legislative process.” ",Trump supports Republican tax overhaul bill: adviser,"November 2, 2017 /  4:44 PM ",washington u s president donald trump supports the tax overhaul bill unveiled on thursday by republicans in the house of representatives a top white house advisor said the bill that the house has delivered today is a bill that the president can support national economic council director gary cohn told a gathering of the economic club of washington adding that he was confident the house would approve a tax overhaul if it delivers middle class tax relief and a  percent corporate tax rate and it shows up on his desk i can guarantee he s going to sign it cohn said republicans pushing the tax bill will have to accept the assessments of budget analysts who may not share the white house s views on how the tax bill could increase some tax revenues by fostering growth in the economy cohn said we have to accept the score to get the legislation through he said we will legislate to a bill to get the score that we need to get it through the legislative process ,Boeing Crisis,0.3352630138397217
12912,"DETROIT   - Volkswagen AG unit Electrify America said on Monday it will install Tesla Inc battery storage packs at more than 100 charging stations across the United States to keep costs down for drivers charging electric vehicles. Electricity users can incur high-demand charges from many U.S. utilities when they draw a lot of energy from the grid in a short time, which can happen charging an electric vehicle or a number of them at once at a single station. “If you pass the demand charge onto the customer in a high-demand charge market” it can cost anywhere from $70 to $110 to charge a vehicle, Electrify America’s chief operating officer Brendan Jones told Reuters. “If you did that, obviously nobody would buy an electric vehicle.” Tesla Powerpack battery systems draw power from the grid during off-peak hours and store it for use during peak hours to avoid or reduce demand charges. Electrify America will install most of its battery packs in areas of the United States where there is a higher concentration of electric vehicle owners, particularly on the West Coast and the Northeast. During a conference call with analysts this week, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said “stationary storage” is a growth opportunity for the automaker.  “I expect that to grow, I mean, probably twice as fast as automotive for... a long time,” Musk said. VW has agreed to spend $2 billion nationwide on clean car infrastructure as part of an agreement with federal regulators after admitting to diesel emissions cheating.  A lack of EV recharging infrastructure is seen as a major barrier to mass adoption as consumers remain concerned over their limited range.  By this June Electrify America will have 484 charging stations built across America. The company is discussing using more battery storage packs with regulators for its next round of infrastructure investment, company CTO Jones said. He said that apart from keeping charges down for consumers, Electrify America will examine the possibility of selling stored energy to lower charging stations’ costs. Global automakers are planning a $300 billion surge in spending on electric vehicle technology over the next five to 10 years, with nearly half of the money targeted at China, accelerating the industry’s transition from fossil fuels and shifting power to Asian battery and electric vehicle technology suppliers.

12964,"NEW YORK   - U.S. companies are beating analysts’ expectations this earnings season, but to a smaller degree than normal, and S&P 500 companies are now barely expected to eke out an increase in profits for the first quarter of 2019.  The trend underscores fears about a potential decline in earnings this year, even as stocks just closed their best January in more than three decades, as the benchmark S&P 500 index rebounded from a swoon late last year. “It does get tricky here as this quarter plays out if companies continue to see weakness. Then, there’s going to be an issue and investors will become very concerned,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. Fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to be up 15.5 percent from a year ago, based on results from nearly half of the S&P 500 companies and forecasts for the rest, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, compared with about 14.5 percent three weeks ago. That growth clip is historically strong but disappointing on two fronts.  The rate is noticeably slower than the three earlier quarters in 2018, when the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts fueled double-digit earnings gains. Estimated profit growth for all of 2018 is at 23.6 percent, based on Refinitiv’s data. Also, given recent historical trends in earnings rates, investors might expect growth to be on track to rise even faster at this point in the reporting period. The quarterly profit growth rate typically falls heading into a reporting period and then quickly reverses course once companies begin to report, often beating analysts’ expectations. So far this earnings season, the percentage by which companies are beating estimates for the entire S&P 500 is 2.8 percent, compared with a median of 5.4 percent over the past eight quarters, based on Refinitiv’s data.  If the index were beating estimates by the recent median, fourth-quarter profit growth would now be estimated at 17.4 percent instead of 15.5 percent, said David Aurelio, senior research analyst at Refinitiv. The inability of the financials sector to meaningfully outdo earnings expectations is at least partly to blame for the slower-than-usual pickup in the growth rate, he said. With results in from 66 percent of the S&P 500 financials, the sector’s median earnings surprise is just 0.4 percent. That’s on track to be well below the sector’s 4.4 percent median surprise of the last eight quarters. Also affecting the fourth-quarter’s growth rate, profit estimates for the energy sector were still falling in recent weeks, following a 38 percent drop in U.S. oil prices in the fourth quarter, analysts said. Oil prices have recovered somewhat this year, and Exxon Mobil and Chevron both reported stronger-than-expected results on Friday. At the same time, the percentage of reports beating expectations for the fourth quarter - 70.9 percent - so far is below the 78 percent average of the past four quarters, based on Refinitiv’s data. Meanwhile, estimated first-quarter profit growth has fallen to just 0.7 percent from 3.5 percent about three weeks ago, as the benefits from the tax cuts recede. First-quarter forecasts for the energy and technology sectors have fallen the most, with analysts now expecting year-over-year energy earnings to decline 10.8 percent in the first quarter and those for technology to fall by 5.4 percent. “On a quarterly basis, 1Q19 is emerging as the low point for growth embedded in consensus forecasts,” Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy for RBC Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a note this week. “Still positive, but just barely.” ",U.S. corporate earnings trend stokes concern about 2019 outlook,"February 1, 2019 /  9:33 PM ",new york u s companies are beating analysts expectations this earnings season but to a smaller degree than normal and s p  companies are now barely expected to eke out an increase in profits for the first quarter of  the trend underscores fears about a potential decline in earnings this year even as stocks just closed their best january in more than three decades as the benchmark s p  index rebounded from a swoon late last year it does get tricky here as this quarter plays out if companies continue to see weakness then there s going to be an issue and investors will become very concerned said michael o rourke chief market strategist at jonestrading in greenwich connecticut fourth quarter earnings are estimated to be up   percent from a year ago based on results from nearly half of the s p  companies and forecasts for the rest according to ibes data from refinitiv compared with about   percent three weeks ago that growth clip is historically strong but disappointing on two fronts the rate is noticeably slower than the three earlier quarters in  when the trump administration s corporate tax cuts fueled double digit earnings gains estimated profit growth for all of  is at   percent based on refinitiv s data also given recent historical trends in earnings rates investors might expect growth to be on track to rise even faster at this point in the reporting period the quarterly profit growth rate typically falls heading into a reporting period and then quickly reverses course once companies begin to report often beating analysts expectations so far this earnings season the percentage by which companies are beating estimates for the entire s p  is   percent compared with a median of   percent over the past eight quarters based on refinitiv s data if the index were beating estimates by the recent median fourth quarter profit growth would now be estimated at   percent instead of   percent said david aurelio senior research analyst at refinitiv the inability of the financials sector to meaningfully outdo earnings expectations is at least partly to blame for the slower than usual pickup in the growth rate he said with results in from  percent of the s p  financials the sector s median earnings surprise is just   percent that s on track to be well below the sector s   percent median surprise of the last eight quarters also affecting the fourth quarter s growth rate profit estimates for the energy sector were still falling in recent weeks following a  percent drop in u s oil prices in the fourth quarter analysts said oil prices have recovered somewhat this year and exxon mobil and chevron both reported stronger than expected results on friday at the same time the percentage of reports beating expectations for the fourth quarter   percent so far is below the  percent average of the past four quarters based on refinitiv s data meanwhile estimated first quarter profit growth has fallen to just   percent from   percent about three weeks ago as the benefits from the tax cuts recede first quarter forecasts for the energy and technology sectors have fallen the most with analysts now expecting year over year energy earnings to decline   percent in the first quarter and those for technology to fall by   percent on a quarterly basis q is emerging as the low point for growth embedded in consensus forecasts lori calvasina head of u s equity strategy for rbc capital markets in new york wrote in a note this week still positive but just barely ,Boeing Crisis,0.4203450381755829

12973,"LONDON/NEW YORK   - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp are expected to announce plans next week to proceed with a $10 billion project that will expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility in Texas, three people familiar with the transaction said.  ConocoPhillips, the third partner in the existing import terminal, plans to sell its 12.4 percent stake and does not plan to participate in the expansion, the people said.  LNG demand is soaring. Worldwide consumption of the fuel is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market.  Golden Pass LNG began as a receiving and regasification facility in Sabine Pass, Texas able to handle up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas imports per day.  However, as U.S. gas production has soared to new records, bolstered by shale production, the demand for export capacity has increased. The potential $10 billion expansion, first announced in 2014, would focus on this new market dynamic.  It is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest some $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas footprint. The most likely buyer for ConocoPhillips’ stake is Exxon Mobil, two of the people said, adding that the existing partners do not want to bring in another participant, as plans for the project are in advanced stages.  Currently, Exxon has a 30 percent stake in the LNG export project, and Qatar Petroleum holds a 70 percent stake. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique.  Exxon expects this year to “sanction” the Golden Pass export terminal and another LNG project in Mozambique, Chief Executive Darren Woods said Friday on a conference call with analysts.  The company has been “working very closely with QP (Qatar Petroleum), our partner in Golden Pass, to advance that investment and look forward to announcing something here in the very near term,” Woods said. Qatar was the world’s largest LNG producer in 2017 and has annual output of 77 million tonnes.  Exxon and ConocoPhillips declined to comment, while Qatar Petroleum could not immediately be reached for comment. ConocoPhillips’ stake sale led to delays in announcing the final decision to proceed with the project, one of the people said. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. The move comes as ConocoPhillips hones its focus on international projects.   The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Firms are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year. That’s well above the previous record of about 45 million tonnes in 2005 and triple last year’s 21 million tonnes, Wood Mackenzie’s research director for global gas and LNG, Giles Farrer, said last month. More than 320 million tonnes of LNG was shipped globally in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data. Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members’ investments in the country.

12980,"WASHINGTON   - Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, announced on Tuesday that he would retire from Congress at the end of 2018, marking the exit of Congress’s leading advocate for rolling back strict financial rules. Hensarling, 60, of Texas, said in a statement that he would not seek re-election, noting that his term as head of the banking panel expires at the same time. He has been a vocal proponent of significant deregulation in the financial sector and an author of sweeping legislation to drastically reduce the regulations imposed on banks. “Today I am announcing that I will not seek re-election to the U.S. Congress in 2018,” Hensarling said in a statement. “Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned.” Hensarling, first elected to Congress in 2002, had been the architect of a broad rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The overall would have eliminated several of the major powers given to regulators after the 2007-2009 financial crisis and impose strict new limitations on their authority. That bill, the Financial CHOICE Act, is not expected to become law after passing the House, due to insufficient support in the Senate. But his work was hailed by GOP colleagues as an ambitious effort to cut regulation of the banking industry. “Jeb has eloquently articulated this conservative vision, leading the charge to repeal Dodd-Frank and deliver a freer market that gives every American the opportunity to achieve the American dream,” said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in a statement. Banking lobby groups, including the Financial Services Roundtable and American Bankers Association, said Hensarling had been a strong leader who advanced reforms that led to economic opportunity and better banking. He has been a steadfast critic of rules imposed on the financial sector after the crash, and became an industry ally in efforts to roll them back. But those efforts also made him a top target of advocates of stricter rules, who said his efforts would put Americans at risk of a similar meltdown. “Hensarling has probably just decided to spend more time with his banks. We hope the revolving door doesn’t hit him too hard on the way out,” said Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress. While some GOP lawmakers have announced plans to retire after facing uphill re-election battles, Hensarling hails from a deeply conservative district in Texas where he remains highly popular. In 2016, he faced no Republican rivals in the party’s primary and took 80.6 percent of the district’s vote in the general election. Even though the district consistently votes Republican, his resignation will provide another opportunity for Democrats to realize their hopes of taking control of the House in 2018. Lawyer Dan Wood, has already entered the race to be the party’s nominee for the seat. Unlike some exiting Republicans, Hensarling never publicly feuded with President Donald Trump. In fact, Trump had considered Hensarling for a post in his administration after the election. His exit will set off a competition to take over as head of the powerful banking committee. Representative Patrick McHenry is the vice chair of the committee, but Representatives Blaine Luetkemeyer, Bill Huizenga, and Sean Duffy are also potential contenders, according to lobbyists familiar with the committee. One lobbyist said Luetkemeyer was the leading candidate to lead the panel, as McHenry is seen as a rising star in House leadership. Luetkemeyer is “seriously considering” running for the chairmanship, according to his spokeswoman. Hensarling’s next move is unclear. Some lobbyists speculated he could take a top role at a conservative think tank like the Heritage Foundation. Alternatively, he could take a role in the administration or return to his home state. Cowen and Co analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a client note that Hensarling could be “the top contender” to take over the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The current FHFA Director, Mel Watt, is an appointee of former President Barack Obama, serving out a term that expires in January of 2019.

12985,"LONDON/HONG KONG   - Factory activity was at its weakest in years across much of the world during January, adding to worries trade tariffs, political uncertainty and cooling demand poses an increasing threat to global growth.  Weak Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) readings reinforce expectations central banks will put any further interest rate hikes on hold this year and fuel expectations a global economic slowdown is underway, as highlighted in a Reuters poll last month.  Trade-focused Asia appears to be suffering the most visible loss of momentum so far, with activity shrinking in China, although European economies are stuck in low gear and many emerging markets are sputtering. The euro zone has been rocked by protests in France, an auto sector struggling to regain momentum, political strife and rising trade protectionism.  Manufacturing growth in the bloc was minimal last month, at a four-year low, and forward looking indicators suggest there will be no turnaround soon. [EUR/PMIM] Germany’s manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in more than four years as Europe’s powerhouse was hit by trade tensions although activity in France rebounded, helped by jobs growth. British factories are scrambling to stockpile goods at the fastest rate since records began in the early 1990s as they brace for a potentially chaotic Brexit in less than two months’ time. Yet growth was weaker than expected and optimism waned. [GB/PMIM] Last week, the International Monetary Fund cut its world growth forecasts for this year and next and said failure to resolve protectionism could further destabilize the slowing global economy. “Unfortunately, the situation still looks set to get worse first. We have to brace ourselves for an ongoing string of weak economic data driven by, but not confined to, much weaker global trade,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled its three-year-drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy. In some countries there is even chatter about potential rate cuts. Beijing is under pressure to come up with more stimulus measures and find common ground with the United States to prevent their trade war from escalating. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try and seal a comprehensive trade deal as Trump and his top trade negotiator both cited substantial progress in two days of high-level talks. Trump, speaking at the White House during a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, said he was optimistic the world’s two largest economies could reach “the biggest deal ever made.” “A lot depends on whether the U.S. and China come to a reasonable deal. Then we can actually avert this potential trade recession, but at the moment it’s all tentative,” said Irene Cheung, Asia strategist at ANZ. Global shares crept lower from their highest levels in two months on Friday after the weak data threw a wet blanket on a rally that took them to their best January on record.  China’s factory activity shrank the most in almost three years in January as new orders slumped further and output fell, the private Caixin/Markit PMI survey showed. The numbers were weaker than Thursday’s official PMI survey, but both suggested the economy is continuing to slow. However, veteran China watchers typically advise taking its data early in the year with a pinch of salt, suspecting the trends may be distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays. Many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which begin on Feb. 4 this year. Still, workers, business owners and labor activists have told Reuters companies are shutting earlier than usual as the trade war bites, with some likely to close for good. Spreading beyond manufacturing, the global impact of China’s slowdown means cost-conscious Chinese tourists will chose destinations closer to home for the week off, rather than more expensive trips further afield. “The global outlook is a bit more at risk from China today than it was, say, two or three years ago,” said Sonal Desai, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Fixed Income. Japan’s factory activity was the slowest in 29 months, with weakening exports and output suggesting it could soon fall into contraction. Manufacturers in the world’s No.3 economy are facing both falling exports and a likely slump in domestic demand when the country’s sales tax is hiked in October. Freight rates for dry-bulk and container ships, carriers of most of the world’s raw materials and finished goods, have plunged over the last six months. But not all PMI surveys were gloomy. In India, which relies more on domestic demand, factory activity accelerated. And it was still in moderate expansion territory in Vietnam, Philippines and Thailand.

13036,"BRUSSELS/PRAGUE   - The United States wants to steer people away from Huawei towards Western products because of its concerns over the security of the Chinese company’s technology, the U.S. envoy to the European Union said on Thursday. Huawei faces international scrutiny over its ties with the Chinese government and allegations that Beijing could use Huawei’s technology for spying, which the company denies However, Gordon Sondland said that there was classified evidence on security breaches by the Chinese firm, saying he had raised the U.S. concerns with EU officials. “The U.S. is very supportive of the discouraging the purchase of any Chinese digital products that involve potential national security implications and steering people away from Huawei into Western products is our desired outcome,” Sondland told Reuters before an event in Brussels.  Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones. It derives nearly half of its total revenue outside China and its global reach has come under attack from the United States, which is trying to prevent U.S. companies from buying Huawei equipment and is pressing allies to do the same.  U.S. security experts are worried the gear could be used by China for espionage, a concern Huawei says is unfounded Asked about security issues with Huawei’s products, Sondland said: “There is a lot of evidence, most of it classified.” Responding to Sondland’s comments, a spokesman for Huawei said it had a proven reputation on cyber security and does not buy all of its materials from China. “Only one third of materials used to make Huawei products are sourced in China,” the spokesman said in an email. “The rest are from other parts of the world. In today’s globalised world, all major ICT companies have global supply chains. Huawei has a clean track record on cyber security.”   DE-FACTO EU BAN? The EU is considering proposals that would amount to a de-facto ban on Huawei kit for next-generation mobile networks, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The United States and Australia are among Western nations that have already restricted Huawei from the 5G mobile networks. As Huawei comes under increasing pressure in Europe, Czech President Milos Zeman met representatives of the company to discuss cybersecurity and other topics, his spokesman said. Huawei has been excluded from a Czech tender to build a tax portal after the country’s cyber watchdog warned of possible security threats, documents showed on Wednesday. “Huawei representatives informed the President about the current state of investment activities and plans for the future. The debate also touched upon cybersecurity. Huawei representatives declared that they complied with relevant standards,” spokesman Jiri Ovcacek said on Twitter. Zeman, who has long promoted close cooperation with Beijing and has publicly backed Huawei, also plans to meet its chief executive when he visits China in April, Ovcacek said.

13065,"MADRID   - Ride-hailing companies Uber and Cabify are to suspend their services in Barcelona in response to the regional government’s imposition of limits on how they operate in the city. The Catalan government ruled that ride-hailing services could only pick up passengers after a 15-minute delay from the time they were booked.  The decision followed mass protests by Barcelona taxi drivers who complained that their business was being undermined and the services did not operate on a level playing field.  Barcelona is Spain’s second-largest city and one of its main tourist destinations. The suspension of the services was announced just a few weeks before it hosts the annual Mobile World Congress, one of the world’s largest meetings of the mobile tech industry. “The new restrictions approved by the Catalan government leave us with no choice but to suspend UberX while we assess our future in Barcelona,” an Uber spokesman said. Spain’s Cabify, which has one million users in Barcelona, said in a statement it regretted that the city had “given in to the demands of the taxi sector, seriously hurting citizen’s interests”. Cabify said the new regulation, which took effect on Thursday, had the specific objective of “the direct expulsion of the Cabify application” from Barcelona and the region Catalonia.   Uber said it remained committed to operating in the long-term in Spanish cities and hoped “to work with the Catalan government and the City Council on fair regulation for all”. Uber began offering its UberX service last March. The new regulations were imposed under pressure from taxi drivers, who held strikes that blocked roads in Barcelona and remain on strike in the Spanish capital, Madrid. The drivers in Madrid escalated their protest this week by blocking one of the city’s main arteries. But Uber licenses in Spain are granted by local authorities, and so far Madrid authorities have said they would not adopt the same restriction as in Barcelona.  Cabify and Unauto VTC, an association of transport companies in Spain, said Barcelona’s decision to adopt the new regulation could put 3,000 jobs at risk in Barcelona.  Uber declined to say how many drivers work for it in Barcelona.

Kamal Jayasinghe, chief executive of Sri Lanka’s National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA), which is part of the health ministry, said it had informed the distributor, A.Baur & Co., that it would require further tests for it to continue importing the powder. “We have held their re-registration and informed the distributor to submit quality reports from an accredited laboratory to ensure there is no asbestos in their products,” Jayasinghe told Reuters.  The license for A.Baur & Co to import the product expired in December, a second person at the NMRA said. Shalutha Perera, head of consumer for A.Baur, told Reuters the firm has informed J&J in India of the suspension of the licensing process. “J&J India directly handles all the regulatory matters,” he said.  Perera said the NMRA contacted A.Baur in December regarding new asbestos testing.  A spokeswoman for J&J India declined to comment on the halt of shipments to Sri Lanka but said the company “is in full compliance with current Indian regulatory requirements for the manufacturing and testing of our talc”. “We are fully cooperating with the Indian government and are awaiting results from their testing,” she added.  The spokeswoman said the product was routinely tested by both suppliers and independent labs to ensure it is free of asbestos.

13258,"NEW YORK   - Global stock markets tumbled on Monday after Caterpillar and Nvidia Corp warned of weak Chinese demand while oil posted its biggest one-day drop in a month on expectations of growing U.S. crude supply. Equities also were slammed by plunging shares of Brazilian miner Vale SA, which lost some $19.3 billion of its market value following the collapse of a tailing dam last week that killed at least 60 people.  Vale shares dropped 24.5 percent in Sao Paulo trade.  The dollar fell against a basket of currencies as traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting ending Wednesday and the results of U.S.-China trade talks this week. The euro reached a 10-day high against the dollar ahead of  voting in Britain’s parliament on Tuesday that aims to break the Brexit deadlock. Caterpillar, a bellwether for global industrials, fell 9.1 percent as its quarterly profit missed Wall Street estimates, hurt by softening Chinese demand, a strong dollar and higher manufacturing and freight costs. It was Caterpillar’s worst single-day drop since August 2011. Nvidia slid 13.8 percent after the chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars, hit by weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data center sales. Apple’s downward guidance two weeks ago, along with the announcements by Caterpillar and Nvidia, suggest the U.S.-China trade war will affect more companies, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “I view this as a cause for concern. It’s not a crisis, but it’s likely to be a few more canaries in the coal mine because there is going to be a significant cohort of stocks that are likely to be impacted by the U.S.-China trade war,” Hooper said. Earnings at Chinese industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in December, hit by slowing prices and weak factory activity. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 0.96 percent while MSCI’s all-country world equity index declined 0.62 percent.  Stocks on Wall Street, down more than 1 percent for most of the session, recouped some losses at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 208.98 points, or 0.84 percent, to 24,528.22. The S&P 500 lost 20.91 points, or 0.78 percent, to 2,643.85 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 79.18 points, or 1.11 percent, to 7,085.69. Emerging market stocks lost 0.39 percent. Volatility has picked up as investors fret about an economic cycle that is long in the tooth, leading to sharp reactions in the market to news, said Laura Kane, head of investment themes for the Americas at UBS Wealth Management. Equity markets have solid underpinnings with fourth-quarter earnings looking good, a likely truce in the U.S.-China trade talks and the Fed sounding a dovish message, leading her to be optimistic, Kane said. “But the complication of volatility being uncomfortable and the fact we’re later in the (business) cycle, that’s why we’re seeing these larger reactions to market news than we’re used to,” she said. U.S. energy companies last week boosted the number of rigs drilling for oil for the first time since late December.      U.S. crude production, which rose to a record 11.9 million barrels per day late last year, has undermined sentiment in the oil market, traders said. Also weighing on oil prices are concerns about whether Chinese refiners will continue to import crude at 2018’s breakneck pace. U.S. crude settled down 3.17 percent at $51.99 per barrel and Brent fell 2.77 percent to settle at $59.93. In FX markets, the ICE index that tracks the dollar versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies was down 0.05 percent at 95.745. It hit a near two-week low at 95.673 earlier in the session. The euro rose 0.11 percent to $1.1425 while the Japanese yen strengthened 0.16 percent versus the greenback at 109.36 per dollar. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 1/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.7458 percent. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.4 percent at $1,303.10 per ounce.

13265,"NEW YORK   - Oil fell about 3 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day percentage drop in a month, after an increase in U.S. crude drilling pointed to further supply growth amid continuing concerns about a global economic slowdown.  Brent crude oil futures sank $1.71, or 2.8 percent, to settle at $59.93 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slumped $1.70, or 3.2 percent, to settle at $51.99 a barrel. The last time both crude benchmarks saw bigger daily percentage drops was on Dec. 27. “We’re seeing oil prices really start to break down here,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. “One of the factors that played (into prices) is the rising rig count that we saw on Friday.” U.S. drillers added 10 oil rigs last week, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes on Friday, in another sign of the expanding record U.S. crude production that has soured market sentiment.  GRAPHIC: U.S. oil production & drilling levels - tmsnrt.rs/2Tm4u4I The trade war between Washington and Beijing weighed on futures as investor optimism waned that the two sides would soon end the months-long tariff fight that has damaged China’s economy. That, coupled with uncertainty about how long the U.S. government will stay open after Washington agreed to end a historic shutdown, dampened investor optimism, said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “I think both those factors seem to have sparked fears about slowing demand growth, which have been one of the main bearish drivers in the market for a while,” McGillian said. Crude futures remain on course for their strongest monthly gains in more than two years following production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies this month. Brent has risen nearly 12 percent so far in January, which would be the largest monthly percentage increase since December 2016. WTI has risen more than 13 percent this month, the biggest jump since April 2016, when it surged almost 20 percent. Investors have added to bets on a sustained rise in the oil price this month for the first time since September, according to data from the InterContinental Exchange.  Much of the demand outlook hinges on China and whether its refiners will continue to import crude at 2018’s breakneck pace.  Industrial companies in China reported a second monthly fall in earnings in December, despite the government’s efforts to support borrowing and investment.

13269,"STOCKHOLM   - A Volvo Cars joint venture has won approval to begin hands-free testing of its software for self-driving cars on Swedish highways, partner Veoneer said on Monday. Veoneer said the Zenuity joint venture’s software for Level 4 autonomous driving - the second highest level - would be tested in a Volvo car by trained drivers with their hands off the steering wheel at a maximum speed of 80 kilometers per hour (50 miles per hour). The venture is striving to keep up with larger rivals in the race to develop self-driving vehicles.  U.S. companies are leading the pack, with Google’s Waymo last year winning the first approval to test cars without safety drivers on Californian public roads. General Motors’ Cruise has said it is ready to deploy a self-driving car with no manual controls, while Germany’s BMW and Audi have also secured testing rights. Securing permissions has got tougher after an accident involving a Volvo car that Uber was using to test its own self-driving software. Uber last month resumed limited testing on public roads. Zenuity has been running tests in Sweden to collect data to develop autonomous functionalities and sensors, while Volvo has been carrying out separate tests to gather data to improve driver experience and study driver behavior.  Veoneer Chief Technology Officer Nishant Batra said the approval to do real-life tests was “essential for gathering important data and test functions”. “It is a strong proof-point for the progress of Zenuity’s self-driving capabilities,” he said. Veoneer spokesman Thomas Jonsson said it was too early to say when Zenuity could potentially test without a safety driver.  Zenuity, formed by Volvo and Veoneer in 2017, is expected to have its first driver assistance products on sale by 2019 with autonomous driving technologies shortly afterwards. Volvo and its Chinese parent Geely are customers.  Volvo has goals of delivering self-driving cars sometime after 2021 and deriving a third of its sales from fully autonomous cars by 2025. Documents obtained from the Swedish Transport Authority showed Volvo in September secured the right to test self-driving cars at 80kph and the permit removed a previous condition that a driver has at least one hand on the steering wheel. The cars Volvo was testing were “for the development of fully autonomous vehicles” and it was using outside parties and test drivers, a Volvo spokesman said. A top Level 5 vehicle, or fully autonomous vehicle, will be able to navigate roads without any driver input in all conditions. Volvo teamed up with Baidu last year to use the Chinese company’s autonomous software to develop a Level 4 car.

13317,"MUMBAI   - When India introduced new bankruptcy resolution rules in 2016, government officials and investors said they expected debt-burdened state-owned banks to clear up some of their bad loans and create a dynamic market in restructured debt.  Ultimately, they said, they hoped the reform would remove an impediment to higher economic growth.  Almost three years later, those hopes have been badly dented. Litigation has tied down some big restructuring deals and bankers are starting to sell bad debts at fire sale prices rather than wait for the system to work better. That is bad news for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is keen to get banks lending more to stimulate the economy and create more jobs ahead of an election due by May this year. “The delay (in resolution) definitely affects the diligence and planning effort of financial investors,” said Vijay Padmanabhan, director of KKR & Co. Inc., one of world’s biggest private equity firms which has said it is keen on investing in India’s distressed assets. Although Padmanabhan said the current bankruptcy process was faster than before, he cautioned that “litigations have to be contained and timelines have to be maintained to generate serious interest amongst financial investors.” The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, introduced in May 2016, allows even small creditors to file insolvency petitions against a company that had defaulted on debt. Once the petition is accepted by a court, a resolution plan has to be decided within 270 days, failing which the company will be liquidated. The idea was the law would provide an incentive to owners to negotiate over distressed debt, rather than face an accelerated bankruptcy process over which they would have very little control.  It would also pull in foreign investors seeking distressed investments and potentially high returns, said Siby Antony, chairman of distressed assets resolution business at Edelweiss, which specializes in turning around debt-ridden companies. Then, the owners of one of India’s biggest defaulters - Essar Steel, which owes 508 billion rupees ($7.11 billion) mostly to state banks - challenged the bankruptcy court’s decision to sell the steel producer to Arcelor Mittal, taking it away from its previous owners, the brothers Shashi and Ravi Ruia. The nine months set for the process has now stretched to more than one and a half years, leaving creditors still not knowing how much of their money will be returned. The debt of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, Jyoti Structures (JYTS.NS) and scores of other companies are also stuck in similar litigation. While the bankruptcy code was a step forward, it would have been more effective if it had included restrictions on the scope for litigation, bankers and investors said.  India has 14.5 trillion rupees ($204.16 billion) of distressed assets, of which only around 730 billion rupees ($10.26 billion), or about 5 percent, have been resolved. However, only about half of this sum has so far been recouped by the banks due to legal challenges that have stalled payments. “It would have been helpful if all the nuances of the law and possible outcomes were thought through,” said Alok Verma, executive director at Kotak Investment Banking, part of the Kotak Mahindra Group which works with clients looking at distressed assets in India. So far out of 1,198 cases admitted under insolvency process, only 52 have seen approval of resolution plans, and even among those, repayments are still to be made to lenders.  “Most foreign investors are sitting on the fence waiting for the resolution process to stabilize,” said Antony of Edelweiss. But Anthony does hold some hope that the system will speed up once the Essar Steel issue is resolved as that would set a precedent. “Once the big accounts are cleared the pipeline will move fast,” he predicted. In the meantime, bankers are now looking to sell some of their bad assets at a steep discount to free up capital. India’s largest lender State Bank of India is looking to put its 150.4 billion rupees ($2.1 billion) exposure to Essar Steel on the block at 62 cents to the dollar. Other lenders to the company are weighing similar options as prolonged litigation might cost them more in terms of provisions for losses and loss in interest income than any final recovery they might make, one banker to Essar said. For capital-starved Indian banks, taking such haircuts is  costly. But for the economy, it is an even greater cost given banks fund more than 60 percent of India’s credit requirements. “State-owned banks’ core capital ratios are already very weak and that is the main factor constraining their capacity to lend,” said Saswata Guha, director and head of financial institutions at Fitch Ratings. “It eventually poses a risk to economic growth.” (GRAPHIC: India's stressed debt interactive -

13344,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. government shutdown has handed banks a rare opportunity to tout their nicer side as they prepare for rough treatment under a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. Sparked by a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over President Donald Trump’s demand for a wall on the Mexico border, the partial shutdown is the longest ever, entering its 35th day on Friday.  The president announced on Friday he would back a bill to reopen the government for three weeks as a temporary reprieve, but the financial repercussions from the shutdown could last weeks. With around 800,000 federal workers missing a second paycheck on Friday, lenders including Wells Fargo and Bank of America as well as their Washington lobby groups, have been quick to trumpet their efforts to waive fees, delay debt repayments and give a helping hand to federal workers. “It is a big opportunity,” said Brian Hart, founder of Flackable, a Philadelphia-based public relations and marketing agency for financial services companies. “But you need to be delicate and sensitive about how to approach it.”     Still tainted by the 2007-09 financial crisis, the industry has been searching for ways to repair its image in Washington, where bank bashing is a competitive sport among liberal Democrats.     That hostility is set to intensify with progressive firebrand Maxine Waters taking over as chair of the House Financial Services Committee and Wall Street critic Senator Elizabeth Warren exploring a bid for the 2020 presidential race.     Warren and Waters have urged lenders to go easy on cash-strapped federal workers, but on this occasion the industry – spying a rare public relations opportunity – has been one step ahead of their Capitol Hill critics.     Earlier this month, Bank of America launched a program to help affected customers and pledged $10,000 to an emergency fund to provide assistance to furloughed workers.     Wells Fargo, which is struggling to scrub its image following a series of scandals, has given $250,000 in charitable assistance and so far waived around $3 million in fees, according to Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan, who condemned the government shutdown as “completely embarrassing” in comments to “CBS This Morning” on Friday.    Not to be outdone, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on Friday said in a memo that the bank was donating $1 million to charities providing assistance to federal workers.     In Washington, industry groups such as the American Bankers Association (ABA) have been quick to create websites showcasing such efforts, which they have also enthusiastically flagged to lawmakers.      “A furloughed federal employee was so appreciative of receiving an unsecured loan from a bank to help him make ends meet that he offered to move his other accounts when the shutdown ends,” ABA CEO Rob Nichols wrote to Waters this week.      Even Warren, the industry’s leading adversary, coughed up some praise for lenders in letters sent to bank chiefs this month seeking details on their assistance programs.     “I ... was pleased to see many credit unions and banks that serve federal employees act quickly to help them,” she wrote.

13459,"  - Microsoft Corp’s Bing search engine was accessible for some internet users in mainland China late on Thursday, indicating that online access to the foreign technology service may have been restored within the country’s Great Firewall.  Bing’s website was accessible on mobile as well as broadband connections, though some users still reported occasional difficulties and it was not clear whether resumption to service was temporary or permanent. Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It said on Wednesday that Bing had been blocked in China and that it was trying to determine its next steps.      Searches performed on Bing’s China website at cn.bing.com from within mainland China on Wednesday directed users to a page saying the server could not be reached. The government’s Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) watchdog did not respond to faxed questions about Bing’s blocked website. Bing was the only major foreign search engine accessible from within China’s so-called Great Firewall, with Microsoft censoring search results on sensitive topics, in accordance with Chinese government policy. Its main competitor in mainland China is Baidu, which this week pledged to improve its media aggregating service after a complaint about the quality of the service and its search results went viral on social media. Should Bing be blocked, it would mark Microsoft’s second setback in China since November 2017, when its Skype internet phone call and messaging service was pulled from Apple and Android app stores. Microsoft also has a partnership with Chinese data center provider 21Vianet to sell its Azure and Office 365 products.   Alphabet’s Google search platform has been blocked in China since 2010. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in December that it has no plans to relaunch a search engine in China, though it is continuing to study the idea amid increased scrutiny of big technology firms. China’s President Xi Jinping has accelerated control of the internet in China since 2016 as the ruling Communist Party has sought to crack down on dissent on social media. In a statement on Wednesday, the CAC said it had deleted more than 7 million pieces of online information and 9,382 mobile apps.  The watchdog also criticized technology company Tencent’s news app for spreading “vulgar information”.

13491,"STRASBOURG   - General Electric (GE.N), which bought Alstom’s energy business in 2015, aims to slash close to 470 jobs across the division in France in the face of falling orders worldwide, unions said on Wednesday. GE has opened negotiations to trim its staff in France under a “collective mutually agreed termination” agreement, a measure introduced in France in September 2017. An early retirement plan is also on the table, union officials said. “In a particularly difficult time for the power sector, GE is currently reviewing its businesses to ensure they are best fitted to market reality and ensure their success,” the company said. Some 229 jobs could be cut at Alstom Power Systems (APS), including 146 at GE Energy’s European headquarters in Belfort, eastern France, unions said. Another 149 jobs could go at GE Energy Power Conversion France and 90 at GE Grid, they said. GE employs 16,000 people in France, including 6,000 in the power branch. When it bought Alstom’s energy business, GE had committed to maintain jobs for at least three years in France and create 1,000 net new jobs by the end of 2018. The French government brandished the threat of fines in June 2018 after former GE Chief Executive John Flannery told Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire that the company would fail to create as many jobs as promised. A meeting on that issue is expected to take place at the finance ministry in coming weeks, a GE spokesman said.

13518,"  - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics. In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running. Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully. It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump. “It’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘I’m not a politician,” said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “We’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.” The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said. Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons. His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts. Trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven. “Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.” It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be. “Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don’t think people say, ‘Wall Street financier – that’s someone I can vote for,” he said. Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate. His campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents. Murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him. An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy’s ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll. “Obviously Goldman was his career,” said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. “Everyone has a career.” In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same. The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut’s problems. In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats. Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a “progressive entrepreneur” on his website. Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters’ concerns, political historians said. For instance, while Mitt Romney’s private-equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, Illinois voters elected private equity executive Bruce Rauner as governor in 2014.

13520,"WASHINGTON/DAVOS, Switzerland   - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it will pursue the extradition of the chief financial officer of China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s, arrested in Canada in December.   The United States has accused Meng Wanzhou of misrepresenting the company’s links to a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite U.S. sanctions. The arrest soured ties between Canada and China, which subsequently detained two Canadians and sentenced a third to death.  The U.S. statement came a day after a report that Canada’s ambassador to the United States said his government was told Washington planned to proceed.  “We will continue to pursue the extradition of defendant Ms. Meng Wanzhou, and will meet all deadlines set by the U.S.-Canada Extradition Treaty,” Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi said in a statement. “We greatly appreciate Canada’s continuing support of our mutual efforts to enforce the rule of law.” Huawei Chairman Liang Hua told media at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday that the company was following the issue closely and wanted a quick resolution of the case, but had no direct contact with authorities. The United States must file a formal request for extradition by Jan. 30. Once it is received, a Canadian court has 30 days to determine if there is enough supporting evidence and the Canadian justice minister must issue a formal order.  Canada has not asked the United States to drop its bid to have Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou extradited, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told Bloomberg TV in an interview. Huawei, the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces U.S.-led allegations that its devices present a national security risk. Huawei says such concerns are unfounded. In an editorial on Wednesday, the state-run China Daily newspaper said Canada was helping the United States try to limit China’s technological advance by “containing” Huawei. “If Canada does continue to do what is required of it by the U.S., it will certainly see its relations with China, including its trade relations, further deteriorate,” the newspaper warned. Canada had the choice not to carry out the extradition of Meng on what were trumped-up charges, it added.   It said there was no connection between Meng’s arrest and China’s detention of two Canadians - Michael Kovrig, a diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security. China would “respond” to U.S. actions, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Tuesday, when asked whether China would retaliate against the United States if Meng was extradited. But she did not elaborate.  In an article on Monday, a former head of Canada’s spy agency said the country should ban Huawei from supplying equipment to its 5G networks. China’s ambassador has threatened repercussions if Ottawa blocks Huawei. “We’ve talked about it with Germany because we have a good relationship with Germany and our European partners generally, and Germany is having some deliberations of its own too,” Freeland said on Tuesday, regarding possible curbs on Huawei’s access to 5G networks.  The German government is debating whether to follow the United States and allies like Australia in restricting Huawei from accessing its next-generation mobile networks, business daily Handelsblatt said.

13567,"ZURICH   - UBS (UBSG.S) warned of a tough start to 2019, after reporting an outflow of funds from its flagship wealth management business at the end of last year, sending a shiver through the European banking sector. Shares in Switzerland’s biggest bank fell 4 percent on Tuesday after its fourth quarter earnings fell short of analyst expectations, with the bank blaming geopolitical tensions and trade disputes for the underperformance. UBS is the first major European bank to report fourth quarter earnings, and shares in rivals Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) fell as investors fretted over  similar news from them next month.    UBS’s pivot to focus more on managing money for the world’s rich and less on volatile areas of investment banking over the past six years or so had made it one of the most stable performers among large European banks. But the fall in earnings shows its private banking business is not immune to market swings, with much of its earnings dependent on clients’ willingness to invest. “Of course in the current environment when you see trading in investment banking perform less, you see wealth management also having its issues with money and net new money figures,” Chairman Axel Weber said in an interview on Bloomberg TV, “but by and large this is a stable fee-earning business.”  Overall, UBS generated $862 million in fourth-quarter pre-tax earnings, missing analyst expectations for $985 million in the consensus provided by the bank. The Zurich-based lender, which manages more than $2 trillion of the world’s wealth, posted a 22 percent dip in fourth-quarter adjusted pre-tax earnings in wealth management as clients reduced risk in their portfolios, traded less and built up their cash positions.  The unit saw $7.9 billion in net new money outflows, a closely watched metric of future earnings. Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said UBS should be able to get back to bringing in fresh money, with the bank reaffirming targets to grow wealth management’s pre-tax profit at the upper end of a 10-15 percent target over 2019-2021. Ermotti said in October he had no doubt the bank could deliver superior and sustainable shareholder value, regardless of market conditions, but on Tuesday acknowledged its path to hitting its return on capital and cost-income targets for the year had become “steeper”. The investment bank also had a torrid quarter with a fall in earnings in its trading, capital markets and advisory businesses. In equities, usually an area of strength, UBS posted a 13 percent drop in earnings from a year earlier, bucking the trend seen at U.S. banks last week which largely had a strong quarter for stock market trading. The bank proposed a dividend of 0.70 Swiss francs for 2018, up from 0.65 Swiss francs the prior year, and said it aimed to buy back up to $1 billion in shares in 2019.

13653,"BEIJING   - Growth in property investment in China cooled to the second slowest pace in 2018 in December, adding to signs of a further slackening in the real estate market in a blow to a key driver economic growth. Real estate investment, which mainly focuses on the residential sector but includes commercial and office space, rose 8.2 percent in December from a year earlier, down from 9.3 percent in November, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday. That was just ahead of the slowest pace of growth last year at 7.7 percent recorded for October. For the full year, property investment increased 9.5 percent from the year-earlier period, down from 9.7 percent in January-November.  In December, property sales by floor area, a major indicator of demand, rose a touch by 0.9 percent from a year earlier, the first gain in four months and compared with November’s 5.1 percent drop.  For 2018, property sales by area rose a modest 1.3 percent from a year earlier, official data showed. Analysts say a continued downturn in sales on the back of tight government controls to curb speculation could add to the growing pressure on the world’s second-largest economy.  The real estate sector is a key pillar of the economy, so any further weakness in sales could influence the pace and scope of fresh stimulus measures expected from Beijing this year. Analysts predict the softer sales will constrain price growth in coming months, dampening developers’ appetite for front-loading construction. Funds raised by China’s property developers grew 6.4 percent in 2018 on an annual basis. That was slower from the pace of 7.6 percent in the first eleven months, according to the statistics bureau.  Measured by floor area, construction starts surged 20.5 percent from a year earlier, down from 21.7 percent in November, according to Reuters calculations.

13675,"ROME   - Telecom Italia (TIM) (TLIT.MI) has suffered a setback in its plan to assuage pressures for a separation of its prized network assets by placing them into a wholly owned subsidiary, as the industry regulator said it was opposed to the proposal. TIM has been under pressure for years from Italian politicians, regulators and rivals to separate and upgrade its network, which analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros  ($17 billion). Before being ousted in November former TIM chief Amos Genish set out a plan to spin off the network into a fully controlled separate company, but communications regulator AGCOM has given an initial thumbs down to the idea since TIM would continue to have significant power in the market. In a document published on its website the watchdog said it was launching a 45-day public consultation on the plan, results of which would help it draw up a final decision in coming months. A spokesman for TIM declined comment. Italy’s biggest phone group gives rivals such as Vodafone (VOD.L), Wind and Fastweb (SCMN.S) access to its network infrastructure, but also competes with them when it sells its own telecom services to customers.  AGCOM said that under TIM’s plan, by keeping control of the new company it would be in the position of being able to favor its own companies to the detriment of competitors. Pressure on TIM to spin off its fixed access network  intensified after French media group Vivendi (VIV.PA), the Italian phone group’s biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, named Genish at the helm of the group in September 2017 and began to exert greater influence, which upset the Italian government. Since coming to power in June the government has placed the creation of a fast broadband network at the heart of its industrial policy and is drafting measures to help create one single network player for the country, which could combine TIM’s network with that of smaller rival Open Fiber. TIM has also been caught since early last year in a battle between Vivendi and U.S. activist fund Elliott over how to revive the Italian company, which is saddled with 25 billion euros of debt. TIM appointed Luigi Gubitosi as chief executive in November.

13725,"SACRAMENTO, Calif.   - California will move its presidential primary from June to March under a bill signed on Wednesday by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, a change aimed at giving the liberal-leaning state more influence in choosing candidates from either national party. The most populous U.S. state, which voted heavily for Democrat Hillary Clinton in November’s presidential election, has traditionally held its primary so late that Democratic and Republican voters in other states had essentially already chosen their parties’ candidates. “The Golden State will no longer be relegated to last place in the presidential nominating process,” said Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat who backed the change, in a statement. “Candidates will not be able to ignore the largest, most diverse state in the nation as they seek our country’s highest office.” The bill was passed mostly along party lines in the majority-Democrat legislature. The new date will leave the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary in place as the first and second contests of the presidential election cycle, during which voters in each state choose the candidate they would like their party to nominate for president. Because California’s primary has been in June while others were held earlier, candidates have largely ignored the state, spending less on outreach than elsewhere, making fewer visits, and failing to prioritize California voters’ concerns in their campaigns, supporters said. In 2016, California Democrats chose Clinton and Republicans opted for Donald Trump, the populist businessman who ultimately won the presidency. Backers in the legislature said the early primary would lead to less divisive choices by members of both major parties in the 2020 election cycle, and establish California as a leading voice in the choice of candidates. Progressive Democrats also believe that moving the primary up could result in their party’s selection of more liberal candidates. “California is the beating heart of the national resistance to Trump, and California Democrats are defining the progressive agenda for America,” state Democratic Party Chairman Eric Bauman said in a press release. “When it comes to deciding the Democratic nominee, our voices need to be heard early in the process.” ",California moves presidential primary for bigger say in candidate choice,"September 27, 2017 /  11:38 PM ",sacramento calif california will move its presidential primary from june to march under a bill signed on wednesday by democratic governor jerry brown a change aimed at giving the liberal leaning state more influence in choosing candidates from either national party the most populous u s state which voted heavily for democrat hillary clinton in november s presidential election has traditionally held its primary so late that democratic and republican voters in other states had essentially already chosen their parties candidates the golden state will no longer be relegated to last place in the presidential nominating process said secretary of state alex padilla a democrat who backed the change in a statement candidates will not be able to ignore the largest most diverse state in the nation as they seek our country s highest office the bill was passed mostly along party lines in the majority democrat legislature the new date will leave the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary in place as the first and second contests of the presidential election cycle during which voters in each state choose the candidate they would like their party to nominate for president because california s primary has been in june while others were held earlier candidates have largely ignored the state spending less on outreach than elsewhere making fewer visits and failing to prioritize california voters concerns in their campaigns supporters said in  california democrats chose clinton and republicans opted for donald trump the populist businessman who ultimately won the presidency backers in the legislature said the early primary would lead to less divisive choices by members of both major parties in the  election cycle and establish california as a leading voice in the choice of candidates progressive democrats also believe that moving the primary up could result in their party s selection of more liberal candidates california is the beating heart of the national resistance to trump and california democrats are defining the progressive agenda for america state democratic party chairman eric bauman said in a press release when it comes to deciding the democratic nominee our voices need to be heard early in the process ,Boeing Crisis,0.22748291492462158
13735,"BOSTON   - Two of America’s best-known green investors are reassessing their stakes in global insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher & Co after a Reuters investigation into the company’s lucrative side-business in “clean coal”. A.J. Gallagher (AJG.N) has invested in 34 facilities producing so-called refined coal, which is chemically treated to make it burn cleaner and heavily subsidized by the U.S. government. The firm also holds a 46.5 percent stake in Chem-Mod LLC, which provides the chemicals used to produce the fuel.  A.J. Gallagher has accumulated about $850 million worth of U.S. government tax credits from the business. But many utilities burning the coal have pumped out more smog, not less, over the past decade, and the chemicals have contributed to elevated carcinogens in downstream drinking water supplied to more than 1 million people, according to the Reuters Special Report. Now, the Green Century Funds and Calvert Funds - which include A.J. Gallagher in their portfolios based on its record as an insurance firm, not a coal supplier - said they will review the company’s green credentials. Green Century and Calvert are two of nation’s leading money managers focused on corporate environmental, social and governance matters.  The idea behind the strategy is to help investors sidestep companies whose activities they find objectionable, such as polluting the environment.  “In light of this new information, we certainly will … press the company to stop profiting from schemes devised by the fossil fuel industry to the detriment of U.S. citizens and taxpayers,” Green Century said in a statement, calling clean coal “a myth”. A.J. Gallagher is one of about 360 companies in the $250 million Green Century Equity Fund GECQX.O, which advertises itself as “100% percent fossil fuel free.” The fund, which held 4,394 A.J. Gallagher shares at the end of October, is passively managed and invests in the companies that are in an index run by MSCI Inc (MSCI.N). MSCI declined to comment for this story. Calvert Research and Management, a unit of Eaton Vance Corp, said it has contacted A.J. Gallagher as part of a reassessment of the company’s ESG performance. A.J. Gallagher is a holding in the $1.3 billion Calvert U.S. Large Cap Core Responsible Index Fund (CISIX.O). “In response to this new information, we have contacted the company and will consider this information in our assessment of ESG performance,” Calvert said in a statement, referring to the Reuters reporting.  The Calvert fund has built its own index, drawing from the 1,000 largest publicly-traded U.S. companies based on market capitalization. From there, using its own principles for responsible investment, that list had been narrowed to about 720 companies, including A.J. Gallagher. A.J. Gallagher did not respond to messages seeking comment. Assets in portfolios that use various ESG-related criteria have grown to about $23 trillion globally, an increase of more than 600 percent over the past decade, fund research firm Morningstar Inc said in a 2018 report. Shares of A.J. Gallagher are held in at least ten other mutual funds that screen companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, including ones run by BlackRock Inc, Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group. The company’s broad inclusion highlights the lack of clear criteria for how companies’ environmental credentials are vetted in this fast-growing green investment sector, said Vanguard spokesman John Woerth. “There is no universally-accepted definition of ESG,” he said in a statement to Reuters. The $4.4 billion Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund (VFTSX.O) holds an investment in A.J. Gallagher. But Vanguard does not pick the companies in the index fund it offers to investors, Woerth said. That job is done by index providers such as MSCI, or in Vanguard’s case, FTSE Russell.  “Index funds are beholden to the benchmarks they track,” he said. “While we engage with index providers to understand their methodologies, it is our view that index providers are independent and should have complete autonomy when constructing an index and assembling its constituents.” Jill Davies, a town board member for Woodstock, Vermont - which has endowment money invested in the Vanguard fund - said she was disappointed by the company’s inclusion. A.J. Gallagher’s “activities in coal don’t seem to align with the social responsibility concept behind this Vanguard fund,” she said.  FTSE Russell said it was working to improve its ESG screening methods.  “This is especially relevant in a rapidly expanding area like ESG,” FTSE spokesman Tim Benedict said in a statement.

13739,"PARIS   - Renault (RENA.PA) expects to deliver sales growth in 2019, despite the imminent ouster of Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn and tension with alliance partner Nissan (7201.T). “Volumes progressed across almost all our regions (in 2018), and we’re entering 2019 with expectations for a slight increase in sales,” Renault sales chief Olivier Murguet told reporters. Murguet declined to comment on the leadership crisis engulfing Renault-Nissan following Ghosn’s arrest in Japan for alleged financial misconduct or any sales impact it may have. The French carmaker posted a 3.2 percent increase in vehicle sales last year, boosted by a new Chinese joint venture and rebounding demand in Russia and Latin America. On Thursday, acting chairman Philippe Lagayette said that Renault will appoint new leadership after the French government, its biggest shareholder, called for Ghosn’s replacement almost two months after his Nov. 19 arrest. The Renault board and its nominations committee are expected to meet within days to consider potential successors including Michelin (MICP.PA) CEO Jean-Dominique Senard, senior Toyota (7203.T) executive Didier Leroy and Ghosn’s Renault deputy Thierry Bollore, sources have told Reuters. Ghosn has been charged over allegations he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the company itself have also been indicted. Both men deny the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure, while former alliance boss Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008. Renault’s sales rose to a record 3.88 million vehicles last year - including some 166,000 sold through its new partnership with China’s Brilliance (1114.HK). Global sales excluding the joint venture fell 1.2 percent. The carmaker only narrowly avoided being overtaken by arch-rival PSA Group, outselling the Peugeot maker by 6,530 vehicles. Unlike Renault, PSA avoided major disruption from tougher new “WLTP” emissions tests introduced in September, and increased sales 6.8 percent to 3.88 million vehicles in 2018 thanks largely to its acquisition of Opel-Vauxhall. Renault’s share of the European passenger car market shed more than one point to 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter, from 10.9 percent a year earlier. While the global sales decline - excluding Brilliance - reflected setbacks in Turkey, Iran, China and India, Renault nonetheless outperformed a weak home market, with a 0.5 percent gain in European vehicle sales including vans. The company said it expects automotive markets to be “stable” in Europe and globally this year, with Russia growing 3 percent and Brazil expanding 10 percent. Murguet also said Renault had no plans to stockpile vehicles in preparation for Britain’s exit from the European Union in March, in case London and Brussels fail to reach an exit deal. “Stockpiling is expensive and short-termist,” Murguet said, adding: “we’ll take an extremely pragmatic sales approach and adapt extremely rapidly.” ","Gripped by Ghosn crisis, Renault expects slight sales growth","January 18, 2019 /  8:01 AM ",paris renault rena pa expects to deliver sales growth in  despite the imminent ouster of chairman and chief executive carlos ghosn and tension with alliance partner nissan  t volumes progressed across almost all our regions in  and we re entering  with expectations for a slight increase in sales renault sales chief olivier murguet told reporters murguet declined to comment on the leadership crisis engulfing renault nissan following ghosn s arrest in japan for alleged financial misconduct or any sales impact it may have the french carmaker posted a   percent increase in vehicle sales last year boosted by a new chinese joint venture and rebounding demand in russia and latin america on thursday acting chairman philippe lagayette said that renault will appoint new leadership after the french government its biggest shareholder called for ghosn s replacement almost two months after his nov  arrest the renault board and its nominations committee are expected to meet within days to consider potential successors including michelin micp pa ceo jean dominique senard senior toyota  t executive didier leroy and ghosn s renault deputy thierry bollore sources have told  ghosn has been charged over allegations he failed to disclose close to  million in additional compensation for   that he had arranged to be paid later nissan director greg kelly and the company itself have also been indicted both men deny the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure while former alliance boss ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to nissan in  renault s sales rose to a record   million vehicles last year including some   sold through its new partnership with china s brilliance  hk global sales excluding the joint venture fell   percent the carmaker only narrowly avoided being overtaken by arch rival psa group outselling the peugeot maker by   vehicles unlike renault psa avoided major disruption from tougher new wltp emissions tests introduced in september and increased sales   percent to   million vehicles in  thanks largely to its acquisition of opel vauxhall renault s share of the european passenger car market shed more than one point to   percent in the fourth quarter from   percent a year earlier while the global sales decline excluding brilliance reflected setbacks in turkey iran china and india renault nonetheless outperformed a weak home market with a   percent gain in european vehicle sales including vans the company said it expects automotive markets to be stable in europe and globally this year with russia growing  percent and brazil expanding  percent murguet also said renault had no plans to stockpile vehicles in preparation for britain s exit from the european union in march in case london and brussels fail to reach an exit deal stockpiling is expensive and short termist murguet said adding we ll take an extremely pragmatic sales approach and adapt extremely rapidly ,Boeing Crisis,0.2846587598323822
13767,"NEW YORK   - U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday as hopes of a resolution to the trade dispute between the United States and China boosted industrial shares and lifted investor sentiment. Stocks spiked higher in afternoon trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports and suggested offering a tariff rollback during trade discussions scheduled for Jan. 30. S&P 500 industrial stocks .SPLRCI, which have been sensitive to trade developments, rose 1.7 percent. They held most of their gains even as U.S. stocks pulled back from session highs after a Treasury spokesman said that Mnuchin had not made any such recommendations. “The market reaction is really telling,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. “It shows how badly people want the trade war to end.” Earlier, industrial stocks had moved higher as shares of defense contractors rose after President Donald Trump unveiled a new U.S. missile defense strategy. Shares of Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) advanced 3.3 percent, and shares of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) gained 2.4 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 162.94 points, or 0.67 percent, to 24,370.1, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 19.86 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,635.96 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 49.77 points, or 0.71 percent, to 7,084.46. With Thursday’s gains, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed above its 50-day moving average for the first time since Dec. 3. The S&P 500 is 10.1 percent away from its Sept. 20 record close after having rallied from a 20-month low on Christmas Eve on concerns over a global economic slowdown. Also helping to boost stocks on Thursday was a rebound in financial shares, which ended 0.5 percent higher after having dropped as much as 1 percent. The financial index has posted gains for seven straight sessions. However, shares of Morgan Stanley (MS.N) ended 4.4 percent lower after the investment bank reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit. In after-hours trading, shares of Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) fell 2 percent after the video-streaming company reported quarterly results. Analysts have cut their fourth-quarter profit growth forecast for S&P 500 companies to 14.2 percent from 20.1 percent estimated on Oct. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.45-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 23 new lows.

13802,"  - The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed William Emanuel, a veteran  management-side labor lawyer, to the National Labor Relations Board, giving the agency a Republican majority widely expected to roll back recent decisions that business groups have said favored unions. Emanuel, a partner with global labor-law firm Littler Mendelson, was confirmed 49-47 by the Republican-controlled Senate. President Donald Trump nominated Emanuel and Marvin Kaplan, a lawyer and former Republican congressional aide, to the board earlier this year. Kaplan was confirmed in August. The NLRB oversees union elections and disputes between private-sector employers, workers and unions.  Republicans will now have a 3-2 edge on the board. Business groups and many Republicans lawmakers have called on the agency to revisit significant changes to labor policy adopted during the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama. They include rules designed to speed up the union election process and a 2015 decision that made it easier for companies to be found to be joint employers and held liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies and franchisees. Emanuel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  said that during the Obama administration, the board strayed from its role as “a neutral umpire in labor disputes.” “It’s time to get back to that important original mission,” he said. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said, however, that  Emanuel should not join the NLRB after spending 40 years trying to prevent workers from organizing. Emanuel has worked with Republicans in Congress and trade groups including the National Retail Federation and National Association of Manufacturers, and has defended employers for decades in NLRB cases.  He is a member of the conservative Federalist Society, an influential group of lawyers credited with pushing Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch to U.S. Supreme Court. At a Senate confirmation hearing in August, several Democrats questioned whether Emanuel would properly consider workers’ collective bargaining rights after long representing employers and trade groups.

13825,"DETROIT   - Auto executives gathered in Detroit on Monday called on the Trump administration and Congress to resolve trade disputes, and end the government shutdown, saying political uncertainty is costing the industry.  U.S. trade officials are negotiating a new deal with China  in hopes of avoiding new tariffs, while a new regional trade agreement with Canada and Mexico still needs congressional approval. Automakers producing vehicles in the United States are  contending with U.S. steel and aluminum prices driven higher by Trump administration tariffs. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) Chief Executive Mike Manley told reporters at the Detroit auto show on Monday that U.S. metals tariffs will raise the automaker’s 2019 costs by $300 million to $350 million, or about $135 to $160 a vehicle, based on the automaker’s 2018 U.S. sales.  Toyota Motor Corp’s (7203.T) executive vice president for North American sales, Bob Carter, said the company has had to raise prices three times because of higher tariff costs - even though 96 percent of steel in Toyota U.S. vehicles is from U.S. steel plants. The tariffs boosted industry vehicles prices by about $600 on average, he estimated. General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) are also taking financial hits from the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs. “Those are headwinds,” GM President Mark Reuss told Reuters. “It’s our job to run the business to offset those headwinds.” GM Chief Executive Mary Barra last Friday promised investors the company would boost 2019 profit despite tariff-related costs and investments in electric vehicles. She stuck to her plans to target five North American factories for closure and cut nearly 15,000 jobs overall. About one-quarter of federal government operations have been shut down by a lack of funding since Dec. 22 after President Donald Trump demanded $5.7 billion this year from Congress for building a security wall on the southwest U.S. border. Manley said the U.S. government shutdown is holding up certification of one of the company’s new heavy duty pickup truck models. Those vehicles are among the company’s most profitable products. “The earlier it can be resolved, clearly the better,” he said. Concern in the auto industry about the uncertainty created by Trump’s efforts to revamp trade and environmental policies is weighing more heavily as forecasters call for a slowdown in vehicle demand in the United States and China during 2019. “There’s a lot of balls in the air right now that are unresolved,” Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. told Reuters on the sidelines of the auto show. “Certainty is something we really desire because of our product lead times. We don’t have that right now.” Ford said the automaker feels its opinions are being heard by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, but he has no idea when the various issues will be resolved. U.S.-China trade tensions have forced Chinese automaker GAC to delay its planned entry to the U.S. market, Wang Qiujing, head of GAC’s (601238.SS) research and development center, told Reuters on Monday. “We have postponed our launch until the first half of 2020,” he said, adding that the timing will depend on the outcome of U.S.-China trade negotiations. If the current 25 percent U.S. tariff on Chinese-made vehicles continues, “the impact will be very significant,” he said. GAC has a large display at the Detroit auto show, and is hiring engineers and designers at three U.S. locations, including a new technical office in Detroit expected to employ about 30 people, Wang said. Auto executives have welcomed the conclusion of a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, as the industry seeks certainty for rules that will govern automakers’ long-term investment decisions in the region.  In the interest of greater certainty, they would like to see the U.S. Congress decide quickly on the updated agreement’s fate. “We just need it resolved,” said Brian Smith, chief operating officer for Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) in North America, who added that the automaker needs clarity so it can adjust its supply chain as necessary. “It’s been going on way too long.” U.S. officials are weighing so-called Section 232 national security tariffs on imported vehicles. That tariff would not hit U.S.-made models, but some analysts warn it could trigger a sales slump as prices for European and Asian-made models jump. “The decline in volumes could be larger than a recession would produce,” Jonathan Smoke, an economist with auto market information company Cox Automotive, said during a briefing on Sunday. Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) CEO Herbert Diess on Monday announced the German automaker would invest $800 million in its Chattanooga, Tennessee, plant and add 1,000 jobs to build electric vehicles as it faces pressure from the Trump administration. VW is worried the Trump administration will move ahead with new tariffs and hopes the new investments will help the German automaker avoid them. “We have strongly been encouraged to invest more, which we will do,” said Diess, who met with Trump last month.

13831,"NEW YORK   - Major world stock indexes rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 supported by sharply higher U.S. bank shares after strong earnings, while the pound was up after British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government won a confidence vote in parliament. That should allow her to attempt to create a consensus among lawmakers on an agreement on Britain’s departure from the European Union. The confidence vote followed the parliamentary defeat of May’s Brexit deal late Tuesday. Expectations of a softer Brexit - perhaps incorporating the Labour Party’s idea of membership of a permanent customs union - gave some support to the pound.  Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2873, up 0.12 percent on the day. Stocks mostly shrugged off the results of the vote. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.39 percent. On Wall Street, strong earnings from Bank of America (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) helped to keep stocks in positive territory. Bank of America shares were up more than 7 percent while Goldman’s stock was up about 8 percent. “There is hope for this earnings season, and Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have got it started off on the right foot,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 218.87 points, or 0.91 percent, to 24,284.46, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 15.34 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,625.64 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 32.57 points, or 0.46 percent, to 7,056.40. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.54 percent. The dollar rose against the euro as the euro zone single currency was pushed lower by worries about the zone's economy, with the euro EUR= down 0.12 percent to $1.14. Earlier this week, data showed Germany barely escaped a recession in the second half of 2018 and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi warned on Tuesday the euro zone economy was weaker than anticipated. In sovereign debt markets, British government bonds underperformed versus German peers in early trade. U.S. Treasury yields rose as stronger-than-forecast results from two major banks lifted Wall Street, reducing safe-haven demand for U.S. government debt.

13852,"  - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Officer David Solomon on Wednesday apologised to the Malaysian people for former banker Tim Leissner’s role in the sovereign wealth fund 1MDB scandal, but said the bank had conducted due diligence before every transaction. Goldman is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion (£5 billion) for 1Malaysia Development Berhad. U.S prosecutors last year charged two former Goldman bankers for the theft of billions of dollars from 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. “It’s very clear that the people of Malaysia were defrauded by many individuals, including the highest members of the prior government,” Solomon said on conference call discussing the bank’s fourth-quarter results. Solomon said that Leissner denied the involvement of any of Goldman’s intermediaries in transactions with 1MDB. An attorney representing Leissner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Roger Ng, the other charged former Goldman banker, was arrested in Malaysia at the request of U.S. authorities and is expected to be extradited, according to John Marzulli, a spokesman for the prosecution. The DOJ has said that $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014. As part of Goldman’s due diligence efforts, Solomon said the bank sought and received written assurances from 1MDB and International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) that no third-parties were involved in the first two bond sales. Abu Dhabi’s IPIC had co-guaranteed the 1MDB bonds when they were issued in 2012. In the final offering, the Malaysian government itself, along with 1MDB, represented that no intermediaries were involved, he said. “All these representations to Goldman Sachs have proven to be false,” Solomon said. Goldman Sachs did not disclose any other information about its involvement with 1MDB, but said the impact on its client franchise had been “de minimis.” Shares of the bank, which reported strong fourth-quarter results earlier in the day, have fallen over 25 percent in the last three months, after headlines about its involvement with the sovereign wealth fund emerged. The Malaysian government said in December it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB.

13864,"MILAN   - John Elkann, chairman of Ferrari (RACE.MI) and main shareholder Exor (EXOR.MI), reiterated his support for Ferrari chief executive Louis Camilleri, denying speculation a top management purge could be on the cards. “I deny all rumors about both a possible return to the past and changes in our structure,” Elkann, a scion of Italy’s Agnelli family, said in a letter published on Wednesday in Italy’s Gazzetta dello Sport. “My commitment to ensuring stability and concentration at Ferrari is total as is that of CEO Louis Camilleri,” he said. The sudden death in July last year of chairman and CEO Sergio Marchionne triggered a change at the top of the luxury sportscar maker with Camilleri taking over as chief executive and Elkann as chairman. In September Camilleri described as “aspirational” targets set by Marchionne. After the replacement this month of Maurizio Arrivabene by Mattia Binotto as Formula One principal, media speculation grew over a possible broader management shake-up. “The appointment of Mattia Binotto... does not represent any overhaul,” Elkann said, adding the company had picked the new principal in common agreement with Arrivabene.

13875,"SHANGHAI   - China’s central bank injected a record $83 billion into the country’s financial system on Wednesday, seeking to avoid a cash crunch that would put further pressure on the weakening economy. China’s policymakers are pledging to step up stimulus measures this year and do more to protect jobs as economic growth cools to 28-year lows. But a raft of measures last year from big rail projects to tax cuts seem to have had little impact so far, with recent data suggesting activity is cooling more quickly than expected.     “The news is clear - the economy needs help,” said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for emerging Asia at Natixis in Hong Kong. Wednesday’s open-market operation, the bank’s largest net single-day injection on record, came a day after China’s state planner, central bank and finance ministry all offered reassurances to investors, signaling more spending and other types of policy support. But shockingly weak December trade data released earlier this week, along with shrinking factory activity, are stirring speculation over whether more rapid and aggressive policy measures are needed to turn the world’s second-largest economy around. Authorities now agree the economy needs more decisive support “and today’s large injection reflects that,” Nguyen added. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said Wednesday’s injection was aimed at ensuring there are ample funds in the financial system, which is facing strains as tax payments peak in mid-January, and as demand for cash picks up ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays starting in early February. “The banking system’s overall liquidity is falling rapidly,” it said in a statement. While sizable injections are common this time of year ahead of the long holidays, the addition was much heftier than usual and follows a large cut in banks’ reserve ratios announced this month, which will free up a total of $116 billion for new bank lending. The first stage, a 50-basis-point cut, came into effect on Tuesday. An equal-sized cut is scheduled for Jan. 25. The move also came a day after money supply data showed several of China’s key credit gauges continue to languish around record lows, despite government efforts to channel more funds to cash-starved companies and lower their financing costs.  While authorities have urged banks to keep lending to struggling firms and even dangled incentives, banks are wary of bad loans after a long regulatory crackdown on riskier lending. Many businesses, facing slowing sales, are in no mood to make the fresh investments that Beijing is counting on. New medium- and long-term corporate loans last month fell to less than half of average December levels, Nomura noted. Chinese officials have repeatedly pledged more support for the economy while vowing they will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus that Beijing has unleashed in the past, which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt. Asked if the PBOC needed to cut benchmark interest rates, a PBOC deputy said on Tuesday that existing policy measures should be improved. Analysts at OCBC said the comments suggest the PBOC is willing to give existing measures time to work, and is in no rush to switch to more aggressive tactics at this point.  “I have never seen such huge amounts of reverse repos ... the central bank is making its attitude known,” said a trader at a brokerage house in Shanghai. “It’s saying, ‘don’t question my determination’” to stabilize market expectations, the trader said. Markets appear to agree that policymakers will stick with  modest measures for some time yet. Chinese stocks and money market rates, sensitive to hints of policy shifts, were little changed on Wednesday. The seven-day repo rate, CN7DRP=CFXS, a closely watched measure of liquidity, was 2.6142 percent on Wednesday afternoon, slightly lower than the previous day’s close. “While the (PBOC’s) net injection is big, it’s little versus what a rate cut would release, which is what people in the market are watching for,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho in Hong Kong. In a rare encouraging sign, home prices remained buoyant in December, suggesting that at least some of Beijing’s efforts at support are beginning to have an effect. Construction also appears to be slowly picking up as regulators fast-track approvals of more infrastructure projects.     But analysts agree steps so far will take some time to percolate through the broader economy, with most not expecting activity to convincingly bottom out until summer.      On Monday, China is expected to report the economy grew 6.6 percent in 2018, cooling from 6.9 percent the previous year and the slowest rate of expansion the country has seen in 28 years. The pace is expected to slow further to around 6.2 percent this year. Some analysts’ in-house models suggesting activity is already much weaker than official data suggests. (For a related graphic click tmsnrt.rs/2SVUUFp) Darkening the picture further, hopes are dimming once again that China will be able to reach a trade deal with the United States in current negotiations. U.S. tariffs have increasingly weighed on Chinese exports in recent months, disrupting its supply chains and dragging down business and consumer confidence.       U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer did not see any progress made on structural issues during U.S. talks with China last week, Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said on Tuesday.

13891,"  - Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone will be leaving Snap Inc (SNAP.N) less than a year after taking the job, the company said on Tuesday, the latest in a string of executive departures from Snap over the past year. Shares of Snap dropped 8 percent to $6.02 in after market trading. Stone's departure is not related to any disagreements with the company, which owns popular photo messaging app Snapchat, Snap said in a filing bit.ly/2McCRIt. Snap has faced high-profile troubles recently as it continues to grapple with a widely-panned redesign of the Snapchat app, which was attributed to a decline in Snapchat users over the past two quarters.  It has also struggled with high turnover in its top ranks. Former Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan and Vice President of content Nick Bell left the company in September and November, respectively.  Snap also said in the filing it expects to report fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization near the top end of its guidance.  The company previously said it expected fourth quarter revenue between $355 million to $380 million.   Stone will remain at Snap to help with the transition and the company’s fourth quarter earnings call on Feb. 5, said Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel in a memo to employees on Tuesday, seen by Reuters.    “Tim has made a big impact in his short time on our team and we are very grateful for all of his hard work,” Spiegel said.

13933,"LONDON   - Britain’s plans to leave the European Union could be thrown into disarray by a vote in parliament later on Tuesday but bets are mounting that a chaotic no-deal Brexit can be avoided and that sterling will rise from here.  After slumping 7 percent in 2018, the pound has started the year on the front foot. It scaled $1.29 on Tuesday, hours before  British lawmakers are due to vote on the withdrawal agreement Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the EU.  They are expected to reject the deal, barely 2-1/2 months before Britain is due to leave the bloc, opening up a range of outcomes, from quitting with no agreement on future relations to halting Brexit altogether.  But even amidst the tumult some investors are starting to view medium-term sterling valuations as decently priced, market positioning overly negative and the dollar topped out. They reckon the chances of a no-deal Brexit — long seen as the worst case scenario for the pound — are diminishing as parliament exerts greater control over the process. On Friday, hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a major donor to the Brexit campaign, went as far as to say he now expects the project to be abandoned altogether and that he is positioning for the pound to strengthen. “A pretty poor outcome from Brexit has already been discounted so sterling, from here, will move more on good news than bad,” said Kit Juckes, global head of FX strategy at Societe Generale.  “Anything short of a no-deal Brexit is likely sterling positive.” This view is evident in the options market where the risk of sterling falling against the dollar is deemed the lowest in over seven months, according to one-month risk reversals GBP1MRR=FN. (GRAPHIC: Sterling risk reversals - tmsnrt.rs/2H5ef5w) The outlook for a sterling bounce is also supported by valuations. Based on the real effective exchange rate — a currency’s value against trade partners’ currencies, adjusted for inflation — sterling is 6 percent below its five-year average, and 14 percent below its 20-year average. “At the moment a no-deal [Brexit] is looking very unlikely so UK assets are probably undervalued and there is some upside potential in the currency,” said Roberto Coronado, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. He has a small long position in sterling versus the dollar. Odey said he had changed his view in the last month and that the pound “looks like it could be quite strong” and rise to $1.32 or $1.35 against the dollar, from around $1.27 currently.     Odey Asset Management’s flagship fund had previously reaped the benefits of betting against UK assets amid wider market fears about the impact of Brexit. NO NO-DEAL Foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters last week saw the pound gaining more than 8 percent against the U.S. dollar this year — assuming Britain and the EU part ways amicably. Ruling out a no-deal Brexit, as some lawmakers are seeking to do, would allow traders to actually take a directional view and buy sterling. Lessening the risk of serious upheaval when Britain leaves the world’s biggest trading bloc on March 29 could also allow the Bank of England to raise interest rates, which would further underpin the pound.  A Reuters poll of economists published on Tuesday showed respondents expect some kind of deal to pass, followed by a 25 basis-point rate rise later in the year. They overwhelmingly saw a free-trade agreement between Britain and the EU as the most likely eventual outcome of Brexit.     With the U.S. Federal Reserve looking set to pause its own policy tightening, that would suggest potential for sterling strength.  “If we get through Brexit by avoiding no-deal, the BoE will be limbering up for rate hikes,” said Sarah Hewin, chief Europe economist at Standard Chartered. “In 12 months we have sterling recovering to the low $1.40s.” (GRAPHIC: Trade-weighted sterling historically undervalued - tmsnrt.rs/2SV4gRD) But getting there could be “painful”, Hewin added.  Others said positioning for a brighter sterling outlook remains tricky. LMAX Exchange analyst Joel Kruger said he found it too risky to wade in and planned to take option positions on sterling only if it breaks above $1.33 or falls below $1.23.  The pound was trading at $1.2850 on Tuesday. One way to do it is via implied volatility options — a bet on sterling staying erratic, although with sterling volatility still higher than many emerging market currencies and the highest of all G10 currencies, that is an expensive trade.  Betting the pound will remain in a relatively tight range against the euro — another currency that could be expected to move on Brexit news — is another option, according to Juckes.  Sterling traded mostly in a range of 86 to 90 pence against the euro EURGBP=D3 last year. It swung more violently versus the dollar but that is partly down to the greenback’s own volatility in 2018.

13973,"NEW YORK   - One of the rare market bright spots last year, the U.S. healthcare sector remains a Wall Street darling despite a slow start to 2019.  As 2019 begins, healthcare .SPXHC is the most favored of the 11 main S&P 500 sectors, according to a Reuters review of ratings from 13 large Wall Street research firms, which recommend how to weigh those groups in investment portfolios. Healthcare shares overall rose 4.7 percent last year, one of only two S&P 500 sectors, along with utilities, to post positive returns in 2018 as the benchmark index fell 6.2 percent.  Proponents cite the healthcare sector’s reasonable valuations, strong balance sheets and dividend payments among many companies, as well as the group’s upbeat outlook for earnings, which are less susceptible to economic cycles than other businesses. If economic growth is slowing, some investors are wary of being too invested in cyclical sectors that thrive during an upswing, but do not want to be too defensive either. “We are trying to find things that skirt both of those two categorizations, and healthcare is a really nice diversified earnings stream,” said Noah Weisberger, managing director for U.S. portfolio strategy at Bernstein. Such diversity stems from the variety of companies comprising the sector: manufacturers of prescription medicines, makers of medical devices, such as heart valves and knee replacements, health insurers, hospitals and providers of tools for scientific research. From a stock perspective, that means the sector includes potential fast-growing stocks, such as biotechs that can carry more risk and more reward, or large pharmaceutical companies and others that offer steadier, slower growth. Investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates sold some pharmaceutical holdings late last year that had posted big gains, such as Merck & Co (MRK.N), to move into biotech stocks it believed were undervalued, said Alan Lancz, the firm’s president. “We have maintained our overweighting, which is unusual for us with a sector that has outperformed so dramatically,” Lancz said. “But mainly there are segments within the sector that still offer opportunity.” (GRAPHIC: Healthcare is most favored sector on Wall Street  - tmsnrt.rs/2HaLYKT)  For 2019, healthcare companies in the S&P 500 are expected to increase earnings by 7.5 percent, ahead of the 6.3 percent growth estimated for S&P 500 companies overall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), the sector’s third-largest company by market value, kicks off fourth-quarter earnings season for healthcare on Tuesday. “Healthcare is one of the few sectors with high quality, above-market growth and it’s relatively immune to the array of macro headwinds that we see out there,” said Martin Jarzebowski, sector head of healthcare for Federated Investors. Healthcare shares could also benefit from anticipation of increased dealmaking activity after two large acquisitions of biotechs were already announced this year. Despite healthcare’s outperformance last year, the sector is trading at the same valuation as the S&P 500 - 14.5 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months - whereas healthcare on average has held a premium over the market for the past 20 years, according to Refinitiv data. The sector also is valued at a discount, by such price-to-earnings measures, to defensive sectors, including consumer staples .SPLRCS, which trades at 16.6 times forward earnings, and utilities .SPLRCU, which trades at 15.8 times. (GRAPHIC: Healthcare stocks, by the numbers  - tmsnrt.rs/2H7Mnxw)  According to the Reuters review of sector weightings, healthcare is followed by financials .SPSY, then technology .SPLRCT. Real estate .SPLRCR ranks as the most negatively rated group. The healthcare sector has lagged in the early days of 2019, rising less than 1 percent against a 3 percent rise for the S&P 500. Some investors doubt healthcare will maintain its outperformance. JP Morgan strategists downgraded the sector to “underweight” last month, pointing in part to political rhetoric possibly turning “more negative on healthcare leading up to the 2020 presidential elections.” The healthcare sector struggled ahead of the 2016 election, with the high U.S. cost of prescription medicines a prominent issue during the presidential campaign. With renewed scrutiny on drug pricing, such concerns linger. The sector could suffer if investors become more optimistic about economic growth and flee defensive stocks, while the popularity of healthcare as an investment could work against it if the trade becomes overly crowded. “There is risk there,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. But given issues affecting other sectors, he said, “when you look around the market...you arrive by default at healthcare, and so I think that’s why a lot of people are interested in the sector.”

14003,"MANILA   - Pachinko tycoon Kazuo Okada has asked the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) to block the proposed listing of Universal Entertainment Corp’s (6425.T) domestic unit, saying the Japanese gaming company has no authority to proceed with the plan. Okada is engaged in a public spat with Universal, whose board ousted him as chairman in 2017 and accused him of misappropriating $20 million, which the billionaire denied. Tiger Resort Asia Ltd, Universal’s subsidiary, agreed to acquire a majority stake in a Manila listed company in September, paving the way for its own backdoor listing. Tiger owns the operator of the $2.4 billion Okada Manila integrated casino-resort. “The backdoor listing is not authorized and is opposed by the casino magnate, the true and legal beneficial owner of controlling shares, and Chairman or Sole Director, in all Okada Companies,” Okada’s lawyers said in a January 11 letter to the PSE, which was sent to the media. The PSE should disallow the backdoor listing because “there exists, at bare minimum, a serious issue as to whether Fujimoto et. al. are legitimate directors/officers of Tiger, and the rest of the Okada Companies, that can act for and on behalf of said Companies,” the lawyers said, referring to Universal President Jun Fujimoto.  Officials of the stock exchange, Universal and Tiger were not immediately available for comment. It is a public holiday in Japan on Monday. A Philippine court earlier this month ordered the arrest of Okada, who is facing fraud charges. In August, he was arrested in Hong Kong because of multiple corruption-related charges and is currently on bail.

14022,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will lead a trade mission to China in mid-November as part of President Donald Trump’s first visit there, the Commerce Department said in a notice posted on its website. The Department said the multi-sector mission “will advance the bilateral commercial relationship by promoting business deals between U.S. and Chinese firms, as well as addressing market access barriers faced by U.S. companies,” the Commerce Department said in a statement. The department said it was taking applications from trade associations and companies large and small through Sept 29. It said the mission would promote new sales and investments between U.S. businesses and Chinese entities and provide them with access to senior decision makers in the Chinese government. Reuters on Tuesday quoted a U.S. official as saying that  Trump would likely stop in China as part of a trip that will take him to an ASEAN summit in the Philippines and an APEC summit in Vietnam. The trade mission comes at a time of heightened trade tensions between the United States and China following Trump’s decision on Wednesday to block a Chinese-backed private equity firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker. In July, a high-level U.S.-China economic dialogue meeting did not produce an agreement the Trump administration’s demands of reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China.

14089,"SAO PAULO   - At BM Multimarcas, a used-car dealer on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, owner Santel de Abreu Bernardo can show you jalopies that most big banks would not touch. There is a faded blue 2003 Renault hatchback with 195,000 kilometers on the dial. And a Volkswagen Gol Turbo so old that it could vote. But when he needs to seal a deal, Bernardo has a go-to option for financing: the Brazilian unit of Spain’s Banco Santander. It has grabbed 25 percent of the market for car loans in Latin America’s largest country, in part by extending credit to borrowers shunned by other mainstream banks. That means financing working-class customers in need of cheap motorcycles and cars up to two decades old. That business helped power Madrid-based Santander through Brazil’s recent deep recession, even as domestic rivals Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA hit the brakes, and other foreign banks such as London-based HSBC Plc and U.S. Citigroup sold their struggling Brazilian retail businesses. There are risks to Santander’s strategy, as any used-car veteran will tell you. “When an old car breaks down, its owner prefers spending money to fix it rather than paying down debt,” said Bernardo of BM Multimarcas. “That’s why many banks don’t like financing old cars.” Yet Santander, Brazil’s third-largest private-sector bank, is cruising. Its 90-day default ratio is the lowest among Brazil’s largest private banks, at 2.9 percent in September. Year-over-year consumer loan growth in Brazil hit 22.6 percent in September, more than triple the industry average of 7 percent. Brazil unit profitability, which for years has lagged peers, jumped to 19.4 percent from 16.3 percent in the same period. That beat Bradesco, the country’s second-largest private lender, and narrowed the gap with industry-leading Itau.   Santander’s increasing reliance on Brazil shows how emerging markets can still provide a jolt of growth. The Brazilian unit contributed 26 percent of group profits in the first nine months of 2018, up from 19 percent four years ago. Santander Brasil’s stock price has surged more than two thirds in the last 12 months, vastly outperforming the shares of its parent company, as well as those of Itau and Bradesco. Still, Santander Brasil’s outsized auto loan portfolio, and its willingness to bet on borrowers and vehicles avoided by competitors, could presage a bumpier road ahead in a country with a history of economic volatility. “Certainly, Santander’s growth strategy is a success story so far,” said Andre Martins, an analyst at XP Investimentos. “But the bank will be the one most exposed to defaults if the Brazilian economy turns down.” (For a graphic on Santander Brasil's share of auto loans in Brazil, see tmsnrt.rs/2GtCxFR)  For now, Brazil’s economy appears to be on the upswing. And Santander executives say their strategy is battle-tested. Around 80 percent of the Brazil unit’s auto loans are on cars aged four years or less, and down payments are hefty, averaging 36 percent. “If Santander’s loan book were problematic, it would already have popped after a 3-year historic recession,” said Angel Santodomingo, chief financial officer for Santander Brasil. “Our success in credit quality is related to our ability to analyze and price individuals’ risk.” Santodomingo would not reveal Santander’s secret sauce. But the bank is harnessing big data to glean information beyond borrower income and savings. And Brazil risk officers are using company tools that have proven successful elsewhere, including the United States, where Santander is a major subprime auto lender. The bank has also embraced the internet to grow its business, leveraging online sales generated through WebMotors, a top car-selling website that it owns. Two years ago it launched an app that allows dealers to arrange car loans within minutes for buyers who provide eight pieces of information, an innovation that is now being copied by other Brazilian banks. That process had previously taken at least a day and required car buyers to provide reams of documentation. If a loan is approved, clients sign the contract digitally. “It saves a lot of time,” said Eduardo de Jesus, a salesman at Basile Center Car, located in a middle-class neighborhood on Sao Paulo’s northwest side.  Santander plans to use that model to grow its consumer finance business in Brazil with loans for vacations, building materials and solar panels, according to Andre Novaes, head of Santander’s consumer finance unit. Many Brazilian banks have avoided such lending because of the high default risk and shaky collateral.  To safeguard its portfolio, Santander said it has encouraged highly-indebted clients to refinance and consolidate different types of loans in arrears into a single loan with more amicable terms. Some bankers, however, view the practice as a way to mask Santander’s default ratio. Severe losses in 2011 forced Itau and Bradesco to stop financing low-end motorcycles, and to ban cars aged ten years and older from their portfolios. They also increased down payments and shortened loan maturities, which had stretched as long as 70 months. Santander has been in Brazil since 1982. It has made a few good-sized acquisitions, including the purchase of the Brazil unit of Amsterdam-based ABN AMRO in 2007.  But most of its organic growth spurt has come under Sergio Rial, who took the CEO job at Santander Brasil in January 2016. A lawyer and economist, Rial served a stint as chief financial officer at the grains trader Cargill Inc and as a board member at ABN AMRO. He was chief executive of the Brazilian meatpacker Marfrig when Ana Botin, the executive chairman of Santander Group, tapped him for the top job in Brazil.(Santander Brasil share's outperform rivals: tmsnrt.rs/2ADY3Cx) While car loans have juiced growth, Rial has also bet on safer credit lines, including payroll loans and mortgages, as well as credit cards. Overall, Rial has been strengthening Santander’s retail arm to the detriment of corporate loans. Consumer loans comprise 70 percent of the bank’s loan book, up 12 percentage points from when Rial took the CEO post. To engage the bank’s employees, Rial has tied more of their compensation to performance; variable compensation increased 16 percent from 2015 to 2017 even as the bank’s payroll shrunk roughly 7 percent. The number of clients has increased for 40 straight months, reaching 23.4 million in September. Still, the auto loan business remains the bank’s standout in terms of growth. De Jesus, the car salesman at Basile Center Car, said Santander’s rivals are paying attention.  “When clients come to a store, they want to know exactly if the down payment suits their pockets, and Santander’s tools show it immediately,” he said. “Other banks are copying it now.” ",How Santander's Brazil unit is driving growth with car loans,"January 11, 2019 /  6:09 AM ",sao paulo at bm

14189,"  - Amazon.com Inc founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, and his wife MacKenzie Bezos are divorcing after 25 years of marriage, the couple said on Twitter on Wednesday.  Jeff Bezos, 54, has a fortune that has soared as high as $160 billion thanks to his stake in Amazon, which again became Wall Street’s most valuable company this week, surpassing Microsoft Corp. Bezos has credited MacKenzie, 48, for her support when he uprooted the young couple to Seattle from New York to launch Amazon, an online bookseller that grew into the world’s largest internet retailer. MacKenzie Bezos, a Princeton graduate who is now a novelist, did accounting for Amazon for its first year after it was founded in 1994.  The couple decided to divorce after a long period of “loving exploration” and trial separation, and expect to remain partners in ventures and projects, according to the joint statement. Amazon shares ended up 0.2 percent on Wednesday. The divorce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co. According to Refinitiv Eikon data, MacKenzie does not hold any Amazon shares directly, while Bezos has a 16.1 percent stake worth about $130 billion. Forbes magazine now estimates his overall net worth at $137.1 billion. Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another.  “They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible,” she said. “I don’t think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the divorce.” Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff Bezos to buy out his wife, or for MacKenzie Bezos to retain shares. “If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights,” she said. It is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public, according to New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who represents Judith Giuliani in her divorce from Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and current lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump. “These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement,” Clair said, referring to Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos. Reuters was unable to determine any further financial details of the planned divorce.  “Jeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon,” said Drew Herdener, vice president of communications for the company. He declined to comment on how the divorce might affect the ownership stake. MacKenzie Bezos met her husband when interviewing for a job at a New York hedge fund, according to a 2013 profile in Vogue. The two were engaged after three months of dating and married three months after that, according to the magazine. They have four children. Speaking at an event in Berlin last April, Jeff Bezos said his wife’s support was instrumental when he founded Amazon. “When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,” he said. Jeff Bezos in September committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities. He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth.  Last January, the couple donated $33 million to fund college scholarships for U.S. high schoolers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents. In 2012, they donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex nuptials there.  From modest beginnings, Amazon branched out into almost every product category, taking on established retailers such as Walmart Inc.  In November, Amazon picked America’s financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in New York City and a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C. Jeff Bezos also founded space company Blue Origin in 2000, and is funneling more than $1 billion a year of his own fortune into pulling it out of start-up mode and into production. He also owns the Washington Post, which has been a frequent target of criticism from Trump.

14190,"NEWARK, N.J.   - U.S. Senator Bob Menendez abused his power to help a wealthy benefactor in a years-long bribery scheme that netted the New Jersey Democrat lavish gifts and major campaign donations, federal prosecutors told a jury on Wednesday. “This case is about a corrupt politician who sold his Senate office for a life of luxury he couldn’t afford,” the lead prosecutor, Peter Koski, said at the start of Menendez’s corruption trial in Newark. Menendez’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said prosecutors had twisted a close, brother-like relationship into something illicit. “Acting out of friendship is not improper, it is not corrupt, and it is certainly not a crime,” he said. Menendez is accused of intervening with federal officials to help his co-defendant Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who gave the senator private flights, stays at a Caribbean villa and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign money. The case comes at a crucial time in Washington, D.C., where Republicans hold a razor-thin 52-48 edge in the Senate. If Menendez is convicted and either resigns or is expelled by his colleagues before January, his replacement would be named by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican. A group of supporters cheered Menendez, 63, as he entered court on Wednesday morning. The senator told reporters he had “never backed away from a fight.” He is running for a third six-year term in 2018 despite the charges. Koski told jurors Menendez used his influence to help Melgen, securing visas for Melgen’s foreign girlfriends and pressuring the U.S. State Department to resolve a contract dispute between a company Melgen owned and the Dominican Republic. After Medicare, the federal insurance plan for the elderly and disabled, concluded Melgen had overbilled it by $8.9 million, Menendez asked officials to change the reimbursement policy, Koski said. Melgen was convicted earlier this year of perpetrating a massive Medicare fraud. He has yet to be sentenced. Koski also urged jurors to pay attention to the timing of Melgen’s gifts. In April 2012, for instance, Menendez met with an assistant secretary of state regarding the Dominican Republic dispute; Melgen gave Menendez $80,000 on the same day. “Robert Menendez was Salomon Melgen’s personal United States senator,” Koski said. Lowell said Menendez only acted at Melgen’s suggestion after researching the issue with his staff and concluding it was sound policy. He also accused prosecutors of cherry-picking a handful of examples amidst countless similar interventions that Menendez has made over the years when matters were brought to his attention. The trial is expected to last up to eight weeks.

14216,"  - The Trump administration drew vigorous responses to its announcement on Tuesday it would be ending an Obama-era program that allows children to stay in the United States who entered the country illegally.  Business executives, politicians and rights groups were outspoken in their reactions to the plan to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), whose beneficiaries were known as Dreamers. “Kicking them out won’t lower the unemployment rate or lighten anyone’s taxes or raise anybody’s wages ... Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America or whether we treat them the way we’d want our own kids to be treated.  It’s about who we are as a people – and who we want to be.” - Former President Barack Obama in a statement  * “Today is a cruel day for Dreamers, our families, and all Americans ... President Trump just threw the lives and futures of 800,000 Dreamers and their families, including my own, into fearful disarray, and injected chaos and uncertainty into thousands of workplaces and communities across America. He is using the lives of 800,000 people as pawns.” - Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy for the American Civil Liberties Union * “It is my hope that the House and Senate, with the president’s leadership, will be able to find consensus on a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this great country.” - Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in a statement * “This is a sad day for our country. The decision to end DACA is not just wrong. It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it ... It’s time for Congress to act to pass the bipartisan Dream Act or another legislative solution that gives Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.” - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post * “President Obama wrongly believed he had the authority to re-write our immigration law. Today’s action by President Trump corrects that fundamental mistake. This Congress will continue working on securing our border and ensuring a lawful system of immigration that works.” - Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell * “I applaud President Trump for phasing out DACA ... The Obama-era program went far beyond the executive branch’s legitimate authority ... President (Barack) Obama unilaterally conferred lawful presence and work authorization, and then President Obama used that lawful-presence dispensation to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship.” - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton * “Let’s lay the truth bare: President Trump has knowingly deceived the American people over the past seven months about his intentions to protect the innocent young men and women of the DACA program ... Now they will be awake at night wondering whether tomorrow will be their last day on American soil.” - Javier Palomarez, president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, in a statement also announcing his resignation from Trump’s diversity council * “When people come here to learn, work hard and give back to their communities, we should allow them to stay in the United States.” JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive Jamie Dimon, chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of the nation’s largest companies * “DACA was an unconstitutional overreach by the Obama administration that created incentives for children from Central America to take great risks to enter America illegally. The president has given Congress six months to get our act together and fix our broken legal immigration system, end incentives for illegal entry, lawfully protect the Dreamers, and secure our borders.” - Republican Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee * “In our view, DACA was an unconstitutional abuse of executive authority by President Obama ... Congress should seize this opportunity to come together and forge these much-needed reforms in our nation’s immigration policy.” - Statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform * “We say this even though Microsoft ... cares greatly about modernizing the tax system and making it fairer and more competitive.

14239,"CARACAS   - Venezuela’s opposition-run congress on Tuesday issued a resolution calling deals between state-run oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and U.S. and French companies announced this week illegal, since they had not been sent to lawmakers for approval. The body said the oilfield deals with France’s Maurel & Prom (MAUP.PA) and little-known U.S. company Erepla violated article 150 of Venezuela’s constitution, which requires that contracts signed between the state and foreign companies be approved by the National Assembly, as Venezuela’s congress is known. “They are giving concessions that violate the law,” said lawmaker Jorge Millan, mentioning the two contracts. Congress, largely stripped of its power since the opposition took it over in 2016, is unlikely to be able block the deals from going forward. But the rejection could create legal complications under a future government. Maduro is set to be inaugurated for his second consecutive term on Thursday following a May vote considered a sham by the domestic opposition and many foreign governments. A regional bloc of Latin American countries last week called on Maduro, a protege of the late Hugo Chavez, not to take office. The deals are part of Maduro’s effort to reverse a sharp decline in the OPEC nation’s crude output that has crippled its economy.

14264,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. job openings fell in November, pulled down by sharp declines in construction and other services, but did little to change views that the economy is facing a shortage of workers. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped by 243,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.9 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, on Tuesday. Despite November’s drop, job openings outpaced the number of unemployed people that month by 870,000. “We see no change in the big picture labor market story from the latest job openings data,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Job openings hit a record high of 7.3 million in August. The decline in job openings in November was led by a 66,000 drop in the other services category.  Construction vacancies fell 45,000. The decrease in job openings in November was concentrated in the West region. But there were increases in vacancies in the transportation, warehousing, and utilities sector as well as finance and insurance, and education and health services. The job openings rate slipped to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent in October. Hiring declined 218,000 to 5.7 million in November. The hiring rate fell to 3.8 percent from 4.0 percent in October.  Anecdotal evidence has been growing of companies experiencing difficulties finding workers, a phenomenon that economists expect will slow down job growth this year. A survey from the NFIB on Tuesday showed the share of small business owners reporting job openings they could not fill surged five points to a record high of 39 percent in December. Most of these vacancies were in manufacturing. “It won’t get easier for small businesses to fill open positions but it’s premature to conclude there are significant labor supply issues,” said Ryan Sweet, as senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 312,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February. Job growth averaged 220,000 per month in 2018. Job gains are expected to slow to around 150,000 per month this year as workers become more scarce. The JOLTS report also showed the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs falling 112,000 to 3.4 million in November. The quits rate, which policymakers and economists view as a measure of job market confidence, was unchanged at 2.3 percent.  Some economists said the steady quits rate suggested moderate wage inflation, which could make the Federal Reserve cautious about raising interest rates too high this year.  The U.S. central bank has forecast two rate hikes this year, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week “we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves.” “It is just that the labor market is not going into overdrive where it could lead to an overheating economy with labor shortages, sharply higher wages and more inflation, and this will keep the Fed cautious on the need to move interest rates gradually higher this year,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. Layoffs were little changed at 1.8 million in November, holding the layoffs rate at 1.2 percent for a second straight month.  The Labor Department has not been affected by the partial shutdown of the U.S. government and will continue to publish economic data complied by its statistics agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Data releases from the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis, including November trade figures, which were scheduled for publication on Tuesday, have been suspended during the shutdown, which started on Dec. 22 amid demands by President Donald Trump for $5 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

14278,"  - The clock may be fast running out on Sears Holdings Corp, but you wouldn’t know it from the company’s feisty posts on Twitter. “We are down, but not out... - SMT,” Sears, via its official Twitter account (@Sears), said in reply to one of the many posts Monday morning about the 126-year-old company potentially going out of business. The optimistic tweets come ahead of a hearing on Tuesday, where Sears will ask a U.S. bankruptcy judge if it can proceed with liquidation after it failed to reach a deal on Chairman Edward Lampert’s $4.4 billion takeover bid, according to people familiar with the matter. Another Twitter user opined that the retailer “had a good run I would say.” Sears replied: “We would say that as well, but we are Marathon Runners, and we are still running. We may be slowing down, but we are not out of the race just yet. Don’t count us completely out. Happy Shopping! -SMT” The “SMT” sign-off is for the Sears Social Media Team that runs the Twitter account, which has a following of 209,000, significantly smaller than many of its retail peers.  The company declined to comment on its social media strategy. In the face of competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc and other brick-and-mortar retailers, including Walmart Inc, Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based Sears has struggled to reinvent itself. Sears’ former Chief Marketing Officer Kelly Cook told Reuters at the end of 2017 that the company planned to invest more heavily in social media in 2018. Cook said marketing directly to shoppers via Twitter and Instagram posts and influencers could help change consumer sentiment toward Sears. The company also planned to use shoppers’ opinions to make operational and merchandising changes, she said. However, only 9 percent of U.S. millennials - aged between 22 to 37 years in 2018 - said they would consider buying goods from the retailer, according YouGov BrandIndex, a company that tracks public perception of brands.     On Monday, Sears encouraged those saddened by its store closures to shop online.    “Thank you for the picture! It is very surreal,” the account tweeted at a user who posted a picture of a Sears store striped of inventory, one of many to shutter its doors. “Here’s to ONLINE shopping for everyone! -SMT” Over the last 30 days, Sears’ posting frequency on Twitter has gone up by the week, as have interactions per post, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. Toys ‘R’ Us took a slightly different tack to reach its nearly 2 million followers on Twitter.  “While our store roster may be getting smaller, what is not changing is our desire or commitment to serving you,” Toys ‘R’ Us (@ToysRUs) tweeted from its official account in February 2018, roughly five months after it filed for bankruptcy protection. “We will continue to operate stores in all major markets and as always, you can also continue to shop online. Thank you!”   Then, in March, Toys ‘R’ Us announced it would sell or close all 885 stores in its U.S. chain, after failing to restructure billions of dollars in debt. Nearly three months after filing for bankruptcy in October, Sears has made plans to sell its vast inventories of tools, appliances and store fixtures, sources told Reuters on Sunday.  Lampert’s bid is meant to preserve 425 Sears stores and up to 50,000 jobs across the United States. A liquidation would put roughly 68,000 people that Sears now employs out of work. “If Sears liquidates, it’d be very, very sad for all of us,” said longtime Sears vendor Joe Shamie, CEO of furniture vendor Delta Children, which lost millions after Toys ‘R’ Us filed for bankruptcy.

14298,"NEW YORK   - Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Investments, Citadel Securities LLC and a host of other financial companies plan to launch a  low-cost bourse that will compete with the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Brokers and traders have complained for years about what they say are unjustifiably high fees charged by the big U.S. stock exchanges for data on stock trades. The news of the new exchange on Monday pushed down the share prices of the parent companies of the NYSE and Nasdaq. “The announcement is the latest salvo in the on-going fee battle between exchanges and other market participants, and one which should be taken seriously at least from the perspective of the potential earnings pressure on existing exchanges,” said  Nathan Flanders of Fitch Ratings. In a joint statement on Monday, the companies creating the new exchange said it would look to increase competition, improve operational transparency, reduce fixed costs and simplify equity trading in the United States. Data fees are one of the biggest costs for brokers. The venture will be called Members Exchange, or MEMX, and will be funded and controlled by nine institutions: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Charles Schwab Corp, E*TRADE Financial Corp, TD Ameritrade Holdings Corp, UBS, Virtu Financial, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Citadel. This is not the first time that industry giants have taken on the established exchanges. A decade ago, a group including Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and  Merrill Lynch backed a low-cost exchange called BATS. Around the same time, other industry heavyweights launched an exchange called Direct Edge with a similar goal of slashing trading costs. The two exchanges quickly gained market share, later merged and are now owned by Cboe Global Markets. Banks tried a similar move in Europe by setting up Turquoise to trade cross-border shares as a stick to persuade incumbent exchanges to cut data fees. Turquoise partly succeeded in its aim, but ended up being bought by the London Stock Exchange. Last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked stock exchanges to do a better job justifying their fees for public market data. It also repealed two data price changes last May for public feeds for Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange-listed securities for the first time.  MEMX, which plans to offer a simple trading model with basic order types and the latest technology, will also represent the interests of its founders’ collective client base of retail and institutional investors. It will offer “lower pricing on market data, and connectivity and transaction fees,” it said. The big three U.S. exchanges have faced criticism for surging fees for services like data feeds that brokers use to monitor movements in stock prices. Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE) owns the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq is run by Nasdaq Inc and the other exchange is Cboe. Shares of ICE were down 2.6 percent and those of Nasdaq Inc were 2.8 percent lower.  In early 2019 MEMX will file an application with the SEC seeking approval to operate as a national securities exchange, according to the statement. The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) hit back against criticism of bourses on Monday, saying price feeds would not exist but for the role they play. “The price at which information is licensed is accordingly a commercial matter for each individual consumer and exchange. The WFE stands ready to assist any regulators who are concerned about the role and nature of market data,” the WFE said.

The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets also said it has elected Wayne Hewett to join the board. Peetz was named to the board in February of 2017 and chaired the risk committee, a key position as Wells Fargo works to prove that it has improved its risk management controls.  The former president of Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N)  is stepping down to devote more time to other commitments, the statement said. She will retire as director during the company’s annual shareholder meeting in April. Enhancing its risk controls is a priority for the bank after a series of scandals stemming from its sales practices landed the bank under public and regulatory scrutiny. Revelations that Wells Fargo opened up potentially millions of unauthorized accounts has resulted in billions of fines for the bank and a punitive cap on assets from the Federal Reserve. Hewett is currently chairman of industrial manufacturing company DiversiTech Corporation and has experience with  medical devices, food and electronics, the statement said. “Wayne brings a unique and relevant background to Wells Fargo’s business and strategic direction, further enhancing the breadth of skills and experience of our board,” said President and Chief Executive Tim Sloan.

14306,"NEW YORK   - Oil prices edged higher on Monday, rebounding further from 1-1/2-year lows reached in December, on support from OPEC production cuts and steadying equities markets. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 27 cents to settle at $57.33 a barrel, a 0.47 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 56 cents to settle at $48.52 a barrel, a 1.17 percent gain. Oil futures have gained more than 7 percent since last Monday. “Momentum is coming back into the market from very depressed price levels,” Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said. Prices drew support from a Wall Street Journal report saying that Saudi Arabia is planning to cut crude exports to around 7.1 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of January.   OPEC and its allies are trying to rein in a surge in global supply, driven mostly by the United States, where production surpassed 11 million bpd in 2018. Record high crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has pushed up U.S. inventories. OPEC oil supply fell in December by 460,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 32.68 million bpd, a Reuters survey found last week, led by cuts from top exporter Saudi Arabia. “We continue to view the OPEC production cuts that became official last week as a legitimate bullish consideration and we still look for the reduction to translate to a reduced U.S. crude surplus that could potentially be erased in some 8-9 weeks,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. U.S. crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, fell by 565,000 barrels from last Tuesday to Friday, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. More upbeat equity markets also offered support. “When stock markets are strong oil usually follows suit,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said. Shares have risen on expectations that trade talks this week between the United States and China will ease the trade war. Disruptions to trade undermine prospects for economic growth and oil demand. [MKTS/GLOB] Goldman Sachs said in a note it had downgraded its average Brent crude oil forecast for 2019 to $62.50 a barrel from $70 due to “the strongest macro headwinds since 2015.” Societe Generale cut its 2019 oil price forecast for Brent by $9 to $64 a barrel and reduced its forecast for U.S. light crude by $9 to $57 a barrel.

14318,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a defeat to Merck & Co (MRK.N) by refusing to hear its appeal of a ruling that it had dishonestly obtained patent rights and could not collect a $200 million verdict against rival drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) in a dispute involving blockbuster hepatitis C drugs. A jury awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Gilead’s Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents, but a judge later ruled the patents unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers. Merck had urged the Supreme Court to place limits on the doctrine of “unclean hands” that can prevent plaintiffs from winning lawsuits if they acted in bad faith. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Injection drug use is among the causes of the infection.  Direct-acting anti-viral medications like Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni have revolutionized treatment of hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. Merck holds patents that it has said cover a compound that is the foundation for all major antiviral treatments for chronic hepatitis C. A federal court jury in San Jose, California awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents. A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling that in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011. The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel. Merck’s litigation against Gilead has included several reversals of fortune. In 2016, a jury in Delaware said Gilead infringed a related patent and ordered it to pay Merck $2.54 billion in royalties, the largest verdict ever in a patent case. But a judge threw out the verdict in February 2018, ruling that Merck’s patent was invalid because it was not sufficiently detailed in its wording.

14319,"BRASILIA   - Brazil national security adviser Augusto Heleno said on Monday that the government is studying whether the deal between planemakers Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and Boeing (BA.N) is in its “ideal form” or in need of changes.      Embraer in December agreed to sell 80 percent of its commercial aviation business to Boeing for $4.2 billion. The deal requires the government’s blessing to go forward.  Heleno, speaking to reporters at a press conference, added that the government was not “thinking of interrupting negotiations.” He said the government wants a deal that will be “the best possible for the country.” President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday expressed concern about a provision in the agreement that would allow Boeing to end up with 100 percent of the commercial division business, extinguishing Embraer’s participation. He described the Brazilian planemaker, which is a private company, as part of the national “patrimony” and said he did not want to see it “pass to the other side,” in a reference to full Boeing ownership.     Before becoming president, Bolsonaro and his advisers spoke favorably of the Boeing-Embraer deal, but without addressing specific details.
