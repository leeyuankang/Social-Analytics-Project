1,EDITH M. LEDERER / AP,"(UNITED NATIONS) — Food insecurity in North Korea “is at an alarming level,” with nearly half the population — 11 million people — undernourished, the U.N. independent investigator on human rights in the country said Tuesday. Tomas Ojea Quintana told the General Assembly’s human rights committee that 140,000 children are estimated to be suffering from “undernutrition,” including 30,000 who “face an increased risk of death.” Quintana said the government, which has primary responsibility for ensuring access to food, “is violating its human rights obligations due to its failing economic and agricultural policies.” In addition, he said, “climate conditions, infertile land, natural disasters and the negative impact of sanctions have contributed to further food insecurity.” More broadly, Quintana said he has seen no improvement in North Korea’s human rights situation during his three years as special rapporteur. “The country’s economic resources are being diverted away from the essential needs of the people,” he said. “Pervasive discrimination in the public distribution system means that ordinary citizens, especially farmers and people in rural areas, have not been receiving any rations.” Quintana said collective farming and the failure to allow farmers to benefit from individual plots of land is further exacerbating food insecurity. “At the same time, the government has failed to put in place conditions where people can securely engage in trade and exchange in marketplaces without facing criminalization, extortion and other forms of abuse,” he said. Nonetheless, he added, the vast majority of North Koreans “are now engaged in such market activity for their survival.” Ironically, he said, the government’s failure to regulate nascent market activity is creating increasing inequality based on wealth, “where only those with money have access to basic rights such as education, health care, freedom of movement and adequate housing.”",UN Investigator: 11 Million North Koreans Are Undernourished,8:01 AM EDT
2,STEPHEN WADE / AP,"Paralympian Marieke Vervoort said when the day arrived, she had signed the euthanasia papers and was prepared to end her life. That day came Tuesday in her native Belgium, her death confirmed in a statement from the city of Diest. Vervoort, who was 40, won gold and silver medals in wheelchair racing at the 2012 London Paralympics, and two more medals three years ago in Rio de Janeiro. In an interview attended by The Associated Press at the Paralympics in Rio, Vervoort described living with unbroken pain from an incurable, degenerative spinal disease. She talked of sleeping only 10 minutes some nights, described severe pain that caused others to pass out just watching her, and detailed how sports kept her alive. “It’s too hard for my body,” Vervoort said in the 2016 interview. “Each training I’m suffering because of pain. Every race I train hard. Training and riding and doing competition are medicine for me. I push so hard — to push literally all my fear and everything away.” Vervoort spent her last evening with close friends and family, even sharing a glass of sparkling wine, which she referred to as a painkiller. Condolences streamed in from across the nation, including from the royal family “Marieke ‘Wielemie’ Vervoort was an athlete tough as nails and a great lady. Her death touches us deeply,” the family said in a statement. Vervoort was a strong advocate of the right to choose euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium. Like training hard, she said it gave her control and put “my own life in my hands.” “I’m really scared, but those (euthanasia) papers give me a lot of peace of mind because I know when it’s enough for me, I have those papers,” she said. “If I didn’t have those papers, I think I’d have done suicide already. I think there will be fewer suicides when every country has the law of euthanasia. … I hope everybody sees that this is not murder, but it makes people live longer.”",'For Me It's Something Peaceful.'

3,Amy Gunia,"A murder investigation is under way after 39 bodies were discovered on Wednesday in a truck on an industrial estate in southern England. Police were reportedly called by paramedics in the early morning hours after the bodies were discovered in the town of Grays in Essex county. “This is a tragic incident where a large number of people have lost their lives. Our inquiries are ongoing to establish what has happened,” police chief superintendent Andrew Mariner said, according to the Guardian. Police said that the victims include one teenager, and that they are still in the process of identifying the bodies. “I anticipate that this could be a lengthy process,” the superintendent told media. The Guardian reports that the truck is from Bulgaria and is believed to have entered the country through the town of Holyhead in Wales on Oct. 19. It says that the truck driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, has been arrested. While authorities have not yet commented on why the victims were in the truck, there have been several cases of migrants dying while being smuggled across borders in recent years. In 2018, a Hungarian court convicted a group of smugglers for their roles in the trafficking and deaths of 71 migrants whose bodies were found in a truck abandoned next to a highway in Austria in 2015. In 2017, emergency responders found dozens of undocumented migrants in distress in a semi-trailer in a Walmart parking lot in San Antonio, Texas. Nine people died.

4,Rachael Bunyan,"A 2-year-old girl who was threatened with deportation from the U.K.—despite both her parents being citizens— has won the right to stay in the country. “No words can explain how much this means to me and my family,” Lucy Dutton’s mother Lindsay Dutton, 30, tells TIME. “Waking up this morning and knowing my daughter wasn’t going to be ripped out of my life was a true blessing. I felt humbled and grateful.” Lucy was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and brought to the United Kingdom by her parents in August 2018, when she was 11 months old. Her parents, both originally from South Africa, claimed British citizenship through their parents, who were born in the U.K. But British citizenship through descent only extends to one generation, meaning Lucy did not have an automatic right to stay in the U.K. As a result, she was living in the country on a child visitor’s visa. After her parents applied for an extension, the U.K.’s Home Office, which is in charge of immigration, sent a letter to Lucy telling that her the application had been denied because she had not lived in the U.K. for seven consecutive years. It was two days before her second birthday. Her parents were told that they could return to South Africa with Lucy. “Getting that refusal letter was the worst day of my life. It was the biggest nightmare any mother could endure and it will affect me for a long time,” Lindsay Dutton says.  The reversal of the decision to deport the toddler comes after the family’s local member of Parliament, Tonia Antoniazza, got involved. On Monday, the U.K. Immigration Minister Seema Kennedy met with Antoniazza to assure her that if the family apply for Lucy’s “indefinite leave to remain” in the U.K., her application would be granted, Antoniazza tells TIME.  The family’s lawyers had initially applied for temporary permission to stay in the U.K., but this was incorrect advice, according to Antoniazza. Antoniazza, a member of the Labour Party, is now helping Lucy’s family with the new application.","'I Cried Tears of Joy.'

5,Antony Sguazzin / Bloomberg,"Russia will on Wednesday land the world’s biggest military aircraft in South Africa, the Tupolev Tu-160 “Blackjack” bomber, in a rare display of cooperation between the defense forces of the two countries. The two bombers, which are capable of launching nuclear missiles, are the first to ever land in Africa and will be escorted by fighter jets from the South African Air Force when they touch down at the Waterkloof air base in Tshwane, the South African National Defence Force said in a statement. The bombers will arrive at around 4 p.m. and a number of other Russian military aircraft will also land at the site. The bombers had initially been scheduled to land earlier. “The military-to-military relations between the two countries are not solely built on struggle politics but rather on fostering mutually beneficial partnerships based on common interests,” the SANDF said. Russia’s defense ministry put out a similar statement. The arrival of the bombers in Africa’s most industrialized nation coincides with Russian President Vladimir Putin hosting an Africa summit this week, the first such event to be organized by Russia.

6,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong’s security minister announced Wednesday the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill that has sparked months of protests in the territory. The procedure makes good a pledge to scrap the detested measure made last month by the enclave’s embattled leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam. “The government has expressed several times that the work [related to the bill] had completely stopped. Now, in order to more clearly illustrate the government’s stance on the bill, I … formally announce the withdrawal of the bill,” John Lee said in the Legislative Council as pro-democracy lawmakers called for his resignation. The formality may ease some tensions but it remains to be seen whether or not it will put an end to Hong Kong’s civil unrest, which has escalated from the initial opposition to the bill into a push for greater political freedom. Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, told TIME that the procedure was “a belated response to the growing anger of Hong Kong people, and it’s come to the point that it may no longer even be relevant in terms of calming society down.” He added: “The protests have evolved further now. It’s not only about the law, but a full-scale governance crisis concerning police measures and the lack of political accountability of the Carrie Lam administration. For restoring trust, a proper independent investigation [into alleged police brutality] is necessary, and it would help a lot if Beijing and the Hong Kong government can consider opening the democratization process.” Coincidentally, the man whose case was cited by the Hong Kong government as a pressing reason to implement the bill walked free from prison today. Chan Tong-kai, 20, completed a sentence for money laundering, relating to the theft and sale of items belonging to his girlfriend, whom he reportedly confessed to murdering while on a visit to Taiwan. Hong Kong officials had consistently argued that amendments to existing extradition laws were needed in order for Chan to be returned to Taiwan to stand trial for the murder. “The Taiwan murder case has set the clock ticking,” Lam told media in April. “We don’t want the suspect to escape.”","Hong Kong Completes the Process of Withdrawing the Extradition Bill, But Will It Stop the Protests?",4:01 AM EDT
7,LOLITA C. BALDOR / AP,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived in Baghdad Wednesday, as chaos swirled along the Turkey-Syria border and Iraqi leaders chafed over reports the U.S. may want to increase the number of troops based in Iraq at least temporarily. Esper has said that under the current plan, all U.S. troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq and the military would continue to conduct operations against the Islamic State group to prevent its resurgence in the region. He later added that the troops would be there temporarily until they are able to go home, but no time period has been set. He said Wednesday that the U.S. has no plans to leave those troops in Iraq “interminably.” Iraq’s military, however, said Tuesday that U.S. troops leaving Syria and heading to neighboring Iraq do not have permission to stay in the country, even as the American forces continue to pull out of northern Syria after Turkey’s invasion of the border region. Esper said Wednesday he plans to talk with Iraqi leaders about the matter. Meanwhile, Russia and Turkey reached an agreement on Tuesday that would deploy their forces across nearly its entire northeastern border to fill the void left by President Donald Trump’s abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces. It was unclear Wednesday what that means for U.S. forces. Trump ordered the bulk of the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria to withdraw after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear in a phone call that his forces were about to invade Syria to push back Kurdish forces that Turkey considers terrorists. The pullout largely abandons the Kurdish allies who have fought the Islamic State group alongside U.S. troops for several years. Between 200 and 300 U.S. troops will remain at the southern Syrian outpost of Al-Tanf. Esper said the troops going into Iraq would have two missions, one to help defend Iraq against a resurgence of Islamic State militants and another to monitor and perform a counter-IS mission. The U.S. currently has more than 5,000 American forces in Iraq, under an agreement between the two countries. The U.S. pulled its troops out of Iraq in 2011 when combat operations there ended, but they went back in after the Islamic State group began to take over large swaths of the country in 2014. The number of American forces in Iraq has remained small due to political sensitivities in the country, after years of what some Iraqis consider U.S. occupation during the war that began in 2003. Iraqi leaders may privately condone more U.S. forces to battle IS, but worry if it’s widely known that there will be backlash from the citizens.",U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper Arrives in Baghdad to Discuss Troop Deployments,2:32 AM EDT
8,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Hong Kong’s embattled leader is to resign and be replaced under a plan being mooted by the Chinese government, according a Financial Times report citing unnamed sources. The report, which comes as anti-government unrest in the enclave enters its fifth month, says an “interim” chief executive will replace Carrie Lam for the remainder of her term and be installed by March, if the proposal is given the go-ahead from China’s authoritarian president Xi Jinping. The assertion was greeted with skepticism by at least one commentator, who said that under Hong Kong’s constitution, Lam could only be replaced by her deputy, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, pending fresh elections—unless Beijing intended to overturn that stipulation. Claims of Lam’s possible ouster comes a month after an audio recording leaked by Reuters captured her saying that she wanted to step down. “For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,” she said. “If I have a choice, the first thing is to quit.” Lam, however, has also denied that she has wants to step down, and has reiterated several times that she has both the responsibility and the determination to lead Hong Kong out of political chaos. The sources spoken to by the FT say leading candidates to succeed Lam include Norman Chan, the former head of Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s de facto central bank, and tycoon Henry Tang. The latter previously campaigned to be Hong Kong’s leader but became mired in an ethics scandal after lavish but illegal architectural modifications were found at his opulent residence. Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Center for China Studies, says the resignation of Carrie Lam would help to diffuse the tensions in the short term. “[Her stepping down] could go some ways to repair the damage,” he told TIME. “It could improve the situation as she has already lost the trust of Hong Kong people.”","China Could Replace Hong Kong's Leader Soon, a Report Claims",11:35 PM EDT
9,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"The suspect whose murder case was used as justification to introduce an extradition bill that triggered months of protest in Kong Kong was released from a Hong Kong prison on Wednesday morning, amid a diplomatic row with Taiwan over what to do with him next. Speaking outside the prison, where he had been serving a sentence on money laundering charges, Chan Tong-kai, 20, bowed and apologized to the people of Hong Kong and the victim’s family. “To society, I can only say sorry,” Chan said on live news broadcasts of his release. “I hope for people’s forgiveness. I hope that people can give me a chance to live again, give me a chance to pay back society.” Chan confirmed his plans to surrender to authorities in Taiwan, where he is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend. “I am willing to turn myself in for my impulse, the wrong things I’ve done, and serve sentence and be tried in Taiwan.” He left the prison in a white van, accompanied by an Anglican priest who had been visiting him in prison. It is not yet known when Chan plans to return to Taiwan. His release has sparked a dispute between Hong Kong and Taiwan on how to handle his surrender. In the early morning hours Tuesday, the Hong Kong government issued a statement rejecting Taiwan’s request to send officials to Hong Kong to escort Chan back to Taipei. Hong Kong wants Chan to travel to Taiwan himself and turn himself in informally. At stake is the hugely sensitive issue of Taiwan’s status. Beijing regards the island as a renegade province; self-governing Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign nation. If Hong Kong were to allow Taiwanese law enforcement officials to land and take custody of Chan, it could be seen as a de facto extradition agreement with a foreign power, and thus a tacit recognition that Taiwan is not part of the ‘One China’ that Beijing insists it is.",The Murder Suspect Whose Case Sparked the Hong Kong Protests Has Walked Free,10:46 PM EDT
10,SUZAN FRASER and VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV / AP,"(ANKARA, Turkey) — As the leaders of Russia and Turkey sought to work out the fate of the Syrian border region, the United States ran into a new hitch in getting its troops out of Syria, with neighboring Iraq’s military saying Tuesday that the American forces did not have permission to stay on its territory. The Iraqi announcement seemed to contradict U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who a day earlier said the forces leaving Syria would deploy in Iraq to fight the Islamic State group. The conflicting signals underscored how the United States has stumbled from one problem to another in getting its troops out of Syria after President Donald Trump abruptly ordered their withdrawal. Amid fears the Americans’ departure will revive IS, Esper is considering keeping some troops in Syria to protect oil fields held by Kurdish-led fighters, backing away from the full withdrawal first touted by Trump. After the Iraqi statement, Esper said he would speak to the Iraqi defense minister on Wednesday and underlined that the U.S. has no plans to keep the troops in Iraq “interminably” and intends to “eventually get them home.” The U.S. pullout opened the door for Turkey to launch its offensive against Kurdish fighters on Oct. 9. After a storm of criticism, Washington moved to broker a five-day cease-fire that was set to expire Tuesday night. Meanwhile, Russia has stepped into the void to strengthen its role as a power broker in Syria. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russia’s Vladimir Putin held talks in the Black Sea town of Sochi just hours before the cease-fire was set to expire. The talks are likely to be crucial in determining arrangements along the Syrian-Turkish border, where Ankara demands a long “safe zone” cleared of Kurdish fighters. Seeking protection after being abandoned by the Americans, the Kurds turned to the Syrian government and its main ally, Russia. The Syrian army has advanced into parts of the area, and Russia deployed its troops in some areas to act as a buffer force.",Russia's Putin Meets With Turkey's Erdogan as U.S. Struggles to Shift Troops From Syria to Iraq,"October 22, 2019"

12,Rebecca Collard / Beirut,"High, cement blast walls surrounding the United Nations offices in central Beirut are covered with anti-government graffiti. “Down with the rule of the mafia,” is spray-painted next to the word “revolution.” The names of every member of the Lebanese parliament are on the blast wall. The word “thief” is written below each name. Nearby, a crowd chants the same, “ thieves, thieves.” Lebanese protesters say their politicians have stolen tens, or even hundreds, of billions of dollars from them, aided by laws that allow bank secrecy. Hundreds of thousands of them have taken to the streets over the last six days, in the biggest protests to sweep the country in over a decade. Here’s what to know. The demonstrations began Thursday after the government announced new taxes, including a $6 monthly fee on calls on free messaging apps like WhatsApp, unleashing anger against decades of corruption, government mismanagement and nepotism.  In the first days, mostly young men swarmed around on scooters smashing shop windows and lighting fires in the middle of the street, as they chanted against the government. But by Saturday, that had given way to a festive, but still defiant, atmosphere. Men and women of all ages, class and religions sang patriotic ballad as fireworks burst above.  On Sunday, hundreds of thousands came out in the largest day of protests across the country. The proposed tax was scrapped just hours after the protests started, but demonstrations continued.  Lebanon’s economy is stagnating and the country has one of the world’s highest debt to GDP ratios. Economists have warned of a complete economic collapse. In recent weeks, banks have restricted the withdrawal of U.S. dollars.

13,Madeline Roache,"Prince William is “worried” about his brother after he talked about his mental health in a TV documentary, a Kensington Palace source told the BBC on Tuesday October 22. BBC Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said he heard from one “very good source” that Prince William was “furious” with his younger brother for doing the interview, in which he and his wife Meghan Markle, 38, spoke out about their struggle to live under a global spotlight. One other source from Buckingham Palace told BBC they hadn’t seen any such fury and that the Duke of Cambridge was clearly “worried” about his brother, and hoped Harry and his wife Meghan “are all right.” There was a view that the couple were “in a fragile place,” the palace source added. During the hour-long ITV documentary Harry and Meghan: An African Journey Prince Harry, 35, described his mental health and the way he deals with the pressures of his life as a matter of “constant management.” He also addressed the rumors of a rift between himself and his older brother, the “majority” of which “are created out of nothing,” he said. “We’re certainly on different paths at the moment […] I’ll always be there for him and as I know, he’ll always be there for me. We don’t see each other as much as we used to because we’re so busy but I love him dearly,” he said in the program that aired in Sunday in the U.K. and will air in the U.S. on Wednesday, October 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on ABC. Phil Dampier, author of Royally Suited: Harry and Meghan In Their Own Words told The Scotsman, “There’s no doubt the Queen and other royals are very worried about the direction Harry and Meghan are taking and it’s very serious.” A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace, however, declined to comment on the reports.

14,Jasmine Aguilera,"U.K. Police have announced they will be traveling to the U.S. to interview the American suspect in the crash that killed British teen Harry Dunn. The suspect, Anne Sacoolas, is the wife of an American diplomat who fled to the U.S. after claiming diplomatic immunity — a law that protects diplomats and their families from prosecution in the country they are based. The case has garnered international attention and both the U.S. and U.K. governments have become involved. “It’s about Harry, it’s not about politics,” Charlotte Charles, Dunn’s mother, said in a Thursday interview with TIME. “It shouldn’t be about the governments and it shouldn’t be us worrying about this becoming a political brawl or whatever. It’s about our boy, and making sure that it doesn’t happen to another family.” Northamptonshire Police Chief Nick Adderley told reporters at a Tuesday press conference that Sacoolas requested an in-person interview, rather than submitting a statement, “in order for them to see her and the devastation that this has also caused and her family,” Adderley said. He added the police will travel when visas are secured and that Sacoolas has cooperated fully with the investigation. “The suspect not being in the county clearly frustrates the investigation, but it does not stop it,” Adderley said. The announcement comes a week after the Dunn family met with President Donald Trump at the White House and were presented with a surprise request by Trump to introduce them to Sacoolas herself. Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles, Harry Dunn’s parents, along with Harry Dunn’s step-parents, were in the U.S. to call on officials to return Sacoolas to the U.K. Harry Dunn died after an August 27 collision. Sacoolas allegedly drove off the Air Force base on the wrong side of the road and crashed into Dunn head on. The next day, she was interviewed by Northamptonshire Police and the police submitted a request to waive Sacoolas’s diplomatic immunity, Adderley said. The investigation carried on despite being unable to continue involvement with Sacoolas because of their request for a waiver. On Sept. 16 the police were informed that their request for a waiver had been declined and that Sacoolas had left the U.K. The family wasn’t informed that Sacoolas had left the country until 10 days later. In a Tuesday interview with BBC Breakfast, Tim Dunn said it is good progress that the U.K. police will travel to the U.S. to interview Sacoolas. “Hopefully they will get her to come back,” he said.",U.K. Police to Travel to U.S. to Interview Suspect in the Crash That Killed British Teen Harry Dunn,"October 22, 2019"
15,Suyin Haynes,"It’s the week before The Wing opens its first international location, and the final touches are being made to its five-story townhouse in London’s Fitzrovia. The space is the latest in The Wing’s roster of all-women members’ clubs and workspaces—there are eight others, in New York, L.A. and Chicago—which are dedicated to “the professional, civic, social and economic advancement of women through community.” In London, the style will be familiar to anyone who has seen The Wing’s clubs on Instagram: plush lounge chairs in jewel and pastel shades; custom wallpaper and furniture designed by female entrepreneurs; marble workstations with noise-cancelling headphones; Scandinavian-style wooden tables. Conference rooms are named after inspirational women—in London, they include journalist Christiane Amanpour and architect Zaha Hadid—and soft lamps emblazoned with ubiquitous “W” logos hang from the ceiling in The Wing’s bar and restaurant.  The Wing’s glossy aesthetic is a new addition to a recent crop of clubs springing up in London, reinventing the concept of the traditional gentlemen’s club. Historically, clubs in the capital largely catered towards upper-class and elite men. “Clubland used to be a space. It was marked on the map. Everyone knew when you walked down those streets in St James and Pall Mall [neighborhoods], that was Clubland” says Amy Milne-Smith, associate professor in history at Wilfrid Laurier University and author of London Clubland: A Cultural History of Gender and Class in Late Victorian Britain. And while women’s clubs have already existed for decades, the newer generation of clubs is drawing on that history to inform their mission in the present. “So much public good and general welfare was born out of women’s desire to see their societies be better, and so we’re just modernizing that concept,” says Zara Rahim, The Wing’s senior director of strategic communications. Gentlemen’s clubs in London date back to the 17th century, including the famously exclusive White’s Club, founded in 1693 and still in use today. And while London was not the only location for such clubs, its position at the heart of a growing British Empire in the late 19th century made it a hotspot for men’s only establishments. “Other cities had their own social institutions, but London is the heart of the type of club we are talking about, of the gentlemens’ club,” says Milne-Smith. “A lot of it has to do with the structures of London itself: The fact that it is both the political capital, and the financial capital, and the men in power who founded these clubs were always drawn to London.” Male members of these clubs included respected writers such as Charles Dickens, and influential politicians like British Prime Minister William Gladstone. Different clubs specialized in different clientele: The diplomats would mingle at the St James Club, artists and impresarios could be found hobnobbing at the Garrick and politicians would network at the Carlton or the Reform Club. “These were the urban sites of socialization for these men,” says Milne-Smith. These men would often have a larger country house to entertain their guests, and in the days before restaurant and nightclub culture exploded in London in the 20th century, the club was the place to host people, to eat, drink and entertain in the city. Clubs were seen as a home away from home, and a place where speaking about professional business was often not permitted under stringent club rules. Traditional gender roles in Victorian Britain meant that women would largely entertain at home. “In this era, women are queens of the domestic space,” says Milne-Smith. “Elite women absolutely had exclusive sites of socializing.” That’s not to say that women’s clubs didn’t exist at the time, although there wasn’t a large movement pushing for them. Some women’s clubs established in the late 19th century mimicked the men’s club model, such as the Alexandra and Victoria Clubs, which were “for ladies of position only.” The University Women’s Club was established in 1883, and originally required women to have a university degree. It had similar aims to the gentlemen’s clubs of the era, although it put control into the hands of its female members, who are still responsible for ownership and management of the club. “It’s run by and is for women, and it does feel like a safe and relaxing space,” says Ruth Allington, chairman of the University Women’s Club. “It’s just a home from home.” Other establishments, like the Women Journalists’ Club or the Pioneer Club, had a slightly more professional focus. “They tended to be professional networking sites, and sites for women with careers who needed a place to work in London, and to connect,” says Milne-Smith. But the lack of women working outside the home at the time meant Victorian women’s clubs had limited popularity. The launch of newer clubs in London like Allbright, which opened in 2018, mark a shift in demand for women’s-only spaces. Named after Madeleine Albright, the club is billed as a networking community for businesswomen and has two locations in London, one in West Hollywood and two further planned for New York and Washington D.C. The trend in members’ clubs becoming more women-oriented comes against the backdrop of changing ways of working in the U.K.; a report earlier this year noted that the number of women turning to self-employment has risen by 57% since 2008. Designed with spaces ideal for co-working, many freelancers are drawn to clubs like Allbright and The Wing. Meanwhile, programming networking events for members to make business connections are part of the package at The Wing, which has its own social media app specifically for members. It’s an ethos at other London clubs such as Marguerite, an all-women’s club designed for women working in the creative industries and visual arts. “The art world is so heavily based on genuine relationships and trust,” says Joanna Payne, founder and director of Marguerite, which started in her living room in 2015 and has since grown to 300 members. Although the club doesn’t have a physical location, Payne wanted to create a way for like-minded women to network and build confidence, as well as hosting high-profile female speakers and programming events. “Yes, we want to make friends, but we also want to advance our careers whilst doing so.”",The Wing Is Opening Its First International Space in London.

16,JAN M. OLSEN / AP,"(COPENHAGEN, Denmark) — At least two people were injured Tuesday in Norway’s capital city of Oslo, struck by an ambulance stolen by an armed man who was injured when police opened fire to stop him. Police said those struck by the ambulance included a woman with a stroller and an elderly couple. The woman and her baby were taken to a hospital. “We are in control of the ambulance that was stolen,” Oslo police tweeted. “Shots were fired to stop him. He is not in critical condition.” Police also said that they were looking for a woman who “looks drunk” and may have been involved in the incident in north Oslo. Anders Bayer, a spokesman for Oslo University Hospital, confirmed to Norwegian news agency NTB that the ambulance was stolen by an armed person. Three employees on the vehicle when it was stolen were unharmed, Bayer added. The Aftenposten newspaper published a photo showing a man, wearing green trousers lying next to the vehicle surrounded by police officers. Another photo in the daily showed a handcuffed man, flanked by police, walking toward an ambulance stretcher. Norwegian media said that officials believe the pair — described as known to the police — faked an accident and called for an ambulance, which they then stole.

17,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"Taiwan appears to have backed down in an escalating dispute with Hong Kong over the fate of a murder suspect, whose case was used as justification for the introduction of an extradition bill that ignited protests more than four months ago in Hong Kong. Chiu Chui-cheng, vice-chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, said that Taiwan officials had sent Hong Kong authorities a letter asking for their assistance in bringing the suspect and his confession back to Taiwan, reports Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post newspaper. Chan Tong-kai is being released from jail in Hong Kong on Wednesday, after serving a sentence for money laundering. Local media reported Monday that his offer to surrender himself to authorities in Taiwan, where he is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend, was deemed insufficient by the Taiwanese, who insisted that formal talks were required to accept him within a legal framework. The Hong Kong government had responded with a statement saying that the case should be handled informally, and that Taiwan’s acceptance of Chan should have nothing to do with whether or not there is a mechanism in place for criminal judicial assistance, but was instead a matter of “common sense.” Experts say the complicated relationship between Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan is behind the standoff. “If Taiwan were to accept, Taipei would implicitly accept [its] position as similar to Hong Kong, as being a part of China,” Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Center for China Studies tells TIME. Taiwan, he says, only wants to accept Chan if it is done under a specific agreement—in effect recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign entity and not the renegade province that Beijing says it is. “There’s credible evidence that the crime was committed,” says Gregory Gordon, a law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong “I think it would be problematic for this person not to face justice because of political issues,” he tells TIME. “It’s important for the parties to see that a heinous crime was committed, and the person who committed that crime should face justice. If he walks out a free man in Hong Kong, justice is not done in a brutal murder case—that’s not a good result.”",Taiwan Asks Hong Kong for Return of the Murder Suspect Whose Case Sparked Months of Protests,"Updated: October 22, 2019 6:10 AM ET"
18,ROB GILLIES / AP,"TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a second term in Canada’s national elections Monday, losing the majority but delivering unexpectedly strong results despite having been weakened by a series of scandals that tarnished his image as a liberal icon. Trudeau’s Liberal party took the most seats in Parliament, giving it the best chance to form a government. However, falling short of a majority meant the Liberals would have to rely on an opposition party to pass legislation. “It’s not quite the same as 2015. It’s not all owing to the leader,” said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto. “Trudeau is prime minister because the rest of the party was able to pull itself together and prevail. While Trudeau certainly deserves credit for what has happened he’s really going to have to demonstrate qualities that he hasn’t yet shown.” Still, the results were a victory for Trudeau, whose clean-cut image took a hit after old photos of him in blackface and brownface surfaced last month. “I’m surprised at how well Trudeau has done,” said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. “I don’t think anybody expected Trudeau to get a majority but they are not that far off.” With results still trickling in early Tuesday, the Liberals had 156 seats — 14 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons. “Tonight Canadians rejected division and negativity. They rejected cuts and austerity. They elected a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change,” Trudeau said early Tuesday. His address to supporters came, unusually, as his Conservative rival, Andrew Scheer, had just begun speaking to his own supporters, forcing networks to tear away from Scheer’s speech. But the prime minister struck a conciliatory note: “To those who did not vote for us, know that we will work every single day for you, we will govern for everyone,” Trudeau said.",Canada's Trudeau Wins a Second Term But Loses His Majority,"October 22, 2019"
19,Eva Vergara / AP,"(SANTIAGO, Chile) — Protesters defied an emergency decree and confronted police in Chile’s capital Monday, continuing violent clashes, arson and looting that have left at least 12 dead and led the president to say the country is “at war.” Police used tear gas and streams of water to break up a march by hundreds of students and union members on one of Santiago’s main streets, but demonstrators who at first dispersed later reformed elsewhere. Meanwhile, police and soldiers guarded Chileans who formed long lines outside supermarkets before they reopened after many closed during a weekend during which dozens of stores were looted or burned. Only one of the city’s six subway lines was operating because rioters had burned or damaged many of the stations, and officials said it could take weeks or months to fully restore service. Some 2 million students were forced to stay home from classes and many people were unable to reach jobs. Conservative President Sebastián Piñera said Sunday night that the country is “at war with a powerful, relentless enemy that respects nothing or anyone and is willing to use violence and crime without any limits.” But he did not identify a specific enemy. After receiving criticism for his comments, he said Monday that he would meet with members of his administration and the opposition “to explore and hopefully advance toward a social agreement … to a better solution for the problems that affect Chileans.” The government is also working on a reconstruction plan that would cover the hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure damaged during the protests, Piñera said.","Chile Is 'At War' Its President Says, as Continuing Clashes Leave 12 Dead","October 22, 2019"
20,Amy Gunia,"Princes Charles, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro are all in Tokyo this week, as foreign figureheads and royals from across the globe flock to Japan to watch Emperor Naruhito formally declare his enthronement on Tuesday. The former Crown Prince took over the role on May 1, the day after his father, 85-year-old former-Emperor Akihito, abdicated the throne citing health concerns. Japan’s monarchs are expected to serve until death, but parliament passed special legislation to allow Akihito to step down. He was the first emperor to step down in more than 200 years. Although Emperor Naruhito has been acting as emperor for almost six months, his ascension is not official until he completes a series of rituals, including Tuesday’s traditional enthronement ceremony. Here’s what to know about this week’s celebrations. The main event will be held at Tokyo’s Imperial Palace on Tuesday when the Emperor will ascend the Takamikura throne, which stands more than 20 feet high. Clad in a dark orange robe, worn by emperors only on special occasions, Naruhito will declare his enthronement in a short speech, according to the Japan Times. Empress Masako, his wife, will be seated in an adjacent throne. Important imperial regalia, like an ancient sword and a jewel will be brought to the ceremony. Following the Emperor’s speech, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will offer congratulations, and lead guests in three cheers wishing longevity to the new emperor. Approximately 2,000 people are expected to join the ceremony.

21,ROB GILLIES / AP,"(TORONTO) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared set to win a second term in Canada’s parliamentary elections Monday, seemingly fending off a challenge from rival Conservatives despite having been weakened by a series of scandals. Trudeau’s Liberal party was projected to win the most seats in the 338-seat Parliament, giving it the best chance to form the next government. However, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said it would be a minority government, forced to rely on an opposition party to stay in power. “It’s way better than I expected. It was conceivable that the Liberals would lose,” said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto. “Trudeau is going to have to command a caucus that will not be as grateful than it was in 2015. A lot of them will say ‘Look we won but not because of you.'” The Canadian vote came down to what was essentially a choice between the handsome and charismatic Trudeau and the Conservatives’ unassuming leader, Andrew Scheer, who was seen as the perfect antidote to Trudeau’s flash and celebrity. Trudeau reasserted liberalism in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative Party government in Canada, but a series of scandals combined with high expectations threatened his prospects. Perhaps sensing Trudeau was in trouble, Barack Obama made an unprecedented endorsement by a former American president in urging Canadians to re-elect Trudeau and saying the world needs his progressive leadership now. Trudeau, son of the liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is one of the few remaining progressive leaders in the world.

22,LYNN BERRY / AP,"KYIV, Ukraine — William Taylor has emerged as an unlikely central player in the events that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. The retired career civil servant was tapped to run the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine after the administration abruptly ousted the ambassador. He was then drawn into a Trump administration effort to leverage U.S. military aid for Ukraine. And then he apparently grew alarmed. “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” he wrote at one point in excerpts of text messages released by impeachment investigators in Congress. Now, members of Congress will hear directly from Taylor. The former Army officer is scheduled to testify behind closed doors in an inquiry trying to determine if Trump committed impeachable offenses by pressing the president of Ukraine into pursuing information that could help his campaign as he withheld military aid to the Eastern European country. Taylor had been serving as executive vice president at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan think tank founded by Congress when he was appointed to run the embassy in Kyiv after Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was removed before the end of her term following a campaign against her led by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. He was chosen for the post because he was among only a handful of former officials with experience in Ukraine who would be perceived as neutral by local officials and wouldn’t raise objections at the White House, according to a colleague. “It was a very short list, but Bill was at the top of it,” said the colleague, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. “We were very grateful he agreed to do it.”",U.S. Diplomat Who Said 'It's Crazy to Withhold Security Assistance' in Ukraine Text Messages to Testify to Congress,"October 21, 2019"
23,JOSEF FEDERMAN / AP,"(JERUSALEM) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Monday that he had failed to form a majority government in parliament, marking a major setback for the embattled Israeli leader that plunges the country into a new period of political uncertainty. In a statement, Netanyahu said he had worked “tirelessly” to establish a unity government with his chief rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, but been repeatedly rebuffed. Facing a Wednesday deadline, Netanyahu said he was returning the “mandate” to President Reuven Rivlin, who will now ask Gantz to try to form a coalition. While Netanyahu remains at the helm of his Likud party, his announcement marked the second time this year that he has been unable to form a government. With Israel’s attorney general set to decide in the coming weeks on whether to indict Netanyahu in a series of corruption cases, the longtime Israeli leader could come under heavy pressure to step aside. In last month’s national election, Netanyahu fell short of securing a 61-seat parliamentary majority. But Rivlin gave Netanyahu the first opportunity to form a government because he had more support — 55 seats — than Gantz, who was supported by only 54. Netanyahu had hoped to form a broad “unity” government with Gantz, who heads the centrist Blue and White party. But Netanyahu insisted that his coalition include his traditional allies, a collection of hardline and religious parties, drawing accusations from Gantz that he was not negotiating in good faith. “Since I received the mandate, I have worked tirelessly both in public and behind the scenes to establish a broad, national unity government. That’s what the people want,” Netanyahu said in a statement. “During the past few weeks, I made every effort to bring Benny Gantz to the negotiating table. Every effort to establish a broad national unity government, every effort to prevent another election,” he said. “To my regret, time after time he declined. He simply refused.” In a short statement, Gantz’s Blue and White party said that “now is the time of action.” “Blue and White is determined to form the liberal unity government, led by Benny Gantz, that the people of Israel voted for a month ago,” it said. There is no guarantee, however, that Gantz will succeed. He has expressed willingness to form a partnership with Likud, but not if Netanyahu continues to lead while he faces such serious legal problems. For the time being, Likud has remained steadfastly behind its leader.","Netanyahu Fails to Form New Government Coalition, Returns Mandate to Israeli President","October 21, 2019"
24,FARAI MUTSAKA / AP,"(HARARE, Zimbabwe) — At least 55 elephants have starved to death in the past two months in Zimbabwe’s biggest national park as a serious drought forces animals to stray into nearby communities in search of food and water, authorities said on Monday. “The problem is real, the situation is dire,” said National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority spokesman Tinashe Farawo. Other animals such as lions at Hwange National Park have been affected. This is the worst drought in years in the southern African nation that also suffers from a collapsing economy. Massive food and water shortages have resulted. As animals stray from Zimbabwe’s wildlife parks they destroy crops and sometimes kill people, Farawo said, adding that more than 20 people have been killed this year alone. Overcrowding in Hwange also contributes to the destruction of vegetation. The park can handle 15,000 elephants but currently has about 53,000, Farawo said. Meanwhile the drought is drying up water sources. The wildlife agency has been drilling wells as deep as 400 meters (yards) to find water for the animals. “The single biggest threat to our animals now is loss of habitat,” Farawo said. “We have managed to significantly reduce poaching … we were losing hundreds of elephants in past years, but last year we only lost not more than 20 to poaching.” Zimbabwe has one of Africa’s largest elephant populations. It seeks to be allowed to hunt and export more of them to ease pressure on the animals’ habitat and raise badly needed money for conservation. Botswana, which also has a large elephant population, this year lifted a ban on elephant hunting, saying the move would help reduce conflict between humans and animals and earn the country much-needed revenue. But other countries that are parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora have successfully lobbied to limit the sales of elephants, to the dismay of some African countries that say they are struggling with large numbers of the animals.

25,Siraphob Thanthong-Knight / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — The official royal consort of Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been stripped of her title, according to a Royal Gazette statement. The title, ranking and all medals have been removed from Sineenat Bilaskalayani for inappropriate behavior and a failure to be loyal to the monarch, according to the statement released Monday night in Bangkok. Sineenat, 34, was the first person to hold the title of Royal Noble Consort in almost a century. Vajiralongkorn designated her as such in July, three months after he announced his fourth wife Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana as the queen. But she failed to respect royal traditions by trying to make herself equivalent to the queen, according to the statement, which added that she also defied the royal couple. “Sineenat’s behavior disrespected the monarchy, caused conflict among royal household officials and created misunderstanding among the public,” it went on to say. In August, the palace released unprecedented pictures and a biography of Sineenat, which provided a rare insight into royal life. Images of her posing with the monarch were among the dozens released. Vajiralongkorn became king in 2016 but the formal coronation was delayed until May this year. Thailand’s top royals are officially treated as semi-divine. They are also protected by lese-majeste laws that allow for as long as 15 years in prison for those convicted of threatening or insulting them, limiting public discussion of the monarchy.

26,Carles Puigdemont i Casamajó,"Francesc Pujols, one of the last century’s most renowned Catalan philosophers, said that “Catalan thought will always grow anew and survive those who would foolishly bury it”. It’s a phrase that still rings true today. Two years after the start of a campaign of repression against the Catalan pro-independence movement intended to ‘decapitate’ it, in the words of the then Vice-President of the Spanish Government, the resurgence of mobilizations, protests and civil disobedience actions in Barcelona and elsewhere has been overwhelming.  No, the Catalan independence movement was not just a flash in the pan. It has not been quashed, as claimed by those in the government who seek to bury it and as reported in the pliant Spanish media. The movement has always existed and will continue to exist until the political conflict is resolved. A week ago, we heard the Spanish Supreme Court’s ruling on the case of some of the people responsible for the independence process. They were sentenced to between 9 and 13 years in prison. This was a conviction not just against the members of my government, but against the 2.3 million Catalans who made the self-determination referendum possible on Oct. 1 2017.  The convictions have triggered a reaction that is impossible to understand for those who still ascribe to the belief that the referendum is a ‘crime’ punishable by harsher sentences that those given for manslaughter. Surely no society would revolt over a fair sentence, nor stand in solidarity with the masterminds behind a crime of such severity. The reason that there has been such an uprising and an outpouring of solidarity is because the sentence is not fair nor are the people convicted guilty of any crime. The crisis that we are experiencing is not regional, or internal, but international. It affects a Europe that has so far remained silent in the face of violations of human rights committed by an E.U. member state. This is not just an opinion, it is a fact asserted by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. European democrats should feel a moral obligation to get involved because, for the first time ever, members of a legitimately elected government and parliament have been imprisoned because of their political decisions. The damage to fundamental European values, which have always been based on the will of the people, may be irreversible if we permit attitudes that we used to think only existed in other regions around the world. For the last two years, I have been living in exile in Belgium. I now face a third arrest and extradition warrant, after the first two were withdrawn by Spain. I am currently free, but await the ruling of the Belgian courts. Meanwhile, I have brought a claim to the European Court of Justice asking that they uphold my rights as a Member of the European Parliament.

Right now the answer is almost certainly not. Brexit is on track to be delayed (again) after Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost a crucial vote in Parliament Tuesday evening, rejecting his plans to speed his last-minute Brexit deal through the Houses of Parliament. The defeat means a Brexit back-and-forth will almost certainly continue past Oct. 31. Johnson has already asked E.U. leaders for an extension until Jan. 31.

28,Associated Press,"AKCAKALE, Turkey — Angry over the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, residents of a Kurdish-dominated city pelted departing American military vehicles with potatoes Monday as they drove through. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that U.S. troops will stay in eastern Turkey to protect Kurdish-held oil fields for at least the coming weeks and that he was discussing options to keep them there. A video by the Kurdish news agency showed a convoy of armored vehicles driving through the northeastern city of Qamishli. People in the street hurled potatoes at the vehicles, shouting, “No America,” and “America liar,” in English. “Like rats, America is running away,” one man shouted in Arabic. Another shouted obscenities and talked of babies in Kurdish-held who have died in the Turkish offensive. dand added a new indignity to an American withdrawal that has been rushed and saw several close brushes with Turkish-backed forces. The Kurds were stunned when President Donald Trump two weeks ago abruptly decided to pull U.S. troops out of border areas, abandoning their allied Kurdish-backed fighters ahead of Turkey’s invasion. After the assault began Oct. 9, Trump ordered a general withdrawal from Syria. At another location, near the town of Tal Tamr, a group of protesters raised banners to departing US troops late Sunday, according to an Associated Press video. One man blocked the way of a U.S. van with a poster reading: “Thanks for US people, but Trump betrayed us.” The Kurdish-led force were the U.S.’s ally in the long and bloody fight that eventually brought down the Islamic State group’s rule over northeast and eastern Syria. Abandoned by U.S. forces, the Kurds agreed to a cease-fire deal brokered by Washington that requires them to leave a section of the border, handing it over to Turkish-backed forces. Esper said he is discussing an option that would keep a small residual U.S. military force to secure oil fields located in eastern Syria and continue the fight against Islamic State militants.",Potatoes Thrown at American Troops As They Depart Northeastern City in Syria,"October 21, 2019"

Known for his down-to-earth style, Widodo opted for an austere ceremony at the heavily guarded Parliament in contrast to the festive parade and horse-drawn carriage at his first inauguration, a relaxed affair where he was cheered on by thousands of waving supporters. A knife attack by an Islamic militant couple against his security minister on Oct. 10 prompted a security crackdown for Widodo’s second inauguration. Army troops and police, along with armored vehicles, firetrucks and ambulances, were deployed across Jakarta and major roads were closed. On his way to the ceremony, Widodo left his convoy with some of his security escorts and shook the hands of supporters, who waved national flags, yelled his name and called him “bapak,” or father. After taking his oath before the Quran, the Muslim holy book, in front of lawmakers and foreign dignitaries, Widodo laid out ambitious targets to help Indonesia join the ranks of the world’s developed nations by its centennial in 2045. He said in his inauguration speech that he expects poverty — which afflicts close to 10 percent of Indonesia’s nearly 270 million people — to be just about wiped out and the country’s annual GDP to reach $7 trillion by then. “For those who are not serious, I’ll be merciless. I would definitely fire people,” Widodo warned. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan were among the dignitaries attending.

Officials in the Santiago region said three people died in fires at two looted supermarkets early Sunday — among 60 Walmart-owned outlets that have been vandalized, and the company said many stores did not open during the day. Five more people later were found dead in the basement of a burned warehouse and were not employees, authorities said. At least two airlines cancelled or rescheduled flights into the capital, affecting more than 1,400 passengers Sunday and Monday. President Sebastián Piñera, facing the worst crisis of his second term as head of the South American country, announced Saturday night that he was cancelling a subway fare hike imposed two weeks ago. The fare boost touched off major protests that included rioting that caused millions of dollars in damage to burned buses and vandalized subway stops, office buildings and stores. After meeting with the heads of the legislature and judicial system Sunday, Piñera said they discussed solutions to the current crisis and that he aims “to reduce excessive inequalities, inequities abuses, that persist in our society.” Jaime Quintana, president of the Senate, said that “the political world must take responsibility for how we have come to this situation.” Authorities said 10,500 soldiers and police officers were patrolling the streets in Santiago as state of emergency and curfew remained in effect for six Chilean cities, but protests continued during the day. Security forces used tear gas and jets of water to try disperse crowds. Interior Minister Andrés Chadwick reported that 62 police officers and 11 civilians were injured in the latest disturbances and prosecutors said nearly 1,500 people had been arrested.

34,MEHMET GUZEL and BASSEM MROUE / AP,"(AKCAKALE, Turkey) — Kurdish fighters and civilians began evacuating from a besieged Syrian town on Sunday, the first pullback under the U.S.-brokered cease-fire deal, opening the way to a broader withdrawal of the Kurdish-led forces from parts of the Turkish border. The evacuation is a boost to a cease-fire that has been shaky since it began on Thursday evening. Clashes have erupted daily, with occasional shelling, particularly around Ras al-Ayn, the border town where Kurdish fighters have been encircled by Turkish-led forces. A local official in Ras al-Ayn told the Associated Press that Kurdish fighters and civilians had begun leaving in convoys. He said it was unsure if it would be completed Sunday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the process. The cease-fire deal only calls for fighters to leave the border area. But Kurdish civilians flee as well because without their protection they fear atrocities by the Turkish-backed Syrian forces. Those fighters, who are Arab and often Islamist extremists, have been accused of killings of Kurdish civilians and captured fighters during this campaign and in other Syrian territory seized in Turkish campaigns since 2017. A senior official in the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Redur Khalil, said that after the Ras al-Ayn evacuation, the forces will withdraw from a zone about 120 kilometers (75 miles) wide and 30-kilometers (20 miles) deep between Ras al-Ayn and the town of Tel Abyad further west. Under the accord, that pullback is supposed to be completed by Tuesday evening when the cease-fire — or pause in fighting, as Turkey calls it — runs out. The Trump administration negotiated the accord after heavy criticism at home and abroad that it had opened the way for the Turkish invasion by abruptly removing its soldiers from northeast Syria . That move abandoned the Kurdish-led force, which had allied with the Americans to fight the bloody, years-long campaign that brought down the Islamic State group’s rule over nearly a third of Syria. Khalil told the AP that the SDF had reached understandings with the Americans to leave the town from the start of the cease-fire but the siege delayed the plans for days.

Three experts defused the 500-pound American bomb during a three-hour operation that also forced 60,000 people to stay in their homes and closed sporting complexes and churches, the news agency ANSA reported. An alarm signaled the all-clear to reopen the city center just before noon, as well as a nearby north-south highway and rail line both connecting Italy with Austria and Germany. The bomb was found close to the city’s central cathedral and not far from the train station — the likely wartime target — during excavation work for a new shopping center. The online news site Neue Suedtiroler Tageszeitung said after being defused, the bomb was brought to a secure site nearby for a controlled explosion. According to historian Ettore Frangipane, Bolzano, in the northern Alto-Adige region bordering Austria, suffered 13 major World War II bombing raids that damaged 60% of the city and killed 200 people. Alto Adige was part of a broad swath of northern Italy that remained under Nazi occupation long after Italy’s 1943 surrender to the Allies.

36,LOLITA C. BALDOR / AP,"(KABUL, Afghanistan) — U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived Sunday in Afghanistan, where stalled peace talks with the Taliban and persistent violent attacks by the insurgent group and Islamic State militants have complicated the Trump administration’s pledge to withdraw more than 5,000 American troops. Esper told reporters traveling with him that he believes the U.S. can reduce its force in Afghanistan to 8,600 without hurting the counterterrorism fight against al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. But he said any withdrawal would happen as part of a peace agreement with the Taliban. The U.S. has about 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan as part of the American-led coalition. U.S. forces are training and advising Afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism operations against extremists. President Donald Trump had ordered a troop withdrawal in conjunction with the peace talks that would have left about 8,600 American forces in the country. U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad had a preliminary peace deal with the Taliban, but a surge in Taliban violence and the death of an American soldier last month prompted Trump to cancel a secret Camp David meeting where the peace deal would have been finalized. He declared the tentative agreement dead. “The aim is to still get a peace agreement at some point, that’s the best way forward,” said Esper, who was making his first trip to Afghanistan as defense secretary. He visited Afghanistan in his previous job as U.S. Army secretary. He would not say how long he believes it may be before a new peace accord could be achieved. A month after the peace agreement collapsed, Khalilzad met with Taliban in early October in Islamabad, Pakistan, but it was not clear what progress, if any, was being made. Esper’s arrival in Kabul came as Afghan government leaders delayed the planned announcement of preliminary results of last month’s presidential election. Esper said he plans to meet with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.",Defense Secretary Mark Esper Visits Afghanistan to Chart a Path Forward,"October 20, 2019"
37,LOLITA C. BALDOR / AP,"(KABUL, Afghanistan) — While President Donald Trump insists he’s bringing home Americans from “endless wars” in the Mideast, his Pentagon chief says all U.S. troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq and the American military will continue operations against the Islamic State group. They aren’t coming home and the United States isn’t leaving the turbulent Middle East, according to current plans outlined by U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper before he arrived in Afghanistan on Sunday. The fight in Syria against IS, once spearheaded by American allied Syrian Kurds who have been cast aside by Trump, will be undertaken by U.S. forces, possibly from neighboring Iraq. Esper did not rule out the idea that U.S. forces would conduct counterterrorism missions from Iraq into Syria. But he told reporters traveling with him that those details will be worked out over time. Trump nonetheless tweeted: “USA soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. We have secured the Oil. Bringing soldiers home!” The president declared this past week that Washington had no stake in defending the Kurdish fighters who died by the thousands as America’s partners fighting in Syria against IS extremists. Turkey conducted a weeklong offensive into northeastern Syria against the Kurdish fighters before a military pause. “It’s time for us to come home,” Trump said, defending his removal of U.S. troops from that part of Syria and praising his decision to send more troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom defend against Iran. Esper’s comments to reporters traveling with him were the first to specifically lay out where American troops will go as they shift from Syria and what the counter-IS fight could look like. Esper said he has spoken to his Iraqi counterpart about the plan to shift about 1,000 troops from Syria into western Iraq. Trump’s top aide, asked about the fact that the troops were not coming home as the president claimed they would, said, “Well, they will eventually.”","U.S. Troops Leaving Syria Will Move to Western Iraq, Defense Secretary Says","Updated: October 21, 2019 12:16 AM ET | Originally published: October 20, 2019"
38,MIKE CORDER and GREGORY KATZ / AP,"(LONDON) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson pressed ahead Sunday with plans to try to win parliamentary backing for his new Brexit deal even as the European Union began considering his grudging request to extend the looming Brexit deadline. As the dust settled on a day of high drama in Parliament, the next steps in Britain’s divisive, tortuous Brexit saga became clear. Monday will feature more legal action, more arm-twisting, cajoling and veiled threats by Johnson and his ministers and more amendments designed by lawmakers to stymie Johnson’s plan to have Britain leave the 28-nation bloc on Oct. 31. In the midst of all this, EU leaders and officials across the Channel were pondering whether to grant the British leader a Brexit extension that he does not even want. As required by law, Johnson sent an unsigned letter to the EU at the last possible moment late Saturday seeking a delay to Britain’s impending Oct. 31 departure. But he followed it with a signed letter indicating that he does not favor another Brexit extension. “My view, and the government’s position, (is) that a further extension would damage the interests of the U.K. and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,” Johnson wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk. Johnson has long declared that he plans to take the U.K. out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal, and his minister in charge of Brexit again emphasized that stance. “We are going to leave by Oct. 31st,” Michael Gove told Sky News on Sunday. “We have the means and the ability to do so.” The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Tusk would consult with other leaders “in the next days” about Johnson’s request, but most signs indicate the EU would prefer an extension to an abrupt no-deal Brexit.","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Pushes for Brexit Delay, Even Though He Doesn't Want One","October 20, 2019"
39,Associated Press,"(AMMAN, Jordan) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a group of American lawmakers on a surprise visit to Jordan to discuss “the deepening crisis” in Syria amid a shaky U.S.-brokered cease-fire. The visit came after bipartisan criticism in Washington has slammed President Donald Trump for his decision to withdraw the bulk of U.S. troops from northern Syria — clearing the way for Turkey’s wide-ranging offensive against the Kurdish groups, who had been key U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State group. Turkey agreed on Thursday to suspend its offensive for five days, demanding the Kurdish forces withdraw from a designated strip of the border about 30 kilometers deep (19 miles). Pelosi, along with the nine-member Congressional delegation, met with Jordan’s King Abdullah II in the capital of Amman late Saturday for talks focusing on security and “regional stability,” according to a statement from her office. Jordan is a key U.S. ally in the region and has been greatly affected by the eight-year-long civil war in neighboring Syria. Jordanian officials say the kingdom hosts some 1 million Syrians who have fled the fighting. “With the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey’s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to ISIS, Iran and Russia,” said the statement, using the Islamic State group’s acronym. Jordan’s state news agency Petra said Abdullah stressed the importance of safeguarding Syria’s territorial integrity and guarantees for the “safe and voluntary” return of refugees. “The meeting also covered regional and international efforts to counter terrorism within a comprehensive approach,” the agency said.",House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Visits Jordan to Discuss 'Deepening' Syria Crisis,"October 20, 2019"
40,TIME Staff,"Tens of thousands of anti-communist protesters defied an official ban to march through one of Hong Kong’s prime tourist districts Sunday. But what began as a peaceful demonstration followed the usual pattern and degenerated into violence, arson and destruction. Marchers originally intended to rally at the West Kowloon high-speed rail terminus—a showpiece transport hub, built at a cost of $10.7 billion, connecting the former British colony to mainland Chinese cities. Some parts of the facility are subject to mainland customs and immigration laws and therefore the terminus is seen as a symbol of Beijing’s presence by many protesters, whose push for greater political freedom has taken on an increasingly anti-China tone over five months of unrest. But the crowds quickly shifted their targets after the march began. The shuttered shopfronts of mainland Chinese businesses were vandalized as the march made its way up the “Golden Mile” of Nathan Road—the prime tourist strip—passing five-star hotels, including the Peninsula hotel, Hong Kong’s 91-year-old “grande dame.” Branches of the Bank of China were broken into and ransacked before being set on fire. Government offices were defaced and petrol bombs were hurled over the walls of a police station and into subway stations, forcing the closure of several. Protesters also erected burning barricades and threw bricks at police, who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon, pursuing protesters up Nathan Road, through the Jordan district, and into the blue-collar heartland of central Kowloon. Many marchers wore masks in contravention of a government ban on facial coverings at public assemblies, meant to deter participation in protests. Others carried Catalonian flags in solidarity with the secessionist movement that has thrown Spain into crisis. The protesters chanted “Stand with Hong Kong! Fight for Freedom!” and called for full democracy for the enclave’s 7.4 million people, who are presently ruled by a Beijing-backed official selected by a so-called “election committee” of just 1,200 members from mostly business and establishment backgrounds. Earlier in the afternoon, a group of South Asians in “I Love HK” shirts stood outside Chungking Mansions—an iconic, 1960s commercial building that is home to a shifting population of traders from the subcontinent and sub-Saharan Africa.",Unrest Continues Unabated in Hong Kong as March on Rail Terminus Degenerates into Arson and Street Battles,"Updated: October 20, 2019 4:59 AM ET"

42,Associated Press,"LONDON — In a major blow to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, U.K. lawmakers voted Saturday to postpone a decision on whether to back his Brexit deal with the European Union, throwing a wrench into government plans to leave the bloc at the end of this month. At a special session of Parliament intended to ratify the Brexit deal, lawmakers voted 322-306 to withhold their approval on the Brexit deal until legislation to implement it has been passed. The vote aims to ensure that the U.K. can’t crash out of the EU without a divorce deal on the scheduled Oct. 31 departure date. But it means Johnson he has to ask the EU to delay Britain’s departure, since Parliament previously passed a law compelling him to do that if a Brexit divorce deal had not been passed by Saturday. The government still hopes it can pass the needed legislation by the end of the month so the U.K. can leave on time. A defiant Johnson said after the vote that he was not “daunted or dismayed” by the result and would push ahead with plans to leave the EU. As lawmakers debated, tens of thousands of anti-Brexit demonstrators descended on London to march to Parliament Square, demanding a new referendum on whether Britain should leave the EU or remain. Protesters, many wearing blue berets emblazoned with yellow stars symbolizing the EU flag, poured out of subway trains and buses for the last-ditch protest effort. Bruce Nicole, a vicar from Camberley southwest of London, said the Brexit deal would harm Britain. “I fervently believe that we should remain in the EU,” he said. “I am British but I am also European.”",British Lawmakers Vote to Delay Brexit Deal Approval,"October 19, 2019"
43,MEHMET GUZEL and SARAH EL DEEB / AP,"AKCAKALE, Turkey — Syrian Kurdish-led forces and Turkey exchanged blame on Saturday for fighting that has rattled a U.S.-brokered cease-fire in northeastern Syria, as the Kurds appealed to Vice President Mike Pence to enforce the deal. The Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement that Turkey has failed to abide by the deal, refusing to lift the siege of Ras al-Ayn, a key border town. It said 30 hours after the five-day pause went into effect on Thursday, there were still reported clashes inside the town and medical personnel could not enter to help wounded. Turkish-backed Syrian fighters encircled Ras al-Ayn just before the cease-fire came into place, trying to crush Kurdish resistance inside. Throughout much of the day Friday, fighting was reported there and in neighboring villages that came under attack by the Turkish-backed forces. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday that Turkey-backed Syrian fighters have prevented a medical convoy from reaching Ras al-Ayn since Friday. It said a medical convoy arrived outside the town but Turkey-backed factions closed the road ahead and behind, leaving it stuck outside Ras al-Ayn. Turkey’s Defense Ministry said Saturday it was “completely abiding” by the accord. It accused Kurdish-led fighters carried out 14 “attacks and harassments” the past 36 hours, most in Ras al-Ayn. It said the Syrian Kurdish fighters used mortars, rockets, anti-aircraft and anti-tank heavy machine guns. The ministry also said it was in “instant coordination” with the United States to ensure the continuity of calm, excluding instances of “self-defense.” The agreement — reached in negotiations between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence — virtually hands Turkey its aims in the invasion, requiring Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border during the cease-fire. The Kurdish-led force, which had only a nominal, indirect role in the deal, said it will abide by the halt in fighting but has not committed to any pull-out. Erdogan warned Friday that Turkey will relaunch its assault on Tuesday when the deal runs out if the Kurdish fighters don’t pull out of a zone 30 kilometers (20-miles) deep running the entire length of the border.",Kurdish and Turkey Forces Reportedly Clash During Shaky Ceasefire,"October 19, 2019"
44,ANDREA ROSA and JOSEPH KRAUSS / AP,"(BARDARASH, Iraq) — For months, every time Turkey threatened to invade northern Syria, Salwa Hanna told her husband they should take their children and flee from the border town of Kobani. And every time, he told her not to worry, because the Americans were there. Now the Christian family is among an estimated 160,000 Syrians who have fled Turkey’s offensive, which began last week after President Donald Trump announced he would move U.S. forces out of the way, abandoning their Kurdish allies. The invasion transformed one of the safest parts of Syria into a war zone, leaving displaced residents with a deep sense of betrayal. Hanna and her husband arrived Thursday at a newly reopened camp in Iraq with their children and two small bags of clothes. They said they borrowed $200 to pay a smuggler to lead them across the border and have nothing left. They were shown to an empty tent with a bare concrete floor. “I left my home, and I had just started a new home, and I left it all behind,” Hanna said. “There are no emotions anymore. We live as if we are dead.” They are originally from Afrin, a Kurdish enclave in northwestern Syria that fell to Turkish troops and allied Syrian fighters in early 2018. There were no Americans in Afrin, and after the Kurds retreated there was no one to prevent the Syrian fighters — a motley crew of former rebels, Islamists, guns for hire and outright bandits — from looting and pillaging. “They stole cars, they stole whatever they wanted. They even stole sandals,” Hanna’s husband, Abdulrahman Ali, said as he waved a flip-flop in the air. “They stole everything. All in the name of revolution or whatever.” So the couple fled with their 10-year-old and their two-year-old, who suffers from asthma. “When they attacked Afrin it was winter, there were no doctors. I thought my son was going to die in front of me,” Hanna said. The harrowing journey brought them to Kobani. A U.S.-led international coalition had partnered with Syrian Kurdish fighters to defeat the Islamic State group, a campaign that began in Kobani after the Kurds were nearly annihilated there in 2014. Northeastern Syria, where armored vehicles mounted with American flags could be seen patrolling on the outskirts of some towns, was a rare refuge from the civil war. Hanna and her husband found work and started setting up a new home. But a shadow clouded their newfound sense of security.",'Only God is With Us.'

45,Ioan Grillo,"In Mexico’s big cities, drug cartel gunmen normally act like phantoms. They hide in safe houses or amid communities, suddenly striking with an assassination or a gunfight, and then disappearing again. Residents know they are there and are scared, but most the time, they can’t see them. But on Thursday in the Sinaloan city of Culiacan, the cartel gunmen were everywhere. They openly drove in trucks with mounted machine guns, blockaded streets flashing their Kalashnikovs and burned trucks unleashing plumes of smoke like it was a scene in Syria. They took control of the strategic points in the metro area, shut down the airport, roads, and government buildings and exchanged fire with security forces for hours, leaving at least eight people dead. In contrast, everyone else had to act like ghosts, hiding behind locked doors, not daring to step outside. And in this unusual battle, the Sinaloa Cartel won. Their uprising was in response to soldiers storming a house on Thursday and arresting Ovidio Guzman, the 28-year old son of convicted kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman. In February, the U.S. Justice Department announced it had indicted Ovidio Guzman on trafficking cocaine, marijuana and meth. But after hours of cartel chaos, Mexico’s federal government gave soldiers the go ahead to release him. It capitulated. I’ve covered Mexico’s drug violence for 18 years, written two books about the subject, and seen many extraordinary episodes. In Sinaloa, the cradle of drug traffickers, I’ve repeatedly been on the crime beat chasing bullet-ridden corpses and into the mountains to Guzman’s opium-growing village. But Thursday was different. It wasn’t gangster action; it was a mass insurrection. “There was panic, terror, the city was under siege,” says Vladimir Ramirez, a political scientist in Culiacan, who like many has continued curfew into Friday. “People slept wherever they were at. Businesses are closed, nobody wants to go out.” This change has not come overnight. It is the result of a bloody trend of cartels developing insurgent tactics over many years. The use of burning vehicles to block roads was taken from militant protesters; cartels use it to stop the movement of troops and put pressure on the government. The cartels have armed up with stolen military weapons and an endless stream of rifles from the United States. Between 2007 and 2018, more than 150,000 firearms seized in Mexico were traced to U.S. gun shops and factories.And cartels from the Texas border to Guadalajara have learned to protect their leaders with rings of gunmen who can cause trouble to stop their capture. Yet it was still shocking on Thursday to see how fast the cartel moved and how brazenly the gunmen stayed on the streets. Residents took dozens of photos of the armed thugs that circulated on social media, amplifying the threat. And it was almost a side note that there was a simultaneous prison break in which 51 inmates fled. “The Sinaloa Cartel demonstrated a tremendous ability to mobilize rapidly and take effective control of the city,” says Raul Benitez, an expert on Latin America’s armed conflicts. “They showed that in Sinaloa, they are the ones who run things.”",How the Sinaloa Cartel Bested the Mexican Army,"October 18, 2019"

The Oracle shopping mall in Reading, England had entered into a six-month pilot period with the American fast food chain, but announced Friday — only eight days after the fast food restaurant’s grand opening — that it would not be renewing the lease, according to the BBC. “At the Oracle, we offer an inclusive space where everyone is welcome,” said a spokesperson for The Oracle in a statement to TIME. “We always look to introduce new concepts for our customers, however, we have decided on this occasion that the right thing to do is to only allow Chick-fil-A to trade with us for the initial six month pilot period, and not to extend the lease any further.” A Chick-fil-A spokesperson, however, says the company always intended to only be at in Reading for that six month pilot. “We have been very pleased with what we’ve seen in the U.K. in terms of customer response to our food and our approach to customer service,” a spokesperson for Chick-fil-A said in a statement to TIME. “We mutually agreed to a six month lease with the Oracle Mall in Reading as part of a longer term strategy for us as we look to expand our international presence.” Chick-fil-A, an Atlanta-based company that has often made headlines for heartwarming stories of customer service, is owned by a family who, in 2012, faced backlash for their ties to millions of dollars of donations to anti-LGBTQ causes. The chain’s owners have publicly stated they support the “biblical definition of marriage.” WinShape Foundation, the owner’s charity foundation, had also donated $1,000 to Exodus International, according to tax records obtained by Equality Matters, an LGBT advocacy organization. Exodus International closed in 2013, but had been a proponent of conversion therapy. The Reading restaurant opened on October 10, and Chick-fil-A told local newspaper the Reading Chronicle that “we are pleased to have already served several hundred customers in our first day.” But the backlash to its presence was swift, as local paper Berkshire Live noted. Reading Pride, a local LGBT advocacy group, had planned a Saturday protest against the mall. “The chain’s ethos and moral stance goes completely against our values, and that of the UK as we are progressive country that has legalized same-sex marriage for some years, and continues to strive towards equality,” said organization in a public statement.

48,Nick Turse,"Pastor Jules Mulindwa runs a rollicking Congolese megachurch complete with flashing lights and a live band. Walk into Sunday services and the applause is startling. Don’t even bother shouting into the ear of the person next to you as the MC — wearing a ruffled white tuxedo shirt beneath a royal blue suit — whips the crowd into an ecstatic fervor. Your neighbor is never going to hear you. The wooden stage at the front of the Cite de Refuge church is painted the sky blue of the Congolese national flag and from it, the faithful shout long-winded testimonials into a microphone. “Those people like Ebola. They’re becoming famous and successful from it,” hollers a middle-aged male parishioner wearing a black suit, near the end of an 8-minute ramble. “They can keep it. Ebola will never reach this church,” For more than a year, the Ebola virus has ravaged communities in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – the provinces of North Kivu, Ituri, and, most recently, South Kivu — areas already wracked by dire poverty, more than 130 armed groups, widespread violence, and mass displacement. When the outbreak was declared in August 2018, it was classified as a Grade 3 Emergency, the World Health Organization’s most dire designation for public health crises. In mid-July, after the first confirmed case of Ebola Virus Disease surfaced in North Kivu’s capital Goma — a city of nearly two million people bordering Rwanda and home to the Cite de Refuge — the WHO declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It is now the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history with 3,220 reported cases and 2,150 deaths.  Mention Ebola in Goma and you’ll hear a riot of rumors, half-truths, and conspiracy theories about the disease: that it doesn’t exist; that it’s been imported for financial gain; that it’s being used to kill people as part of an organ theft plot. A study published in September in the journal PLOS One found that 72% of respondents were dissatisfied with or mistrustful of the Ebola response and 12% believed that the disease “was fabricated and did not exist in the area.” Misinformation is a key factor in making the outbreak so difficult to stamp out, say experts. “One of the reasons why things look so bad is the great suspicion of authorities: a great suspicion that this outbreak was propagated, that it’s not real, that it’s a big hoax,” says Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It’s made controlling Ebola very problematic.” Long an incurable disease, Ebola may someday be preventable and treatable thanks to recent drug advances. Still, with an almost 70% fatality rate during this current outbreak, Ebola continues to be obscenely lethal. To survive it, early medical intervention is key. But Pastor Jules Mulindwa, a compact man with a receding hairline and a thin mustache, has his own protocol. While he doesn’t discount medical science, he doesn’t believe it’s necessary. Experts say that the new Ebola drugs – known as REGN-EB3 and mAb114 – are the first clearly effective treatments for Ebola, but Pastor Jules promotes a different cure: Just bring a bottle of water from your home to his church and raise it high. “From the pulpit, I pray for the water. Then you drink it and you’ll be healed, even if you have Ebola,” he says. In his cavernous Cite de Refuge, Pastor Jules is all smiles and bombast. He gets big laughs talking about rival preachers drinking lotoko — local moonshine that looks like water but tastes like gasoline. The crowd eats it up.  At his home, the bombast remained, but the smiles were absent. He was getting a bad rap, Pastor Jules told me as we sat in the well-manicured courtyard of his large brick compound in a tony part of town along the shore of Lake Kivu. The son of a Pentacostal minister from Goma, Pastor Jules started his own church a decade ago. Now, he claims to have a huge congregation and an empire of 50 churches dotting the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The attack underscored the record-high number of civilians dying in the country’s 18-year war. Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar Province, said the militant attack wounded 36 others. He said it was not immediately clear if the mosque was attacked by a suicide bomber or by some other type of bombing. “Both men and children are among those killed and wounded in the attack,” he said. Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, strongly condemned the attack on his official Twitter account. “The Afghan government strongly condemns today’s suicide attack in a mosque in Nangarhar province,” he tweeted. “The Taliban and their partners heinous crimes continue to target civilians in time of worship,” he added. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but both the Taliban and the Islamic State group are active in eastern Afghanistan, especially Nangarhar province. However, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s spokesman in a statement condemned the attack in Nangarhar and called it a serious crime. Zahir Adil, spokesman for the public health department in Nangarhar Province, said 23 of the wounded were transferred to Jalalabad, the provincial capital, and the rest were being treated in the Haskamena district clinic.","Explosion at Afghan Mosque During Friday Prayers Kills 62, Officials Say","October 18, 2019"
50,Billy Perrigo,"Scotch whisky, French wine and Italian cheeses are about to become much more expensive, after President Donald Trump imposed some $7.5 billion worth of tariffs on E.U. goods. The new tariffs of 25% came into force at just past midnight on Friday, the latest salvo in Trump’s trade wars around the globe. They add to tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports from the E.U. in place since 2018. The U.S. is the E.U.’s biggest export market for food and drink, with 16% of all exports flowing there. The E.U. responded by saying it would impose its own tariffs “in due course” on the U.S. airplane manufacturer Boeing. The list of products released by the U.S. Trade Representative runs to 20 pages, and includes very specific descriptions of products targeted. Here is a generalized list of some of them. All tariffs are 25% and apply to the whole E.U. except where otherwise specified: The U.K. is scheduled to leave the E.U. on Oct. 31, but because each country is named individually in the Trade Representative’s notice, the tariffs will continue to apply. The new tariffs stem from a 15-year-old case that concluded earlier this month when the World Trade Organization ruled that the U.S. could attempt to recoup damages of $7.5 billion stemming from what it called unfair state subsidies given to airplane manufacturer Airbus by the E.U. “Imposing tariffs on each other serves nobody’s long term interest,” the E.U. trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström said in a statement announcing retaliatory tariffs. She called for the U.S. and the E.U. to sit down and negotiate a “balanced and compliant” settlement.","New Trump Tariffs Are About to Make Scotch Whisky, French Wine and Italian Cheese More Expensive","Updated: October 18, 2019 11:43 AM ET"
51,Andrés Villarreal and PETER ORSI / AP,"(CULIACAN, Mexico) — Mexican security forces aborted an attempt to capture a son of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman after finding themselves outgunned in a ferocious shootout with cartel henchmen that left at least eight people dead and more than 20 wounded, authorities said Friday. The gunbattle Thursday paralyzed the capital of Mexico’s Sinaloa state, Culiacan, and left the streets littered with burning vehicles. Residents took cover indoors as automatic gunfire raged outside. It was the third bloody and terrifying shootout in less than a week between security forces and cartel henchmen, raising questions about whether President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s policy of avoiding the use of force and focusing on social ills is working. López Obrador defended the decision to back down, saying his predecessors’ strategy “turned this country into a cemetery, and we don’t want that anymore.” But Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration who worked undercover in Mexico, called the violence “a massive black eye to the Mexican government” and a “sign that the cartels are more powerful” than it is.

52,Rachael Bunyan,"A two-year-old girl is facing deportation from the U.K. even though her parents each hold a British passport, in a move described as “cruel and sadistic” by a U.K. human rights lawyer. Lucy Dutton was born in South Africa and brought to the United Kingdom by her parents in August 2018, when she was 11 months old. Her parents, both originally from South Africa, claimed British citizenship through their parents, who were born in the U.K. But British citizenship through descent only extends to one generation, meaning Lucy does not have an automatic right to stay in the U.K. Her child visitor’s visa expired in February, and her parents’ subsequent attempts to apply for a right for Lucy to remain in the U.K. have been unsuccessful. Laws regarding who is allowed to stay in the U.K. have generally become stricter since the Conservative Party came to power in 2010; the previous laws were “softer and more generous” according to Shoaib Khan, a U.K. human rights lawyer. In particular, the eligibility criteria for visas allowing family members of British citizens to remain in the U.K. were narrowed in 2012 — the visa is now only available to those who require long-term care, which can only be provided by their relatives in the U.K. But in Lucy’s case, the British government argue that this care can be provided in South Africa if her parents return with her. On Oct. 8, the British interior ministry, known as the Home Office, told Lucy in a letter that her application had been declined because she had not lived continuously in the U.K. for seven consecutive years. They said Lucy had 14 days to leave the country or appeal the ruling. It was two days before her second birthday. “When I found about their decision, I broke down sobbing. I was in one hell of a mess at work,” her mother Lindsay Dutton, 30, told TIME, speaking from her home in Swansea, Wales. “I never in a million years expected it to be a refusal. It was the worst day of my life — I’ve cried myself to sleep every night since receiving the letter.” Lucy’s family are appealing the decision and fighting for her to remain in the U.K, but say they are struggling to make ends meet. Her mother already took out a high-interest loan to pay for £3,052 ($3,938) in administrative and legal fees. But they have to raise an additional (£3140) $4,051 to fund an appeal of the decision, before their case is heard in court in November. Dutton says she is unable to borrow more money, so instead she’s set up a Go Fund Me page to raise the funds.",She's 2 Years Old. Her Parents Have British Passports.

53,ANDRÉS VILLARREAL and MARÍA VERZA / AP,"CULIACAN, Mexico (AP) — An intense gunfight with heavy weapons and burning vehicles blocking roads paralyzed the capital of Mexico’s Sinaloa state Thursday after security forces located one of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s sons who is wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges. Mexican security secretary Alfonso Durazo said 30 members of the National Guard and army were patrolling in Culiacan when they were fired on from a house. They repelled the attack and inside the house found Ovidio Guzmán López. The house was then surrounded by heavily armed gunmen who had “a greater force” and authorities decided to suspend the operation, Durazo said. He did not say if Ovidio Guzmán was arrested or went free. “With the goal of safeguarding the well-being and tranquility of Culiacan society, officials in the security cabinet decided to suspend the actions,” said Durazo. José Luis González Meza, a lawyer for “El Chapo’s” family, told The Associated Press that Guzmán’s family has said “Ovidio is alive and free” but that he had no more details about what had happened. Ovidio was not one of the jailed Mexican drug lord’s best-known sons – Iván Archivaldo Guzmán and Jesús Alfredo Guzmán are known as “los Chapitos,” or “the little Chapos,” and are believed to currently run their father’s Sinaloa Cartel together with Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada. But Ovidio Guzmán was indicted in 2018 by a grand jury in Washington, along with a fourth brother, for the alleged trafficking of cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana. Following Thursday’s localization of Ovidio Guzmán, Culiacan exploded in violence with armed civilians in trucks roaring through the city’s center shooting what appeared to be .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns.",Gun Battles Sweep Mexican City After Troops Locate El Chapo's Son,"October 18, 2019"
54,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong’s number two official met with a dismal reception Friday when he went on government-funded radio, in place of the enclave’s embattled leader Carrie Lam, to explain how the administration planned to tackle five months of civil unrest. Morning news presenters at RTHK Radio 3 demanded to know why Lam had not appeared on the show to explain policies herself, asking if she was “scared.” One presenter asked: “What is she doing now, that she can’t be on the show?” Traditionally, Hong Kong leaders appear on the program after giving their annual policy speeches. Lam attempted to give her speech on Wednesday but unruly legislators forced her to abandon the attempt within minutes. She fled the legislature to streams of invective and calls for her ouster, and was forced to deliver the speech later on video. In a stark illustration of the administration’s growing isolation, both presenters and callers to the public broadcaster attacked Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung for Lam’s no-show, and accused the government of ignoring demands for both democratic reform and the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality. Presenters poured scorn on Cheung’s suggestion that the government was actively reaching out to the community, saying that the claim “strains credulity” and pointing out that “in the thousands of hours” that had elapsed since Lam had made such a pledge in August, her dialogue sessions with the public amounted to “two and a half hours in reality.” Cheung replied, “We can’t spend every single minute talking to the community.” The chief secretary also said that the establishment of a judicial commission to look into the police force’s handling of the unrest—a key demand of protesters—would duplicate the work of the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), which was slated to deliver an initial report by the end of the year. He brushed aside a caller’s concerns that the IPCC was ineffectual because it had no power to summon witnesses or compel them to testify. “We take the view that the IPCC provides an already established and independent mechanism for the task,” Cheung said.","""Is She Scared?""

55,W.J. Hennigan,"Eleven days ago, Kurdish and American troops fought side by side against ISIS, as they have for the last five years in Syria. A week ago, the Kurds watched those same Americans flee the battlefield in a disorderly retreat as the Kurds’ sworn enemy, Turkey, invaded their territory. Today, the Kurds saw Vice President Mike Pence seal their military defeat in the name of a “temporary ceasefire.” Pence and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reached the agreement Thursday in Ankara, carving out a 20-mile wide “safe zone” in Syria set to be “primarily enforced” by Turkish forces, according to a document released by both sides. The U.S. agreed to cancel economic sanctions announced just days earlier. In return, Turkey agreed to suspend its military offensive in northern Syria for five days, nominally to allow Kurdish forces to collect their dead, wounded, and retreat from the area. President Donald Trump hailed the deal as a major achievement. “I didn’t know it would work out this well,” he said, while traveling to a political rally in Dallas. “It’s a great day for the United States. It’s a great day for Turkey. It’s a great day for our partners.” Pence declared his mission to Ankara Thursday a success. “We think the agreement today first ends the violence, which is what President Trump sent us here to do,” Pence said. “We’ve achieved that.” But Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, told reporters the agreement was only a “pause” in Turkey’s latest military operation against its long-standing regional enemy. “We got what we wanted,” Cavusoglu said. American experts within the administration, and outside it, agreed with the Turkish diplomat that the U.S. had delivered a win for Ankara that contains few enforceable conditions. “This lets the Turkish offensive stand, and reinforces the impression that it was OK with the President,” said one U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. “It’s a total surrender, and a disgusting betrayal, not just of our allies but of our own people that they’re trying to pass off as some political win.” Eric Edelman, a former ambassador to Turkey under President George W. Bush, said the agreement was a capitulation by the Trump Administration. “There’s no wonder why the Turks are celebrating in Ankara,” he said. “The Administration gave them everything they wanted.” In the U.S. Senate, the developments were not greeted with enthusiasm. A short time after Pence announced the ceasefire, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah took to the Senate floor and called for hearings next week into how the Administration came to its current policy. “I simply don’t understand why the Administration did not explain, in advance, to Erdogan that it is unacceptable for Turkey to attack an American ally,” Romney said. “Are we so weak and so inept diplomatically that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey? Are we incapable of understanding and shaping complex situations? Russia seems to have figured it out. Are we less adept than they? Are our principles to be jettisoned when things get messy?” He added: “What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.” Other Republicans joined in the criticism of the Administration’s efforts. “We’re all searching to see what we can do to mitigate this damage,” said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. “Right now, we need to prepare ourselves for the consequences of what’s to come… Sometimes what is popular in the short term is not good for America’s national security.”","Kurds Await Fate as Trump, Turkey Celebrate Temporary 'Ceasefire'","October 18, 2019"
56,Jasmine Aguilera,"Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn say they made a deathbed promise to seek justice for their son — and they have every intention to keep it. Just two days after the pair took part in a bizarre White House meeting in which President Donald Trump attempted to ambush them with a surprise meeting with the woman believed to have struck and killed their 19-year-old son, Harry Dunn, the grieving parents tell TIME they cannot understand what the American government expects them to do, and they will not simply accept that their son’s suspected killer may be exempt from prosecution because she is the wife of a diplomat. “That’s not going to happen,” Dunn tells TIME. Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American diplomat, is suspected to have struck Harry Dunn on his motorcycle in August, and then fled to the U.S. after claiming diplomatic immunity, igniting pressure on the U.S. to waive that immunity and allow the U.K. to press charges against her. The parents came to the U.S. in an effort to persuade the U.S. government officials to reconsider Sacoolas’ immunity — a law that protects diplomats and their family members from prosecution in the country that they are based — and were shocked when a vague invitation to the White House led to a meeting with the President himself. They were even more stunned when Trump tried to cajole them into meeting Sacoolas, whom they were told was also inside the building. Although they previously called Trump “gracious” during the meeting, they said he seemed surprised when they declined to agree to the unexpected meeting with Sacoolas. “It became quite evident then that he was hoping we were just going to just say ‘Oh great, okay,'” Charles tells TIME. Trump didn’t know that the family had already decided against ever meeting Sacoolas unless it was on U.K. soil and with grief counselors who could help their healing process. On August 27, Harry Dunn was riding his bike near an Air Force base run by the U.S. government when Sacoolas was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road and struck him head on. Tim Dunn was able to arrive on the scene about 40 minutes later. He found his son with broken bones and finding it hard to breath. When first responders sedated Harry, Tim Dunn says he had no idea he would never be able to talk to his son again: “I knew he had broken bones, but at no time did I think he was going to die.” The parents initially thought justice would be easy and swift, considering the evidence against Sacoolas that police have gathered, and her original willingness to cooperate with the investigation — and are now coping with a different reality as they also work through their grief.",'It’s About Our Boy.'

Although the flight was expected to last just 25 minutes, the plane was forced to stay in the air for two hours before turning back to Lahore, according to People.

58,Associated Press,"(BRUSSELS) –– British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s career of disdain for the European Union was a thing of the past on Thursday as he and the bloc’s leaders celebrated their long-sought Brexit deal. He now faces an opponent closer to home: his own Parliament. With the ink barely dry on the proposal and Johnson still happily backslapping EU leaders at a summit in Brussels, a chorus of British party leaders said they would vote against the deal. Crucially, the Northern Irish party that supports Johnson’s minority government also stood opposed, leaving the prime minister uncertain of getting the votes he needs to ratify the agreement. After an intense week of talks and with only two weeks to go until Britain’s scheduled departure on Oct. 31, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker broke the tension with a tweet Thursday morning: “We have one! It’s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment.” The deal found a way to avoid a hard border between Ireland, an EU member, and the U.K.’s Northern Ireland. It crucially also lays a path for Britain’s orderly departure. European leaders unanimously endorsed the proposal on Thursday, formally sending it to the British Parliament, which will consider it in a special session Saturday. He said he was confident he would succeed where his predecessor did not — Theresa May’s proposal was voted down three times in Parliament. “This is a great deal for our country. I also believe it’s a very good deal for our friends in the EU,” Johnson told reporters in Brussels. “There is a very good case for MPs across the House of Commons to express the democratic will of the people as we have pledged many times to do and to get Brexit done.” He will face a struggle. All the major opposition parties condemned the agreement, and Johnson’s key ally, Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, also said its lawmakers would oppose it.","E.U.

59,Zeke Miller and Robert Burns / AP,"(ANKARA, Turkey) — The U.S. and Turkey agreed Thursday to a five-day cease-fire in the Turks’ attacks on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria to allow the Kurds to withdraw to roughly 20 miles away from the Turkish border. The arrangement appeared to be a significant embrace of Turkey’s position in the weeklong conflict. After more than four hours of negotiations with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the purpose of his high-level mission was to end the bloodshed caused by Turkey’s invasion of Syria. He remained silent on whether the agreement amounted to a second abandonment of America’s former Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State. Turkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria a week ago, two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the area. Pence and Secretary of State Mile Pompeo lauded the deal as a significant achievement, and Trump declared it “a great day for civilization.” But the agreement essentially gives the Turks what they had sought to achieve with their military operation in the first place. After the Kurdish forces are cleared from the safe zone, Turkey has committed to a permanent cease-fire but is under no obligation to withdraw its troops. In addition, the deal gives Turkey relief from sanctions the administration had imposed and threatened to impose since the invasion began, meaning there will be no penalty for the operation. Erdogan had stated on Wednesday that he would be undeterred by the sanctions. He said the fighting would end only if Kurdish fighters abandoned their weapons and retreated from positions near the Turkish border. Kurdish forces were not party to the agreement, and it was not immediately clear whether they would comply. Before the talks, the Kurds indicated they would object to any agreement along the lines of what was announced by Pence. But Pence maintained that the U.S. had obtained “repeated assurances from them that they’ll be moving out.” Ankara has long argued the Kurdish fighters are nothing more than an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a guerrilla campaign inside Turkey since the 1980s and which Turkey, as well as the U.S. and European Union, designate as a terrorist organization.",Mike Pence Says Turkish President Erdogan Agrees to Cease-Fire in Syria,"Updated: October 17, 2019 4:06 PM ET"
60,Sanya Mansoor,"Former President Barack Obama on Wednesday endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his re-election bid. Canada’s polls open Monday and opinion surveys indicate that it will be a tight race and Trudeau’s approval ratings are at near-record lows. If Trudeau loses, it would be the first time since 1935 that a first-term Canadian prime minister with a parliamentary majority lost a bid for reelection, according to the Associated Press. Obama’s support comes in the wake of a turbulent month for Trudeau, who has apologized on multiple occasions after photos of him in brownface and blackface surfaced. TIME was the first to report on the issue after obtaining a copy of a photo of Trudeau in brownface at a party at the private school where he was teaching in the spring of 2001. Trudeau’s main opponent Conservative leader Andrew Scheer had criticized Trudeau after the photo was made public, saying it showed a “complete lack of judgement and integrity” and depicted “someone who’s not fit to govern this country.” Obama emphasized Trudeau’s commitment to climate change in his endorsement on Twitter and said that “the world needs his progressive leadership now.” Trudeau responded by thanking Obama and saying, “we’re working hard to keep our progress going.” After the initial TIME story, Trudeau apologized and also admitted to wearing blackface once before, during a high school performance of “Day-O,” a Jamaican folk song famously performed by African American singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte. A third instance of Trudeau with darkened skin also emerged in a video from the early 1990s.  Trudeau said that he was unsure whether more images of him in blackface or brownface existed. ““And I think the question is: ‘How can you not remember that?’” he continued. “The fact is I didn’t understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day.” Contact us at editors@time.com.",Barack Obama Endorses Justin Trudeau Ahead of Canadian Elections,"October 17, 2019"
61,DAVID RISING / AP,"(HAMBURG, Germany) — From his post as a teenage SS private in a watchtower in Nazi Germany’s Stutthof concentration camp, Bruno Dey could hear the screams of Jews dying in the gas chamber. And, Dey later told investigators, the carting of their lifeless bodies to the camp’s crematorium was a daily sight. More than seven decades later, Dey went on trial Thursday on 5,230 counts of accessory to murder in Hamburg state court. Pushed into the courtroom in a wheelchair, accompanied by one of his daughters, the 93-year-old wore a wide-brimmed hat and held a red folder in front of his face to shield it from the cameras. After they had gone, he dropped the cover to reveal a full head of neatly combed white hair and a mustache. He answered basic questions from Presiding Judge Anne Meier-Goering, such as his date and place of birth. As prosecutor Lars Mahnke then detailed how Jews were gassed, shot and starved to death as part of the “systematic killing” in the camp where he stood guard 75 years ago, he showed little expression but appeared to be listening attentively. While there is no evidence of Dey’s direct involvement in a killing in Stutthof, prosecutors argue that as a camp guard from August 1944 to April 1945 he aided in all the killings that took place during that period as a “small wheel in the machinery of murder.” “The accused was no ardent worshipper of Nazi ideology,” prosecutors argue in the indictment. “But there is also no doubt that he never actively challenged the persecutions of the Nazi regime.” Dey, a baker by training, does not deny being a guard at Stutthof. He gave wide-ranging statements to investigators about his service, saying that he was deemed unfit for combat in the regular army in 1944 at age 17, so was drafted into an SS guard detachment and sent to Stutthof, not far from his hometown near Danzig, which is today the Polish city of Gdansk. In deference to his age, trial sessions are being limited to two hours a day, and are scheduled to be held only twice a week.","Former Nazi SS Guard Goes on Trial at Age 93 for 5,230 Counts of Accessory to Murder","October 17, 2019"

But whether Brexit will happen on Oct. 31 remains in doubt, as a crucial caucus of British lawmakers refused to give their support to the deal. British and E.U. negotiators had been in intense talks for days as the deadline approached. “We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted, referring to the next step in the process, where U.K. lawmakers must ratify the deal. Jean Claude Juncker, the E.U. Commission President, also welcomed the deal on Twitter. “Where there is a will, there is a deal – we have one!

Yet even before dawn, Johnson already had to deal with a serious setback when his Northern Irish government allies said they would not back his compromise proposals. The prime minister needs all the support he can get to push any deal past a deeply divided parliament. It only added to the high anxiety that reigned on Thursday morning, with the last outstanding issues of the divorce papers still unclear. Technical negotiators again went into the night Wednesday to fine tune customs and sales tax regulations that will have to regulate trade in goods between the Northern Ireland and Ireland — where the U.K. and the EU share their only land border. And they were set to continue right up to the summit’s mid-afternoon opening. If a deal is agreed on during the two-day summit, Johnson hopes to present it to Britain’s Parliament at a special sitting Saturday. After months of gloom over the stalled Brexit process, European leaders have sounded upbeat this week. French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that “I want to believe that a deal is being finalized,” while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said negotiations were “in the final stretch.” Johnson — who took office in July vowing Britain would finally leave the EU on Oct. 31, come what may — was slightly more cautious. He likened Brexit to climbing Mount Everest, saying the summit was in sight, though still shrouded in cloud. Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party added to those clouds early Thursday.

65,ZEKE MILLER and ROBERT BURNS / AP,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior U.S. delegation faces the herculean task of pressuring Turkey to accept a cease-fire in Northern Syria, hours after President Donald Trump declared the U.S. has no stake in defending Kurdish fighters who died by the thousands as America’s partners against Islamic State extremists. Vice President Mike Pence, heading a U.S. delegation that includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien, is set to arrive in Turkey Thursday afternoon, a day after Trump dismissed the very crisis he sent his aides on an emergency mission to douse. Trump suggested Wednesday that a Kurdish group was a greater terror threat than the Islamic State group, and he welcomed the efforts of Russia and the Assad government to fill the void left after he ordered the removal of nearly all U.S. troops from Syria amid a Turkish assault on the Kurds. “Syria may have some help with Russia, and that’s fine,” Trump said. “They’ve got a lot of sand over there. So, there’s a lot of sand that they can play with.” He added: “Let them fight their own wars.” The split-screen foreign policy moment proved difficult to reconcile and came during perhaps the darkest moment for the modern U.S.-Turkey relationship and a time of trial for Trump and his Republican Party allies. Severe condemnation of Trump’s failure to deter Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s assault on the Kurds, and his subsequent embrace of Turkish talking points about the former U.S. allies, sparked bipartisan outrage in the U.S. and calls for swift punishment for the NATO ally. Republicans and Democrats in the House, bitterly divided over the Trump impeachment inquiry, banded together for an overwhelming 354-60 denunciation of the U.S. troop withdrawal. Many lawmakers expressed worry that the withdrawal may lead to revival of IS as well as Russian presence and influence in the area — in addition to the slaughter of many Kurds.

66,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong’s new legislative season continued its disastrous start Thursday after the city’s top official was prevented from carrying out a question-and-answer session on her policies for the coming year. Several pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected from the proceedings for unruly conduct and the session, which had to be suspended twice, eventually broke up in disarray. The chaotic scenes were a repeat of yesterday’s fiasco, when Chief Executive Carrie Lam was unable to give her annual policy address in the chamber and was instead forced to flee, under a torrent of abuse, to deliver the speech by video two hours later. The latest curtailed meeting is only the second to be held in the chamber since it underwent a $5 million renovation after anti-government protesters ransacked it in July, and augurs poorly for Hong Kong, where a fledgling movement for full democracy is pitted against an unrepresentative, Beijing-backed government headed by Lam. The chief executive was swamped in verbal abuse from the opening of the session. “Don’t be our chief executive—go be the leader of China,” shouted the chairman of the main opposition Democratic Party, Wu Chi-wai, as he was being dragged out of the meeting. “Leave! The earlier the better! You talk trash and you are very unwelcome here!”  Legislator Claudia Mo yelled “Carrie Lam is a liar!” before being escorted out. Several of her colleagues followed. Many wore black t-shirts that read “Five demands, not one less”—a slogan of the Hong Kong protests. Others held up placards with images of Carrie Lam with bloodied hands, conveying their anger at her refusal to hold an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality. Lam, who was only able to take questions from three pro-government lawmakers before the meeting broke up, appealed across the divide. “Despite the chaos going on in society, despite the dissatisfaction towards the government, we will still work hard to restore the normal operations of society,” she said. “I hope all lawmakers can let the government operate normally.” But she also repeated her refusal to take any initiative contrary to the “One Country, Two Systems” formula by which Hong Kong is governed, whereby the enclave is promised a high degree of autonomy in exchange for acknowledging Beijing’s sovereignty. Her stance underscores the difficulty of reaching a political compromise in the former British colony, where calls for self-determination have grown during five months of unrest.",Chaos Returns to Hong Kong's Legislature as Pro-Democracy Lawmakers Disrupt Leader's Q&A Session,"October 17, 2019"
67,ELENA BECATOROS and BASSEM MROUE / AP,"CEYLANPINAR, Turkey (AP) — Syrian forces on Wednesday night rolled into the strategic border town of Kobani, blocking one path for the Turkish military to establish a “safe zone” free of Syrian Kurdish fighters along the frontier as part of its week-old offensive. The seizure of Kobani by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad also pointed to a dramatic shift in northeastern Syria: The town was where the United States military and Kurdish fighters first united to defeat the Islamic State group four years ago and holds powerful symbolism for Syrian Kurds and their ambitions of self-rule. The convoys of government forces drove into Kobani after dark, a resident said. The resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, was one of the few remaining amid fears of a Turkish attack on the town. Syria’s state-run media confirmed its troops entered the town. Syria’s presence in Kobani puts a firm limit on Turkish ambitions in its offensive. The town lies between a Turkish-controlled enclave farther west and smaller areas to the east that Turkey seized in the past week. Turkey had talked of creating a 30-kilometer (19-mile) deep “safe zone,” driving out Kurdish fighters from the border region. Turkish forces had shelled Kobani in recent days as part of the offensive but had not advanced ground troops on it. The battle for Kobani turned the once-nondescript town into a centerpiece of the international campaign against IS, with TV cameras flocking to the Turkish side of the border to track the plumes of smoke rising from explosions in the besieged town.

68,JOSEPH WILSON / AP,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Rioting raged in Barcelona and several other Catalan towns for a third straight night Wednesday, with police fighting running street battles with protesters angered by lengthy prison sentences for nine leaders of the wealthy region’s drive for independence from Spain. Tens of thousands of protesters faced off against police in Barcelona. Some set up flaming barricades in the streets, torching cars and trash cans. They chanted, “The streets will always be ours!” Catalan police said protesters threw gasoline bombs, stones, bottles and firecrackers at them. Violence erupted in Catalonia after Spain’s Supreme Court on Monday sentenced nine separatist Catalan leaders to up to 13 years in prison for their part in an October 2017 effort to declare independence for the region. After a surge in separatist sentiment since the global economic crisis that hit Spain particularly hard, around half of Catalonia’s 7.5 million residents want to break away from Spain and forge a new European country. The divisive issue has divided families and friends, but demonstrations had largely been peaceful until this week. Outnumbered police used riot helmets, vests and shields for protection. They fired foam bullets and swung batons to keep away the swarming radicals, most of who covered their faces. Police also drove armored vans at high speeds to scatter the crowds. When police succeeded in dispersing one hot spot, another erupted. One police helicopter was hit by five “pyrotechnic” objects similar to fireworks, according to the regional police force. The rare passers-by or tourists caught in the middle of the melees scurried to safety. Some residents tossed water from balconies down on burning trash bins and debris while firefighters tried to keep up with the emergencies.",Police and Protesters Clash in Catalonia for a Third Consecutive Night,"October 17, 2019"
69,W.J. Hennigan,"Declaring his abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops in northern Syria “strategically brilliant,” President Donald Trump Wednesday scrambled to contain the damage from what outraged Republicans and Democrats said was an expanding litany of losses for American national security interests in the region. Trump welcomed Russia’s rapid takeover of American positions in the region. He said that the Kurds, long Washington’s ally against ISIS, were “no angels” and that some were in fact worse terrorists than ISIS itself. And he described mounting violence that has killed scores of civilians and has included multiple reports of war crimes, as a fight over sand that didn’t concern the U.S. It was a dizzying series of statements by the President that contradicted policies touted by Trump’s own administration as recently as two weeks ago. The result, said worried foreign policy experts, was not just a short term danger of a resurgent ISIS and the human cost as foreign forces swept through the power vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal, but a larger shift in power in the region. “The world sees a U.S. President with no plan or understanding of the lasting and severe consequences of both his actions and inactions,” said Chuck Hagel, a former U.S. Defense Secretary and Republican Senator from Nebraska. Trump’s sharp break with his own recent policies reflected how rapidly and unfavorably events in Northern Syria have unfolded in the wake of his Oct. 6 phone call with Turkey’s leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump said it was “a good thing” that Russian forces had begun supporting the Kurds. On Tuesday, Russians were already sleeping in bunks at bases that American troops had spent years building and provisioning only to abandon them in haste just hours earlier. Trump’s former counter-ISIS envoy Brett McGurk wrote on Twitter that U.S. forces were “executing [an] emergency ‘break glass’ evacuation procedure reserved for an extreme worst-case scenario.” The result, says Hagel is a big win for Russian president Vladimir Putin. “Russia comes out the big winner in the Middle East,” Hagel said. “Putin now is the go-to guy in the Middle East. Assad will do what Putin wants.” Trump likewise downplayed his abandonment of the Kurds, who had fought ISIS alongside U.S. troops since 2015. Following the U.S. retreat, the Kurds switched military allegiances for their own survival, aligning themselves this week with Syria’s President Bashar Assad and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. “The Kurds are very well protected,” Trump said, “Plus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they’re no angels.” Republican Senators like Lindsey Graham were particularly vocal in criticizing Trump’s abandonment of the Kurds in the fight against ISIS.  “I worry we will not have allies in the future against radical Islam, ISIS will reemerge, & Iran’s rise in Syria will become a nightmare for Israel,” Graham tweeted, “I fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making.” Although ISIS is no longer in control of any major city in Iraq or Syria, the fighting is not over. The U.S. had been relying on the Kurds to destroy remaining underground ISIS cells and to guard more than 30 detention facilities that hold about 11,000 ISIS detainees spread across northern Syria. Trump also dismissed reports of mounting violence, which the U.N. said has displaced 130,000 people and killed scores of others. “It’s a problem we have very nicely under control,” Trump told reporters. “It’s not our problem,” Trump said. “They’ve got a lot of sand over there… There’s a lot of sand they can play with.”",Litany of Defeat: Trump Defends Rising Costs of 'Strategically Brilliant' Mideast Retreat,"October 17, 2019"
70,Justin Sink / Bloomberg,"President Donald Trump wrote a letter to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling on him to “work out a good deal!” and warning him not to be a “tough guy” or “fool.” “History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way,” according to the Oct. 9 letter, reported earlier by Fox Business Network and confirmed by the White House. “It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don’t happen.” Trump has been trying to contain the damage from his sudden move last week to pull American forces from northern Syria, allowing Turkey to proceed with a military operation in the region. The withdrawal left Kurdish fighters who fought for several years alongside American troops against Islamic State exposed to attack from the Turkish military. Trump on Wednesday stood by his decision, rejecting criticism from key GOP supporters in Congress that he abandoned Kurdish allies and allowed Russia to fill the void. Trump’s letter told the Turkish leader: “I have worked hard to solve some of your problems.” He didn’t elaborate. Trump also referred to the case of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical pastor who had been held captive in Turkey on terrorism charges. Trump told Erdogan in the letter: “You don’t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don’t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy — and I will. I’ve already given you a little glimpse with respect to Pastor Brunson.” Brunson was freed from prison in Turkey in 2018 after Trump doubled metal tariffs on Turkey, fueling a weakening of the lira, and imposed financial sanctions on key Erdogan aides involved in the pastor’s case. Brunson had been accused of collaborating with terrorist groups and participating in a 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, charges he strongly denied.",'Don't Be a Tough Guy. Don't Be a Fool!'

72,ROSHAN MUGHAL and AIJAZ HUSSAIN / AP,"(ISLAMABAD) — Pakistani and Indian troops exchanged gunfire in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, killing four civilians and wounding nearly a dozen others, officials from both sides said Wednesday, as tensions remain high between the two South Asian countries. Kashmir is split between Pakistan and India and claimed by both countries in its entirety. They have fought two wars over the province. India sparked a new round of tensions in August, when it downgraded the autonomy of its side of Kashmir and imposed tighter controls on the area. On Wednesday, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said it summoned an Indian diplomat to lodge its protest over the previous day’s “cease fire violations” that killed three civilians, including two children, on the Pakistani side of the contested Kashmir border. In neighboring India, Lt. Col. Devender Anand, an army spokesman, said Pakistan fired at two dozen Indian army posts along the highly militarized Poonch sector Monday and Tuesday. He said Pakistani troops used mortar and machine-guns and targeted several villages as well. Anand blamed Pakistan for initiating the fire and said Indian troops “befittingly” responded to what he called a series of unprovoked cease-fire violations. Earlier, an Indian civil administrator, Rahul Yadav, said that a young woman and several cattle were killed because of Pakistani firing in the Poonch sector Tuesday. Also Wednesday, Indian police officer Parvaiz Ahmed said Indian security forces killed three militants in an exchange of gunfire in southern Kashmir after receiving intelligence that a group of militants was hiding in the town Bijbehara town. Police also said gunmen fatally shot one brick kiln worker and one apple trader from the Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Punjab states on Wednesday in Indian-controlled Kashmir.","Pakistani and Indian Troops Exchange Gunfire in Kashmir, Killing 4 Civilians","October 16, 2019"
73,Gina Martinez,"President Donald Trump surprised the family of a British teen killed in a road accident by offering to introduce them to the diplomat’s wife who is allegedly responsible for his death. Harry Dunn’s mother, Charlotte Charles, told Sky News that the “bombshell” offer was dropped on them during their 15-minute meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The parents told the U.K. news outlet that they were surprised when Trump told them Anne Sacoolas, the woman suspected of hitting their son in the fatal road accident in the U.K. in August, was also at the White House, and willing to meet. Sacoolas, the wife of a U.S. diplomat, left the U.K. after the fatal crash and the State Department has blocked British investigators by claiming diplomatic immunity. With the help of the Dunn family’s activism, the incident has made international headlines. For weeks they have been pleading with British and American officials to bring Sacoolas back to the U.K. to face justice. “The bombshell was dropped not soon after we walked in the room that Sacoolas was in the building and was willing to meet with us,” Charles said. “We made it very clear, as we’ve said all along, we will meet with her and we are still willing to see her… but it has to be on our terms and on U.K. soil.” Although they were surprised by the circumstances surrounding the meeting, the Dunn family said that they were pleased with how Trump otherwise handled the meeting. Charles called Trump “gracious,” and said that when the family asked him to put himself in their shoes and consider what he would do if was his son, Trump told them he would “push to look at this from a different angle.” But Tim Dunn, Harry’s father, told Sky News in the same interview that Trump did not suggest returning Sacoolas to the U.K. and that the surprise meeting was not what the family had in mind. “We said from the start that’s not what we wanted,” Dunn said. “We weren’t ready to meet her and we felt a bit rushed.”","During White House Meeting, Trump Surprised Family of Dead U.K. Teen by Offering to Introduce Them to Woman Suspected of Killing Him","October 16, 2019"
74,"Anna-Catherine Brigida / Ciudad Juarez and Matamoros, Mexico","Forty-four numbers need to be called before Sofia and her family finally have the chance to seek asylum in the United States. Camped out in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juárez with her husband and two kids, she anxiously waits for her number to be called. The family arrived in August, after they fled threats from a cartel in their hometown in Zacatecas in Central Mexico.  Officials told the family to wait in line behind thousands of asylum seekers – Cubans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Ugandans and more. Instead the family pitched a tent by the bridge and joined a separate list for Mexican asylum seekers, which sprung up in recent weeks. “[Other migrants] say it’s better to wait here,” says Sofia, whose name has been changed because she fears retaliation for speaking out. “The other way could take years.” Legally, migrants like Sofia and her family should be able to present themselves at a U.S. port of entry to request asylum. But since at least 2016, U.S. officials from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have only allowed a limited number of asylum seekers – although they won’t say just how many – to present themselves at a port of entry each day in a process known to immigration advocates as metering. (One official speaking to TIME said the number used to be around 70 per day for one port of entry in Juarez, but is now around 30.) At least one class action lawsuit has challenged metering as illegal for all asylum seekers, but for Mexican asylum seekers, metering is particularly dangerous.  “Under U.S. and international law, CBP can’t turn them away at a port of entry, especially a Mexican national because you are returning them to the same country from which they’re fleeing persecution,” says Shaw Drake, policy counsel at the ACLU Border Rights Center. Mexicans like Sofia have grown frustrated with the delay. There are now an estimated 26,000 people of all nationalities on metering lists in Mexican border cities, including Ciudad Juárez, Matamoros, Nogales, and Tijuana. Some are staying in shelters that have grown more crowded as some 50,000 people have been turned back to await their court dates under the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as Remain in Mexico. Others live in tents on the streets in cities where temperatures can reach the high 80s and 90s and murders and kidnappings are common. In Ciudad Juárez, these Mexican asylum seekers hope staying close to the bridge means they won’t miss their chance when CBP allows the next people to present themselves.  “They just tell us to wait,” says Monica, a 30-year-old mother from the western Mexican state of Michoacán who fled cartel violence with her husband and three daughters. The family is number 165 on the list. “They don’t give us answers. Nothing progresses.” Homicides, kidnappings and disappearances have increased in Mexico in the last decade as drug cartels fight over key territory. The government’s military response has had limited success. But dating back to the Obama Administration, Mexican nationals have received asylum at lower rates than the national average. From 2011 to 2016, Mexico had one of the highest asylum denial rates of any nationality, with about 90 percent of cases denied, according to data gathering organization TRAC. In 2018, only about 15 percent of Mexican asylum seekers won their cases, compared to the 35 percent average for all nationalities.",Mexican Asylum Seekers Are Facing Long Waits at the U.S. Border.

75,Belinda Luscombe,"South Sudan ranks just above Syria and Afghanistan as the least peaceful country in the world. Its people are being force-fed the full toxic stew of warfare: violence, child soldiers, warlords (remember Joseph Kony?), famine, displacement, statelessness. Bishop Eduardo Hiiboro Kussala, who heads the Catholic church in the Tombura-Yambio diocese in the country’s southwest, is trying to broker a peace between its warring factions. The country, whose population is largely Christian, won its independence from Sudan in 2011 after a protracted campaign that involved thousands of lost lives and billions of dollars of foreign aid, mostly from the U.S. By 2013, it had slipped back into violence. Since then, the U.S. has spent about $4 billion on humanitarian assistance, most of it on food aid. Today, two-thirds of the country’s citizens are displaced or living without adequate food or shelter. On Nov. 12, a new transitional government, comprised of President Salva Kiir Mayardit and former vice president turned rebel leader Riek Machar, is scheduled to come to power in the latest attempt to bring peace. But preparations for this switch are far behind. Bishop Kussala, the Vatican’s representative at the peace negotiations, grew up in refugee camps with his grandmother after his village was attacked and his mother killed when he was nine months old. Before South Sudan gained independence he ran churches and taught in refugee camps in the neighboring Central African Republic. Along with other faith leaders, he has had some success in brokering a peace for the Western Equatoria region in which he works, partly by persuading rebel armies to lay down their arms and partly by persuading the cowboy-hat wearing South Sudanese President Kiir to honor existing peace agreements. In an interview in New York City to raise money for the Sudan Relief Fund, he talks about why Americans should not give up on the newest member of the United Nations. BISHOP EDUARDO HIIBORO KUSSALA: I don’t call it a tribal or ethnic war, but a war of ignorance. These people for centuries never had a country of their own. To organize a nation needs a lot of work. A Minister of Finance or a Minister of Foreign Affairs was [previously] a commander in the bush fighting. And nearly 95% of the population don’t know how to read and write. When there are property disputes and problems, people take care of security within their communities, within their own tribal bodies. I didn’t do it alone, I invited all the faith-based organizations, Christian and Muslim, saying that if we have faith we have to work to bring peace. More than three times I was made to kneel down at gunpoint, but we kept telling these young boys that ‘Look, the country’s yours, and the country belongs to your future. And this gun can’t take you anywhere, what do you want?’ The President had said ‘If you can manage to convince these young people to come out of the bush I will collaborate with you.’",The South Sudanese Bishop Trying to Bring War to an End in the World’s Newest Country,"October 16, 2019"
76,Raf Casert and Jill Lawless / AP,"(BRUSSELS) — European Union and British negotiators failed to reach a breakthrough in Brexit talks during a frantic all-night session and will continue seeking a compromise on the eve of Thursday’s crucial EU summit. An EU official, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations were still ongoing, said Wednesday that “discussions continued until late in the night and will continue today.” Both sides were hoping that after more than three years of false starts and sudden reversals, a clean divorce deal for Britain leaving the bloc might be sketched out within the coming hours. Even though many questions remain, diplomats made it clear that both sides were within touching distance of a deal for the first time since a U.K. withdrawal plan fell apart in the British House of Commons in March. But talks saw no deal materializing between experts from both sides holed up late into the night at EU headquarters in Brussels. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office said the negotiations had been “constructive” and would continue. Johnson is eager to strike a deal at an EU summit starting Thursday that will allow for the U.K. to leave the bloc in good order on the scheduled date of Oct. 31, fulfilling his promise to get Brexit done, come what may. But both sides say gaps remain over plans for keeping goods and people flowing freely across the Irish border, the thorniest issue in the talks.",Brexit Negotiators Fail to Reach a Breakthrough as Talks Continue Ahead of a Crucial E.U.

77,Hyung-Jin Kim / AP,"(SEOUL, South Korea) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to surmount U.S.-led sanctions on his country in state media reports Wednesday alongside evocative propaganda images of him riding a white horse seen as foretelling significant decisions as his own deadline for U.S. movement on nuclear talks is nearing. The images in his country’s official media showed a bespectacled Kim, wearing a long, light-brown coat and riding up snow-covered Mount Paektu on horseback. The location and the animal are symbols associated with the Kim family’s dynastic rule. The highest point on the Korean Peninsula is sacred to North Koreans, and Kim has visited it before making major decisions such as the 2013 execution of his powerful uncle and his 2018 entrance into diplomacy with Seoul and Washington. The images and Kim’s comments were released days after his country’s first nuclear negotiations with the U.S. in more than seven months fell apart. South Korean media quickly speculated Kim may be considering a new strategy in his dealings with the U.S. because he’s previously demanded Washington come up with new proposals to salvage the stalemated diplomacy by the end of December. “He, sitting on the horseback atop Mt Paektu, recollected with deep emotion the road of arduous struggle he covered for the great cause of building the most powerful country with faith and will as firm as Mt Paektu,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said. North Korean documents say Kim’s grandfather and national founder Kim Il Sung had an anti-Japan guerrilla base on Paektu’s slopes during Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. The official biography of Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, says the second-generation leader was born on Paektu when a double rainbow filled the skies. The white horse is also a propaganda symbol for the Kim family that has ruled North Korea for seven decades with a strong personality cult surrounding family members. State media have occasionally shown Kim, his sister and his father riding white horses. The symbolism goes back to Kim Il Sung, who according to the North’s official narrative, rode a white horse while fighting Japanese colonial rulers. KCNA said Kim also visited nearby construction sites in Samjiyon County and complained about U.S.-led U.N. sanctions imposed on his country because of its nuclear and missile programs.",Kim Jong Un Vows to Fight U.S. Sanctions as Deadline for Nuclear Talks Nears,"October 16, 2019"
78,TIME Staff,"Pro-democracy lawmakers forced the adjournment Wednesday of the annual policy address by Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam. It was the isolated leader’s first appearance in the newly reopened legislature, refurbished to the tune of $5 million after protesters ransacked it in July. Legislative Council president Andrew Leung adjourned the meeting barely minutes after it had begun, when opposition legislators started chanting “Carrie Lam step down!” and used a projector to beam slogans onto the chamber wall. Several legislators were ejected from the chamber. Lam was instead forced to deliver her speech via a video broadcast 90 minutes later—the first time in Hong Kong’s history that a leader has had to resort to such a measure. In her address, she warned that “any acts that advocate Hong Kong’s independence and threaten the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests will not be tolerated,” before going on to outline several initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, the lack of which has helped fuel the raging social discontent behind five months of anti-government protest. “So long as Hong Kong remains impeded by unresolved disputes, ongoing violence, confrontation and discord, our city cannot embark on the road to reconciliation and people will lose faith in the future,” Lam said. “We have to put aside differences and stop attacking each other.” Speaking to reporters after the meeting’s adjournment, democratic lawmaker Tanya Chan said: “I really urge [Lam], if she can’t govern Hong Kong, and has no determination to govern Hong Kong, and no ability or even capability of administrating Hong Kong, to please step down. This is the only way we can have a good future, the only way Hong Kong can go forward. Please, please Carrie Lam, please don’t let us suffer anymore. Please go.” Legislator Claudia Mo accused Lam of being “a puppet on strings, being played by Beijing,” while lawmaker Alvin Yeung told reporters: “What leader, in reading out a policy report, can only do it on TV? It is those who have failed, those who cannot face the public.” Pro-Beijing lawmakers strongly condemned the disruptions. “The behavior of my colleagues in disrupting the delivery of the policy address by the chief executive is anti-democratic and oppressive of the rights of the chief executive, and the rights and freedoms of myself and colleagues who want to listen to the policy address,” Legislative Council member Regina Ip said at a press conference. “Nothing can justify that sort of behavior.” Establishment politicians also criticized the content of Lam’s address. “On the subject of ending violence, we hoped that the government would have concrete policies and measures so that people can trust that order in society can be restored, instead of just asking people to be sensible and peaceful,” Starry Lee, head of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, told media. “But the policy address did not have any practical, concrete response.”",Hong Kong Leader's Annual Policy Speech Adjourned After Rowdy Lawmakers Disrupt Proceedings,"Updated: October 16, 2019 5:51 AM ET"
79,Aritz Parra and Renata Brito / AP,"(BARCELONA, Spain) — Violent clashes erupted for a second night in Barcelona between police and protesters angry about the conviction of a dozen Catalan separatist leaders, as Spain launched an investigation Tuesday into an activist group organizing the demonstrations. Thousands of people held vigils near the Spanish government offices in Catalonia’s four provinces. But the gatherings turned into melees, with protesters hurling firecrackers and other objects at anti-riot officers and kicking temporary fences around the official buildings. In Barcelona, protesters sang the Catalan anthem and shouted “The streets will always be ours” and “Independence,” while they called Spanish police “occupying forces” and urged them to leave Catalonia. Demonstrators erected improvised barricades with trash bins, fences and piles of cardboard that they set on fire. The greatly outnumbered riot police went in with shields and batons striking protesters in their path. They hit people on the legs mostly and fired foam-type anti-riot bullets that dispersed the crowds. There were also clashes in Girona, Lleida and Tarragona as well as smaller towns across Catalonia. In a statement late Tuesday, the office of the Spanish prime minister said protesters were causing “damage” and “vandalism,” and accused “groups who use street violence to break coexistence in Catalonia” of coordinating the rioting. Most impromptu protesters were responding to an online campaign by Tsunami Democratic, a loose, leaderless grassroots group that uses encrypted messaging apps to call for peaceful disobedience.

80,Lefteris Pitarakis and Bassem Mroue / AP,"(CEYLANPINAR, Turkey) — Russia moved to fill the void left by the United States in northern Syria on Tuesday, deploying troops to keep apart advancing Syrian government forces and Turkish troops. At the same time, tensions grew within NATO as Turkey defied growing condemnation of its invasion from its Western allies. Now in its seventh day, Turkey’s offensive against Kurdish fighters has caused tens of thousands to flee their homes, has upended alliances and is re-drawing the map of northern Syria for yet another time in the 8-year-old war. Russia moved quickly to further entrench its role as a power broker after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the pullout of American forces in northeastern Syria. The American move effectively abandoned the Kurdish fighters who were allied with the U.S. and cleared the way for Turkey’s invasion aimed at crushing them. Desperate for a new protector, the Kurdish administration struck a deal with the Russia-backed government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose forces on Sunday began moving into Kurdish-administered areas to shield them against Turkey. Syrian troops waved flags after they rolled into Manbij, a flashpoint town west of the Euphrates River that Turkey had been aiming to capture and wrest from Kurdish control. Video by Russian journalists with the troops showed what appeared to be an abandoned outpost where U.S. forces had been stationed. A U.S. military spokesman, Col. Myles B. Caggins, confirmed U.S. troops had completed their pullout from Manbij. During the withdrawal, contacts were kept open with the Turks and Russians to ensure the several hundred American forces there got out safely, U.S. officials said. U.S. troops have had outposts in Manbij since 2017, when they went in to avert a battle over the town between Turkish and Kurdish fighters. Now Russia was playing that role.

82,MATTHEW DALY / AP,"WASHINGTON — The House passed three bills Tuesday aimed at showing U.S. support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The action follows months of protests over the Beijing government’s aggressive attempts to enforce control over the semi-autonomous territory. One of the bills condemns China’s intrusions into Hong Kong’s affairs and supports the right of people to protest. Another requires annual reviews by the U.S. secretary of state of Hong Kong’s special economic and trade status, providing a check on Beijing’s influence over the territory. A third bill would ensure that U.S. weapons are not being used against protesters by police. All three bills were approved on separate voice votes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the bills important reminders of U.S. support for human rights in the face of significant commercial interests in China. “If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, then we lose all moral authority to speak out on behalf of human rights any place in the world,” she said. Pelosi said the bravery of young protesters in Hong Kong stands in contrast to “the cowardly government that refuses to respect the rule of law” and the “one country, two systems” policy that was supposed to ensure a smooth political transition after the former British colony was returned to China in 1997. Under U.S. law, Hong Kong receives special treatment in matters of trade, customs, sanctions enforcement, law enforcement cooperation and more.

83,Simon Shuster,"In their effort to discredit President Donald Trump’s perceived enemies, close allies of the President have received key documents and information from a Ukrainian oligarch wanted in the U.S. on corruption charges, according to five people directly involved in this effort and two other people familiar with it. The information came from the legal team of Dmitry Firtash, a wealthy industrialist with assets across Europe, who has spent the last five years in Vienna fighting extradition to the U.S. on bribery and racketeering charges. The U.S. Department of Justice said in 2017 he was among the “upper echelon associates of Russian organized crime”—something Firtash vigorously denies, along with all charges against him. As part of his legal defense, Firtash’s lawyers have gathered documents that make controversial allegations against former special counsel Robert Mueller and former Vice President Joe Biden. Firtash’s lawyers have passed these documents and other information to associates of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. In his frequent appearances on cable news, Giuliani has presented some of these documents to the American public as evidence for his claims of wrongdoing by Mueller and Biden. The key document is an affidavit from a former Ukrainian prosecutor who accuses Biden of corruption. “The witness I’m relying on,” Giuliani told Fox News on Oct. 6, was the prosecutor Viktor Shokin. “That’s the affidavit I put out,” Giuliani added. He did not mention that the affidavit was obtained by the Firtash legal team. At the beginning of the document, Shokin writes that he is making the statement “at the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash.” Asked about his ties to the Firtash legal team, Giuliani wrote in a text message to TIME on Tuesday: “I do not represent Mr. Firtash and I have never met him.” He did not reply to requests for further comment. Over the last two months, a TIME investigation has traced some of Giuliani’s claims about Biden and Mueller to a troubling relationship, one in which a foreigner wanted by the U.S. government on corruption charges has taken steps, as part of his own legal strategy, that are helping the American President attack his most prominent critics. This alignment of interests has taken shape at the same time, and with many of the same goals and actors, as the parallel effort by Trump and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden’s family. The effort in Ukraine was brought to light in September in a complaint from an intelligence-community whistleblower.

84,DAVID McHUGH / AP,"(FRANKFURT, Germany) — The sanctions the U.S. announced against Turkey this week over its offensive in Syria fall well short of doing serious damage to an economy still healing from a recession and currency collapse. President Donald Trump could take far tougher action that would deter foreign investment and credit that Turkey badly needs — but doing so could backfire in a number of ways, and it’s not clear he really wants to. Trump has said he could “destroy and obliterate” the economy of Turkey, and has called on the country to rein in its offensive in Syria. The statement follows backlash from both Democrats and Republicans over Trump’s decision to give Turkey a green light for its military incursion against Kurdish fighters who had been U.S. allies. The sanctions announced Monday, however, did not match the rhetoric and were seen as minimal by analysts and financial investors.

They block transactions involving any assets they may have in the U.S. financial system and bar U.S. residents and businesses from dealing with them. The U.S. also raised tariffs on Turkish steel exports from 25% back to 50%, where they were in May, and suspended talks over a U.S.-Turkey trade deal. Given the dominant role that U.S. financial institutions and the dollar play in world commerce, such measures fall far short of what the U.S. could do by targeting Turkey’s banks and their links to the global financial system. Turkey’s currency and stock market both rose Tuesday as investors breathed a sigh of relief that harsher measures were not imposed. Timothy Ash, emerging market strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, called the sanctions “minimal” and “window dressing,” noting that the trade deal was years off in any case.",Trump's 'Window Dressing' Sanctions Not Expected to Affect Turkish Economy,"October 15, 2019"
85,Jasmine Aguilera,"An American lawyer and acting attorney general for the Yap state of Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands west of the Philippines, was killed by a gunman Tuesday after returning home from a jog. Rachelle Bergeron was shot in the upper leg and upper torso outside of her home, according to the Associated Press. Her dog was also killed. Bergeron’s husband was at home when the shooting happened around 7 p.m. Police and friends arrived on the scene and rushed her to the the Yap Memorial Hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival, according to the AP. “Today marks a tragic day in our history. We are under the watchful eyes of the world,” said Yap Governor Henry Falan in a public statement. “Yap’s spirit is broken by this senseless and heinous act.” Falan said the shooting is under investigation. No one has yet been arrested as a suspect. One friend of Bergeron’s, Amos Collins, told the AP that he considers Yap a safe place and often leaves his car unlocked. Yap is one of four of the Federated States of Micronesia, Pacific islands located about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii. Bergeron moved to Yap in 2015, though originally from Wisconsin, to begin working there as the assistant attorney general. Her friends tell the AP that Bergeron had been planning to move back to the U.S. Another friend Julie Hartup, told the AP that Bergeron and her husband were close to celebrating their one-year wedding anniversary. The Federated States of Micronesia were once trustee territory of the U.S. until the states implemented their own constitution in 1979, entering into a compact of free association in which the U.S. provides financial support.

86,KIM TONG-HYUNG / AP,"(SEOUL, South Korea) — North Korea held South Korea to a 0-0 draw Tuesday in a World Cup qualifying soccer match played in an empty stadium in Pyongyang. Specific details of the game weren’t immediately available. South Korean soccer officials were unable to watch a telecast of the historic game at Kim Il Sung Stadium and South Korean spectators and media were denied entry. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was in Pyongyang and attended the match. “I was looking forward to seeing a full stadium for such a historic match but was disappointed to see there were no fans in the stands,” Infantino said in a statement. “We were surprised by this and by several issues related to its live broadcast and problems with visas and access for foreign journalists.” The North had been expected to have a unique home advantage in the 50,000-capacity stadium devoid of South Korean fans. But the South Korean soccer association, known as the KFA, was surprised to find out there apparently was no home crowd support, either. “Photos sent by our employees show not a single person in the stands,” KFA official Park Jae-sung said. “We are not sure why the North is doing this.” The KFA sent two staff members to the stadium to watch the game, but ruled out live text updates on its website because of uncertainties in internet connection. It recommended that fans watch the KFA’s social media accounts, where it posted game information its employees emailed from Pyongyang. North Korea has agreed to provide a recording of the match to South Korean officials before they leave the North, which would allow South Korean networks to play the game on tape delay, according to Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which deals with affairs with the North. The game was the first competitive meeting between the national men’s teams in the North Korean capital, although the North hosted the South in a friendly in 1990.","North Korea, South Korea Play Soccer World Cup Qualifier in Empty Pyongyang Stadium","October 15, 2019"
87,Sean Gregory,"Ever since Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey unwittingly sparked an international incident with his tweet in support of protestors in Hong Kong — which compelled China to pull NBA sponsorships and cancel broadcasts of last week’s exhibition games in the country between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers — fans and commentators have been awaiting a response from LeBron James. The NBA superstar hasn’t been shy about wading in political waters. He’s been a fierce critic of President Trump, a vocal supporter of payments for college athletes, and has spoken out on police violence and other issues. He also stars in an ESPN TV show called “More Than An Athlete.” While James was in China last week, the NBA cancelled media availabilities for the teams. “They have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real time,” the league said. So James could avoid answering uncomfortable questions on Chinese soil. But back in the U.S., just as China-NBA tensions were dissipating and fans’ attention was turning towards the Oct. 22 season tipoff, James spoke up. And his startling comments put China right back at the center of basketball. James said he believed Morey “either was misinformed or not really educated on the situation” and that “many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually.” Any reasonable observer could have interpreted James’ remarks as tacit support for the Chinese government, which reacted angrily to Morey’s pro-Hong Kong tweet, over Morey’s right of free expression. James later backtracked, saying on Twitter that he wasn’t talking about the “substance” of Morey’s tweet, but its impact. “I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet,” James said. He said Morey “could have waited a week” to send it, implying that he objected to Morey potentially putting players in harm’s way while they were in China. While James may have a point — when Morey sent the pro-Hong Kong tweet, he surely didn’t anticipate the backlash from the Chinese government — implying that speech should be regulated for the convenience of NBA stars playing exhibition games isn’t exactly endearing to the average American. Plus, the damage was already done. At a “Stand With Morey” rally in Hong Kong, a protestor held up a meme of James holding Chinese money. China is an enormous growth market for the NBA — the league, and all its players, profit handsomely from doing business there. Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter, who hails from Turkey and is embroiled in a feud with the Erdogan regime, fired off a series of pointed tweets. “Wow dude!”, he wrote, with the head slap. “SMH.” The barfing emoji.

88,MARTIN CRUTSINGER / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — The International Monetary Fund is further downgrading its outlook for the world economy, predicting that growth this year will be the weakest since the 2008 financial crisis primarily because of widening global conflicts. The IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook foresees a slight rebound in 2020 but warns of threats ranging from heightened political tensions in the Middle East to the threat that the United States and China will fail to prevent their trade war from escalating. The updated forecast released Tuesday was prepared for the fall meetings this week of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank. Those meetings and a gathering Friday of finance ministers and central bankers of the world’s 20 biggest economies are expected to be dominated by efforts to de-escalate trade wars. The new forecast predicts global growth of 3% this year, down 0.2 percentage point from its previous forecast in July and sharply below the 3.6% growth of 2018. For the United States this year, the IMF projects a modest 2.4% gain, down from 2.9% in 2018. Next year, the fund foresees a rebound for the world economy to 3.4% growth but a further slowdown in the United States to 2.1%, far below the 3% growth the Trump administration projects. IMF economists cautioned that that even its projected modest gains might not be realized. “With a synchronized slowdown and uncertain recovery, there is no room for policy mistakes, and an urgent need for policymakers to cooperatively de-escalate trade and geopolitical tensions,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, said in the report. Last week, the United States and China reached a temporary cease-fire in their trade fight when President Donald Trump agreed to suspend a tariff hike on $250 billion of Chinese products that was to take effect this week. But with no formal agreement reached and many issues yet to resolved, further talks will be needed to achieve any meaningful breakthrough. The Trump administration’s threat to raise tariffs on an additional $160 billion in Chinese imports on Dec. 15 remains in effect.","Global Economic Growth This Year Will Be Weakest Since 2008 Financial Crisis, International Monetary Fund Predicts","October 15, 2019"
89,Robert Burns / AP,"(WASHINGTON) –– A U.S. official says the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops being withdrawn from northern Syria will reposition in Iraq, Kuwait and possibly Jordan. The official spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive planning for a U.S. pullout amid heavy fighting between Turkish and Syrian Kurdish forces. The official says the American troops have pulled out of the Manbij area, where U.S. outposts were set up in 2017. Troops are consolidating their positions to prepare to fly out of the country soon. The official says U.S. troops based in Iraq could conduct cross-border operations against the Islamic State group in Syria as they did before creating the now-abandoned partnership with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The White House announced a week ago that U.S. forces in northeast Syria would move aside and clear the way for an expected Turkish assault, essentially abandoning the Kurds who fought alongside American forces against Islamic State militants.

90,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam is set to deliver a key policy address Wednesday as her government grapples with increasingly violent protests that may have entered a dangerous new phase after police say a homemade bomb exploded last weekend. Despite fears of disruptions, Lam is slated to give her speech at the city’s Legislative Council complex, which was recently restored after demonstrators laid siege to it in July. The annual speech marks the start of a new legislative year, and is expected to outline the administration’s response to issues of economic disparity and soaring housing costs—problems in part underlying the five months of unrest. During a press conference Tuesday, Lam said her remarks will primarily focus on land and housing policies. She is not expected to provide further concessions to the pro-democracy movement, which has spawned weekly skirmishes between police and protesters. As the crackdown intensifies, with police arresting more than 2,500 protesters, the black-clad demonstrators have fired back bricks, gasoline bombs and most recently, police say, an improvised explosive. The homemade bomb was concealed in a roadside bush about a mile away from a police vehicle and was detonated remotely by a mobile phone, Suryanto Chin-chiu, superintendent of the Hong Kong police’s Explosive Ordinance Disposal Bureau, said during a press conference Monday. The device was made with “high-performance explosives,” he added.  The impact of Sunday’s explosion was minimal with no injuries reported, but Suryanto said that the bomb-maker appeared to be familiar with chemicals and electrical devices, and “has the ability to make effective explosives.” “The tactics and explosives involved are similar to those used in terrorist attacks around the world,” he said, adding that “the use of explosives is an escalation of violence.” Tang Ping-keung, a deputy police commissioner, said there was reason to believe the device targeted police officers.",Hong Kong Legislature to Reopen as Police Say Bomb Detonated in Escalating Violence,"October 15, 2019"

92,SARAH EL DEEB and JOSEPH KRAUSS / AP,"(BEIRUT) — The Syrian fighters vowed to kill “pigs” and “infidels,” paraded their Kurdish captives in front of cameras and, in one graphic video, fired several rounds into a man lying on the side of a highway with his hands bound behind his back. They are part of the self-styled Syrian National Army, the shock troops in Turkey’s offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces who were abandoned last week after President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria. The Syrian fighters, trained and funded by Turkey, present themselves as heirs to the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad. But while they include some Islamic extremists and past members of some Syrian rebel factions, many are Arab and Turkmen fighters from northern and eastern Syria who have an ax to grind against the Kurds and a reputation for violence and looting. “The main problem with these forces is their criminality,” said Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute who has interviewed dozens of the fighters and said they appear to be driven by a desire for power and money rather than by any specific ideology. “Hatred of Kurds, a sense of Arab chauvinism, complete intolerance for any dissent, and just a desire to make a profit is what’s driving most of the abuses,” she said. Since Turkey began funding the force in 2016, its fighters have yet to battle Assad’s troops. Instead, they have mostly fought in Turkey’s cross-border offensives against the Islamic State group and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led militia that had partnered with the United States and battled IS extremists with far greater success. In the latest offensive, the Turkish-led Syrian forces have pushed deep into northeastern Syria, an ethnically and religiously mixed region, raising fears of ethnic conflict and human rights abuses. Some of the factions allied with Turkey have been accused of banditry, and others include hard-line Islamic militants in their ranks.",Money and Hatred for the Kurds Drives Turkey's Syrian Fighters,"October 15, 2019"
93,MARK STEVENSON / AP,"(MORELIA, Mexico) — State police expected the worst when they ventured into the wild township of Aguililla to serve a single warrant. Commanders sent 42 officers in five trucks. It wasn’t enough. More than 30 suspected drug cartel gunmen were waiting for them Monday, some in vehicles that were apparently armored, prosecutors in Mexico’s western state of Michoacan said. Officials said the gunmen opened up on the police convoy with .50 caliber sniper rifles and AR-15 and AK-47 assault rifles. Thirteen officers were killed, some of their bodies still inside the patrol trucks when the vehicles were set afire. Nine other officers were wounded. The attack — the worst on Mexican law enforcement in years — came in a state where violence blamed on drug gangs has jumped in recent months. Authorities said the state police convoy was ambushed as it sought to enforce a judicial order at a home in El Aguaje, a town in the municipality of Aguililla, which is the reputed birthplace of Nemesio “Mencho” Oseguera, leader of the hyper-violent Jalisco New Generation cartel. “No attack on the police will go unpunished, and this was a cowardly, devious attack because they laid an ambush in this area of the road,” Gov. Silvano Aureoles said. Images published in Mexican media showed vehicles burning in the middle of a highway and messages apparently signed by Jalisco New Generation, one of Mexico’s most powerful and rising cartels.

94,Joseph Hincks / Gaziantep,"Turkey’s ongoing incursion into northeast Syria, which began Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced the surprise withdrawal of U.S. troops from the northern border area, has already become a humanitarian crisis. The fighting has forced more than 130,000 people to flee their homes, according to the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, who in a statement on Sunday estimated that up to 400,000 civilians in the Syrian conflict zone may require aid and protection in the coming period, Reuters reports. A human rights monitor has claimed Turkey-backed proxy forces summarily executed nine civilians, including a female Kurdish politician. Turkey claims its objective is to sweep the Kurdish militia group leading the formerly U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) —which it regards as indistinguishable from the militant Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK)—from its southern border. But U.S. lawmakers have accused Trump of leaving America’s Kurdish allies to the “slaughter.”  Trump has denied greenlighting any operation and has threatened Ankara with “very powerful” sanctions. U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CBS’ Face the Nation program on Sunday that Turkey “appears to be” committing war crimes, adding that all American troops would withdraw from northern Syria because of the danger of getting caught in crossfire. On Friday evening, TIME met with U.N. Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock in Gaziantep, near Turkey’s southwestern border with Syria where he had been inspecting a cross border aid operation. In an interview edited for length and clarity, Lowcock discussed how the new front in Syria’s complex war is exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation, and urged Turkey to “live up to assurances” made to the U.N. to protect civilians in harm’s way. Mark Lowcock: Our assessment, which I have corroborated with the Turks, is that there are about 800,000 people in the 32-km zone along the border. Those that are moving are mostly moving from the towns in the middle of the zone, and they are mostly moving south. They are largely going to friends and family, in many cases to Hasekah [in Syria’s far northeast] and some other towns. We had already developed contingency plans to, for example, provide food for up to 650,000 people for a month or two. We’ve been operating across the northeast for quite a while and we are used to situations evolving. We’ve listened to what Turkey has said about its intent. We’ve called for restraint and de-escalation and for people to recognize Syria’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, for people to comply with international humanitarian law. I have assurances from the Turkish authorities on their intention, in their words, to give maximum importance to the protection of civilians and humanitarian concerns. So, it’s up to them to live up to those assurances.",The Turkish Invasion of Syria Shows the U.N. Is Struggling to Keep Up With Humanitarian Crises,"October 14, 2019"

96,Associated Press,"AKCAKALE, Turkey — Syrian government troops moved into a series of towns and villages in northern Syria Monday, setting up a potential clash with Turkish-led forces in the area, as U.S. troops prepared to pull out. The Syrian army’s deployment near the Turkish border came hours after Syrian Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. said they had reached a deal with President Bashar Assad’s government to help fend off Turkey’s invasion, now in its sixth day. The announcement of a deal between Syria’s Kurds and its government is a major shift in alliances that came after President Donald Trump ordered all U.S. troops withdrawn from the northern border area amid the rapidly spreading chaos. The shift sets up a potential clash between Turkey and Syria and raises the specter of a resurgent Islamic State group as the U.S. relinquishes any remaining influence in northern Syria to Assad and his chief backer, Russia. The fighting also seems likely to endanger, if not altogether crush, the brief experiment in self-rule set up by Syria’s Kurds since the war began. “We are going back to our normal positions that are at the border,” said a Syrian officer said, as embattled Kurdish authorities invited the government to retake towns and villages in the north.

97,Aritz Parra and Ciaran Giles / AP,"(MADRID) — Spain’s Supreme Court on Monday convicted 12 former Catalan politicians and activists for their roles in a secession bid in 2017, a ruling likely to inflame independence supporters in the wealthy northeastern region. The court sentenced ex-Catalan regional Vice President Oriol Junqueras to 13 years for sedition and misuse of public funds following one of Spain’s most important trials since democracy was restored after the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975. Eight received lengthy prison terms in Catalonia’s attempt to break away from Spain following an illegal independence referendum, while three received lesser sentences. Although prosecutors had requested convictions for the more severe crime of rebellion, which under Spanish law implies the use of violence to subvert the constitutional order, judges convicted nine of sedition, implying that they promoted public disorder to subvert the law. Regional Parliament Speaker Carme Forcadell was given 11 and a half years in prison; former Cabinet members Joaquim Forn and Josep Rull 10 and a half years each; and grassroots pro-independence activists Jordi Sánchez and Jordi Cuixart nine years. Junqueras and three other former Cabinet members — Raül Romeva, Jordi Turull and Dolors Bassa, who were sentenced to 12 years — were also convicted for misuse of public funds. Three other former members of the Catalan Cabinet — Santiago Vila, Meritxell Borràs y Carles Mundó — were fined for disobedience. Grassroots pro-secession groups have said that if any of the defendants were found guilty they would organize protests and “peaceful civil disobedience.” Spanish authorities deployed hundreds of extra police to the region in anticipation of the ruling.",Spain's Supreme Court Convicts Catalan Leaders for a 2017 Secession Attempt,"October 14, 2019"

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a parliamentary session that the number of deaths tied to Typhoon Hagibis had climbed to 53 and was expected to rise, as at least another nine people are presumed dead. Kyodo News agency, citing its own tally, put the death toll at 69. Abe pledged to do the utmost for the safety and rescue of those missing or those who had to evacuate. “We put the people’s lives first,” he said. Hagibis hit Japan’s main island on Saturday with strong winds and historic rainfall that caused more than 200 rivers to overflow, leaving thousands of homes flooded, damaged or without power. Rescue crews on Tuesday were still searching for those missing, thought to number about 20. Some 34,000 homes were without power and 110,000 lacked running water. More than 30,000 people were still at shelters as of late Monday, according to the Cabinet Office’s latest tally. Business appeared nearly back to normal in central Tokyo, and residents in areas where floodwater subsided started cleaning up.

99,Vanessa Gera and Monika Scislowska / AP,"(WARSAW, Poland) — Poland’s conservative governing Law and Justice party won the most votes in Sunday’s election in the deeply divided nation and appeared, according to an exit poll, to have secured a comfortable majority in parliament to govern for four more years. The exit poll, conducted by the research firm Ipsos, projected that Law and Justice won 43.6% of the votes. That would translate into 239 seats, a majority in the 460-seat lower house of parliament. The poll said a centrist pro-European Union umbrella group, Civic Coalition, would come in second with 27.4%. The biggest party in the coalition is Civic Platform, which governed Poland in 2007-2015. Coalition leaders cheered and welcomed the result as a spur toward uniting society around common goals. Other parties projected to surpass the 5% threshold to get into parliament were a left-wing alliance with 11.9%, the conservative agrarian Polish People’s Party with 9.6% and a new far-right alliance called Confederation with 6.4%. The exit poll had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. Final vote results, which are expected by Tuesday, could shift, as they have in past elections. A prominent journalist, Konrad Piasecki, said that “at the moment it looks like the largest triumph in the history of parliamentary elections” in Poland. But he also cautioned that results varying even slightly from the exit poll could mean big changes to the distribution of seats in parliament. Law and Justice has governed Poland since 2015 and is popular for its social conservatism and generous social spending.

100,Lefteris Pitarakis and Sarah El Deeb / AP,"(AKCAKALE, Turkey) — Syria’s Kurds said Syrian government forces agreed Sunday to help them fend off Turkey’s invasion — a major shift in alliances that came after President Donald Trump ordered all U.S. troops withdrawn from the northern border area amid the rapidly deepening chaos. The shift could lead to clashes between Turkey and Syria and raises the specter of a resurgent Islamic State group as the U.S. relinquishes any remaining influence in northern Syria to President Bashar Assad and his chief backer, Russia. Adding to the turmoil Sunday, hundreds of Islamic State families and supporters escaped from a holding camp in Syria amid the fighting between Turkish forces and the Kurds. The fast-deteriorating situation was set in motion last week, when Trump ordered U.S. troops in northern Syria to step aside, clearing the way for an attack by Turkey, which regards the Kurds as terrorists. Since 2014, the Kurds have fought alongside the U.S. in defeating the Islamic State in Syria, and Trump’s move was decried at home and abroad as a betrayal of an ally. Over the past five days, Turkish troops and their allies have pushed their way into northern towns and villages, clashing with the Kurdish fighters over a stretch of 200 kilometers (125 miles). The offensive has displaced at least 130,000 people. On Sunday, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said all American troops will withdraw from northern Syria because of the increasing danger of getting caught in the crossfire. “We have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies, and it’s a very untenable situation,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” He did not say how many would withdraw or where they would go but that they represent most of the 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria. The peril to American forces was illustrated on Friday, when a small number of U.S. troops came under Turkish artillery fire at an observation post in the north. No Americans were hurt. Esper said it was unclear whether that was an accident.",Syria's Kurds Look to Assad for Protection From Turkey's Invasion after the U.S. Withdraws Troops,"October 14, 2019"
101,MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN and GONZALO SOLANO / AP,"(QUITO, Ecuador) — Residents of Ecuador’s capital ventured out into the streets Sunday despite a 24-hour military curfew, picking their way through piles of burnt tires, chunks of pavement and tree trunks smoldering after a day of violent protests across Quito. The government and indigenous protesters planned to begin negotiations aimed at defusing more than a week of demonstrations against a plan to remove fuel subsidies as part of an International Monetary Fund austerity package. The protests have paralyzed Ecuador’s economy and cut off more than half of the country’s production of oil, Ecuador’s most important export. The United Nations and Ecuadorian Bishops’ Conference said negotiations would begin at 3 p.m. local time (4 p.m. EDT) between President Lenín Moreno’s government and the Confederation of Indigenous Nations, which has brought thousands of indigenous protesters to the capital and organized protests across the country, from the Andes high sierra to the Amazon rainforest. “We trust in the will of everyone to establish a dialogue in good faith and find a quick solution to the complex situation the country is living,” the U.N.’s Ecuador office said in a statement. However, the protests have drawn in thousands of Ecuadorians from outside the indigenous minority and many said they would continue demonstrating despite the negotiations. On Sunday afternoon, hundreds of people defied the curfew and headed toward the main protest site, some carrying wooden poles.

102,ROBERT BURNS / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — Amid growing chaos in Syria, President Donald Trump has ordered all U.S. troops to withdraw from the country’s north to avoid a bloody conflict between Turkey and U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters that “gets worse by the hour,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday. Esper, who spoke in two TV interviews, did not say the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria are leaving the country entirely. Trump’s national security team planned to meet later Sunday to assess the situation, Esper said, as U.S. officials continue to urge Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to halt his incursion. Asked whether he thought Turkey, a NATO ally, would deliberately attack American troops in Syria, Esper said, “I don’t know whether they would or wouldn’t.” He cited an incident on Friday in which a small number of U.S. troops fell under artillery fire at an observation post in the north. Esper called that an example of “indiscriminate fire” coming close to Americans, adding it was unclear whether that was an accident. Esper said he spoke to Trump on Saturday night amid growing signs that the Turkish invasion, which began Wednesday, was growing more dangerous. “In the last 24 hours, we learned that they (the Turks) likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned — and to the west,” Esper said. The U.S. also has come to believe that the Kurds are attempting to “cut a deal” with the Syrian army and Russia to counter the invading Turks, he said. As a result, Trump “directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria,” Esper said. Trump, in a tweet Sunday, said: “Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?”","Trump Orders All U.S. Troops to Leave Northern Syria, Defense Secretary Says","October 13, 2019"
103,Associated Press,"(LONDON) — British media are reporting that the wife of an American official who left the U.K. after being involved in a fatal road accident no longer has diplomatic immunity. BBC and Sky News said Sunday that U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had told the family of Harry Dunn that “immunity is no longer pertinent” because the suspect has left the U.K. The Foreign Office declined to comment. Dunn, 19, was killed in August when his motorcycle collided with a car outside a British air force base in southern England used by the U.S. military. The alleged car driver, Anne Sacoolas, who is married to a U.S. official, subsequently left Britain.

104,JOHN LEICESTER / AP,"(HONG KONG) — Tearing a page out of ancient Chinese military philosophy, black-clad protesters in Hong Kong changed tactics and wreaked havoc by popping up in small groups in multiple locations across the city Sunday, pursued by but also often eluding police who made scores of muscular arrests. Violence spiraled as protests stretched from Sunday afternoon into the night, with police struggling to restore order. A savage beating after dark by a group of masked protesters left a man bleeding profusely. Police said an officer was attacked from behind with a sharp weapon earlier in the day and was left with a bleeding neck wound. Video broadcast on Hong Kong television also showed a masked, black-clad protester dropping a riot officer with a flying high kick, followed by two other protesters who beat the officer on the ground and tried unsuccessfully to snatch his gun. The guerrilla-like tactics sought to maximize the disruption and visibility of protests at a time when anti-government demonstrations have, as a whole, been showing signs of flagging as they stretch into a fifth month. Pressure from a government ban on the face masks worn by many protesters and extreme violence earlier this month appear to have cooled the ardor of some demonstrators and whittled down protest numbers. Online calls for gatherings to start at 2 p.m. in dozens of malls, parks, sports grounds and other locations triggered an afternoon of mayhem and marked a shift from earlier more concentrated rallies in fewer spots. “We’re going to be more fluid and flexible,” said Amanda Sin, 23, an office worker who joined a peaceful protest outside police headquarters in central Hong Kong. “We are interchanging different tactics.” Roaming clumps of hardcore protesters — too numerous, elusive and fast-moving to be policed — popped up out of nowhere, vandalizing stores, blocking traffic with makeshift barricades and spraying protest graffiti, often holding up umbrellas to shield their activities from view.",Hong Kong Protesters Shift Tactics as Demonstrations Stretch Into Fifth Month,"October 13, 2019"
105,LEFTERIS PITARAKIS and SARAH EL DEEB / AP,"(AKCAKALE, Turkey) — Syrian government troops will deploy along the border with Turkey to help Kurdish fighters fend off Turkey’s invasion of northern Syria, the Kurds said Sunday, hours after President Donald Trump ordered all U.S. troops to withdraw from the area to avoid getting caught in the middle of the fast-escalating conflict. The announcement represents a major shift in alliances for Syria’s Kurds after they were abandoned by the U.S., with whom they were longtime partners in the fight against the Islamic State group. Adding to the turmoil, hundreds of Islamic State families and supporters escaped from a holding camp in northern Syria amid heavy clashes between Turkish forces and the Kurds. The dizzying developments reflected the rapidly growing chaos that has unfolded in the week since Trump ordered U.S. forces in the region to step aside, clearing the way for the Turkish attack on the Kurdish fighters it considers terrorists. Trump’s decision has been broadly condemned at home and abroad by critics who accuse him of betraying the Kurds, who long fought alongside the U.S. to help defeat the Islamic State group in Syria. U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said all American troops will withdraw from northern Syria because of the increasing danger posed by the fighting. “We have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies, and it’s a very untenable situation,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” He did not say how many would withdraw or where they would go but that they represent most of the 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria. The peril to American forces was illustrated on Friday, when a small number of U.S. troops came under Turkish artillery fire at an observation post in the north. No Americans were hurt.

106,ROSHAN SEDHAI / AP,"(KATHMANDU, Nepal) — Xi Jinping on Saturday became the first Chinese president in more than two decades to visit Nepal, where he is expected to sign agreements on several infrastructure projects. Xi arrived Saturday from New Delhi, where he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Nepal is expected to tread cautiously while building relations with big neighbors India and China. India has extensive influence on Nepal’s economy and politics, while China and Nepal share a border covered with high mountain peaks. Jiang Zemin had been the last Chinese president to visit Nepal, making the trip in 1996, but other Chinese leaders — including premiers and foreign ministers — have since paid official visits to the Himalayan nation. Tanka Prasad Karki, a former Nepalese diplomat, said that a Chinese president had not visited Nepal in such a long time because “China was waiting for a strong government in Kathmandu, as the last few decades were marked by a Maoist war, frequent changes of government and political instability.” Xi was received by Nepalese President Bidhya Devi Bhandari and Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli at the Kathmandu airport. Trans-Himalayan connectivity and an extradition treaty will be high on the agenda during official talks on Sunday, said Narayan Kaji Shreshta, a spokesman for the ruling Nepal Communist Party. He said the countries are also expected to sign a project report on constructing a rail link between Kathmandu and Keirung in Tibet. Nepalese officials ruled out the possibility of any immediate agreement on the extradition issue. China has been pressing Nepal to sign the treaty for some years to improve administration of border areas and fight against illegal border crossing and transnational crimes like banking fraud, trafficking and the smuggling of gold and wildlife parts, Nepalese officials said.",Xi Jinping Becomes First Chinese President in 2 Decades to Visit Nepal,"October 12, 2019"

108,MEHMET GUZEL / AP,"(CEYLANPINAR, Turkey) — Turkey’s military said it captured a key Syrian border town under heavy bombardment Saturday as its offensive against Kurdish fighters pressed into its fourth day with little sign of relenting despite mounting international criticism. Turkish troops entered central Ras al-Ayn according to Turkey’s Defense Ministry and a war monitor group, marking the most significant gain since the invasion began Wednesday. The ministry tweeted: “Ras al-Ayn’s residential center has been taken under control through the successful operations in the east of Euphrates” river. Turkey’s continued push into Syria comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump cleared the way for Turkey’s air and ground offensive, pulling back U.S. forces from the area and saying he wanted to stop getting involved with “endless wars.” Trump’s decision drew swift bipartisan criticism that he was endangering regional stability and risking the lives of Syrian Kurdish allies who brought down the Islamic State group in Syria. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces was the main U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State group and lost 11,000 fighters in the nearly five-year battle against the extremists. An Associated Press journalist across the border in Turkey heard the sound of sporadic clashes as Turkish howitzers struck the town and Turkish jets screeched overhead. Syrian Kurdish forces appeared to be holding out in some areas of the town. The Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces released two videos said to be from inside Ras al-Ayn, showing fighters saying that it is Saturday and they are still there. The fighting was ongoing as the Kurdish fighters sought to reverse the Turkish advance into Ras Al-Ayn, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

109,Julia Leite / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — More than a month since oil started washing up on some of Brazil’s most touristic beaches, dotting sand with black patches, killing sea turtles and scaring off fishermen, the origin of the crude is still a mystery. “We don’t know the oil’s origin, where it came from or how it got here,” Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said at an offshore exploration auction in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday. The crude probably leaked from a ship in the ocean, he ventured, adding that it has characteristics similar to Venezuelan heavy crude — which doesn’t mean it comes from there. Venezuela’s state oil company categorically denied having anything to do with the slick, saying there were no reports of incidents at its facilities or from clients, nor evidence of leaks that could have led to damages in Brazil. The massive spill has already spread along the coasts of all nine states in Brazil’s northeast. Over a dozen sea turtles have been found dead, covered in crude, local newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported. Some 800 baby turtles that hatched were kept from going into the sea, the newspaper said, citing Projeto Tamar, one of Brazil’s best-known wildlife conservation projects. The nation’s environmental agency said the oil found on the beaches was not produced by Brazil, and that the country’s Navy and federal police are investigating the spill. On Wednesday, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said the oil likely originated from Venezuela, citing a report from state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA about the characteristics of the crude. Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco said Tuesday that the spill could have come from an oil tanker that sank, an accident when loading oil from one tanker to another, or from a criminal act. President Jair Bolsonaro has said for days that the oil spill was probably criminal, without elaborating further. Contact us at editors@time.com.",Oil Is Killing Brazil’s Turtles.

110,Associated Press,"(TOKYO) — A man arrested on suspicion of stalking a female pop idol used the reflections of her pupils in photos she shared on social media and Google Street View to find where she lived. Tokyo police declined comment on the specifics of the investigation but confirmed Friday that 26-year-old Hibiki Sato was arrested Sept. 17 on suspicion of indecent behavior in connection with stalking and causing injuries to the 20-year-old woman. The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as is often policy at Japanese bureaucracies, said the case was related to the reports about a stalker and pupil images. Police described Sato as an “avid fan.” Public broadcaster NHK and other Japanese media reported this week that details in the woman’s selfies were used to identify the train station she frequented. They said Sato looked at other images she shared, such as her apartment, to figure out where she lived. Police say he hurt her and committed indecent acts, such as groping her after accosting her from behind and knocking her down. Japan has many young female performance groups. Tokyo Shimbun, which reported on the stalking case, warned readers even casual selfies may show surrounding buildings that will allow people to identify the location of the photos. It also said people shouldn’t make the V-sign with their hand, which Japanese often do in photos, because fingerprints could be stolen. Cyberstalking has been a problem for years, with criminals and perpetrators of domestic violence using hacking, clandestine activation of microphones and cameras and other methods to track their victims.","Police in Japan Arrest Pop Star's Stalker After He Analyzed Her Selfies, Used Reflections in Her Eyes to Find Her Address","October 11, 2019"
111,PAUL WISEMAN and KEVIN FREKING / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — The Trump administration is suspending a tariff hike on $250 billion in Chinese imports that was set to take effect Tuesday, and China agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products as the world’s two biggest economies reached a cease-fire in their 15-month trade war. The White House said the two sides made some progress on the thornier issues, including China’s lax protection of foreign intellectual property. But more work will have to be made on key differences in later negotiations, including U.S. allegations that China forces foreign countries to hand over trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market. The U.S. and Chinese negotiators have so far reached their tentative agreement only in principle. No documents have been signed. President Donald Trump announced the trade truce in a White House meeting with the top Chinese negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He. The news followed two days of talks in Washington. “You’re very tough negotiators,” Trump said to the Chinese delegation. Trump has yet to drop plans to impose tariffs Dec. 15 on an additional $160 billion in Chinese products, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States. The December tariffs would cover a wide range of consumer goods, including clothes, toys and smartphones and would likely be felt by American shoppers.

112,Ian Bremmer,"Earlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would pull back from the border the few U.S. troops along the border in northeast Syria, clearing the way for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to launch his offensive against Kurdish forces in the area. According to reports, Trump did not consult either the State or Defense Departments before taking the decision. Kurdish fighters have been the strongest U.S. ally taking on ISIS in Syria, but Ankara considers them to be in league with Kurdish groups operating within Turkey. The Turks have been trying to get the U.S. to leave northeast Syria (which borders Turkey) for months; they finally succeeded this week, and wasted little time launching their offensive. Why It Matters: When it comes to Syria, it is always useful to explain who is fighting whom, and for what reason. To wit, here is a (very much) simplified state of play of what’s going on in Syria in October 2019. Syrian strongman Bashar Assad has won Syria’s civil war, as his forces have recaptured much of Syria’s land. He’s now back in Damascus—a feat only accomplished with the backing of Russia and Iran—both of whom are looking to use Syria to expand their influence in the region. Turkey is no fan of Assad by any means, but their biggest enemy in Syria’s civil war are the Kurds, whom Turkey is worried will use the territory they’ve captured to establish an independent Kurdish state, which has long been the dream of the region’s 25 to 35 million Kurds, roughly 15 million of whom reside in Turkey. The U.S. (along with a broader coalition of Western countries) got involved in Syria under Barack Obama to fight back against ISIS—whose “caliphate” stretched across territory in both Iraq and Syria—but was always wary about putting too many boots on the ground, forcing it to work with whoever was most aligned with that mission while also not being a brutal dictator (Assad) or perennial enemy of the US (Russia/Iran). That happened to be Kurdish rebel forces. Today, ISIS has lost virtually all the land it controlled at the height of its power. But that doesn’t mean it’s been 100% defeated, though Trump maintains that it has. Nearly 10,000 ISIS fighters from Iraq and Syria are being detained in Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) jails, and as many as 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters. Trump feels that now that ISIS is no longer an immediate threat, he can begin to remove U.S. troops from the country and make good on one of his central campaign promises to bring U.S. troops home. But that also means allowing Turkey to come in and launch an offensive against a group of people that up until last week were US allies. It’s a controversial move—when Trump tried to remove U.S. troops from Syria last year, it prompted the resignation of US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. But Trump is now desperate for political wins as impeachment hearings bare down. The backlash in the U.S. has been swift, and uncharacteristically bipartisan. There are three main concerns that both Democrats and Republicans share over the move. The first is the precedent this sets for how America treats its allies; if this is how the Kurds are rewarded for being loyal partners to the US, who would willingly sign up to work with the Americans going forward? The second, and most immediate, concern is what happens to those ISIS fighters being kept in Kurdish-controlled jails—as more Kurds will be needed to fight over the Turkish offensive, the worry is that those jailed-ISIS fighters will have an easier time escaping, and potentially resuscitating an ISIS network that was gasping its last breaths. Third, is that the removal of US troops in Northeast Syria will eventually give way to the removal of the rest of US troops from the country (roughly 1,000 of whom are left), allowing Russia or Iran more influence, and ultimately resulting in a US. with less clout in the Middle East and more enemies.",What Happens Next in Syria After Turkey's Invasion,"October 11, 2019"
113,Sarah El Deeb / AP,"(BEIRUT)–– Syrian Kurdish officials say Turkish shelling has hit a prison holding Islamic State militants in northeastern Syria. A video shared by the officials Friday shows a shell landing in the courtyard of what appears to be a prison facility in the city of Qamishli. Seconds later, a handful of men open doors and seem to be trying to leave. An official with the mostly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces says some of the men in the video are security guards seeking to contain the escape and regain control of the prisoners. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to brief the media. It was not possible to verify the attempted escape. But chaos and the ongoing assault have raised fears that the Turkish offensive on Kurdish-held northeastern Syria may undermine the security of over two dozen facilities where 10,000 IS militants are held. There are 2,000 foreigners among them.

114,Christopher R. Hill,"With the shakedown in Ukraine and betrayal of the Kurds in Northern Syrian, another foreign policy failure this past week almost went by without notice: the complete breakdown of talks between U.S. and North Korean diplomats on North Korea’s denuclearization. The U.S. and the North Koreans have engaged in a negotiation of sorts since the spring of 2018 when President Trump accepted a proposal by Kim Jong Un to meet face to face. Trump’s willingness to meet was hailed in Northeast Asia as a courageous gesture to resolve the longstanding impasse over North Korea’s nuclear program. At the time, both South Korean president Moon Jae-In and Japanese Prime Minister Abe, in a rare display of agreement on anything, suggested that Trump was deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize for his courage in doing what no other sitting US president has been willing to do. Three summits later which have included presidential trips to Singapore, Hanoi, and even a presidential walk across the demilitarized zone into North Korea itself, there is little indication that any progress whatsoever has been achieved in persuading the North Koreans that they can have a better future without nuclear weapons. At first, Trump’s approach was to engage in a grand bargain, a willingness to embrace the North Korean leader by lifting all sanctions against that country in return for complete denuclearization. Those grand thoughts have given way to a more incremental and much more familiar process of going step by step. But even that has yielded little in the way of concrete actions primarily because the North Koreans have essentially refused to meet any U.S. negotiator unless that negotiator is named Donald Trump. Despite the notable lack of progress, President Trump has continued to make North Korea his signature foreign policy triumph, even suggesting he would have won the Nobel Peace Prize if the process had not been so – you guessed it – rigged. On the positive side of the ledger, North Korea has indeed restrained from nuclear tests, and tests of long-range missiles. North Korea also released some US prisoners, hostages as Trump not entirely inaccurately described them, and agreed to restart the search for the remains of U.S. service members killed during the Korean war, a program halted by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in 2006 out of concern that too many fees were being paid to the North Koreans. But on the crucial issue of ending their nuclear weapons program the North Koreans have been unwilling to discuss the matter or even to meet with US negotiators until last week. On October 1, in the context of demanding new offers from the U.S. and threatening they may give up on the effort, North Korea announced that working level talks with the US would soon resume. As if to celebrate their announcement, the North Koreans followed up hours later with more tests of its newest generation shorter range, solid fuel missiles. It was a gross violation of UN Security Council resolutions, and an ominous one because this new generation of weapons appear to be intended for a new submarine force capable of firing off missiles at a moment’s notice. It gives U.S. military planners an entirely new and dangerous threat. President Trump and his ever faithful bulldog Secretary of State Pompeo (seemingly unperturbed by the various North Korean insults launched his way) have both downplayed the significance of the tests. The two “working level” negotiating parties gathered on the outskirts of Stockholm at a remote conference center to explore some “new ideas.” It wasn’t pretty. After a few hours of discussions, the North Koreans abruptly announced they had had enough, and walked out, claiming the US had failed to follow through on anything new. They described themselves as very disappointed. While the North Koreans, with their customary charm called the talks nothing short of “sickening” and “nauseating,” the State Department spokesperson, Morgan Ortagus, took a somewhat more philosophical view, explaining to no one in particular that the two sides will not overcome 70 years of war and hostility in one day. The U.S. side suggested they gather in two weeks for another day of sharing new ideas, but the North Korean chief negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, brushed aside that suggestion and headed home.",President Trump's Ongoing Failure With North Korea Talks,"October 11, 2019"
115,COLLEEN BARRY / AP,"(MILAN) — U.S. consumers who appreciate the tang of aged Italian Parmesan cheese as an aperitif or atop their favorite pasta dish are stocking up ahead of next week’s tariff hike and as dairy producers in the two countries square off. The Italian agricultural lobby Coldiretti said Friday that sales of both Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano, aged cheeses with a distinctive granular quality that are defined by their territory of origin, have skyrocketed in the United States by 220% since the higher tariffs were announced one week ago. The new tariffs — up from $2.15 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) to around $6 a kilogram — take effect on Oct. 18. Parmesan cheese is on a long list of EU products targeted by the Trump administration for retaliatory tariffs approved by the World Trade Organization for illegal EU subsidies to aviation giant Airbus. Coldiretti says American consumers as a result will pay over $45 a kilogram, instead of $40 — which is expected to hurt sales in the U.S., the second-largest export market after France. Nicola Bertinelli, president of the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese consortium, says the tariffs threaten the economic health of 330 small dairy producers in the area around Parma and the 50,000 people who work in the production supply chain. “I believe that … Europe has understood that this is a commercial attack,” Bertinelli told The Associated Press this week. The consortium produces 3.7 million Parmesan wheels a year, each weighing an average of 40 kilograms (88 pounds) and aged from more than 18 months to over 30 months. Parmigiano Reggiano is produced in a defined territory from the Apennine mountains to the Po River from the milk of 250,000 cows raised in the same territory to earn its “protected designation origin,” a labor give to specialty foods from a specific geographic region.",U.S. Sales of Italian Cheese Rise by 220% As Consumers Stock Up Ahead of Tariff Hike,"October 11, 2019"

117,ROBERT BURNS and LOLITA C. BALDOR / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — An “impulsive” decision by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to invade northern Syria will further destabilize a region already caught up in civil war and puts America’s Syrian Kurdish partners “in harm’s way,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Friday. Washington is “greatly disappointed” by the Turkish incursion, Esper said at a Pentagon news conference, adding that the invasion has damaged relations with Turkey, a NATO ally. It also has raised the prospect of losing control of thousands of captured Islamic State fighters. Esper called on the Turks to halt their operation, but he told reporters that he has no indication they are willing to do so. “To be clear,” Esper said, “we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces, and U.S. troops remain with them in other parts of Syria. The impulsive action of President Erdogan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation.” Speaking alongside Esper, Gen. Mark Milley said the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish military known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, is still guarding the camps holding IS prisoners. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Turkish military operations across the border into Syria are “still relatively limited.” He also called on the Syrian Kurds to show restraint so that a diplomatic solution might emerge. The remarks were the Pentagon’s most explicit criticism of the Turkish operation, which began Wednesday as a campaign against the Syrian Kurd-led militia that has partnered with U.S. forces over the past five years to fight the Islamic State.

118,Aryn Baker,"Abiy Ahmed, the Ethiopian Prime Minister who engineered the end of a two-decade conflict with neighboring Eritrea, was named on Oct. 11 as the recipient of the 100th Nobel Peace Prize, for his efforts to “achieve peace and international cooperation.” Yet even though he had been one of the top bookie’s picks for the prize, it took a while for the news to trickle through to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. Bethlehem Tilahun Alemu, the founder of Sole Rebels, one of Ethiopia’s best recognized fashion exports, was busy in her factory when she heard the news via a telephone call. “Dr. Abiy? The Nobel Prize?” Her broad grin was practically audible. “This is just amazing news. We love him for what he did with Eritrea, and it’s great that he is being recognized for it. Without peace, you can’t grow.” The history of the Ethiopia-Eritrea war is dark and bloody. Over the course of 20 years, the two countries, brothers in culture and language, waged a vicious battle over land, politics and ideology. When war first broke out, in 1998, families that spanned both sides of the border found themselves split apart by violence. An estimated 80,000 died in the first two years of the conflict, cousins fighting cousins in what Eritrea called a war of independence. To the tribes that had historically occupied the border areas, it felt more like a civil war. A brief peace prevailed in 2000, only to collapse a few months later into a protracted, low level border conflict that consumed soldiers and massive amounts of wealth from both countries, draining national resources and depriving the citizenry of funds better spent on development. Reuniting families was all but impossible. “It was like a wall,” says Hagos, a 24-year-old cart driver from the border town of Zalambesa, who grew up on the Ethiopian side even though his father was Eritrean. It was Abiy who jumpstarted the peace process in June 2018, just three months after taking office. In a surprise move, he said he would hand a disputed border town over to Eritrea, in accordance with the terms of a long-neglected peace agreement from 2000. A few weeks later Abiy and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki declared an end to the war between the two countries. That same month, long dormant phone lines between the two nations were reconnected, and Ethiopians started calling random Eritrean numbers, just to say hello. Ethiopian Airlines resumed flights between Asmara, the Eritrean capital, and Addis Ababa. On a July 14 visit to Addis Ababa, Afwerki attended a state dinner, saying in a prepared speech: “Henceforth, anyone who says Eritreans and Ethiopians are two different peoples is one that doesn’t know the truth.” On Sept. 11, the border was reopened, allowing thousands to be reunited with their loved ones. Hagos’ father had died in the conflict, but when he was finally able to meet the uncles and cousins he had never known, he says, “I didn’t feel like an orphan anymore.” Alemu, whose mother was Eritrean, flew with her family to Asmara to meet cousins for the first time in 20 years. Peace between the two countries, while welcome, moves slowly. And domestically, Abiy’s tenure as prime minister has been rocked by eruptions of ethnic violence even as he pushes for national unity. “[His] hardest challenges lie ahead,” said William Davison, Crisis Group Senior Analyst for Ethiopia. Afwerki, meanwhile, still presides over one of the most repressive states in the world, accused of major human rights violations and charged with using military conscription as a cover for forced labor in Eritrea —one of many reasons, perhaps, that he was not invited to share the award with Abiy.",How Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed Won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize After Ending a War,"October 11, 2019"
119,Associated Press,"BRUSSELS — The European Union said Friday that talks with the U.K. to find an amicable divorce deal were back on track, despite huge challenges and a looming end-of-month deadline for Britain to leave the bloc. EU Council President Donald Tusk said he has “received promising signals” from Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar that a Brexit deal is still possible, so he has extended a deadline to continue the Brexit talks. Tusk, speaking in Nicosia, said “for the first time” Varadkar and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson saw a pathway toward a deal, adding that “even the slightest chance must be used” to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Immediately, the wheels of the negotiating machinery started churning again. Johnson’s Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, got a warm welcome from EU negotiator Michel Barnier before they started almost two hours of talks around breakfast. “If there is a will, there is, of course, a way. Otherwise people would not be working on this,” said EU Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva. Originally, Tusk said he was planning to pull the plug Friday on the Brexit talks, but because of the breakthrough he can now see talks going through the weekend, ahead of the EU’s two-day summit, which starts next Thursday. Tusk said “there is no guarantee of success and the time is practically up” but insisted both sides should use every opportunity available ahead of Britain’s scheduled Oct. 31 departure date. “A no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU,” Tusk said.",Brexit Talks Are Back On Track With Just Weeks Left Before a Critical Deadline,"October 11, 2019"
120,MARK LEWIS and ELIAS MESERET / AP,"(OSLO, Norway) — Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2019 in recognition of his efforts to end his country’s long-running border conflict with Eritrea. The Norwegian Nobel Institute on Friday also praised the “important reforms” that Abiy, Ethiopia’s leader since April 2018, has launched at home. Chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said some people may consider it too early to give him the prize, but “it is now that Abiy Ahmed’s efforts need recognition and deserve encouragement.” Abiy, 43, took office after widespread protests pressured the longtime ruling coalition and hurt one of the world’s fastest growing economies. Africa’s youngest leader quickly announced dramatic reforms and “Abiymania” began. In a move that caused surprise in the long-turbulent Horn of Africa region, he said Ethiopia would accept a peace agreement with Eritrea, ending one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts. Within weeks, Eritrea’s longtime leader, visibly moved, visited Addis Ababa and communications and transport links were restored. For the first time in two decades people could, long-divided families made tearful reunions. The improving relations led to the lifting of United Nations sanctions on Eritrea, one of the world’s most reclusive nations. But Ethiopia’s reforms appear not to have inspired any in Eritrea, which has since closed border posts with its neighbor. At home, Abiy offered one political surprise after another. He released tens of thousands of prisoners, welcomed home once-banned opposition groups and acknowledged past abuses. People expressed themselves freely on social media, and he announced that Ethiopia would hold free and fair elections in 2020. The country has one of the world’s few “gender-balanced” Cabinets and a female president, a rarity in Africa.",Nobel Peace Prize Awarded to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed,"Updated: October 11, 2019 5:44 AM ET"

The Rugby World Cup and other events were canceled for Saturday, and flights and train services halted. “In order to protect your own life and your loved ones, please try to start evacuating early before it gets dark and the storm becomes powerful,” Meteorological Agency forecast department chief Yasushi Kajihara told a news conference. Kajihara said Typhoon Hagibis resembled a typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958 with heavy rains and left a half-million houses flooded. More than 1,200 people died in that storm. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet is to hold a disaster management meeting later Friday. “The government is doing the utmost to prepare for the approaching typhoon,” disaster management minister Ryota Takeda told reporters, and urged people to prepare early and obtain food and water. Economy Minister Isshu Sugawara urged hospitals and other public facilities to check their backup power. Typhoon Hagibis was in the Pacific advancing north-northwestward toward Japan’s main island. Its winds were blowing 180 kilometers per hour (110 mph) with gusts to 250 kph (156 mph) at Friday, the weather agency said.

122,NASSER KARIMI and JON GAMBRELL / AP,"(TEHRAN, Iran) — Two missiles struck an Iranian tanker traveling through the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia on Friday, Iranian officials said, the latest incident in the region amid months of heightened tensions between Tehran and the U.S. There was no word from Saudi Arabia on the reported attack and Saudi officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Oil prices spiked by 2% on the news. “This latest incident, if confirmed to be an act of aggression is highly likely to be part of the wider narrative of deteriorating relations between Saudi and the U.S. and Iran,” private maritime security firm Dryad Maritime warned. “It is likely that the region, have being stable for the last month, will face another period of increasing maritime threats, as the Iranian and Saudi geopolitical stand-off continues,” it added. Iranian state television said the explosion damaged two storerooms aboard the oil tanker and caused an oil leak into the Red Sea near the Saudi port city of Jiddah. The leak was later stopped, IRNA reported. The state-run IRNA news agency, quoting Iran’s National Iranian Tanker Co., identified the stricken vessel as the Sabiti. It turned on its tracking devices late Friday morning in the Red Sea, putting its location some 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Jiddah, according to data from MarineTraffic.com. The ship is carrying some 1 million barrels of crude oil, according to an analysis from data firm Refinitiv. Images released by Iran’s Petroleum Ministry appeared to show no visible damage to the Sabiti visible from its bridge, though they did not show the ship’s sides. The ministry’s SHANA news agency said no ship nor any authority in the area responded to its distress messages. The Sabiti last turned on its tracking devices in August near the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas.

124,Madeleine Carlisle,"Ibrahim al-Asiri, a senior al-Qaeda bomb maker and terrorist coordinator, was killed two years ago in a United States operation in Yemen, the White House announced on Thursday. Al-Asiri had been in hiding in Yemen for years and was the repeated target of U.S. drone strikes. The U.S. mistakenly believed they had killed him in a 2011 strike. They later targeted a man they believed was al-Asiri in a May 2012 strike, but he turned out to be another al-Qaeda leader. As TIME wrote in 2013, the Obama administration believed al-Asiri was “the most dangerous terrorist in the world.” He was connected to the failed “underwear bomb” aboard a U.S.-bound flight on Christmas Day 2009, and allegedly built bombs that nearly detonated within two Chicago-bound international cargo planes in 2010. Al-Asiri also allegedly planned to blow up a U.S. airliner in 2012 around the anniversary of  al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden’s death, but was stopped when the member chosen for the suicide mission turned out to be a double agent for the U.S. Per the White House statement, Al-Asiri also built a device used in an assassination attempt of the former Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.  “Al-Asiri’s death significantly handicapped al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula,” the statement reads. “The United States will continue to hunt down terrorists like al-Asiri until they no longer pose a threat to our great Nation.” The reveal comes at a moment when the Trump administration faces pressure for their recent announcement to withdraw troops from Northern Syria, putting Kurdish forces — key U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS — at increased danger of attacks from Turkey. The Kurds, part of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, control facilities holding about 11,000 ISIS detainees. If the Kurds abandon the detention camps to fight the Turkish military, thousands of ISIS operatives could escape, U.S. officials worry. President Donald Trump has faced criticism from members of his own party in Congress for his decision to withdraw troops from Syria’s border with Turkey. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, usually a staunch defender of the President, called the move “a major blunder” that “cuts against sound military and geopolitical advice.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned that “a precipitous withdrawal” of troops would benefit Russia, Iran and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and increase the risk that the Islamic State would “regroup.” Write to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com.","Al-Qaeda Bomb Maker Once Dubbed 'World's Most Dangerous Terrorist' Was Killed 2 Years Ago, White House Says","October 10, 2019"
125,Associated Press,"(LONDON) — Protesters in New York City brought traffic to a standstill in the city’s busiest hub and an activist in London climbed atop a plane as climate change demonstrators entered the fourth day of rallies around the world. Protesters transported a green boat on a trailer into Times Square and then sat down and refused police orders to move. The boat bore the logo of the activist group Extinction Rebellion. It also had the words “Act Now” written on it and a string of brightly colored flags. Some of the demonstrators carried signs in the shape of orange rescue lifebuoys, with the words, “Save our Future.” The New York Police Department made dozens of civil disobedience arrests and removed the vessel some time later, which led to re-opened area streets and brought the traffic back to normal. In London, a climate change activist scaled a British Airways plane at London City Airport. Extinction Rebellion identified the activist as a former Paralympic cyclist. A video streamed by the group showed the activist clinging to the fuselage. British Airways says that customers were booked onto alternative flights to Amsterdam. In a separate incident, BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt tweeted that his flight from London to Dublin had been grounded after a protester stood up to deliver a lecture on climate change just as it was to take off.",Climate Activists Stop Traffic in New York's Times Square as Worldwide Rallies Stretch Into Fourth Day,"October 10, 2019"
126,Justin Worland,"Activists, politicians and economists are forever arguing over the best way to address climate change: carbon tax or Green New Deal; both or neither, or a mixture of elements from each. A new International Monetary Fund (IMF) report released Thursday cuts through that noise: any aggressive policy, it says, is better than nothing at all. “We definitely want action to be taken,” says Paolo Mauro, deputy director of fiscal affairs at the IMF, who oversaw the report. “We’re not religious about any particular type of measure.” The new report comes as a range of different climate policies are under consideration in the U.S. Proposals for a Green New Deal — an ambitious spending program aimed at eliminating emissions and funding social programs — have garnered the most attention in recent months. All the major Democratic presidential candidates have embraced some form of a Green New Deal, and activists have pushed aggressively for such a program. But proposals for a carbon tax have also been gaining momentum on Capitol Hill. U.S. lawmakers are currently considering drafts for several new carbon tax proposals. The IMF report does not provide a specific policy prescription. Instead, it assesses a variety of different proposed climate policies, including a carbon tax, an emissions trading system, regulations and a so-called “feebate” system in which polluting is penalized and those who reduce emissions are rewarded. The IMF report concludes that lawmakers must craft rules that work within their own countries’ political context. Still, while taking an even-keeled look at several policies that would effectively reduce emissions, the IMF report does put a thumb on the scale. It concludes unequivocally that a carbon tax is the most “single, most powerful and efficient tool” to drive a reduction in emissions. It would push polluters to reduce carbon emissions across all facets of the economy—and it’s easier to implement than some alternatives. One of the benefits of a carbon tax, the report says, is that it’s easier to standardize across borders. More than 70 countries have committed to eliminating their carbon footprint by 2050, but many others — including the biggest emitters, like the U.S. and China — have lagged behind. A carbon tax offers a uniform approach to compare each country’s progress and to form coalitions across borders. “If a country has a straightforward carbon tax,” says Mauro, “it’s a lot easier to compute how much action has been taken.” For those nations that don’t implement a carbon tax, economists will need to calculate an implicit carbon price, a tricky but doable proposition, report authors say. The IMF found that to keep temperatures from rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, the price on carbon needs to reach $75/ton by 2030. Authors behind the IMF report argue that activists need not choose between a carbon tax and a Green New Deal-type spending program: a carbon tax can — at least in part — help defray the cost of a Green New Deal. It’s an idea that has caught on in some policy circles, even if it hasn’t risen to the forefront of the climate policy discussion. TIME reported in July that dozens of members of Congress who support Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal resolution also back a carbon tax.",Activists Can't Agree on How to Fight Climate Change. The IMF Says Just Do Something.,"October 10, 2019"
127,Sanya Mansoor,"For the first time in the Nobel Prize for Literature’s 118-year history, two authors were announced Thursday as recipients of the award for two different years: Austrian novelist and playwright Peter Handke and Polish author Olga Tokarczuk. (Handke received the Prize for 2019. Tokarczuk received the Prize for 2018.) Last year’s Nobel Prize for Literature had been cancelled in the wake of sexual assault allegations and significant resignations in 2017 that rocked the Swedish Academy administering the Nobel Prize. Here’s what to know about the two central European authors. Tokarczuk received the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature “for a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life,” the Nobel Academy said. Tokarczuk, 57, was born in 1962 in Sulechów, Poland. She now lives in Wrocław. She was immersed in literature from a young age. Her parents were teachers and her father was also a school librarian. In the library, “she read pretty much everything she could get hold of,” the Academy says in a biography of the author. Her “real breakthrough,” it notes, was with her third novel, Primeval and Other Time — a family saga set in a mythical place. And what the Nobel Academy described as her “magnum opus” to date was the historical novel, The Books of Jacob — a story about an 18th century sect leader whose followers saw him as the new Messiah. That book won The Nike Prize, a prestigious Polish literary award that has been described as “Poland’s Booker equivalent” and an English translation is expected to release in spring of 2021. Tokarczuk is not new to international acclaim either. Last year, she became the first Polish writer to win the Man Booker International Prize for her novel Flights, about travel in the 21st century, borders and human anatomy. This year, her newly translated book, Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead, has been short-listed for the same prize; the story is a thrilling murder mystery in which horoscopes help solve homicides. Tokarczuk said in a phone interview with the Academy shortly after winning the prize that she was “surprised” and “cannot find the right words” to express how she feels. She added that she was happy to know that both awards went to authors from central Europe, noting the region’s challenges with democracy.",Two Authors Just Won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

128,Rajan Basra,"Around noon on Wednesday, a 27-year-old German man drove to a synagogue in the city of Halle in eastern Germany with the aim of killing as many Jews as possible. It was Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The attacker failed to get past the perimeter gate of the synagogue, and then allegedly shot and killed a passerby before driving off while apologizing for his incompetence to his livestream audience: “Sorry guys … like the loser I am … One time loser, always a loser.” He continued to a nearby kebab shop where he killed one person before making an escape. Police later arrested him following a car chase.  What at first sight may appear as an isolated attack in an obscure German city is anything but. The manifesto the attacker posted online — as well as his comments during the livestream — make clear that this is just the latest in a series of interconnected far-right terrorist attacks that have taken place across the world. It follows on from attacks in Pittsburgh (United States), Christchurch (New Zealand), Poway (United States), El Paso (United States) and Bærum (Norway), attacks that have killed 85 people in total over the last year. All of them speak to the same audience of white nationalists online, hoping to inspire them to commit their own acts of violence. Of those, the March 2019 Christchurch massacre in New Zealand — which left 51 worshippers dead in two mosques — has proven to be most influential. Wednesday’s attack in Germany featured many of the same hallmarks: the use of a livestream, the stated aim of a mass-casualty attack with “high score” kill counts, the posting of an online manifesto, the use of meme music and the language of relatively obscure internet image boards. Beyond the similar modus operandi, the Halle shooter also invoked the unifying grand narrative of white-nationalist terrorism today: the “white genocide” conspiracy theory. This is the idea that a Jewish conspiracy is orchestrating the mass immigration of non-whites into Europe and North America with the ultimate aim of destroying the white population. Euphemistically labeled “the great replacement,” this was cited as motivation by the Christchurch, Poway, and El Paso shooters. And the Halle attacker explicitly referred to this in his live stream, blaming Jews for feminism, declining birth rates, and mass immigration, as well as denying the Holocaust. There are, however, differences. While the Christchurch shooter wanted to kill as many Muslims as possible, he also had secondary and tertiary aims: for New Zealand and the United States to ban guns (the reaction), causing people to rise up (the counter-reaction). He said he hoped to have “accelerated” that process. New Zealand did ban assault rifles following the Christchurch massacre, though there was no popular uprising as Tarrant anticipated. The Halle attacker, meanwhile, had no such secondary or tertiary aims. His manifesto makes no mention of possible government reactions or counter-reactions. Instead, he only hoped to inspire more mass-casualty attacks by white nationalists on Jews, Muslims, and other “enemies.” The Halle attacker had constructed an arsenal of improvised weapons, including a submachine gun and hand grenades. In his manifesto he explicitly states he wanted to prove the viability of such improvised weapons, and therefore inspire others to do the same. Yet much to his frustration, his firearms jammed throughout the attack, giving several people a chance to escape. Had his weapons proved more reliable, and had he managed to enter the synagogue, the attack would have been deadlier. His failure to do so has already become the subject of ridicule among white nationalists online.  The trend of livestreaming attacks leads to difficult questions for tech companies, particularly over whether more can be done to stop them. The Christchurch shooter used Facebook Live, while Wednesday’s attack was streamed on the gaming-platform Twitch. For its part, Twitch said that it had shared the video’s hash with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a partnership of leading tech companies formed in 2017 that uses hashing technology to automate content takedown. While the audience for these livestreams is relatively small — the Halle attacker’s stream was only viewed live by a handful of people — members of an online subculture quickly downloaded and shared this content on more obscure platforms. Tackling those may prove more difficult. Contact us at editors@time.com.",How the Synagogue Shooting in Germany Fits Into a Global Pattern of Far-Right Terrorism,"October 10, 2019"
129,Rachael Bunyan,"The wife of a U.S. diplomat allegedly involved in a fatal car accident will not return to the U.K. for further questioning, according to “secret” briefing notes accidentally shown by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday at a press briefing. The briefing notes, marked “secret”, revealed that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab that the “spouse of the U.S. Government employee will not return to the United Kingdom.” They were captured in a photo by a Washington Post photographer during a press conference on Oct. 9. U.K. officials, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have urged the U.S. to waive diplomatic immunity for the wife of the U.S. diplomat, named in British media as Anne Sacoolas, after she fled the U.K. following a car crash on Aug. 27 this year which killed British teenager Harry Dunn. The vehicle was driving on the wrong side of the road when it crashed into Dunn’s motorbike head-on, Northamptonshire police said in a statement. Sacoolas was allegedly behind the wheel in the crash which killed the Dunn, 19. Northamptonshire Police Superintendent Sarah Johnson confirmed in a statement on Oct. 5 that the suspected driver, a 42-year-old American woman, left the country despite telling the police she had no plans to leave the country in the near future. Police want her to return to “enable Northamptonshire police to complete their investigations and justice to be served for Harry Dunn and his very distraught family,” Stephen Mold, the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire, told TIME. President Trump’s briefing notes also said that it is up to the diplomat’s wife to consider whether to speak to British investigators. It read: “(If raised) Note that the spouse of the U.S. Government employee will have to consider, based on the advice or her legal counsel, whether to make herself available for questioning by British authorities.” Despite having the notes at the press conference, when asked about the case, President Trump did not read from the notes. Instead he said: “It’s a very complex issue as you know. So a young man was killed. The person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity. We’re going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something. It was an accident… We’re going to speak to her and see what we can come up with so there can be some healing.” President Trump added: “The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road. That can happen.” U.K. Foreign & Commonwealth Office sources confirmed to TIME that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a discussion with U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, but they declined to discuss the detail of that conversation. Nor would they comment on the leaked notes, arguing that it was unclear whether President Trump had read them and, if he had done, whether he agreed with them.","Diplomat's Wife Suspected in Fatal Car Crash Will Not Return to U.K., Trump's Briefing Notes Reveal","Updated: October 10, 2019 3:37 PM ET"
130,AMIR VAHDAT and MEHDI FATTAHI / AP,"(TEHRAN, Iran) — Thousands of flag-draped Iranian women cheered, blew horns and celebrated inside a Tehran stadium Thursday as they watched the first FIFA soccer match they’ve been allowed to freely attend in decades. The 2022 World Cup qualifier between the Iranian national team and Cambodia at Tehran’s Azadi Stadium marks a decades-long push by Iranian women to be able to watch soccer matches, something hard-liners in Iran’s Shiite theocracy to this day still oppose. Iran allocated only 4,000 tickets for women in a stadium that seats about 80,000 people, keeping them separated from men and under the protection of female police officers. That’s even though face-painted Iranian women have cheered for their team abroad for years, despite the 1981 ban that followed the country’s Islamic Revolution. “We are so happy that finally we got the chance to go to the stadium. It’s an extraordinary feeling,” said Zahra Pashaei, a 29-year-old nurse who has only known soccer games from television. “At least for me, 22 or 23 years of longing and regret lies behind this.” The majority of Azadi, or “Freedom,” Stadium was empty except for the raucous crowd of women who could be heard chanting and cheering amid the match. Iran in the second half was up 10-0 over Cambodia. Iranian state television, which long has been controlled by hard-liners in the Islamic Republic, aired footage of women cheering and commentators even acknowledged their presence. While Iran for years has considered letting women into soccer matches, the decision to allow them in Thursday came as part of intense pressure from FIFA, the world body governing the sport. Iran faced a potential ban if it didn’t allow women into the match. That pressure has grown both with FIFA and Iran’s soccer-loving public since September, when an Iranian woman detained for dressing as a man to sneak into a soccer stadium to watch a match died after setting herself on fire upon learning she learned she could spend six months in prison. The self-immolation death of 29-year-old Sahar Khodayari, who became known as the “Blue Girl” for her love of the Iranian team Esteghlal, shocked Iranian officials and the public, becoming an immediate hashtag trend across social media in the Islamic Republic.",Iranian Women Allowed at FIFA Soccer Match for First Time in Decades,"October 10, 2019"
131,ZEINA KARAM and JOSEPH KRAUSS / AP,"(BEIRUT) — Syrians are fleeing by the tens of thousands yet again, a recurring nightmare of hastily packed bags, traffic-clogged highways and an uncertain fate. Families who just a few years ago fled from an Islamic State onslaught are now running from a Turkish offensive against the same Kurdish fighters who defeated the extremist group. The United States, which worked hand-in-hand with the Syrian Kurds, has stepped aside and abandoned its allies. Now, civilians are on the run again, but this time there are even fewer places to go. The northern border with Turkey is sealed, displacement camps are already overwhelmed and hostile forces, including unbowed IS militants, are poised to move in and exploit the chaos. Here’s a look at the refugee crisis in northeastern Syria amid fears it will dramatically worsen. Syrian government forces largely withdrew from the northeast after the civil war erupted in 2011 to focus on other parts of the country. That allowed the Kurdish minority to carve out an autonomous region that welcomed refugees from the fighting in other parts of the country, including Christians and other religious minorities. But the Islamic State group swept in starting in 2013 and eventually conquered most of the area, establishing the capital of its self-styled caliphate in the northeastern city of Raqqa. Tens of thousands of people fled the fighting and the group’s brutal rule, which was marked by massacres, public beheadings and other atrocities. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces launched a counteroffensive after nearly being wiped out in the northeastern border town of Kobane. With close U.S. military support, they gradually retook nearly all of northeastern Syria from the extremists, including Raqqa. But victory came at a staggering cost, with tens of thousands killed and entire neighborhoods and towns left in ruins. Much of Raqqa was destroyed, and the city is still littered with undetonated explosive devices. Now the Kurdish fighters are racing to the front lines once again, this time to fight Turkey, which considers them terrorists because of their links to the Kurdish insurgency inside its borders.",U.N.

He didn’t do this in an official NBA capacity; his tweet nevertheless set off a firestorm in China, which promptly set off alarms at NBA headquarters in New York City. Morey took down the tweet, and to contain the fallout, the NBA issued two press releases, one in English and one in Chinese that was decidedly more apologetic. It’s as if NBA officials were unaware that the Internet exists in 2019. Uproar ensued, in both China and the U.S. China said it would halt broadcasting and streaming Rockets games. Chinese sponsors have followed suit in cutting ties with the team, among other measures. It was an entirely predictable Chinese response to unwanted foreign criticism. For U.S. fans, the NBA was supposed to be better than this; the NBA has a strong record when it comes to supporting its personnel’s speaking their minds. Enes Kanter, center for the Boston Celtics, once called Turkey’s President “the Hitler of our century.” When he decided to skip a game in London out of security concerns, NBA commissioner Adam Silver backed the decision, saying, “I support Enes as a player in this league, and I support the platform the players have.” Turkish broadcaster S Sport decided not to televise last year’s Western Conference finals because they featured Kanter, then a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. Kanter remains in the NBA. But Turkey is not the market China is. The NBA supports the free speech of its players and personnel when it costs little, but not when $4 billion is on the line. The league’s position may be a hypocritical approach, but this is a fight the league just can’t win. The NBA has spent years trying to balance its values while making inroads into China’s 1.4 billion-strong consumer market. China has been forcing companies to toe Beijing’s political line for far longer. South Park took on Chinese censorship in a recent episode; the show has been effectively banned there since. For a show built on taking swipes at all different kinds of authorities, it’s the cost of doing business. Businesses not built on irreverence are typically forced to fire people for these sorts of transgressions. Silver eventually got around to saying the right thing, albeit too late to head off the crisis. “It is inevitable that people around the world … will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.” An admirable sentiment, but one that’s increasingly incompatible with business realities for a global brand in 2019 (or with even one more pro–Hong Kong tweet from the NBA). As a league, the NBA never should have waded into this political fight. If the NBA wants access to the Chinese market, it will now need to play by Chinese rules, and in today’s world those rules don’t just stop at China’s borders. While plenty in the league have expressed support for Morey, you can bet that no one affiliated with the NBA will again publicly support protests in Hong Kong without thinking twice. Hong Kong is far from the only hot-button issue for China. Further from the spotlight is the Uighur population of China’s western Xinjiang province, Muslims who have been victims of harsh and systematic oppression for many years.

135,Naina Bajekal,"“When we are away from home, in new and strange places, we get to know ourselves better,” Abdallah, the son of a rich merchant, thinks as he gazes out an airplane window. It’s a sentiment that will resonate with many readers who immerse themselves in the rich, dense landscape of Jokha Alharthi’s Celestial Bodies, newly translated into English. The novel has already made history–as the first by an Omani woman to be translated into English, and the first originally written in Arabic to win the Man Booker International Prize. (Marilyn Booth shares the award for her translation.) Through the lives of three sisters and their families, Alharthi charts the dizzying transformation of Oman in the decades after it achieved independence from Britain in 1951. During that time, the Gulf state redefined itself and opened up to Western commerce. Originally published in 2010 as Sayyidat al-Qamar (Ladies of the Moon), the novel is written in short, experimental chapters that shift between streams of consciousness and memories and across multiple timelines. Alharthi alternates the first-person voice of Abdallah, the son of a slave trader (Oman only abolished slavery in 1970), with a third-person viewpoint following the sisters and multiple other characters. The results are mixed–the cast is so broad that it’s impossible to follow the story without regular glances at the family tree provided. But the variety of perspectives is effective in offering a window into a country that few Western readers will know intimately. Celestial Bodies is strongest in its exploration of how the changes in Oman affect women: within one generation, they are exposed to ideas from abroad and start moving away from cloistered, rural life. But Alharthi, who began writing the novel while homesick in Edinburgh as she completed her Ph.D. in classical Arabic literature, pushes past stereotypical narratives of Muslim women defying patriarchy, instead illustrating the difficulties of balancing tradition and newfound freedoms. It’s a tale that perhaps could have been written only in a strange new place itself. Write to Naina Bajekal at naina.bajekal@time.com.

136,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Apple on Thursday took down a smartphone app that protesters in Hong Kong use to track police whereabouts, a move that comes one day after Chinese state media criticized the company for acting as an “accomplice” to the pro-democracy movement. The tech giant is the latest U.S. company to face backlash from the Chinese Communist Party over the ongoing and sometimes violent unrest in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous enclave. The creators of the withdrawn app, HKmap.live, confirmed the delisting from Apple’s online store to TIME. The removal is the latest reversal in an ongoing battle over the crowdsourced map, which allows users to report the locations of police, protesters and tear gas. Just last week Apple had approved the HKmap.live app, after rejecting it earlier this month. In a statement, Apple said it withdrew the app because it had been used to ambush the police and endanger citizens. “The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau [CSTCB] that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,” the statement said, according to Reuters. A Twitter account purportedly run by the developers disagreed with the claims. “There is 0 evidence to support CSTCB’s accusation that HKmap App has been used to target and ambush police, [or] threaten public safety.” The app does not “solicit, promote, or encourage criminal activity,” they added.",Apple Removes Hong Kong Protesters' Crowdsourced Police-Tracking Map From App Store,"October 10, 2019"

138,DEB RIECHMANN and LOLITA C. BALDOR / AP,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. has moved some of the Islamic State prisoners amid fears some could escape custody as Turkey invades northeast Syria. Turkey is attacking the U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces, a Kurdish force that battled the Islamic State group alongside American troops and now is responsible for guarding thousands of detained militants. But guarding those prisoners is now expected to be less of a priority for the Kurdish forces as they rush to defend their territory against the invading Turkish military. Trump told reporters at the White House that some of the “most dangerous” had been moved, but he did not say how many or where they had been taken. “We’re putting them in different locations where it’s secure,” he said. In March, Kurdish and U.S. forces cleared the last members of the Islamic State group from what was left of their self-declared caliphate, which once sprawled across a large part of Iraq and Syria. U.S. officials said operations against remaining members of the Islamic State group are on hold following the invasion Wednesday by Turkey, which sees the Kurds as a threat and is trying to create a buffer zone between the territory held by the SDF and the Syrian border. Kurdish forces hold thousands of Islamic State fighters in detention centers, and U.S. officials said that some Kurds left the prisons to join the fight but did not flee in large numbers. Officials said a small number of high-profile Islamic State detainees are being relocated, but thousands of others remain in custody and there are no immediate concerns the Kurds will completely abandon the facilities.",President Trump Said U.S. Moved ISIS Prisoners as Turkey Attacks Syria,"October 10, 2019"
139,Suyin Haynes,"“I’m fascinated by the grandeur, the pompousness, the overmuch,” says Kara Walker. That sensibility fueled the American artist’s latest creation, Fons Americanus—a 13-meter-high fountain unveiled Sept. 30 in London’s Tate Modern museum. With a cast of characters and iconography reflecting the intertwined histories of Africa, Europe and America, Fons Americanus presents the brutality of slavery in a subversively joyful setting. Walker is known for her ambitious work across mediums interrogating race, sexuality, slavery and identity; her 2014 installation A Subtlety was housed in Brooklyn’s Domino Sugar Factory, attracting over 130,000 visitors to the main giant sphinx sculpture. Fons Americanus is Walker’s fourth site-specific work, and it references classical British artists such as J.M.W. Turner and William Blake, as well as African-American historical figures including Emmett Till and Marcus Garvey. The artist was inspired in part by London’s Victoria Memorial, a towering, majestic monument to the Queen who commandeered the British Empire. “I just got this jazzy feeling,” she says. “I’m interested in ways allegorical figures are misrepresentative of the thing they’re meant to symbolize.” Tributes to empire in the U.K., like Confederate statues in the U.S., have come under scrutiny in recent years, as observers reconsider how frequently immortalized figures also played key roles in the oppression of others. “Public space creates the opportunity for misinterpretation,” says Walker. “In some ways, I think my work is a misreading of empire.” The contrast between the fantasy and the reality, the big and the small, forms the basis for Fons Americanus: “This is about the story I could tell with my own hand, which is perhaps second-class, and unseen or unheard,” says Walker, “and the story that is larger than it ought to be, than it has a right to be.” And while some monuments to empire have been dismantled, Walker is more concerned with what will take their place. “Who are we now, and what are we saying now as a people besides removing something?” she asks. “What do we build in its stead?” Below, Walker explains the inspiration behind the different elements of Fons Americanus. “It was all about the water, in a way,” says Walker. She was influenced by time spent in Rome, home to the spectacular Baroque Trevi Fountain. Early on, Walker decided that water would be an integral part of the installation and would symbolize the oceans that slaves were forcibly transported across, as well as a metaphorical connection between the shared histories and identities of Africa, Europe and America. The fountain’s centerpiece references an 1801 propaganda artwork called The Voyage of the Sable Venus from Angola to the West Indies, which depicted the Middle Passage as a joyful journey. “The image of the Sable Venus is so appalling, isn’t it?” says Walker. It’s an icon that has mesmerized the artist for decades; she first referenced it in an early sketchbook when she was in art school, and later used it in her silhouette work. Walker’s Venus spreads her arms atop Fons Americanus and is reinterpreted as a liberated, celebratory priestess, drawing inspiration from Afro-Brazilian culture. A sea captain partly modeled on Haitian revolutionary leader Toussaint L’Ouverture appears on the front of the pedestal, joined by a kneeling man at his side, symbolic of a once-powerful slave owner now crippled by the rebellion. They are two of several figures overlooking water filled with drowning slaves and infested with Damien Hirst-inspired sharks. In presenting many characters and symbols, Walker wanted to create a “nauseating, miasmic sensation.”",Kara Walker Breaks Down the Influences Behind Her Bold New Work at the Tate Modern,"October 9, 2019"
140,W.J. Hennigan,"As Turkish warplanes bomb U.S.-backed Kurdish allies in northeastern Syria, the Trump Administration has yet to draw up a strategy to safeguard and maintain the more than 30 detention camps that hold tens of thousands of ISIS fighters, families and sympathizers spread across the region. The Kurds, part of the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces, control facilities holding about 11,000 ISIS detainees across northern Syria. They also run a camp for internally displaced persons known as al-Hol, in northeastern Syria, that holds nearly 70,000 people. Among them are thousands of ISIS family members, according to a recent Defense Department Inspector General’s report. The U.S. military has no plans to take over these camps and, with only about 1,000 total troops inside Syria, is not prepared to do so, U.S. officials told TIME. If the Kurds abandon their guard posts to defend their homes against the Turkish military incursion, thousands of ISIS operatives are likely to escape, U.S. military, diplomatic and intelligence officials have concluded. Past and present U.S. military commanders have shared that assessment directly with President Donald Trump, but he has rebuffed the warnings and demanded that Turkey take control of the camps, the officials say. Most of the camps remain outside the area that Turkey is expected to occupy, and the Kurds have said they will remain in control over the detainees. But that may prove difficult if fighting in their home territory intensifies. In early 2018, hundreds of Kurds opted to abandon fighting positions against ISIS in eastern Syria to assist Kurdish forces fighting Turkish military in another skirmish in Afrin, in northwestern Syria. Trump maintains that Turkey can, and will, take over control of the camps as part of their offensive. “Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,” he tweeted Wednesday. “Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!” A peaceful handover of the camps to the Turkish military is unlikely, U.S., European, and Middle East officials warn. The threat is complicated, U.S. intelligence officials say, by an unknown number of young refugees that have been radicalized by the abysmal conditions inside the camps and the proselytizing of ISIS members detained there. “If they are released, the task of identifying potential terrorists has been compounded by what’s been happening in the camps,” said one U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Even though ISIS militants have lost control of major cities in Iraq or Syria, the terror group’s leadership ranks have proven resilient despite the five years of war. And ISIS has been quick to adapt to new circumstances. No longer capable of seizing and holding territory, the surviving foot soldiers have instead gone back to its guerrilla roots by embedding constellations of sleeper cells in both countries to routinely carry out ambushes, bombings and assassinations. “The fact that (ISIS) is no longer a caliphate doesn’t mean it’s been defeated,” says the U.S. official. “Instead, it’s metastasizing.” The U.S. has long known the detention facilities are a problem, but has failed to come up with a solution. For two years, the U.S. has pleaded with European and Arab allies to take custody of fighters held in the camps. It’s estimated that about 2,000 of the 11,000 ISIS prisoners are from more than 40 countries other than Syria and Iraq. With few exceptions, the nations refused to accept their countrymen and the United States was repeatedly rebuffed. “There does have to be a Plan B of what comes next,” Michael Mulroy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, said Oct. 2 at the Council on Foreign Relations. “I can’t declare what that is today because, quite frankly, we haven’t developed it entirely.”","Trump, Pentagon Have No Contingency Plan for ISIS Jailbreakers as Turkey Attacks U.S. Allies in Syria","October 9, 2019"
141,Melissa Chan,"An international law that largely shields foreign diplomats and their family members from criminal prosecution has come under scrutiny after the wife of an American diplomat left Britain following a crash that killed a 19-year-old man. But despite growing calls in the U.K. for U.S. officials to waive the woman’s diplomatic immunity protections, such a revocation rarely happens, the State Department says, and experts don’t think this case will be any different. “It’s highly unlikely that the U.S. will waive immunity,” says Craig Barker, a dean and international law professor at London South Bank University. “I don’t think the special relationship to the U.K. will make an iota of a difference.” The teen, Harry Dunn, died Aug. 27 in Northamptonshire, England, after a 42-year-old American woman allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road struck him head-on while he was riding a motorcycle, police said. Over the weekend, authorities in Britain revealed that the woman, who has been identified as Anne Sacoolas, was no longer in the country. The news was met with swift backlash, especially since police say she told them she had no plans to leave during the investigation into the crash. “She’s broken our family,” Dunn’s mother, Charlotte Charles, said in an emotional TV interview this week. Calls to a number listed for Sacoolas in Virginia did not go through and were met with a constant busy signal. Under international law, foreign diplomats and family members enjoy certain protections that allow them to avoid prosecution for almost any crime unless the diplomat’s home country waives immunity, according to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. While it’s not clear whether the woman is fully entitled to these protections, Charles, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and local authorities have all urged U.S. President Donald Trump to intervene. “This is a tragedy of the largest proportion,” Northamptonshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold tells TIME. “At the end of the day, there is a special relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. We ask them to treat this as though it was the other way round.”",A Teenager's Death Has Put Diplomatic Immunity Under a Spotlight,"October 9, 2019"
142,GEIR MOULSON and JENS MEYER / AP,"(HALLE, Germany) — A heavily armed assailant tried to force his way into a synagogue Wednesday in eastern Germany on Yom Kippur, Judaism’s holiest day, and two people were killed as he fired shots outside the building and into a kebab shop, authorities and witnesses said. The attacker shot at the door of the synagogue in the city of Halle but did not get in as 70 to 80 people inside were observing the holy day, a local Jewish leader said. Video of the attack was livestreamed on streaming site Twitch, which said it had “worked with urgency” to remove it. Germany’s top security official, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, said authorities must assume that it was an anti-Semitic attack, and said prosecutors believe there may be a right-wing extremist motive to it. He said several people were injured. Police said in a tweet early Wednesday afternoon that “the suspected perpetrators” had fled in a car after the attacks and quickly reported that one person had been arrested. Officers spread out in force across Halle, a city of 240,000, urging residents to stay at home. Several hours later, police said there was no longer an “acute” danger to the city and residents could go back into the streets. They gave no details about the person who had been arrested. Police also didn’t specify why their assessment had changed, but the news agency dpa and the Bild newspaper cited unidentified security sources as saying the evidence points to a lone assailant. News magazine Der Spiegel, which didn’t cite its sources, said the suspect is a 27-year-old man from Saxony-Anhalt state, where Halle is located. Rita Katz, the head of the SITE Intelligence Group, wrote on Twitter that 35 minutes of footage of the attacks were posted online, and that the attacker said in English before the shooting that the “root of all problems are the Jews.”",2 Dead Following German Synagogue Attack on Yom Kippur,"Updated: October 9, 2019 2:57 PM ET"

144,CARLEY PETESCH / AP,"(DAKAR, Senegal) — More than 4,000 people have died in Congo this year in the world’s largest measles outbreak, the United Nations children’s agency said Wednesday. The Central African nation is also battling an Ebola outbreak that has killed about half that number since August 2018. Since January, more than 200,000 cases of measles have been reported across Congo, UNICEF said. More than 140,000 involve children under 5, who also make up nearly 90 percent of deaths. “We’re facing this alarming situation because millions of Congolese children miss out on routine immunization and lack access to health care when they fall sick,” said the UNICEF country representative, Edouard Beigbeder. “On top of that, a weak health system, insecurity, community mistrust of vaccines and vaccinators and logistical challenges all contribute to a huge number of unvaccinated children at risk of contracting the disease.” Health officials are facing many of the same challenges in the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo that has killed more than 2,000 people. Multiple armed groups have been fighting over the mineral-rich land for decades and threatening residents. The insecurity has led to mistrust of authorities, including health workers. UNICEF said health workers were rushing additional medical kits to help care for more than 110,000 people infected with the measles, a highly contagious and potentially deadly virus. More than 1.4 million children have been vaccinated this year. The U.N. agency said Congo’s government will launch a vaccination campaign at the end of October to make sure children in every province are vaccinated.

145,Suyin Haynes,"This year’s Nobel Prize for Literature marks a first in the award’s 118-year history. On Thursday, there won’t just be one award announced, but two simultaneously for different years: one for 2018 and the other for 2019. Each winner will receive over $910,000 in prize money and the international acclaim accompanying recognition as a Nobel Laureate.  With winners in previous years including Japanese novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, and Belarusian investigative journalist Svetlana Alexievich, the prize is seen as a celebration of an individual’s contribution to world literature. The unusual move to award two Prizes at once comes after sexual assault allegations and significant resignations in 2017 rocked the Swedish Academy, the institution responsible for administering the Nobel Prize, leading to the cancellation of 2018’s Prize announcement. As the Academy prepares to announce the 2018 and 2019 Laureates, can it rebuild trust in what the prize stands for?  The #MeToo movement blazed through the U.S. entertainment industry in October 2017, before becoming a global rallying cry for survivors of sexual harassment and assault. Countless universities, organizations, and companies faced reckonings over sexual assault and how they should handle allegations. The Swedish Academy, a 233-year-old cultural institution which has been responsible for awarding the Nobel Prize for Literature since its inception in 1901, was no exception. (The Academy is one of Sweden’s Royal Academies, with 18 members elected for life.) In November 2017, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter published allegations from 18 women accusing French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault of sexual assault. Arnault and his wife, author and Swedish Academy member Katarina Frostenson, were two of the country’s most prominent cultural figures at the time. After the allegations were published, further reports alleged a conflict of interest regarding an arts club that Arnault and Frostenson ran together, which was subsidized by the Academy. It was also reported that Arnault, now 72, may have been responsible for leaking the shortlist of authors in consideration for the literature prize seven times since 1996 (the shortlisting and selection of the eventual Prize-winner is notoriously secretive).  Long regarded as a forum for elite and intellectual debate, the Academy was quickly overwhelmed by the scandal. Literary scholar Sara Danius, who was the first woman to lead the Academy and was in charge at the time the scandal broke, announced that she too had been sexually assaulted by Arnault. Yet Danius was forced to step down from the Academy by Arnault and Frostensen’s defenders, most notably former Academy secretary Horace Engdahl. Several other Academy members left in support of Danius, who said in August 2018 that “history will not be merciful about what today’s Swedish Academy is encountering, especially not to Mr Engdahl, to the extent he will be remembered at all.”  Ravaged by infighting, accusations of corruption, and connections with serious sexual assault allegations, the Swedish Academy said in May 2018 that the Nobel Prize for Literature, traditionally announced every fall, was canceled for that year. In October 2018, Arnault was convicted of one count of rape and sentenced to two years in prison, as well as an $11,000 fine; he appealed but two months later, it was denied and he was found guilty of two counts of rape, resulting in $24,000 fine and a 30 month jail sentence.) In its place, several high profile Swedish writers and other cultural figures set up the New Academy prize in literature as a one-off “alternative Nobel” award: Guadeloupean novelist Maryse Condé was announced as the winner in October 2018. Swedish journalist, writer and President of PEN Sweden Jesper Bengtsson says that the Academy’s reputation was “damaged” by last year’s scandal. “It would be stupid to say anything else. But on the other hand, I think it is repairable, although it will take some time,” he says. Observers say this year’s prize does have the potential to mark a comeback from the events of last year. Having recognized how low trust was in the Academy, several reforms have been made to address ongoing criticisms, many of which existed long before last year’s cancellation. A press release from the Nobel Foundation in March stated that the Academy amended its regulations, elected new members and appointed a new independent committee appointed to help select the eventual prize-winner. The statement also noted that members under criminal investigation or subject to a conflict of interest were no longer part of the Academy. Although the selection process for all the Nobel Prizes are famously secretive, with no shortlist or criteria publicly available, the Literature prize reforms outlined a series of structural changes and a commitment to “greater openness.”  “They had to clean up their house, and I’m glad they’re able to relaunch this year,” says novelist and chair of English PEN Maureen Freely, who was a translator for Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006. “I admire organizations that own up to their mistakes and try to do something about them. I far prefer that than the opposite,” she says. Freely, who was part of the judging panel for the 2019 International Booker Prize, says it’s important that some parts of the decision-making for such prizes are kept under wraps. “I prefer it when the rules of a judging panel are transparent, but I also understand how, at a certain point, you can’t let everybody in on every single decision or every single criteria.”",Last Year's Nobel Prize in Literature Was Canceled Over Scandal and Conflict.

147,LEFTERIS PITARAKIS and SARAH EL DEEB / AP,"(AKCAKALE, Turkey) — Turkey launched airstrikes and fired artillery aimed at crushing Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Wednesday after U.S. troops pulled back from the area, paving the way for an assault on forces that have long been allied with the United States. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the start of the campaign, which followed an abrupt decision Sunday by U.S. President Donald Trump that American troops would step aside to allow for the operation. Trump’s move, which has drawn harsh bipartisan opposition at home, represented a shift in U.S. policy that essentially abandoned the Syrian Kurdish fighters who have been America’s only allies inside Syria in the fight against the Islamic State group. After Turkey’s offensive began, there was sign of panic in the streets of Ras al-Ayn— one of the towns under attack with residential areas close to the borders. Cars raced to safety, although it was not clear if they were leaving the town or heading away from border areas. Near the town of Qamishli, plumes of smoke were seen rising from an area close to the border after activists reported sounds of explosion nearby. At least one member of the Kurdish-led force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces was killed in the Turkish bombardment, Kurdish activists and a Syria war monitor said. Turkey’s campaign — in which a NATO member is raining down bombs on an area where hundreds of U.S. troops are stationed — drew immediate criticism and calls for restraint from Europe. “Coalition forces are not near the places Turkey has struck so far,” an official with the U.S.-led coalition told The Associated Press.

148,BERNARD CONDON / AP,"(NEW YORK) — President Donald Trump’s two golf resorts in Scotland posted another year of multimillion-dollar losses as his properties contend with a struggling local economy and a backlash against his divisive rhetoric. Trump’s golf clubs on the North Sea and Irish Sea lost a combined 11.9 million pounds ($14.5 million) last year, according to financial statements filed with Britain’s Companies House. That comes on the heels of a string of annual losses that started before Trump was president. But there were signs of recovery, including an increase in revenue at both Scottish resorts. The president has 17 golf operations around the world. But unlike his licensing operations where he has sold his name for fee, he has spent hundreds of millions to buy and improve the clubs, a bold bet that he can buck the industry trend of bankruptcy and losses. The numbers from Scotland so far have not been encouraging. At Trump’s Turnberry resort on the Irish Sea, which has hosted several British Opens, losses topped 10.8 million pounds ($13.2 million) last year, triple the loss from a year earlier, though much of that came from a hit in foreign exchange. Taking that out and one-time and non-cash costs, the club lost 210,000 pounds, or $257,000. Revenue jumped 20%. Trump’s North Sea club overlooking a stretch of dramatic dunes also posted losses, though much lower — 1.1 million pounds, or $1.3 million. Some in Scotland have praised Trump for bringing in tourists and helping businesses in the North Sea club area. But others have protested his comments about Mexican immigrants and have accused of him of bullying tactics in trying to buy up land and of harming the local dunes with his course. More recently, the club has drawn protests from environmental groups and others over plans to build 550 homes on the property in what would be the biggest construction project for the president’s company since he took office. Residents sent thousands of letters to local politicians, raising the prospect of heavy traffic and crowded schools, though others have argued the homes could provide a boost to the economy. Last month, a local government council approved the Trump club’s plan for expansion, a potentially big source of cash. A marketing brochure says buyers should be prepared to pay as much as 1.3 million pounds for the biggest homes, or $1.6 million each.",President Trump's Two Scottish Golf Clubs Operating at Multi-Million Dollar Losses,"October 9, 2019"
149,DARLENE SUPERVILLE / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — President Donald Trump lashed out Wednesday over sharp bipartisan criticism of his decision to pull back U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, saying he is focused on the “BIG PICTURE” that does not include American involvement in “stupid endless wars” in the Middle East. “Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,” Trump said in a series of morning tweets. “The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!” Turkey launched its offensive Wednesday, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announcing on his official Twitter account that the operation had begun. Erdogan said the operation aims to eradicate “the threat of terror” against Turkey.

It’s also been condemned by some of Trump’s staunchest Republican allies. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close Trump ally, stepped up his criticism of the president Wednesday, telling “Fox & Friends” that if Trump “follows through with this, it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency.” “I hope he’s right. I don’t think so,” Graham said, comparing Trump’s views to the “pre-9/11 mentality that paved the way for 9/11.” Trump defended his unpopular decision, arguing on Twitter that “GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!” He said the U.S. went to war under a “false & now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE!” Trump said he is “slowly & carefully” bringing home “our great soldiers & military,” in line with his campaign promise to do so. He added: “Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE!

150,Mahita Gajanan,"Coleen Rooney, who is married to former England player Wayne Rooney, has accused the wife of another British soccer player of leaking fake stories about her to the tabloid newspaper The Sun. A new statement from Rooney, in which she details the honeytrap she laid out to catch the alleged culprit, has transfixed the internet in the U.K. and beyond — you don’t need to be well-versed in British tabloid culture (and the celebrities it tracks) to appreciate the modern-day detective work at play. “For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing THE SUN newspaper of my private posts and stories,” Rooney, who has long battled tabloid exposes, most famously detailing her husband’s infidelities, wrote in a statement shared to her Twitter and Instagram accounts. She then laid out the lengths she went to identify the person she claims is responsible. Do take notes. To figure out and prove who the informer was, Rooney explained that she blocked everyone with access to her private Instagram from viewing her stories — except for one account owned by the person Rooney wrote she had become suspicious of. Rooney then posted a number of fake stories that would only be visible to the one account not blocked. “Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!” Rooney wrote. “I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly just one person has viewed them. It’s……….Rebekah Vardy’s account.” Vardy is the wife of English soccer player Jamie Vardy, who also plays for the national team. Vardy is well-known for her appearances on the British daytime talk show Loose Women, and also for taking part in the 2017 series of the very popular British reality show I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! Rooney said that the false details she shared included her a story on her researching “gender selection” treatment in Mexico, another on her considering a return to TV hosting, and one about something as mundane as the basement in her home flooding. Articles on all these subjects have been published in The Sun — one in August about “gender selection” treatment in Mexico,” one in September about Rooney’s supposed revived TV career and one in October about her house flooding. A representative for The Sun says the publication does not have a comment on the matter, but pointed TIME to its own coverage of the ongoing fallout between Rooney and Vardy. In that piece, The Sun claims it reached out to Rooney’s representatives for comment on each of the stories she claims Vardy leaked, but that they declined to comment. Vardy was quick to deny Rooney’s accusation. In an Instagram statement of her own, she claimed that other people have had access to her Instagram account and inferred they could/would be the responsible parties. “I’m not being funny but I don’t need the money,” she wrote. “What would I gain from selling stories?”",The Internet Has Dubbed This British Celebrity 'WAGatha Christie' After She Faked Instagram Stories to Catch Out a Friend Leaking Details to a Tabloid,"October 9, 2019"
151,JOE McDONALD / AP,"(BEIJING) — Apple became the latest company targeted for Chinese pressure over protests in Hong Kong when the ruling Communist Party’s main newspaper criticized the tech giant Wednesday for a smartphone app that allows activists to report police movements. HKmap.live, designed by an outside supplier and available on Apple Inc.’s online store, “facilitates illegal behavior,” the Chinese newspaper People’s Daily said in a commentary. “Is Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?” the newspaper said. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has pressed companies including Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways to take the government’s side against the protests, which are in their fourth month. HKmap.live allows users to report police locations, use of tear gas and other details that are added to a regularly updated map. Another version is available for smartphones that use the Android operating system. Asked whether the Chinese government had asked Apple to remove HKmap.live from its online store, a foreign ministry spokesman said he had no information about that. “What I can tell you is that these radical, violent crimes in Hong Kong have seriously challenged the legal system and social order in Hong Kong, threatened the safety of Hong Kong residents’ lives and property, and undermined the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,” said the spokesman, Geng Shuang. “Anyone who has a conscience and justice should resist and oppose instead of supporting and indulging those actions,” Geng said at a regular news briefing.

152,Associated Press,"(JOHANNESBURG) — A new report says more than one-third of women in four low-income countries in Africa and Asia were slapped, mocked, forcibly treated or otherwise abused during childbirth in health centers and suggests that such mistreatment occurs worldwide. The study published Wednesday in The Lancet medical journal says women in Nigeria, Myanmar, Ghana and Guinea also experienced high rates of cesarean sections and surgical cuts to the vagina, or episiotomies, without their consent — and often without a painkiller. “Mistreatment during childbirth can amount to a violation of human rights, and could be a powerful disincentive from seeking facility-based maternity care,” the study said in a discussion of similar research. The new study led by the World Health Organization followed more than 2,000 women during labor and interviewed more than 2,600 women after childbirth. Some 42% reported physical or verbal abuse or discrimination during childbirth. Some women were punched, shouted at, scolded or forcibly held down. Younger, less-educated women are at risk of such mistreatment which also includes neglect by health workers or the use of force during procedures, the study said. Most of the abuse occurred in the 15 minutes before and during childbirth. The study cited research that found that “midwives and doctors described women as ‘uncooperative’ during this period and some justified using physical and verbal abuse as ‘punishment.'” Health officials say the mistreatment of women during childbirth appears to be global, including in developed countries. But the practices are rarely documented and women often fear reporting such violations. Previous reports have documented physical abuse of women in eastern Europe, particularly those of Roma descent, including instances where women are forcibly separated from their newborns for several days. Abusive practices during maternal care have also been widely reported across Latin America, where Venezuela became the first country to legislate against specific unethical practices by adopting a law to ban so-called “obstetric violence” in 2007.","New Report Reveals Widespread Abuse, Mistreatment of Women During Childbirth","October 9, 2019"
153,Associated Press,"(STOCKHOLM) — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday for their work leading to the development of lithium-ion batteries, which have reshaped energy storage and transformed cars, mobile phones and many other devices — and reduced reliance on fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. The prize went to John B. Goodenough, 97, a German-born engineering professor at the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham, 77, a British-American chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Japan’s Akira Yoshino, 71, of Asahi Kasei Corporation and Meijo University. Goodenough is the oldest ever recipient of a Nobel Prize. The three each had a set of unique breakthroughs that cumulatively laid the foundation for the development of a commercial rechargeable battery. The Nobel committee said the lithium-ion battery has its roots in the oil crisis in the 1970s, when Whittingham was working to develop methods aimed at leading to fossil fuel-free energy technologies. “We have gained access to a technical revolution,” said Sara Snogerup Linse, of the Nobel committee for chemistry. “The laureates developed lightweight batteries with high enough potential to be useful in many applications — truly portable electronics: mobile phones, pacemakers, but also long-distance electric cars.” “The ability to store energy from renewable sources — the sun, the wind — opens up for sustainable energy consumption,” she added. Speaking at a news conference in Tokyo, Yoshino said he thought there might be a long wait before the Nobel committee turned to his specialty — but his turn came sooner than he thought. Yoshino said he broke the news to his wife. “I only spoke to her briefly and said, ‘I got it,’ and she sounded she was so surprised that her knees almost gave way.” The trio will share a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma that are conferred on Dec. 10 — the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel’s death in 1896 — in Stockholm.",3 Scientists Share Nobel Prize in Chemistry For Their Work With Lithium-Ion Batteries,"October 9, 2019"
154,Charlie Campbell / Shanghai,"It was supposed to be a week celebrating basketball in Asia, with some of the sport’s top stars due to play preseason games and host charity events in Japan and China. But the escalating showdown between the NBA and Beijing over free speech is fast becoming the latest hot potato in deteriorating Sino-U.S. relations. On Tuesday, China’s state television CCTV and streaming service Tencent suspended all broadcasts of preseason NBA games following a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. That same day, a Brooklyn Nets community event in Shanghai was abruptly canceled, while Rockets memorabilia has been stripped from Chinese online retailers. That Morey’s tweet received a furious backlash in China is hardly surprising. But it’s the muddled and inconsistent response by the NBA, its teams and owners that threatens to cast the spat as an inflection point undermining sport’s time-honored apolitical, and thus unifying, role. “The most disappointing thing about this whole incident is that sport does appear to be tarnished,” says Mark Dreyer, a Chinese sports industry analyst. “It’s not even neutral any longer but actually seen as a negative.” Initially, the NBA said it was “extremely disappointed” by Morey’s “inappropriate” tweet, while Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta insisted his general manager doesn’t speak for the team. But this prompted American NBA fans, as well as politicians on both side of the aisle, to accuse the league of shameless kowtowing to a totalitarian Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for the sake of revenue. NBA commissioner Adam Silver later backtracked, supporting Morey’s right “to exercise his freedom of expression.” Profit versus principle is, of course, a timeless quandary, though one thrown into ever-sharper focus as the global economy slows and the world’s number two becomes more repressive and thinner skinned. Certainly, Silver’s U-turn in the face of domestic pressure ended any prospect for a quick resolution. A statement by CCTV announcing the suspension of broadcasts said, “We believe any speech challenging national sovereignty… is outside of the realm of freedom of speech.” Meanwhile, Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai — the Taiwanese-Canadian co-founder of Alibaba — accused Morey in a lengthy Facebook post of “supporting a separatist movement,” borrowing straight from the language of the CCP. Chinese basketball fans were just as uncompromising. “You only have a home after you have a country,” Mr. Wang, a businessman who has supported the LA Lakers for over a decade, tells TIME. “When our sovereignty is challenged, not watching the NBA isn’t a big deal.”",The China-NBA Spat Underscores Just How Far Sino-U.S. Relations Have Deteriorated,"October 9, 2019"

In its latest assessment of the factors behind productivity and long-term economic growth, the organization best-known for its annual gathering of the elites in the Swiss ski resort of Davos found Singapore overtaking the United States as the most competitive country, aided in no small part by its state-of-the-art infrastructure and strong cooperation between labor and management.

Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Switzerland rounded out the top five places in the rankings. The report’s index maps out the competitive landscape of 141 economies based on more than 100 indicators in a dozen categories. Those categories include headings like health, financial system, market size, business dynamism and capacity to innovate. The U.S. did remain “an innovation powerhouse” and the world’s most competitive large economy, and despite the prospects of a future skills gap, the U.S. still ranks highly for “ease of finding skilled employees” today.

157,Joseph Hincks/Istanbul,"President Donald Trump’s impromptu endorsement of a Turkish incursion into northeast Syria has prompted accusations that Trump had betrayed America’s Kurdish allies in Syria. But his handing Turkey responsibility for thousands of ISIS prisoners has also rung alarm bells among former top officials in Ankara. Shortly after Trump spoke on the phone with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Sunday, the White House issued a statement saying Turkey would soon be moving ahead with its “long-planned operation in Northern Syria” and that U.S. forces would “no longer be in the immediate area.” The statement added that Turkey would now “be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.” Taking responsibility for ISIS will be a “nightmare” for Turkey, said Yaşar Yakış, who served as the country’s foreign minister under prime minister Abdullah Gul between 2002 and 2003. “There are already dormant ISIS cells in Turkey. They may wake up and wreak havoc in the country.” In 2015 and 2016, a series of terror attacks in Turkey claimed by ISIS killed at least 276 people. There are about 11,000 ISIS detainees in over 30 detention facilities across northern Syria. A separate camp for internally displaced persons known as al-Hol, located in northeastern Syria, holds nearly 70,000 people, including thousands of ISIS family members, according to a recent Defense Department Inspector General’s report. These facilities are currently controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the U.S.-backed alliance comprised mostly of Kurdish fighting units known as the YPG, which were instrumental in routing ISIS from its Syrian strongholds. Turkey regards the YPG as indistinguishable from the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which both Ankara and Washington consider a terrorist organization. The objective of the operation in northeast Syria is to strike at YPG fighters.  Nejat Eslen, a retired Turkish Army general, says that while the Kurdish fighters in Syria are the “most important threat” to Turkey, “the main topic of the White House statement is not the PKK, it is ISIS.” Economic or political pressure may have pushed Ankara to agree to the quid pro-quo, he added, but it’s a deal “I would not have accepted.”  The White House statement on Sunday bemoaned European countries’ refusal to take back captured ISIS fighters and the cost of ISIS prison camps to U.S taxpayers. That demonstrates “a complete lack of understanding of anything happening on the ground,” former U.S. special envoy to the global coalition to defeat ISIS Brett McGurk wrote on Twitter. McGurk, who resigned shortly after Trump announced U.S. troops would pull out of Syria late December, said that Turkey does not have the intent, desire, nor the capacity to manage detainees the SDF holds at al Hol camp, which Pentagon officials warn is the “nucleus for a resurgent ISIS.”",Trump Just Handed Control of ISIS Prisoners to Turkey.

Determined activists glued themselves to the British government’s Department of Transport building as police working to keep streets clear appealed to protesters to move to Trafalgar Square. Cities in Australia, elsewhere in Europe and other parts of the world also had climate change protests for a second day. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson appealed Monday to the protesters to stop blocking London’s streets. He called the activists “uncooperative crusties” who should abandon their “hemp-smelling bivouacs.” Mike Gumn, 33, a National Health Service manager with two children, said he used a day of annual leave so he could attend the demonstration. Gumn, of Bristol, took umbrage at Johnson’s characterization of climate change activists as “hippies.” “I want to make a statement that (the activists) are all different sorts of people from all different walks of life, not just people you would call hippies,” he said. Police arrested 152 people on Monday, taking the two-day total to 471. Disruption continued in other major cities in Europe.

159,Mahita Gajanan,"Blizzard Entertainment has banned a professional Hearthstone player who expressed support for protestors in Hong Kong during a live broadcast following the recent Asia-Pacific Grandmasters tournament in which the top pro players from the region participate — and rescinded the money he won in the competition. Blizzard Entertainment, a U.S.-based video game developer that’s a part of the entertainment company Activision Blizzard, is the publisher behind the digital collectible card game Hearthstone. During a post-game interview Sunday on the official Hearthstone Taiwan livestream, the player, Ng “Blitzchung” Wai Chung, pulled down a pro-democracy Hong Kong-style mask and shouted, “Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!” Inven Global, a website that covers esports and gaming news, reports that Blitzchung shouted the phrase in Chinese. Blitzchung is from Hong Kong, according to Inven Global. A clip of the interview can be seen here. In response, Blizzard, a U.S.-based video game developer, banned Blitzchung from competing in Hearthstone tournaments for a year, starting on Oct. 5. The company said Blitzchung has been removed from the Grandmasters roster, and will not receive any prize money he earned during the Grandmasters season 2 tournament. According to a statement from Blizzard, Blitzchung violated a competition rule that bars players from doing anything that “brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.” Blitzchung lost $10,000 in prize earnings, Bloomberg reports. In a statement to Inven Global, Blitzchung said he viewed his comments as a continuation of his participation in the protests. “As you know, there are serious protests in my country now. My call on stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention,” he said. “I put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months, that I sometimes couldn’t focus on preparing my Grandmaster match. I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it’s my duty to say something about the issue.” Blizzard is the latest American organization trying to quell support for the ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong out of an apparent fear of retaliation from the Chinese government, which has insisted that Hong Kong and Taiwan be referred to as its territories, and not as their own countries.

But the children of Carl’s younger children, Prince Carl Philip and Princess Madeleine, were stripped of their royal titles. Carl Philip’s children, Prince Alexander and Prince Gabriel, and Madeleine’s children, Princess Leonore, Prince Nicolas, and Princess Adrienne, “will continue to be members of The Royal Family,” a statement from the Royal House read. “However, they will no longer enjoy the style of Royal Highness and, in the future, will not be expected to perform duties incumbent on the Head of State. The children will retain the Duke or Duchess titles they have already been granted. Alexander and Gabriel are the Dukes of Södermanland and Dalarna respectively; Leonore and Princess Adrienne are the Duchesses of Gotland and Blekinge respectively, and Nicolas the Duke of Ångermanland. Both Prince Carl and Princess Madeleine shared their support for the decision on social media. Princess Madeleine announced on Instagram that the change had been planned for a long time, and said her husband, Christopher O’Neill, who is an American citizen and therefore unable to have a “Prince” title, believed it was a good idea. “Our children now have a greater opportunity to shape their own lives as individuals in the future.

161,STEPHEN WADE and TIM REYNOLDS / AP,"(TOKYO) — NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league is not apologizing for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s since-deleted tweet showing support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, even after China’s state broadcaster CCTV canceled plans to show a pair of preseason games in that country later this week. Silver, speaking Tuesday at a news conference in Tokyo before a preseason game between the Rockets and NBA champion Toronto Raptors, went as far as to say that he and the league are “apologetic” that so many Chinese officials and fans were upset by Morey’s tweet and comments that followed — but insisted that Morey has the right to freedom of expression. “Daryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,” Silver said. “What I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.” Among those consequences: CCTV said it would not show the games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, who will play Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen. Basketball is wildly popular in China and those two teams — largely because of LeBron James starring for the Lakers and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s co-founder Joe Tsai now owning the Nets — would have almost certainly been a huge television draw. “We’re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver’s claim to support Morey’s right to freedom of expression,” CCTV said in a statement. “We believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.” The broadcaster is also reviewing all its cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA, said the statement posted to CCTV Sports’ official social media account. Silver is going to Shanghai on Wednesday and said he hopes to meet with officials and some of the league’s business partners there in an effort to find some sort of common ground. He said he hopes Chinese officials and fans look at the totality of the impact of the three-decade-plus relationship between the league and their country, and urged them to see his response while acknowledging there are political differences between the countries. “I’m sympathetic to our interests here and our partners that are upset,” Silver said. “I don’t think it’s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.”","Amid China Backlash, NBA Commissioner Says League Will Support Freedom of Speech","October 8, 2019"

A record 35 candidates filed nominations Monday for the Nov. 16 election, with former defense chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa considered the favorite. Rajapaksa, who served as defense chief under his brother, former strongman President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is popular for his part in ending the government’s long civil war against ethnic minority Tamil rebels a decade ago. He has been accused of condoning rape, torture and the shadowy disappearances of critics, but is considered a hero among ethnic majority Sinhalese for his role in defeating the Tamil Tiger rebels. Sirisena, who would have had difficulty beating Gotabaya Rajapaksa, did not pay a deposit by a Sunday deadline, making him ineligible to file a nomination. Rajapaksa represents a party that broke away from Sirisena’s party and has the loyalty of a majority of its members. The end of Sirisena’s presidency is marked by unfulfilled expectations of good governance, ethnic harmony and economic progress. Sirisena pledged to abolish a powerful executive presidential system within 100 days of coming to power, change the constitution to allow power sharing with minority Tamils and investigate alleged abuses committed during the final stages of fighting between the government and Tamil rebels.",Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena Will Not Seek Reelection Next Month,"October 8, 2019"
164,Justin Worland,"News broke Monday morning that a group of businessmen touting close ties to President Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, spent last spring maneuvering to install new management at the top of Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state-owned gas company. The news came on the heels of revelations that Trump and his allies spent much of this year pushing Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump’s likely opponents in his reelection bid, triggering a complicated impeachment inquiry. So what is Naftogaz, why is it important, and where does it fit in this larger impeachment story? The short answer is that Naftogaz, as a key transporter of natural gas from Russia to the European Union, is at the center of both legitimate U.S. policy goals in Ukraine and allegations of a pressure campaign exacted by businessmen tied to the Trump Administration. Geography explains the importance of Naftogaz and the reasons why Ukraine has been a focal point of U.S. international energy policy. Ukraine sits right between Russia and the European Union and plays a key role moving Russian natural gas to eastern Europe where it is used for electricity, heating and other purposes. In total, the EU receives 40% of its natural gas from Russia (though not all of it comes via Ukraine).  That supply comes with strings. Russia has used the energy source as a political weapon, occasionally shutting off the gas to threaten and intimidate Ukraine and EU countries. The state-owned Russian firm Gazprom has also targeted Naftogaz directly, withholding billions of dollars in payment in defiance of court rulings. (The relationship between Gazprom, Naftogaz and the EU is currently under negotiation as the contract between Russia and the Ukraine expires in January). In an interview last year, Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev told me that Russia was “trying to destroy Ukraine” using “military and financial” methods, including by withholding payment. “The Gazprom behavior is partly dictated by Russia’s desire to dismantle the Ukrainian state,” he said. It’s in part this behavior that has given the Trump Administration an opening to market U.S. energy products overseas, arguing that U.S. companies are better trading partners than Russian ones. Liquified natural gas has been the most significant focus of this push. In recent years, U.S. natural gas production has reached record levels — some 92.8 billion cubic feet per day in August, enough to power the U.S. and then some — as a fracking boom opened up vast new areas to oil and gas drilling.",How a Ukrainian Gas Company Wound Up in the Middle of Trump's Impeachment Drama,"October 8, 2019"

Police said in an August statement that Dunn’s motorbike was hit head-on by a Volvo after exiting the Royal Air Force Croughton air station in Northamptonshire, England, around 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 27. The suspect was driving on the wrong side of the road, Northamptonshire police said.  Dunn died later at the nearby John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, police said. Nick Adderley, Chief Constable for Northamptonshire Police, tweeted Sunday that as the wife of a U.S. diplomat, the suspect is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Adderley added he and Steven Mold,  Northamptonshire Police Fire and Crime Commissioner have written “in the strongest terms” to the U.S. Embassy to urge them to waive immunity “in order to allow the justice process to take place.”",Diplomat's Wife Suspected in Fatal U.K. Car Crash Returned to the U.S. After Telling Authorities She Would Stay.

166,David French,"Late Sunday night, the Trump administration announced that it was pulling American troops from key positions near the Syria-Turkey border and explicitly permitting the Turkish government to conduct military operations against the Kurdish allies who were indispensable in defeating the ISIS caliphate. This decision represents not just a moral betrayal of men and women who fought and bled by our side in the battle against the world’s most powerful jihadist army, it represents a strategic blunder that is likely to cost American lives for years to come. To understand the reason for the additional strategic risk, one has to understand the nature of the successful American military operation against ISIS. Unlike American offensives during much of the Iraq War — when hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of American troops would conduct complex and costly urban military operations with minimal effective help from Iraqi allies — during the fight against ISIS, our allies have largely born the burden of ground combat. Yes, they’ve enjoyed the indispensable support of American artillery and air power, and small groups of American soldiers have rendered aid and engaged in direct combat as well, but our allies have been going house-to-house and have paid a terrible price. By some estimates, as many as 11,000 Kurds have lost their lives in the fight against ISIS — a staggering death toll borne by a relatively small population. The result — from an American perspective — has been one of the most successful military operations in a generation. The ISIS caliphate, which once dominated a nation-state sized region covering much of northern Syria and northern Iraq, is now in ruins. ISIS isn’t entirely defeated, but it’s a shadow of its former strength. And the cost in American lives has been a small fraction of the cost incurred in even a single battle of the Iraq War. For example, America suffered almost 700 casualties (82 killed) during the Second Battle of Fallujah. The nation has suffered far fewer casualties during the entire fight against ISIS, stretching from June 2014 until the present day. But if the allied bargain with America is that our local allies bleed and then we abandon them to death and military catastrophe when we weary of the alliance, who will ally with us again? Moreover, as we know from recent history, terrorists often thrive not just in chaos but especially in the power vacuums created by unwise American withdrawals. Thus, the Trump administration is creating the worst possible dynamic — it’s undercutting allies at the very same time that it’s creating conditions that may require us to ask for their help again. Indeed, to understand the true magnitude of the betrayal, there are now multiple reports that the Trump administration — in an effort to de-escalate tensions between the Turks and the Kurds — had previously asked our Kurdish allies to dismantle defensive fortifications along the border, rendering them more vulnerable to Turkish invasion. Now our allies will have to reallocate forces, rebuild fortifications, and — in many cases — leave the field in the ongoing fight against ISIS remnants. In a string of tweets, President Trump sought to justify his decision by declaring that he had been elected to extricate America from “ridiculous, endless wars,” but Trump’s withdrawal does not end the war. It grants our enemies a much-needed respite. ISIS has never ended its fight against America. It’s been weakened, and in some areas it has been routed, but it has not asked for peace. It does not seek peace. By potentially further destabilizing northern Iraq, Trump not only puts our Kurdish allies at profound risk, he also creates conditions that could lead to a total loss of allied control over the tens of thousands of ISIS detainees held by the Kurds. In his statement, Trump announced that Turkey would be “responsible” for “all ISIS fighters captured in the area over the past two years.” This is a fantasy. The far more likely outcome is that ISIS fighters and ISIS operatives will assume increasing control over the relevant facilities, and there will be a likely loss of containment. It is absolutely true that the United States faces a formidable challenge in Syria. ISIS has not been entirely defeated, there is a long-running simmering conflict between Turkey and Kurdish forces, and there is still no final peace settlement in the Syrian civil war. Resolving those challenges requires a combination of military resolve and deft diplomacy. There are no easy answers.",Trump's Retreat in Syria Is Dishonorable and Will Cost American Lives,"October 7, 2019"
167,GEIR MOULSON / AP,"(BERLIN) — Activists with the Extinction Rebellion movement blocked roads and staged demonstrations in big cities around the globe Monday, part of a wide-ranging series of protests demanding much more urgent action against climate change. Demonstrators stopped traffic in European cities including Berlin, London, Paris and Amsterdam. In New York, activists smeared themselves — and emblems of Wall Street — in fake blood and lay in the street. In some cities, activists chained themselves to vehicles or pitched tent camps and vowed not to budge. “You might come from a variety of different groups, but we all stand against a system that’s destroying the planet and mankind, and we’re looking to change that because we can’t just have little changes, we want a real big change,” said Pierrick Jalby, a 28-year-old nurse from eastern France who joined the demonstration in Paris. “We don’t want reforms, in fact, we want a revolution.” Members of Extinction Rebellion, a loose-knit movement also known as XR that started last year in Britain, have staged a series of flashy protests this year to demand action on manmade climate change, often featuring marchers in white masks and red costumes and copious amounts of fake blood. In Berlin on Monday, around 1,000 people blocked the Grosser Stern, a traffic circle in the middle of the German capital’s Tiergarten park dominated by the landmark Victory Column. That protest began before dawn. Another 300 people blocked Berlin’s central Potsdamer Platz, placing couches, tables, chairs and flowerpots on the road. Over the weekend, demonstrators had set up a tent camp outside German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office to prepare for the protests, reflecting dissatisfaction with a climate policy package drawn up last month by her government. Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, criticized the group’s tactics.","Extinction Rebellion Climate Activists Block Roads, Stage Protests Worldwide","October 7, 2019"
168,YANAN WANG / AP,"(BEIJING) — The NBA put out one statement reacting to Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s tweet in support of the Hong Kong protest movement. Depending on which language it was read in, the league’s words had very different meaning. A politically charged disagreement over Morey’s tweet that showed support for Hong Kong anti-government protesters got an additional wrinkle when the NBA posted a statement Monday on Weibo — a Twitter-like microblogging site used in China — saying the league was “extremely disappointed” by what it called an “inappropriate” comment. The same post said the NBA’s stance was that Morey’s view “severely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.” Thing is, the league never actually said those words. NBA spokesman Mike Bass’ statement, which had only one version and was delivered in English, began like this: “We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.” It continued, but never said “extremely disappointed,” ”inappropriate” or “severely hurt the feelings” of anyone. “There should be no discrepancy on the statement issued last night,” Bass said Monday. “We have seen various interpretations of the translation of the Mandarin version, but our statement in English is the league’s official statement.” The “hurt feelings” phrase is commonly used by Chinese authorities to describe perceived gaffes by foreign parties. Similar phrasing was used by Mercedes-Benz in February 2018 when it had to apologize for quoting the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, in a social media post. The auto company apologized for “wrong information” that “hurt the feelings of Chinese people.”",NBA Statement About Hong Kong Tweet Translated Differently on Its Chinese Social Media Account,"Updated: October 7, 2019 11:48 PM ET"
169,MARI YAMAGUCHI / AP,"(TOKYO) — Japanese authorities said they rescued all of about 60 North Korean fishermen whose boat collided with a Japanese patrol vessel and sank Monday in an area crowded with poachers. Coast guard officials earlier said that only about 20 North Korean crewmembers were thrown into the sea after their steel boat collided with a Japanese Fisheries Agency inspection boat in Japan’s exclusive economic zone off the country’s northern coast. Officials later said they rescued far more than first thought. No one was missing. The North Korean boat sank about half an hour after the collision in the Yamatotai area, known as rich grounds for squid fishing northwest of the Noto Peninsula. The North Korean boat had made an unauthorized entry into Japan’s exclusive economic zone and the collision occurred just as the Japanese patrol boat was warning it to move out, Fisheries Agency official Satoshi Kuwahara told reporters. He said officials were investigating whether the North Korean ship was actually conducting illegal fishing, and how the two ships collided. Agricultural, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Taku Eto said the North Korean boat suddenly changed course before crashing into the Japanese ship and sinking, Kyodo News agency reported. The coast guard’s regional office in Niigata said officials handed the fishermen to another North Korean boat in the area after notifying The North’s rescue coordination center to arrange their way home. It said the North Korean crewmembers had no life-threatening conditions. Fisheries Agency officials said the Japanese patrol ship had no major damage and was able to move on its own. Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic ties. The two countries also have disputes over Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, as well as North Korea’s nuclear and missile development and the North’s abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s.",Japan Rescues North Korean Fishermen After Boat Collision,"October 7, 2019"
170,Rachael Bunyan,"Bill Gates told an audience at the University of Cambridge on Monday that global malnutrition will be solved and malaria will be virtually eliminated by 2040 if world leaders choose to fund scientific innovation.  Speaking at the Cambridge Union in England, the Microsoft co-founder said: “I’m lucky that my work gives me a view of all the amazing discoveries in the works right now. That’s why I’m able to predict the future.” Gates was named the 2019 recipient of the Professor Hawking Fellowship, founded by the Cambridge Union Society in 2017 in honor of Stephen Hawking’s contribution to the university. Quoting a question Stephen Hawking asked in his final book, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Gates asked the audience, “How do we shape the future?” The billionaire philanthropist is trying to shape the future by tackling global health issues and inequality at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. On Monday, he predicted scientists will solve malnutrition and significantly reduce the number of nutrition-related deaths globally in the next 20 years. “By solving malnutrition, we can fix one of the biggest contributors to inequity,” he said. Malnutrition contributes to about half of deaths in children under the age of five, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).  Gates points to how scientists have developed solutions in recent years, including fortified foods or supplements packed with vitamins and minerals, vaccines and medicines for infections, as well as improving maternal health. But he said another key component to solving malnutrition is understanding the role bacteria plays. In a healthy body, “good bacteria” protects us from infection and is essential for digestion — if your body’s bacteria is not up to scratch, it can lead to severe cases of malnutrition, Gates added.",Bill Gates Makes Hopeful Predictions for Global Health,"October 7, 2019"

172,"ZEKE MILLER, LOLITA C. BALDOR and JILL COLVIN / AP","(WASHINGTON) — President Donald Trump’s sudden decision to pull back U.S. troops from northern Syria drew quick criticism Monday from some of his closest allies in Congress, as well as Kurdish fighters who would essentially be abandoned to face a likely Turkish assault after fighting alongside American forces against the Islamic State. The announcement threw the military situation in Syria into fresh chaos and injected deeper uncertainty into U.S. relations with European allies. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called it “a disaster,” while Syria’s Kurds accused the U.S. of turning its back on allies and risking gains made in the years-long fight against ISIS. Trump defended the move in a series of tweets, acknowledging that “the Kurds fought with us,” but adding that they “were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.” “I held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,” he wrote, adding, in all capital letters, that “We will fight where it is to our benefit, and only fight to win.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened for months to launch a military operation across the Syrian border. He views the Kurdish forces as a threat to his country. Both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. have warned that allowing the Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds and send a troubling message to American allies across the globe. U.S. troops “will not support or be involved in the operation” and “will no longer be in the immediate area,” in northern Syria, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in an unusual late-Sunday statement that was silent on the fate of the Kurds. There are about 1,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria, and a senior U.S. official said they will pull back from the area — and potentially depart the country entirely should widespread fighting break out between Turkish and Kurdish forces. A U.S. official confirmed that American troops were already moving out of the security zone area, which includes the Syrian towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad. That official was not authorized to speak for the record and was granted anonymity to comment. Trump’s move appeared to take even his closest allies by surprise during a pivotal moment of his presidency.

173,Rachael Bunyan,"This Friday, the Nobel committee in Oslo, Norway will announce the winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. The prize is awarded annually to the person or organization that has done the most to promote world peace. Last year, Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and human rights activist Nadia Murad jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. There are 301 nominees for this year’s prize, out of which 223 are individuals and 78 are organizations, according to the Nobel Institute. The official list of nominations remains a secret, but that hasn’t stopped a lot of speculation about who is in the running. Here is a selection of oddsmakers’ favorites for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize — with the caveat that the Nobel committee is rarely predictable in its choice of winner: Greta Thunberg is the clear favorite to win the Nobel Peace Prize this year, according to oddsmakers. Thunberg, who featured on a recent cover of TIME magazine, has become famous for her speeches and protests over climate inaction. At 15 years old, she began her school strike outside the Swedish Parliament in August 2018. Little more than a year later, an estimated four million people joined the teenager in a global strike on Sept. 20 — with activists, many of them schoolchildren, joining the protests from Thailand to Afghanistan to Haiti. A few days later, Thunberg gave an emotionally-charged speech at the Climate Action Summit on Sept. 23, where she condemned world leaders for their lack of action in halting climate change. Despite her achievements, conservatives have criticized Thunberg and suggested that her win would be controversial. Some see her courage and drive to hold world leaders to account as confrontational, divisive and unhelpful. “The problem is that the principle of ‘flight shame’ brings her chances… down. Shame is not a constructive feeling to bring about change,” Sverre Lodgaard, a deputy member of the Nobel award committee from 2003 to 2011 told Reuters. Even so, Thunberg remains the favorite to win. If she does, she would become the youngest person ever to be awarded a Nobel Prize — a title currently held by Malala Yousafzai, who won the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize aged 17. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed made headlines in 2018 after instigating the end of 20 years of conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. War between the two countries began over border disputes in 1998, five years after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia. At least 70,000 people were killed before the two sides signed a peace deal in December 2000 — but tensions have remained high as Ethiopia refused to accept the border.",Here Are the Favorites to Win the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize,"October 7, 2019"
174,Derek Wallbank and Alfred Cang / Bloomberg,"The NBA finds itself caught between two cultures after a tweet about Hong Kong protests sparked criticism from China that threatens the U.S. basketball league’s expansion efforts in its most important international market. The controversy erupted after Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, one of the most popular U.S. basketball teams in China, appeared to support Hong Kong demonstrators in a tweet late Friday. While the message was deleted and both Morey and the National Basketball Association tried to distance themselves from it, the damage reverberated across both China and the U.S. For the Chinese, the incident is seen as the latest example of a Western organization challenging the nation’s sovereignty over its territory. In the U.S., meanwhile, the NBA’s response was met with scorching bipartisan criticism from politicians including Senator Ted Cruz. The situation puts the league at risk of either offending fans in its biggest international market, or exposing itself to charges of kowtowing to China at the expense of American values. “Chinese Rockets fans are first Chinese. We love Chinese red more than Rockets red,” Kang Hui, an anchor for CCTV News Channel, said in a video on an official CCTV Weibo account. “Morey, this time you really fouled. If you foul, you have to pay the price.” At stake is a business that has been notching double-digit growth in China every year since 2008. The league has achieved the kind of success there that other international sports leagues covet. About 800 million Chinese watch NBA programming on TV, digital media or smartphones in a season, with top games attracting more viewers than in the U.S. The NBA has a host of licensing and retail deals in China, including a $500 million pact with Tencent Holdings Ltd. and a 30-plus-years partnership with state-run broadcaster CCTV. Tencent has seen Internet viewership of NBA games nearly triple over the past four years. The fallout was swift following Morey’s tweet, which contained an image that read “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” Chinese sportswear maker Li Ning Co. and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center suspended cooperation with the Rockets, while CCTV and Tencent said they will halt broadcasting the team’s games.

175,Alex Fitzpatrick,"The 2019 Nobel Prize announcements are underway this week, with the first prize, in the category of physiology or medicine, going to a trio of scientists for their work on cells’ ability to sense and react to oxygen availability. The Nobel Prize in physics, chemistry and literature have been announced and the prizes in peace and economic sciences will follow over the next few days. The awards are a recognition of work that advances each of the respective fields. Nobel winners are given a medal, a certificate and a cash award of about $900,000 (when multiple people win a single Nobel, they typically split the cash award.) Here are the 2019 Nobel Prize winners (so far): William G. Kaelin Jr., Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza won the 2019 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. The trio “identified molecular machinery that regulates the activity of genes in response to varying levels of oxygen,” according to The Nobel Assembly. Their work, says the Assembly, has “paved the way for promising new strategies to fight anemia, cancer and many other diseases.” James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz won the 2019 Nobel Prize in physics. Peebles, of Princeton University, received half of the award, per the Nobel Assembly, for work focused on “theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology,” while Mayor and Queloz, of the University of Geneva (and, for Queloz, Cambridge University) shared half the award “for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star.” “This year’s Laureates have transformed our ideas about the cosmos,” the Assembly wrote in a release accompanying the Prize’s announcement. “While James Peebles’ theoretical discoveries contributed to our understanding of how the universe evolved after the Big Bang, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz explored our cosmic neighborhoods on the hunt for unknown planets. Their discoveries have forever changed our conceptions of the world.” John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino won the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry. The three scientists have all worked to develop and advance lithium-ion batteries, now-ubiquitous technology which the Nobel Assembly said has “laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society.” Austrian novelist and playwright Peter Handke won the 2019 Nobel Prize in literature “for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience,” according to the Nobel Assembly. Polish author Olga Tokarczuk won the 2018 Nobel Prize in literature “for a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life,” the Assembly said.

176,AMY GUNIA / MACAU,"Huge screens live-streamed Beijing’s grandiose military parade, and colorful fireworks flashed above the city’s glitzy casinos, as Macau commemorated China’s National Day on Oct. 1. Not everyone, however, was in the mood to celebrate. Jason Chao—one of Macau’s most outspoken democracy and human rights activists—had spent weeks applying to hold a peaceful protest in his hometown. Authorities denied his initial application in September, and late on the eve of the Oct. 1 holiday—the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China—he found out that authorities had shot down his appeal. Chao had planned to gather 15 people to carry placards and posters opposing alleged police brutality in Hong Kong, China’s other Special Administrative Region (SAR) as the two semi-autonomous enclaves are called. In Hong Kong—where protests against a controversial piece of legislation have escalated into an anti-communist rebellion—it was tear gas and Molotov cocktails lighting up the sky on National Day, instead of the usual annual fireworks display, as protesters came out in full force to repudiate Beijing’s control over the territory. But Macau officials denied Chao’s appeal, saying the rally would interfere in Hong Kong affairs. As unrest grips Hong Kong, authorities in Macau are cracking down on any show of solidarity by Macau residents for their Hong Kong neighbors, who live just an hour’s ferry ride away across the Pearl River Delta. On Oct. 1, two people were questioned for sticking posters on a wall. Photos circulating on social media showed signs that read: “Support each other, Hong Kong and Macau.” In August, authorities detained four students who set up a so-called Lennon Wall—murals of colorful Post-it notes bearing handwritten pro-democracy slogans that are a common sight in Hong Kong. The same month, police banned a demonstration in support of Hong Kong’s anti-government protesters and detained seven people. And earlier this month Macau’s Secretary for Security said an event where two students held signs or banners supporting Hongkongers could be treated as an illegal gathering. Chao thinks that the turmoil in Hong Kong is putting Macau’s government under pressure. “They want to present Macau as the perfect embodiment of ‘one country, two systems,'” he tells TIME, referring to the political formula by which China administers its SARs. “It’s utterly unconvincing.” Some say officials are going too far. “Macau police and courts have been illegally repressive of freedom of assembly and of freedom of expression,” Jorge Menezes, a prominent lawyer in Macau, tells TIME. Experts say that political activity by Macau’s youth has been on the uptick for several years, not just the last few months. “Youth activism in Macau has been challenging the local as well as mainland authorities,” Eilo Yu, associate head and associate professor of government and public administration at the University of Macau, tells TIME. That may explain why Chinese President Xi Jinping mentioned Macau, alongside Hong Kong and Taiwan, as major risks and challenges for the Chinese Communist Party while speaking to officials in early September. “Cadres must be vigilant to any wind of change. They must know a deer passing by the rustle of grass and leaves, they must know the coming of a tiger by feeling the wind, they must know the arrival of autumn by the color of one leaf,” Xi said, according to the South China Morning Post.",Will Hong Kong's Democracy Protests Spread to Its Close Neighbor Macau?,"October 7, 2019"

The Syrian Kurdish fighters also accused Washington of failing to abide by its commitments to its key allies in the fight against IS. It’s a major shift in U.S. policy. The American withdrawal came just hours after the White House said U.S. forces in northeastern Syria will move aside and clear the way for an expected Turkish assault — essentially abandoning Kurdish fighters who fought alongside American forces in the yearslong battle to defeat the Islamic State group. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened for months to launch the military operation across the border. He views the Syria Kurdish forces as a threat to his country as Ankara has struggled with a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.

Opposition leaders and thousands of supporters are demanding the resignation of President Jovenel Moïse amid anger over government corruption, ballooning inflation and scarcity of fuel and other basic goods. Seventeen people have been reported killed and nearly 200 injured in the protests. The political turmoil is hitting cities and towns outside the capital of Port-au-Prince especially hard, forcing non-government organizations to suspend aid as barricades of large rocks and burning tires cut off the flow of goods between the city and the countryside.

On Sept. 16, the World Food Programme was forced to suspend all food deliveries to schools as demonstrations started. Meanwhile, cash transfers to some 37,000 people in need were postponed.

There are no package holidays here or even a reliable ferry service to the mainland. Island authorities hope to achieve UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status. Yet still, the natural environment is under threat from an insatiable assailant. Goats outnumber human inhabitants 15-fold and they are munching stretches of Samothraki into a moonscape. After decades of trying to find a solution, experts and locals are working together to find a 21st-century way to save the island’s ecology and economy. Semi-wild, the goats roam across the island, which is roughly three times the size of Manhattan, and can be spotted on rooftops, in trees or on top of cars as they scour the landscape for anything to eat. Their unchecked overgrazing is causing crisis-level erosion. Torrential rains two years ago swept away the island’s town hall and severed its roads. There were no trees or vegetation left on the steep, goat-eaten hillsides to stop the mudslides caused by the downpour. “There are no big trees to hold the soil. And it’s a big problem, both financial and real because (the mud) will come down on our heads,” says George Maskalidis, who helps run Sustainable Samothraki Association, an environmental group. Samothraki, in the northern Aegean Sea, is a two-hour ferry ride south of Alexandroupoli, a Greek city near the country’s border with Turkey. With just 3,000 inhabitants and hard to access, the island has largely missed out on Greece’s tourism boom.

Iraq’s government has scrambled to contain the popular anger that has racked Baghdad and a number of southern cities since Tuesday. Security forces responded with a crackdown on the spontaneous rallies of demonstrators demanding jobs, better services and an end to endemic corruption in the oil-rich country. In the first official statement from the government accounting for the violence, Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan said Sunday that 104 people had been killed in the six days of unrest, including eight members of the security forces, and more than 6,000 wounded. He said an investigation was under way to determine who was behind the most deadly day of violence, in Baghdad on Friday. The unrest is the most serious challenge facing Iraq two years after the victory against Islamic State militants. The chaos also comes at a critical time for the government, which has been caught in the middle of increasing U.S.-Iran tensions in the region. Iraq is allied with both countries and hosts thousands of U.S. troops, as well as powerful paramilitary forces allied with Iran. Iraq’s most senior Shiite spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has urged the protesters and the security forces to end the violence while the country’s prime minister has called on the protesters to go home. Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi also pledged to meet with the protesters wherever they are and without any armed forces, to hear their demands. Abdul-Mahdi defended the security forces, saying they were carrying out their duties and would only use force in extreme cases of self-defense. “We can’t accept the continuation of the situation like this,” Abdul-Mahdi told his Cabinet late Saturday in televised remarks. “We hear of snipers, firebombs, burning a policeman, a citizen.” Speaking on Sunday, Maan, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said protesters have burned 51 public buildings and eight political party headquarters. He claimed security forces didn’t confront the protesters, adding that “malicious hands” were behind targeting protesters and security members alike.",Over 100 Dead and Thousands Wounded in Iraq as Unrest Continues,"October 6, 2019"
181,Associated Press,"(LONDON) — British Prime Minister has renewed his vow to take the country out of the European Union by the Brexit deadline. Boris Johnson, writing in The Sun on Sunday and Sunday Express newspapers, is contradicting a government pledge in court to ask for an extension if no withdrawal deal with the EU is reached. He said “we will be packing our bags and walking out on” Oct. 31. He added: “The only question is whether Brussels cheerily waves us off with a mutually agreeable deal or whether we will be forced to head off on our own.” A U.K. government document quoted in a Scottish court Friday indicated Johnson intends to comply with a law requiring him to ask for a delay if there’s no deal in place by Oct. 19.

The Foreign Ministry said the U.S. charge d’affaires was summoned on Sunday despite an embassy statement that said its Twitter account had liked “an unrelated post in error,” and apologized. Many interpreted the tweet as suggesting that the nationalist leader Devlet Bahceli could soon die. The tweet was posted by a journalist Turkey accuses of belonging to a network led by a cleric who is blamed for a 2016 coup attempt.

183,HYUNG-JIN KIM / AP,"(SEOUL, South Korea) — North Korea said Sunday that it won’t meet again with the United States unless it abandons its “hostile policy” against the North, as the two countries offered different takes on their weekend nuclear negotiations in Sweden. After their first talks in more than seven months in Stockholm on Saturday, the chief North Korean nuclear negotiator said the talks broke down “entirely because the U.S. has not discarded its old stance and attitude” and came to the negotiating table with an “empty hand.” But the U.S. said the two sides had “good discussions” that it intends to build on in two weeks. On Sunday night, the North’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement accusing the U.S. of trying to mislead public opinion and “spreading a completely ungrounded story that both sides are open to meet” again. The statement said the Stockholm talks “made us think they have no political will to improve (North Korea)-U.S. relations and may be abusing the bilateral relations for their own partisan interests” at home. It said North Korea isn’t willing to hold “such sickening negotiations” as those in Stockholm until the U.S. takes “a substantial step to make complete and irreversible withdrawal of the hostile policy toward” the North. It said the U.S. policy “threatens the security” of North Korea and “hampers the rights to existence and development of its people.” North Korea has said it has no other option but to develop nuclear weapons to cope with what it calls a U.S. plot to invade the country. The North has also said rounds of U.S.-led sanctions imposed over its nuclear and missile programs are stifling its economy.

184,TIME Staff,"Anti-communist crowds marched through Hong Kong Sunday to decry the government’s emergency powers and press their demands for political freedom. Many wore masks in open defiance of a government ban on facial coverings meant as a deterrent to protesters, whose four-month-old democratic rebellion has thrown the semi-autonomous enclave into crisis and caused consternation among China’s top leadership. Territory-wide SMS alerts from the police force urged the public to “stay alert” and “avoid going out” as protesters assembled from lunchtime in the retail and entertainment district of Causeway Bay. Chanting “Hongkongers resist!” they set off in the direction of the city center and the main government offices. The legislature was evacuated as retailers brought down their shutters. Mainland Chinese businesses were vandalized, and a branch of Starbucks ransacked. Protesters hurled petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets and made scores of arrests. Fires were also lit outside the Sogo department store—a prominent Hong Kong landmark. Live news streams also showed angry crowds gathering in the tourist district on the Kowloon peninsula. Shouting “Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!” and singing “Glory to Hong Kong”—the song that many are calling Hong Kong’s “national anthem”—they headed up the tourist strip of Nathan Road. A small number continued on to the northern district of Kowloon Tong. They erected barricades across Waterloo Road—a major thoroughfare through the affluent suburb that was home to martial arts icon Bruce Lee and which has so far not been affected by the protests. RTHK, Hong Kong’s government-funded broadcaster, reported that helmeted personnel unfurled a warning flag at protesters from inside the barracks of China’s People’s Liberation Army in Kowloon Tong. The personnel also trained spotlights on the crowd. It is thought to be the first time that Chinese troops garrisoned in Hong Kong have “engaged with protesters” during the unrest, RTHK said. “The government is doing everything it can to restrict our freedom of assembly because it wants to end the protests,” said a protester named Eva, 50, when asked about the mask ban. “I don’t think it will end unless the army marches in,” she told TIME. Marching alongside, her husband, 67, said that while he did not agree with violence “The youngsters feel they have no choice … the government made them.” In the late afternoon, live news broadcasts showed protesters erecting barricades and besieging a large police station in central Kowloon. Police on the parapets fired rubber bullets to drive the crowd back. Mong Kok station, a major transport interchange, was flooded, and facilities were damaged at other subway stations. Fires were lit in the premises of mainland Chinese businesses and the offices of pro-Beijing legislators trashed. As night fell, police set up road blocks and began taking mostly young passengers off buses for searching and questioning, causing a major tailback. RTHK also spoke to students from the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) and Chinese University, who said that police had attempted to enter the campuses without authorization. “People living in HKBU halls are all on edge now, as there are rumors that police are coming to halls to arrest people,” one journalist tweeted. “They are telling one another to lock their doors.”",Hong Kong Plunges Deeper into Crisis as Protests Break Out for the Third Consecutive Day,"Updated: October 6, 2019 9:35 AM ET"
185,Kathy Gannon / AP,"(KABUL, Afghanistan) — The Taliban met with a U.S. envoy in the Pakistani capital, a Taliban official said Saturday, the first such encounter since President Donald Trump announced a month ago that a seemingly imminent peace deal to end Afghanistan’s 18-year war was dead. The official offered few details of Friday’s meeting between peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the movement that was ousted in 2001 by the U.S.-led coalition. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. U.S. officials have been keen to say peace talks haven’t resumed, at least not now in Islamabad. Still, the meeting is noteworthy as the United States seeks an exit from what has become its longest military engagement. More than 14,000 U.S. troops are still in Afghanistan and Trump has repeatedly expressed his frustration with their continued deployment, complaining they have taken on the duties of policing the country, a job he said the Afghan government needed to do. Khalilzad has been in Islamabad for much of the week meeting with senior government officials in what the U.S. State Department described as follow-up meetings to those he held in New York during last month’s U.N. General Assembly session. At the time, he met Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been calling for a resumption of peace talks. The Taliban delegation led by Mullah Baradar __one of its more powerful members __ arrived separately in the Pakistani capital for meetings with government officials that they said were being held to discuss a wide range of political issues relating to the more than 1.5 million Afghans still living as refugees in Pakistan. Baradar was arrested in Pakistan in 2010 in a joint Pakistani-CIA operation after he secretly opened peace talks with then-Afghan President Hamid Karzai, a move that attempted to sideline Pakistan and went against U.S. policy, which did not support talks with the Taliban. In 2018, Baradar was released from jail to facilitate peace talks after Khalilzad was appointed U.S. peace envoy. During the past year, Khalilzad held nine rounds of talks with the Taliban in the Middle eastern State of Qatar, where the insurgents maintain a political office. In early September a deal seemed imminent, but a fresh round of violence and the death of a U.S. soldier caused Trump to suddenly tweet an end to talks and cancel an agreement-signing ceremony that had been planned for Camp David and about which few had been aware.",Taliban Meets U.S. Peace Envoy for First Time Since Canceled Camp David Visit,"October 5, 2019"
186,QASSIM ABDUL-ZAHRA / AP,"(BAGHDAD) — Iraqi protesters pressed on with angry anti-government rallies in the capital and across several provinces for a fifth day Saturday, setting government offices on fire and ignoring appeals for calm from political and religious leaders. Security agencies fatally shot 19 protesters and wounded more than three dozen in a sustained deadly response that has claimed more than 80 lives since the upheaval began. The semiofficial Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights, affiliated with the parliament, put the death toll at 94. It said nearly 4,000 people have been wounded since Tuesday, when mostly young demonstrators spontaneously initiated the rallies to demand jobs, improvements to electricity, water and other services, and an end to corruption in the oil-rich nation. The violent deadlock presented the conflict-scarred nation with its most serious challenge since the defeat of the Islamic State group two years ago and deepened the political crisis of a country still struggling with the legacy of multiple, unfinished wars since the U.S. invasion in 2003. “It has been 16 years of corruption and injustice,” said Abbas Najm, a 43-year-old unemployed engineer who was part of a rally Saturday in the square. “We are not afraid of bullets or the death of martyrs. We will keep going and we won’t back down.” Scrambling to contain the demonstrations, Iraqi leaders called an emergency session of parliament Saturday to discuss the protesters’ demands. But they lacked a quorum due to a boycott called by influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, leader of parliament’s largest bloc. On Friday, al-Sadr called on Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi’s government to resign and hold early elections, saying the shedding of blood of Iraqis “cannot be ignored.” Abdul-Mahdi said in an address to the nation that the protesters’ “legitimate demands” had been heard, but he defended the deadly response of security forces as a “bitter medicine” that was necessary for the country to swallow. In a desperate attempt to curb the growing rallies, authorities blocked the internet Wednesday and imposed a round-the-clock curfew on Thursday. The curfew, ignored by protesters, was lifted at 5 a.m. Saturday, allowing shops to open and traffic to flow in most of Baghdad before the new demonstrations began. As in previous days, protesters waited to gather until the afternoon, when temperatures were cooler and ensured greater participation, and security forces responded by opening fire.",Iraqi Security Forces Kill 19 and Injure Dozens in New Protests,"Updated: October 5, 2019 4:09 PM ET"
187,Kelvin Chan / AP,"(LONDON) — Prince Harry is suing The Sun and the Daily Mirror, two of Britain’s most popular tabloid newspapers, over alleged phone hacking. Buckingham Palace confirmed Saturday that claims regarding “illegal interception of voicemail messages” were filed on Harry’s behalf. The palace declined to say more or provide details “given the particulars of the claims are not yet public.” News Group Newspapers, which owns The Sun and the now defunct News of the World, acknowledged the prince’s High Court action while Reach, which owns the Mirror, said it was “aware that proceedings have been issued” but hasn’t yet received notice of them. The cases escalate Harry’s fight with the British tabloids. It comes days after his American wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, sued the Mail on Sunday for alleged copyright infringement, misuse of private information and violating the U.K.’s data protection law after the paper published a letter she wrote to her father. Harry then lambasted British tabloids after Meghan filed her lawsuit on Tuesday, saying in a statement that his wife’s lawsuit, which was months in the making, was a response to a “ruthless campaign” to smear her by creating “lie after lie at her expense” during her maternity leave. The prince accused the British media of hounding Meghan the way it did his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash while trying to elude paparazzi. British tabloid newspapers have paid millions of dollars to settle claims that their employees had hacked the phone voicemails of celebrities, politicians and others in the public eye. The prince’s lawsuits likely date back years. The News of the World was shut down in 2011, at the height of the hacking scandal and when its former editors later went on trial, a court heard evidence that indicated Harry along with his old brother, Prince William, were targets of the paper’s illicit interception of phone messages.",Prince Harry to Sue 2 U.K. Tabloids Over Alleged Phone Hacking,"October 5, 2019"
188,JOHN LEICESTER and EILEEN NG / AP,"(HONG KONG) — With subway services shut down, the wearing of face masks criminalized at rallies and Hong Kong’s leader reaffirming her determination not to let rioters get the upper hand, anti-government protests that have shaken the city diminished in intensity Saturday but didn’t stop. Marchers still came out to defy the new ban on face coverings that the government of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory says have made the identification of violent protesters difficult for police. Shielded under umbrellas, many wearing masks, several hundred demonstrators clogged a thoroughfare in the central business district, carrying a yellow banner marked “Glory to Hong Kong” and shouting, “Hong Kong, resist!” Scattered gatherings of protesters in masks popped up elsewhere, too, with some holding hands in a human chain. But protester numbers Saturday afternoon appeared down from previous weekends when tens of thousands flooded the streets. A combination of factors seemed to be at work. Some marchers said the protest movement that has plunged Hong Kong into its deepest crisis since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 was merely harboring strength for the long haul. The closure of the entire MTR network of subway and trains that habitually handles more than 4 million trips a day also caused major disruption to the usually never-resting but now edgy and restive city of 7.5 million people. An express link to Hong Kong international airport also closed for a while before reopening with reduced service Saturday afternoon. “From MTR to EmptyR,” tweeted activist Joshua Wong, a key player in 2014 protests that foreshadowed the past four months of demonstrations that have snowballed into a sustained flare of anti-government and anti-China fury. “Can’t go anywhere,” said Kevin Cui, a tourist from mainland China who’d planned to visit Hong Kong Disneyland only to discover at a shuttered subway station that the network was suspended. “This is very troublesome.” Following up on its face-mask ban that went into effect at midnight Friday, the government also hammered home a get-tough message that it would not bow to rioters and appealed for public support after an overnight rash of widespread violence, including arson attacks. Citizens awoke Saturday not only to closed subway stations but also shuttered shops and banks, where lines formed at cash machines.",Hong Kong 'Semi-Paralyzed' as Marches Continue,"October 5, 2019"
189,JARI TANNER and MATTHEW LEE / AP,"(HELSINKI) — North Korea’s chief negotiator said Saturday that discussions with the U.S. on Pyongyang’s nuclear program have broken down, but Washington said the two sides had “good discussions” that it intends to build on in two weeks. The North Korean negotiator, Kim Miyong Gil, said the talks in Stockholm had “not fulfilled our expectations and broke down. I am very displeased about it.” Speaking outside the North Korean Embassy, he read a statement in Korean that a translator next to him read in English. Kim said negotiations broke down “entirely because the U.S. has not discarded its old stance and attitude.” Saturday’s talks were the first between the U.S. and North Korea since the February breakdown of the second summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. North Korea has since resumed missile tests, including an underwater-launched missile that fell inside Japan’s exclusive economic zone Wednesday. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said Kim’s comments did “not reflect the content or the spirit” of the “good discussions” that took place over eight-and-a-half hours, adding that the U.S. accepted an invitation from Sweden to return to Stockholm in two weeks to continue discussions. In a statement, Ortagus said the U.S. delegation “previewed a number of new initiatives that would allow us to make progress in each of the four pillars” of a joint statement issued after Trump and Kim’s first summit in Singapore. “The United States and the DPRK will not overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula through the course of a single Saturday,” Ortagus said",North Korea Says Nuclear Talks Break Down While U.S. Says They Were 'Good',"Updated: October 5, 2019 5:10 PM ET"
190,TIME Staff,"The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said Saturday that the extent of violence during Hong Kong’s four months of anti-government unrest warrants an independent probe. Reuters reported that Bachelet called on Hong Kong authorities to launch an “effective, prompt, independent and impartial investigation” into the handling of the protests, which to date have led to more than 1,100 injuries, 31 of them sustained overnight. Bachelet’s remarks came as Hong Kong entered a second day of protest against a ban on the wearing of facial coverings—an emergency measure to curb the unrest that has met with a disastrous reception. On Saturday afternoon, hundreds began marching through downtown Hong Kong chanting “Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!” and “I have the right to wear a mask!” Marchers occupied major streets and almost all wore facial coverings in defiance of the ban, which applies to all public gatherings and renders violators liable to a year in jail. Along Chater Road, beside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, protesters unfurled massive banners reading “Glory to Hong Kong” and “Murderous Hong Kong Police.” Protests also broke out in three areas of the Kowloon peninsula, and in the northern towns of Sheung Shui, where the storefronts of businesses with mainland Chinese connections were attacked and vandalized, and Yuen Long, where a tense standoff took place with riot police. A clash also took place at the small port of Aberdeen, on the southern side of Hong Kong Island. Of the injuries sustained in Friday’s protests against the anti-mask measure, three were serious. A police officer narrowly escaped a mob that attacked him with a petrol bomb, momentarily set him alight, and attempted to seize his gun. Local media reported that a 14-year-old boy suffered a gunshot wound to the leg—the second teen to be hit with a live round in recent days. He was reportedly charged with rioting and assaulting a police officer. Barring intermittent services to the airport, the entire train network remained suspended today after multiple stations, facilities, and a train were attacked by anti-government protesters. Banks, supermarkets, shopping malls and many stores remain closed after a night of destruction that saw fires lit and shopfronts smashed. Government facilities such as libraries, museums, and performance venues are also shuttered and major streets were deserted.

192,MARCIA DUNN / AP,"(CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.) — The first all-female spacewalk is back on, six months after a suit-sizing flap led to an embarrassing cancellation. NASA announced Friday that the International Space Station’s two women will pair up for a spacewalk later this month. Astronauts Christina Koch and the newly arrived Jessica Meir will venture out Oct. 21 to plug in new, upgraded batteries for the solar power system. It will be the fourth of five spacewalks for battery work. Koch was supposed to do a spacewalk with another female crewmate in March. But NASA had to scrap the plan just a few days in advance because there wasn’t enough time to get a second medium-size spacesuit ready. The second medium was put together on board in June. NASA’s deputy chief astronaut Megan McArthur told reporters the all-female spacewalk will be a milestone. But she noted that women are so integrated at all levels at NASA now that they don’t tend to dwell on gender. “I’m sure that they’ll sit back and reflect on it, as we all will. We will all celebrate that,” McArthur said. Koch and Meir, a marine biologist who arrived at the orbiting lab this week, are both members of NASA’s Astronaut Class of 2013, the first and only one with an even split between men and women. They’re also both making their first spaceflights. Koch, an electrical engineer, is more than 200 days into an approximately 300-day mission, which will set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman. “In the past, women haven’t always been at the table,” Koch said during a televised interview earlier this week. “And it’s wonderful to be contributing to the human spaceflight program at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role, and that can lead, in turn, to increased chance for success.” Since the world’s first spacewalk in 1965, only 14 women have done them, versus 213 men, according to NASA. Expect more women spacewalking together on the horizon, though. “It turns out that over the next couple years, we’re having a lot of medium suit people fly,” said NASA’s space station program manager, Kirk Shireman.","NASA Sets New Date For First All-Female Spacewalk, After Suit-Sizing Fail Derailed a Previous Plan","October 5, 2019"
193,TAMI ABDOLLAH / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — Microsoft said Friday that hackers linked to the Iranian government targeted an undisclosed U.S. presidential campaign, as well as government officials, media targets and prominent expatriate Iranians. Overall, the hackers attempted to penetrate 241 accounts — four successfully — though none of those penetrated was associated with presidential campaigns or current or past U.S. officials, Microsoft said. A company spokeswoman declined to identify those targeted, citing customer privacy. The announcement is the latest sign that foreign governments are looking for ways to potentially disrupt the 2020 presidential election. U.S. intelligence officials have sounded the alarm about the risks for months. Russia’s hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, as well as the subsequent leaks of emails during the 2016 election roiled the DNC, hurt the Clinton campaign and was a focal point in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe. Foreign hackers have long targeted U.S. government and politicians, generally with little notice. But the disruption caused by Russia’s attack has heightened awareness and prompted fears that other nations will try to follow Russia’s example. Iran in particular could have a stake in the outcome of the U.S. election after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a nuclear agreement and stepped up sanctions against the country. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was working with Microsoft to “assess and mitigate impacts.” Chris Krebs, director of the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said much of the activity is likely “run-of-the-mill” foreign intelligence service work. But, “Microsoft’s claims that a presidential campaign was targeted is yet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions,” Krebs said. In a blogpost released Friday, Microsoft’s Tom Burt, corporate vice president for customer security and trust, said that owners of four accounts that were compromised by the hackers have been notified. The company would not identify those accounts.",Microsoft Says Iranian Hackers Targeted U.S. Presidential Campaign,"October 4, 2019"
194,Claire Parker / AP,"(PARIS) — New York-based pop artist Jeff Koons unveiled his long-awaited, giant sculpture titled “Bouquet of Tulips” in Paris on Friday, commemorating the victims of terror attacks that rocked France in 2015 and 2016. The 12.6-meter (41-foot) sculpture, fashioned from polychromed bronze, stainless steel, and aluminum, portrays a hand clasping a bouquet of balloon-like tulips. At an inauguration ceremony attended by some families of the November 2015 Paris terror attacks, Koons called the flowers “a symbol that life moves forward.” He said the “inflatable flowers represent loss, rebirth, and the vitality of the human spirit.” “I did, as a citizen in New-York, experience 9/11 and the depression that hung over the city and it really took years for the city to be able to come to life again”, Koons said. Patricia Correia, whose daughter was killed in the Bataclan concert hall attack, thanked Koons for his tribute. “It’s a very strong testament between the two countries and for me it represents the colors of life, the roots which are here and continue growing despite all the tragic events we went through,” she told the AP. Controversy over the placement of the sculpture stalled its installation for years after Koons announced the gift in November 2016. It was finally placed in the gardens of the Champs-Elysees — between the Petit Palais and the Concorde plaza. Calling the work “a gift from the heart,” Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo described vibrant debate, particularly over art, as a hallmark of Parisian identity.”Nothing can be small in Paris,” she said. “Everything is big in Paris —emotions, controversies, and the traces that art leaves in our lives.” Private French and American donors covered the costs of constructing and installing the sculpture.

195,Ian Bremmer,"This week marks the one-year anniversary of the brutal killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. It’s worth looking back to survey the fallout for Saudi Arabia and the world. Why It Matters: As journalists face increasing danger worldwide in a polarized political climate—fueled by a fractured media landscape where everyone is able to cocoon themselves within their preferred viewpoints and vilify all others—the Khashoggi killing stands out as the most brazen contemporary attempt to silence a prominent government critic and to blunt further dissent. It’s also a criminal act that came complete with Turkish intelligence recordings, leading the US intelligence community to determine that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) ordered the murder. But despite the evidence, the Saudis are back in good international standing, and it didn’t even take that long. At last year’s Future Investment Initiative conference (informally dubbed “Davos in the Desert”, much to the World Economic Forum’s chagrin) that took place less than a month after the killing, many international CEOs opted not to show up out of PR concerns but still sent their number 2’s, and business has continued as usual. While there were some awkward moments at the first G20 summit in Buenos Aires following the murder, by the time of this year’s G20 in Osaka, MbS had been welcomed back into the fold. For supporters of press freedom and human rights, that’s equal parts disturbing and disheartening. For most, it’s the world we live in. What Happens Next:  While Saudi Arabia’s government relationships and business interests have remained largely intact over the last year, the country’s reputation—and the reputation of MbS, once vaunted as a new kind of Middle East leader—has taken a hit, and has led to criticism from US lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. That helps explain why MbS recently told 60 Minutes, when asked point-blank if he ordered the killing of his most high-profile critic: “Absolutely not. This was a heinous crime. But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.” Factoring into this skin-deep mea culpa is that Riyadh is hosting next year’s G20 Summit, and the last thing MbS needs is a boycott of the event by any of the world’s largest economies (and the foreign investment they can bring) because he failed to show appropriate contrition, especially when it doesn’t cost him a thing to do so. But Saudi Arabia’s current problems can’t be solved by handwringing alone. Iran is at the top of the list—the decision to strike Saudi oil production facilities has been the most brash move Tehran has made since President Donald Trump walked away from the Iran nuclear deal. And given long-standing hostilities between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Riyadh is on the frontlines of those escalating hostilities, and the muted response from the US to the attack didn’t help. Donald Trump, maybe the single greatest friend the Saudis have ever had occupy the Oval Office, is preparing for the political fight of his life as impeachment proceedings kick into high gear. And the Saudi Vision 2030 plan to rewire the economy for the 21st century has failed to take off as hoped, meaning Saudi Arabia remains a petrostate in a world increasingly moving away from fossil fuels. Just this week, Fitch downgraded the country’s credit rating. In other words, plenty of problems piling up for the kingdom. Coupled with the passing of time, the Khashoggi murder becomes less and less of an issue, both for Riyadh and the rest of the world.",Jamal Khashoggi Murder: One Year Later What Has Changed,"October 4, 2019"

Ruslan Ryaboshapka’s comments came amid an impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump that relates to a call he made to the Ukrainian president asking him to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate and his son’s work in Ukraine. Ryaboshapka told reporters in Kyiv that prosecutors are auditing all the cases that were closed or dismissed by former prosecutors, including several related to Mykola Zlochevsky, owner of the gas company Burisma that hired Hunter Biden in 2014, at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. “We are now reviewing all the cases that were closed or split into several parts or were investigated before, in order to be able to rule to reverse those cases where illegal procedural steps were taken,” Ryaboshapka said. Asked by The Associated Press about Trump’s comment Thursday that the U.S. has an “absolute right” to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases, Zelenskiy said that Ukraine is “open” and that all the cases under investigation are “transparent.” The Prosecutor General’s Office later said that among the cases they are reviewing, there are 15 where Zlochevsky is mentioned.

It soon escalated into what one feared was a “crazy” swap that risked vital U.S. military aid. That’s according to a cache of text messages released late Thursday by House investigators following a 10-hour interview with one of the diplomats, Kurt Volker, who stepped down as special envoy to Ukraine amid the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. The pages lay out the raw contours of a potential quid-pro-quo exchange — Trump gets his political investigation of a top Democratic rival in return for some price to be paid by the new Ukraine leader — now at the heart of the House investigation. The text messages convey a distinct campaign among the three diplomats, who — apparently against some of their stated better judgment — appear to be trying to help Ukraine reset its relationship with Trump by pushing his interest in investigating his Democratic rival and the 2016 election. Volker, in a text message on the morning of a planned July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote: “Heard from White House — Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / “get to the bottom of what happened” in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.” An adviser to the Ukrainian president appeared to go along with the proposal, which entailed investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company where Joe Biden’s son Hunter served on the board. “Phone call went well,” wrote Andrey Yermak in a text to Volker later that day after the two presidents spoke. Yermak suggested several dates when Trump and Zerenskiy could meet in September. But all that planning started to unravel when Zelenskiy’s aide tried to lock in a date for the Trump meeting before putting out the statement on the investigations.",U.S. Diplomats Encouraged Ukrainian President to Investigate Bidens,"October 4, 2019"
198,TIME Staff,"Protests erupted across Hong Kong Friday after its embattled top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, invoked colonial-era emergency regulations to ban the wearing of face masks at all public gatherings. As night fell, thousands of protesters rampaged across the city, smashing shops, setting fires and occupying streets. Malls and businesses began pulling down their shutters upon hearing the news and panic buying broke out at several supermarkets as shoppers denuded the shelves of staples, fearing a weekend of unrest ahead. Violators of the new regulations, which apply to any kind of facial covering including paint, are liable to imprisonment for a year. The move is intended to curtail the months of anti-government protests that have rocked the former British possession and injured more than 1,100 people. But it may instead exacerbate tensions, with activists vowing to continue to defy the government. “This is unacceptable,” one 23-year-old protester told TIME. “But we are not going to give them the satisfaction of seeing us surrender.” Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, in front of a screen that read “Treasure Hong Kong, End Violence,” Lam said the ban would come into effect on Oct. 5. “Why do we need to have this? Because, in the past four months, we’ve seen that almost all protestors who carry out vandalism and violence cover their faces,” she said. “The purpose is to hide their identity and evade the law and they have become more and more daring. We believe the prohibition on face covering will be an effective deterrent on radical behavior and help police in upholding the law.” Asked if she would consider imposing more measures under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, Lam said “The situation is a fluid and evolving one” and “If the situation continues to worsen, we will identify other means.” Two activists, Kwok Cheuk-kin and student leader Lester Shum, quickly filed judicial challenges to the measure at the High Court.","After Months of Unrest, Hong Kong Invokes Emergency Powers to Ban Face Masks","October 4, 2019"
199,EDITH M. LEDERER / AP,"(UNITED NATIONS) — Deteriorating security across Afghanistan in the past four years led to over 14,000 “grave violations” against children, including nearly 3,500 youngsters killed and over 9,000 injured, according to a U.N. report circulated Thursday. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the alarming level” of grave violations committed by all parties and the fact that children “continue to bear the brunt of the armed conflict.” Of serious concern, he said, is that the nearly 12,600 children verified to have been killed or injured in 2015-2018 represented almost a third of all civilian casualties. That was “an increase of 82 percent in child casualties compared with the previous four years,” he wrote. Guterres said in his fourth report on children and armed conflict in Afghanistan that the rise was traced to “an increase in child casualties resulting from ground engagements, explosive remnants of war and aerial attacks.” The U.N. chief said he is “extremely concerned,” especially by the number of children killed and injured as a result of “aerial operations conducted by government and pro-government forces.” According to the report, child casualties from airstrikes “have significantly increased since 2015,” reversing the downward trend of the four preceding years. The U.N. verified 1,049 child casualties from airstrikes in 2015-2018, including 464 youngsters killed. That represented 40% of civilian casualties from aerial attacks, the report said. Guterres said armed groups were responsible for 43% of child casualties _ 3,450 killed and 9,149 injured. While Taliban fighters were responsible for the majority, the number attributed to the Islamic State extremist group increased overall during the four-year period, he said. Government and pro-government forces were responsible for 30% of child casualties, he said.","U.N. Records 14,000 'Grave Violations' Against Afghan Kids Over the Past Four Years","October 4, 2019"
200,HYUNG-JIN KIM / AP,"(SEOUL, South Korea) — North Korea said Thursday it has carried out its first underwater-launched ballistic missile test in three years, in an apparent bid to dial up pressure on the United States ahead of a weekend resumption of their nuclear diplomacy. Wednesday’s test of the Pukguksong-3 missile, which North Korea describes as a type of missile capable of being launched from a submarine, is seen as the North’s most high-profile weapons launch since it began diplomacy with the United States early last year. Some experts say North Korea wants to show to the U.S. what would happen if diplomacy fails again The Korean Central News Agency said the missile test in the waters off its east coast was successful and “ushered in a new phase in containing the outside forces’ threat to (North Korea) and further bolstering its military muscle for self-defense.” The KCNA report didn’t initially elaborate on whether the missile was fired from a submarine, a barge or other underwater launch platform. North Korea-dispatched photos showed the missile rising and spewing bright flames above a cloud of smoke from the sea, but the launch platform was not identifiable. The Pentagon said the short-to-medium range missile was not launched from a submarine. Air Force Col. Pat Ryder, spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters Thursday there was “no indication that it was launched from a submarine, but rather, a sea-based platform.” Other defense officials described it as a barge or floating platform. Michael Elleman, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the North Korean photos show “a missile breaching the sea’s surface after being ejected from an underwater launch tube, and then igniting its first-stage motor.” He wrote on the website 38 North that the missile was likely launched from “a submersible barge rather than a submarine, as evidenced by the nearby surface ship that presumably towed the barge to a safe off-shore location.”",North Korea Says Underwater-Launched Missile Test Succeeded,"October 4, 2019"
201,Sanya Mansoor,"As House impeachment investigators probe deeper into President Donald Trump’s alleged attempts to court foreign interference with the 2020 election, a dizzying array of Ukrainians and Americans—some already high-profile and others largely unknown to the general public until now—have emerged as key players. Many, including key White House officials and others close to the President, have been subpoenaed to appear before Congress—even as the White House has said it won’t cooperate with the Democrat-led inquiry. The impeachment inquiry comes in the wake of a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. The story also continues to develop outside the House inquiry. The President’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is reportedly under investigation by federal prosecutors, who are looking into whether the former New York mayor violated lobbying laws during his activities in Ukraine, according to reports that emerged from the New York Times. Giuliani is a “central figure” in carrying out Trump’s agenda in Ukraine, according to the whistleblower complaint. Giuliani has frequently denied allegations of wrongdoing and continued to say that the focus should be on Joe Biden and his son.  Hunter Biden, who is the focus of Trump and Giuliani’s unproven claims of corruption, announced Oct. 13 his intention to resign from the board of a Chinese investment company amid scrutiny of his foreign business dealings and whether he inappropriately benefited from the influence of his father. He has denied Trump’s accusations, saying that he did not discuss his business activities in China or Ukraine with his father. Central to the impeachment inquiry is a July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky has denied that he felt pressured to investigate Biden’s son, but many lawmakers are not convinced. Here’s a breakdown of who’s who in the Ukraine investigation. Hunter Biden, 49, is the younger son of former Vice President and 2020 presidential contender Joe Biden.  Hunter Biden is at the center of Trump’s claims of corruption against his father—which the President and his allies continue to make without evidence.

202,JARI TANNER / AP,"(HELSINKI) — Finnish media on Thursday praised their president’s performance at a Washington news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump as “ice-cold strong” as he stoically endured Trump’s heated comments on the U.S. impeachment inquiry. The U.S. president used large chunks of their joint news conference on Wednesday to talk about the situation with Ukraine, leaving his guest sidelined. Finnish President Sauli Niinisto stood calmly by while Trump answered questions about his controversial phone call with Ukraine’s leader. “Ask him a question,” Trump irritably told a reporter, pointing to his counterpart. Thursday’s TV show “Morning Finland” on MTV3 widely covered the Trump-Niinisto meeting, because its U.S. correspondent at the news conference asked Niinisto a pointed question: “What kind of favors has Mr. Trump asked from you?” “I think you mean the other way around,” Trump quickly replied. The Finnish tabloid Iltalehti said the Finnish leader wisely did not interfere with U.S. domestic politics and “Trump’s nightmare.” Finland’s largest newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, said Niinisto’s “poker face held well.” Another tabloid, Ilta-Sanomat, cited a body language expert as saying the two leaders had seemingly good chemistry. It also said Niinisto came out with honors from his meeting with the “explosive” U.S. leader. Helsingin Sanomat also said the news conference showed “two parallel realities” and suggested that Trump “shout less to make reporters hear better.”",Finnish Media Praises Their President for ‘Ice-Cold Strong’ Composure During Press Conference With Donald Trump,"October 3, 2019"
203,Rachael Bunyan,"Climate change activists used an old fire engine to spray fake blood over the Treasury Building in central London early Thursday morning as part of efforts to highlight inaction over climate change. Protesters with the Extinction Rebellion movement parked an old fire engine outside the Treasury Building to spray 1,800 liters of red-colored water over the 100-year-old building. The protest, which started at around 10am on Oct. 3, wanted to highlight the lack of action the U.K. government has shown in addressing climate change, an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson told TIME. Demonstrators were holding banners outside the building, demanding that the U.K. government “Stop Funding Climate Death”. Meanwhile, protesters stood on top of the fire engine and used a hose to spray the fake blood onto the front of the Treasury Building for several seconds, leaving red marks above the door. But they quickly lost control of the high-powered water jet and the liquid was instead sprayed across the road and pavement. The fake blood is made from a concoction of beetroot powder, golden syrup, water and cornflower, Extinction Rebellion told TIME. The mixture can be washed off the building, but faded marks of red remain on the building for now. In a statement, Extinction Rebellion said: “The protest is being held to highlight the inconsistency between the U.K. Government’s insistence that the UK is a world leader in tackling climate breakdown, while pouring vast sums of money into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects.” Extinction Rebellion say that the use of a fire engine is symbolic. “We are in an emergency, using a fire engine is very symbolic of that,” a spokesperson told TIME.",Climate Change Activists Spray Fake Blood at U.K. Government Building,"October 3, 2019"
204,Mike Corder / AP,"(THE HAGUE, Netherlands) — After a series of setbacks, a system for catching plastic floating in the Pacific between California and Hawaii is now working, its Dutch inventor said Wednesday. Boyan Slat, a university dropout who founded The Ocean Cleanup nonprofit, announced that the floating boom is skimming up waste ranging in size from a discarded net and a car wheel complete with tire to chips of plastic measuring just 1 millimeter. The results are promising enough to begin designing a second system to send to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an area of floating plastic trash twice the size of Texas, Slat said. But he sounded a note of caution, saying “if the journey to this point taught us anything it is that it’s definitely not going to be easy.” The floating boom with a tapered 10-foot-deep (3-meter-deep) screen is intended to act like a coastline, trapping some of the 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic that scientists estimate are swirling in the patch while allowing marine life to safely swim beneath it. After it was towed out to sea last year, the barrier did not catch any trash in its first weeks of operation because it was moving at the same speed as the plastic. That problem was overcome by using an underwater parachute anchor to slow the boom so it catches quicker moving trash. Also, late last year, the barrier broke under the constant pummeling by wind and waves in the Pacific, requiring four months of repairs before being relaunched from Vancouver in June. The system also experienced a problem with “overtopping” _ waves that pushed the plastic over the line of floating corks that hold the screen. That was solved by using a line of larger corks to corral the plastic.",Ocean Cleaning Device Starts Collecting Plastic in Pacific Ocean,"October 3, 2019"
205,JILL COLVIN and ZEKE MILLER / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — Ensnarled in an impeachment investigation over his request for Ukraine to investigate a chief political rival, President Donald Trump on Thursday called on another nation to probe former Vice President Joe Biden: China. “China should start an investigation into the Bidens,” Trump said in remarks to reporters outside the White House. Trump said he hadn’t directly asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to investigate Biden and his son Hunter but said it’s “certainly something we could start thinking about.” Trump and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have also tried to raise suspicions about Hunter Biden’s business dealings in China, leaning on the writings of conservative author Peter Schweizer. But there is no evidence that the former vice president benefited financially from his son’s business relationships. Trump’s requests for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to dig up dirt on Biden, as well as Giuliani’s conduct, are at the center of an intelligence community whistleblower complaint that sparked the House Democratic impeachment probe last week. The president’s reference to China came unprompted in an unrelated question about the July 25 Ukraine call and moments after he was asked about trade negotiations with China to end a year-long trade war that has been a drag on both nation’s economies. “I have a lot of options on China, but if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power,” Trump said. He later alleged without evidence that China had a “sweetheart deal” on trade with the U.S. because of the Bidens. “You know what they call that,” Trump said. “They call that a payoff.”",President Trump Says China Should Investigate the Bidens,"October 3, 2019"

Police union official Loic Travers told reporters the attack appears to have begun in an office and continued elsewhere in the large police compound across the street from Notre Dame Cathedral. The number of people injured was not immediately known. Travers said the motive is unknown, but that the 20-year police employee allegedly responsible for the attack worked as an administrator in the intelligence unit and had not posed known problems until Thursday. He said he could not remember an attack of this magnitude against officers. Emery Siamandi, an employee at police headquarters, said he heard gunshots and immediately saw two officers come outside an office weeping. A third officer, who Siamandi described as the person who shot and killed the assailant, came out on his knees, also in tears. The attack came a day after thousands of officers marched in Paris to protest low wages, long hours and increasing suicides in their ranks.

207,Suyin Haynes/London,"Within minutes of our meeting in a central London coffee shop, Louis Theroux starts peppering me with questions. How I am, how I came to be in this job and where I’ve traveled from to meet him. He’s friendly yet persistent, the approach he’s built a career on. Within a matter of minutes, and without meaning to, I find I’ve revealed to him my abridged autobiography. Such is the award-winning technique of Theroux, 49, widely regarded as the face of modern British documentary filmmaking. For the past 25 years, he has been making and presenting television programs featuring quirky subjects, ranging from UFO investigators to committed Nazis, Miami megajail inmates to big-game trophy hunters. Persuasive but not pushy, challenging but not judgmental, his knack for convincing his interviewees to (often unwittingly) reveal more of their psyches has endeared him to millions of viewers around the world. Whether speaking to a transgender woman and her cellmate about their relationship inside San Quentin prison, or asking a member of the Phelps family why she exiled herself from the incendiary Westboro Baptist Church, Theroux elicits poignant, genuine responses. Now Theroux has become his own subject. His new book, Gotta Get Theroux This, is a memoir of his life and career on camera, from his early days in 1994 as a fresh-faced correspondent for Michael Moore’s satirical NBC news show TV Nation. Putting himself in the hot seat does not come naturally, he says. “I’ve made it my habit to be slightly invisible in my programs. Although I’m on camera, I don’t really give that much of myself. I think that’s what’s needed, because of the nature of the programs. I’m a straight man in a world that is somewhat weird, mysterious, dangerous or just emotionally charged in one way or another.” Theroux was born in Singapore in 1970 to an American father (the writer Paul Theroux) and British mother, and eventually settled in London. He and his brother Marcel, now a writer, were encouraged to be interested in the world, and grew up spending summers in Cape Cod with their American family. “That was a big thing growing up: you weren’t tribal. [My parents’] outlook was very much cosmopolitan, striving to be open-minded, unblinkered as to how other countries and other cultures see the world.” Those themes run clear through Theroux’s films, in which he is often a slightly bemused bespectacled British observer interacting with people living in unusual worlds or subcultures. “I think we have a tendency to settle in certain ways of thinking, or select data sets that confirm prejudices we have on a given subject,” he says. To upend these assumptions, several of his programs bring dimensions to subjects that a viewer might not expect. One program focusing on convicted sex offenders showed a woman welcoming Theroux into her home with a crumb cake while wearing an ankle monitor, telling him the hardest part about being on parole is being separated from her children. “I’m interested in those inconvenient bits of data, or those points at which you are forced to acknowledge that something does not fit the template or the paradigm.” In 1998, the BBC aired Louis Theroux’s Weird Weekends, in which he spent time with people on the extreme fringes of American society—right-wing militia members, UFO enthusiasts and porn stars. Four years later, When Louis Met … , a series of interviews with high-profile British personalities, would follow. One of these was When Louis Met … Jimmy, in which Theroux spent time with then popular entertainer and television presenter Jimmy Savile. Two years after Savile died in October 2011, U.K. police investigations uncovered that he had been guilty of hundreds of criminal sex-abuse offenses, targeting mostly children. That revelation has had a lasting impact on Theroux—who had formed a “quasi-friendship” with Savile after filming together-—and was partially the impetus for writing the memoir. The lighthearted nature of Theroux’s questioning of Savile led to retrospective criticism of his interview style, best described as “faux naive.” In an early segment on TV Nation, for example, Theroux interviewed neo-Nazis in Montana and earnestly discussed their theories of different races being banished to different planets after an impending apocalypse. Is it all an act? He says that is in the top three questions he is ever asked. “Am I exactly the same person on camera as off camera? Well, evidently no because I’m doing a job on camera, and part of that is asking questions to which I know the answer sometimes.” That statement circles back to his immersive approach, talking to subjects in the languages of their own worlds. “Maybe it’s my sense of humor to ask something really obvious … I don’t know if that’s a helpful answer or not, but basically I think me saying stupid things sometimes is funny. I plead guilty to that.” Still, his approach risks seeming like he is letting his subjects off the hook—something survivors of Savile’s abuse charged him with when he met with them for a follow-up documentary in 2016. At one point, Theroux is called “gullible and silly,” and confronted with accusations of failing to recognize evil in plain sight. “I needed to hear that, actually,” he says now.","Louis Theroux, Britain's Documentary Trailblazer, Turns the Spotlight on Himself","October 3, 2019"
208,Ian Bremmer,"The U.S.-China trade war is inflicting the most damage to the global economy, but it’s the trade spat between Japan and South Korea that signals the larger troubles ahead for the world. South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled in late 2018 that a number of Japanese companies must compensate a group of South Koreans (or their descendants) who were forced to work for them during Japan’s occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Japan argues that all such claims were settled by a 1965 treaty between the two sides. South Korea’s Supreme Court disagrees, and President Moon Jae-in’s administration insists that it has no authority to tell the country’s independent judiciary to reverse the ruling. Frustrated with the proceedings and determined to put pressure on Moon’s government to intervene in some way, Japan strengthened restrictions on several high-tech exports to South Korea in July and downgraded South Korea’s status as a trusted trading partner in August. South Korea returned the trade fire, and suddenly two of Asia’s largest economies were locked in a trade war. There is not much love lost between Japan and South Korea. Nearly 75 years after World War II ended, the two sides continue to argue over the issue of how much, how often and in what form Japan should appropriately atone for its past transgressions. But what makes this recent round of historical finger-pointing worrisome is the speed with which trade was roped into this fight and how effective it has been in satisfying public outcry. Boycotts have already erupted; in South Korea, sales of Japanese beer and cars have tumbled precipitously. At the end of the summer, nearly 7 in 10 Japanese supported the tech trade restrictions slapped on Seoul; more than half of South Koreans approved of how Moon’s administration was dealing with Japan. With numbers like these, it’s unlikely that either Moon or Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will make the first move toward reconciliation (as each is demanding of the other). On Oct. 1, Seoul accused Tokyo of sitting on the approval of a Japanese firm’s request to send a shipment of liquid hydrogen fluoride–critical in building semiconductors–to South Korea, fueling worries over tech supply chains. In August, the trade war even spilled over into security as Seoul announced that it would not renew an intelligence-sharing pact with Tokyo, to the dismay of the U.S. Not that Washington can say much about it these days. After all, it was the U.S. that decided to bundle a host of other disputes it had with the Chinese into a trade fight–not to mention threatening to increase tariffs on Mexico unless it beefed up border security–setting a troubling precedent for those once wary of doing the same. Trade has become an acceptable weapon in a country’s diplomatic arsenal; in August, French President Emmanuel Macron threatened to upend the E.U.-Mercosur trade agreement over Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s refusal to deal with fires in the Amazon rain forest. With the U.S. decision to stop playing a global leadership role and mediating disputes, the world will face more grievances between countries that roil economies and trade.

209,Karim Sadjadpour,"Iran’s President arrived in New York City in September and left, as usual, without meeting the American one. Both Hassan Rouhani and Donald Trump professed an appetite for sitting down and talking over the ever more treacherous rift between their nations. But as Rouhani has pointed out in private, Iran’s top elected official “has no authority in foreign policy.” That authority–and nearly every other strand of power in the Islamic Republic–resides with the elderly cleric who remained 6,000 miles away, in the country he has not left for decades. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 80 years of age, disabled by a saboteur’s bomb blast and lit by a righteous certainty, holds the title of Supreme Leader of Iran. But he has quietly emerged as the most powerful person in the Middle East, with uniformed military fighting in Syria and loyal proxies dominant in Lebanon, Yemen and (despite a U.S. investment of $1 trillion and thousands of lives) Iraq. Since the spring, behind a thin veil of denials, he has also presided over an audacious and escalating campaign to raise uncertainty and global oil prices, shooting down a $176 million U.S. drone, blowing holes in tankers and bombing the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil production, all without drawing a U.S. military response. Khamenei, who has confounded every U.S. President he has faced since coming to power 30 years ago, harbors a particular animus for Trump. In June, he told the Prime Minister of Japan, who had come bearing a message from the White House, “I do not consider Trump as a person worth exchanging any message with.” A detonation on the hull of a Japanese oil tanker the same day might have been an exclamation point. Perhaps no other foreign leader is working harder to put Trump out of office than Khamenei. And perhaps no other foreign leader differs in more ways. Trump, thrice married and irreligious, has lived a life of opulence and publicity. The deeply devout Khamenei has been married for over 55 years, and he openly disdains pomp and materialism. Trump, operating on impulse, exhibits no organizing principles. Khamenei has shown a lifelong commitment to his: resistance against “global arrogance”–his moniker for American imperialism–is both ideology and strategic doctrine for the theocracy. When Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 deal that had significantly curtailed Iran’s nuclear program, the move validated Khamenei’s view of the U.S. as “deceitful, untrustworthy and backstabbing.” The sanctions Trump then imposed have further debilitated Iran’s economy, sending it to 50% inflation. But they seemingly stiffened Khamenei’s resolve. “Resistance,” Khamenei said in a recent speech that included the word 70 times, “unlike surrender, leads to the retreat of the enemy.” In Trump, Iran has an enemy who does not want to fight. After an Iranian missile shot down that massive U.S. drone in June, Trump at the last minute retracted his own order for military retaliation. Two days later, he thanked Iran for not shooting down a manned flight: “That’s something we really appreciate.” The vacillation seems to have only increased Khamenei’s appetite for risk, and on Sept. 14, Saudi Arabia’s largest oil facility was crippled by a missile and drone attack. Iran denied involvement, but the game unfolding now is one Khamenei knows well. For years, he has carefully calibrated Iran’s reaction to U.S. pressure: an insufficient response might project weakness and invite more pressure. An excessive response, on the other hand, could trigger a serious U.S. retaliation and risk outright war. It’s a situation made even less predictable by two qualities the leaders do share: each harbors an appetite for conspiracy theories and a profound sense of victimization. Khamenei is a geriatric cleric ruling over an increasingly secular population whose median age is 30. Aside from Syria’s Bashar Assad, he has no reliable friends in the world. And he goes to bed every night and wakes every morning believing that the U.S. government is actively trying to overthrow him. This paranoia–frequently reflected in official state media, which Khamenei controls–is also driven by political expediency. Mohammed Khatami, the reformist cleric who was Iran’s President for two terms (1997–2005), told me in a private meeting in Oslo in 2008 that when he was in office Khamenei used to tell him that Iran “needs enmity with the United States. The revolution needs enmity with the United States.” Despite its distance and a military budget less than 3% of that of the U.S., Iran has loomed large in American domestic politics. The Iran hostage crisis ended Jimmy Carter’s presidency; Iran-contra tainted Ronald Reagan’s presidency; Iranian machinations in post-Saddam Iraq exhausted George W. Bush’s presidency. And the Iran nuclear program and negotiations engrossed the Obama presidency.",Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei Is One Despot Trump Might Not Win Over,"October 3, 2019"
210,"Billy Perrigo/Manchester, U.K.","A long standing ovation greeted U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he appeared onstage in Manchester on the final day of the annual Conservative Party conference on Oct. 2. It was his first speech to his party membership as Prime Minister, and he brought the gusto his right-wing base has come to expect, pledging to deliver Brexit, reinvigorate the national economy and fire the leader of the opposition into orbit. But despite the adulation of loyal supporters here, Johnson’s future looks less certain than ever. He not only looks increasingly unable to make good on his promise to deliver Brexit by the Oct. 31 deadline, but also is in danger of losing political standing ahead of a seemingly inevitable early election because of two emerging scandals about his personal conduct while in positions of power. One dates from his time as mayor of London in the early 2010s and involves his relationship with former model Jennifer Arcuri, who allegedly told friends she had a sexual affair with Johnson while he was married. Officials are investigating reports Arcuri improperly received government money, including two grants totaling £11,500 ($14,000) from a public fund managed by Johnson at the time. Both he and Arcuri deny any impropriety. The second scandal stems from new allegations, published on the eve of the conference, that in 1999, when he was editor of the Spectator magazine, Johnson groped the upper thigh of journalist Charlotte Edwardes under a table at a dinner. Johnson’s office said the incident never happened, but his Health Minister said he felt Edwardes was “trustworthy.” The allegation has also renewed attention on the Prime Minister’s past indiscretions, which include a number of extramarital affairs and at least one child born out of wedlock. On the conference floor, Johnson’s party faithful were happy to ignore the new allegations, so long as he could deliver Brexit. “My honest view is: Who cares?” responded one delegate. “The only reason it’s coming up now is people who are trying to stop Boris Johnson in his tracks.” Established members of the party also smelled a conspiracy. “He’s under attack from all sides from people who wish to prevent Brexit,” Geoffrey Van Orden, a senior Conservative lawmaker in the European Parliament, told TIME. “The sources of these accusations are people who want to destabilize Boris’ government and distract people from his main task.” In his speech, Johnson suggested dark machinations were at work. “[People] are beginning to suspect that there are forces in their country that don’t want Brexit delivered at all,” he told the crowd, to a thunderous response. “Within the Conservative Party it’s clear he’s their champion,” says Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, “partly because he’s been offering them everything they’ve ever wanted on Brexit. In spite of all the allegations about his personal life, he still remains very popular. In the same way they do with Trump, people dismiss the sexual-impropriety allegations as either unbelievable or unimportant.” Yet polls show Johnson’s popularity in the country as a whole is waning. A majority (55%) is now dissatisfied with him as Prime Minister, up 17 points from July, according to a poll by Ipsos Mori published on Sept. 30. Women, in particular, are turning against him. According to a YouGov poll published on Sept. 27, 47% think he is “dislikable,” a 7-point increase from late August. The more recent allegations may drive that figure even higher. Such a change will matter if, as widely expected, a general election takes place in the U.K. this winter. Although Johnson pledged onstage to ensure Brexit happens on Oct. 31 “come what may,” he is legally unable to do so unless he manages to strike a new, last-minute deal with European leaders. If he fails and Parliament forces him to seek another extension to the deadline, an election may follow that Johnson’s advisers believe he could win by casting himself as the victim of a cabal that wishes to stop Brexit at all costs.","As Scandals Loom Over Boris Johnson, the U.K. Prime Minister's Base Stays Strong","October 3, 2019"
211,TIME Staff,"The Hong Kong teenager shot by police during anti-government protests on Tuesday is to be charged with rioting and assaulting police. The news is sure to exacerbate tensions in the enclave, which is still recovering from its worst day of violence in over 50 years, and comes amid reports that the government intends to invoke emergency regulations to make the wearing of face masks at demonstrations illegal. Tsang Chi-kin, 18, is scheduled to appear in Sha Tin court on Thursday afternoon, a court official told TIME. It was not immediately clear if Tsang, who is recovering in hospital, would be appearing in person or via video link, or be represented by counsel. By the mid-afternoon, hundreds of Tsang’s supporters had gathered at the court, many of them high school students in uniform. In the crowd was a 28-year-old civil servant, who spoke to TIME on condition of anonymity. “I want to tell the teenagers that I will always support you,” she said. “Many people are behind you, with you. This road is not easy to walk and we will always walk it with you.” A 65-year-old local resident named Chan, who was outside the court, said: “I feel so sorry for them. They shouldn’t have to face this. I have kids myself, they don’t participate in protest so thankfully I don’t need to worry about them. But all of them inside, they are my kids too.” As he prepared to enter the courtroom, a supporter named Jeffrey, 28, told TIME that the imposition of emergency regulations “is not going to scare us. We will find a way, and our protests will continue. We refuse to be intimidated by our authoritarian government.” At the nearby campus of Chinese University, hundreds of students rallied in support of Tsang, who miraculously survived a police bullet at close range during a street battle on Oct. 1.",Teen Shot by Police to Face Rioting Charges as Hong Kong Considers Emergency Regulations,"October 3, 2019"
212,QASSIM ABDUL-ZAHRA / AP,"BAGHDAD (AP) — At least seven people were killed and dozens were wounded in clashes that spread across several Iraqi provinces on Wednesday as security forces fired live ammunition and tear gas for the second day to disperse anti-government protesters demanding jobs, improved services and an end to corruption. The deaths brought the overall number of protesters killed in two days of violence to nine. Protests on Tuesday had left two dead — one in Baghdad and another in the city of Nasiriyah — and over 200 wounded. The renewed clashes occurred despite a massive security dragnet mounted by the government in an effort to quash the economically-driven protests. Hundreds of heavily armed security forces and riot police deployed on Baghdad streets, blocking all intersections leading to a major central square Wednesday to prevent a repeat of Tuesday’s protests. Parked armored personnel carriers and SUVs stood guard and by mid-afternoon, residents said authorities had shut down social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Groups of protesters continued to take to the streets, some of them calling for toppling the government. Thick black smoke hung over the city as demonstrators set fire to tires and garbage containers. Bursts of heavy gunfire could be heard intermittently. At night, protesters closed the road leading to Baghdad’s airport with roadblocks and burning tires, keeping the way into the city open for arrivals. The confrontations quickly spread to at least seven other provinces in the country, with an estimated 3,000 demonstrators taking to the streets in the southern city of Basra in a largely peaceful protest on Wednesday evening. Protests and clashes were also reported in Najaf, Nasiriyah, Waset, Diwaniyah and in other places. The violence was some of the worst between protesters and security forces in Iraq, signaling that the war-weary country could be facing a new round of political instability. Iraq has been caught in the middle of U.S.-Iran tensions in the Middle East, putting an additional strain on the fragile government in Baghdad that hosts thousands of U.S. troops and powerful paramilitary forces allied with Iran. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad called for restraint from all sides. “The right to demonstrate peacefully is a fundamental right in all democracies, but there is no place for violence in demonstrations from any side,” it posted on Twitter.","Protests Escalate in Iraq, Leaving Nine Dead and Hundreds Wounded","October 3, 2019"
213,PAUL WISEMAN and JAMEY KEATEN / AP,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it will impose tariffs on $7.5 billion in European imports beginning Oct. 18 in a case involving European Union subsidies to the plane maker Airbus. The latest escalation in the administration’s tariffs will open a new chapter in the trade wars that are depressing the world economy and heightening fears of a global recession. It comes just as the Trump administration is in the midst of trying to negotiate a resolution to its high-stakes trade war with China. The administration received a green light earlier Wednesday from the World Trade Organization, which ruled that the United States could impose the tariffs as retaliation for illegal aid that the 28-country EU gave to Airbus in its competition with its American rival Boeing. Culminating a 15-year fight over the EU’s subsidizing of Airbus, the administration’s Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it plans to publish a list of targeted products later Wednesday or on Thursday. A senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that EU aircraft will face a 10% tariff and other products a 25% import tax. The tariffs are intended to pressure the EU into dropping its subsidies for Airbus. President Donald Trump called the WTO ruling a “big win for the United States” and asserted that it happened because WTO officials “want to make sure I’m happy.” “The WTO has been much better to us since I’ve been president because they understand they can’t get away with what they’ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States,” Trump said at a joint White House news conference with President Sauli Niinisto of Finland. The move escalates uncertainty for the U.S. and global economies at a time when Trump’s trade war with Beijing is weighing heavily on businesses, particularly manufacturers.","Trump Administration Announces Tariffs on Whiskey, Cheese and Aircrafts From the E.U.","October 2, 2019"
214,Joseph Hincks / Istanbul,"The U.N.’s special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, a Yemeni Nobel Laureate and the owner of the Washington Post were among mourners who gathered outside the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul on Wednesday to mark one year since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “No one should ever have to endure what you did,” Amazon CEO and Post owner Jeff Bezos told Khashoggi’s fiancée Hatice Cengiz on stage, pointing to the street where on Oct. 2 last year she had paced for hours as she waited in vain for him to emerge from the consulate. Bezos embraced Cengiz and told her, “It is unimaginable and you need to know that you are in our hearts. We are here and you are not alone.” Khashoggi, a journalist and commentator who had been critical of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, vanished one year ago after entering his country’s consulate to obtain a marriage certificate. It later emerged he had been killed and dismembered by a Saudi assassination squad. U.S. intelligence concluded the Crown Prince had ordered Khashoggi’s killing, and in June, a United Nations special report found “credible evidence” warranting a deeper investigation into the role of the Crown Prince in the murder. In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, bin Salman said he takes “full responsibility” for Khashoggi’s murder, but denied that he had ordered the killing, calling the death “a mistake” and “a heinous crime.” Speaking after the memorial, U.N. special rapporteur Agnes Callamard told TIME that although MBS’s acknowledgement Khashoggi’s killing was a state crime was important, his attempt to personally distance himself from the murder was unconvincing. “It’s what heads of corporations are always asked to do when there is a f*ck up: claim responsibility but protect yourself from personal liability,” she said. “But the facts go against his statement because the relationships between Mr. Mohamed bin Salman and the people implicated in the crimes are much closer than he’s pretending they are.” Last month, a transcript of Khashoggi’s dying moments was leaked to Turkish journalists. In it members of the Saudi assassination squad referred to Khashoggi as a “sacrificial animal” and detailed plans to carve up his body. “Don’t cover my mouth,” Khashoggi said in his last panicked words, “I have asthma, don’t do it. You’ll suffocate me.” Wadah Khanfar, the former director of Doha-based news network Al Jazeera, said in a speech on Wednesday that Khashoggi’s killers “wanted him to disappear but his image and his voice are chasing them everywhere.” Turan Kislakci, head of the Turkish Arab Journalists Association has announced that his association is attempting to buy the building of the Saudi Consulate and turn it into a permanent memorial for Khashoggi.",Mourners in Istanbul Pay Tribute to Jamal Khashoggi One Year After Murder at Saudi Consulate,"October 2, 2019"

Johnsons says in a letter to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that the U.K. proposes to do that by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU rules for trade in goods, possibly for an extended period.

217,Associated Press,"(BRUSSELS) –– The World Trade Organization says the United States can impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion worth of goods from the European Union as retaliation for illegal subsidies to European plane-maker Airbus — a record award from the trade body. The move green-lights the Trump administration to slap countermeasures on the 28-member bloc and follows a WTO ruling in May 2018 on the Airbus subsidies. Wednesday’s award doesn’t end the long-running trans-Atlantic dispute over aircraft: WTO arbitrators are expected to rule next year on how much the EU can impose in tariffs following a separate decision that went against Boeing.

218,YURAS KARMANAU and ANGELA CHARLTON / AP,"(KYIV, Ukraine) — Ukraine’s former president said Wednesday he discussed investments with President Donald Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in 2017, but that he never discussed Ukrainian companies with any U.S. official. Like many Ukrainians, former President Petro Poroshenko is trying to distance himself from the U.S. impeachment inquiry into Trump, triggered by a phone call between the American leader and Poroshenko’s successor, Volodymyr Zelensky. “We definitely do not want to be involved in the political process inside the United States,” Poroshenko, now a member of parliament, told reporters. Poroshenko said he met Giuliani in 2017 as a “friend of Ukraine” and they discussed “political support and investment” but nothing else. He wouldn’t elaborate. “We never ever spoke about commercial companies” with Trump, former President Barack Obama, current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, or “any U.S. officials,” said Poroshenko, who led Ukraine from 2014 to 2019. Giuliani wants Ukraine to investigate Biden, whose son Hunter served on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Trump asked Zelensky to “look into” the Bidens in a July 25 phone call that is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry. In his first public comments on the phone call, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Trump’s critics are using “every excuse to attack” the U.S. president.

219,Rachael Bunyan,"Boris Johnson has been rocked by fresh allegations relating to his personal life, as he continues to battle intransigent lawmakers over his approach to Brexit. On the eve of the Conservative Party Conference, Charlotte Edwardes, a journalist for the U.K. Sunday Times newspaper, accused Johnson of groping her at a private lunch in 1999. This is on top of allegations of an improper relationship with an American entrepreneur, Jennifer Arcuri, during his time as London mayor. Johnson denies any wrongdoing. But the U.K. Prime Minister has been dogged by claims and reports about his private life throughout his career as a journalist and as politician. Here’s what to know: Edwardes accused Johnson of groping her leg during an event at the offices of The Spectator, a British magazine the future Prime Minister edited between 1999 and 2005. Johnson has denied the claims. The allegations were made by Edwardes, 45, in a Sunday Times article on Sept. 29. She wrote: “I’m seated on Johnson’s right; on his left is a young woman I know. More wine is poured; more wine is drunk. Under the table I feel Johnson’s hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright.”  After confiding in the young woman on Johnson’s left, the guest tells her “Oh god, he did exactly the same to me,” Edwardes claimed. Responding to the allegations on the first day of the Conservative Party conference, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “This allegation is untrue.” Edwardes responded in a Tweet: “If the prime minister doesn’t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.”",Boris Johnson Is Facing Allegations That He Groped Women and Misused Public Funds.

220,Hatice Cengiz,"The morning of Oct. 2, 2018, was the last day I would wake up to a normal life like everyone else, full of hopes and desires. Who would have known that it would be the last day I saw my fiancé, Jamal Khashoggi? Who would have known that when I left the house, I would become a real-life answer to the question: “Can someone’s life change in a day?” I wasn’t supposed to be with Jamal that day when he went to the Saudi consulate to get the necessary documents for our marriage. He knew I was busy with my Ph.D. work and had told me to carry on with my studying. But in the end, I offered to go with him. Apart from being a person I loved, Jamal was a person I profoundly respected, whose life, status, experience and values I admired. I was always happy to know where he was going and to help him out, especially when he was in Istanbul, where we spent a lot of time together. It made him happy, too. Who would have known that as we were finalizing preparations for our marriage, others were moving in for his murder? As the hours passed by in deep silence, I waited for him and stared at the gates of the consulate in fear and hope. By the time I realized something was wrong, the damage was already done. Jamal’s blood had already been spilled; his body cut up into pieces.  I still had no idea of the dark nights to come. In the days that followed, my phone rang constantly for hours. Were the calls from journalists? I could not answer most of them. Although it took a long time for the news to emerge, Jamal’s death in the consulate that day was eventually confirmed to the public on Oct. 19. Turkey was saved from being the host to an anonymous murder. That is hardly enough to ease the enormous loss of Jamal.  
                
                 After the news of the atrocity, I felt detached from life for a long time. I did not read the news; I did not follow what was written during the period. Articles or phone calls would not be able to bring Jamal back. But journalists and rights groups managed to keep the issue on the international agenda for a long time, with sheer loyalty to Jamal and what he stood for. For this I am grateful, and I hope they will uphold their moral responsibility and continue to pursue justice for this brave man.  But Jamal was murdered. I will never see or have the chance to meet with him again in the earthly realm. All my dreams have been profoundly shaken. Before this, I had my own struggles in life like everyone else. Now, Jamal’s fight for justice has been added to them. Because world leaders claim to represent justice but lack morality, I have been left with the burden of carrying this feeling. I am not just the woman going after her partner’s cause in his absence, but also the one left to hold to account those who took his life. A year later, the first thing that comes to my mind is shame, an immense disappointment that the systems of the world are built on economic interests rather than ethical values. As a researcher of the Middle East and a future academic, I can see that the day Jamal was killed was not simply the murder of a journalist. It was also the murder of fundamental values: human rights, the international rule of law, the norms of diplomacy. The situation reminded me of the words of the wise Alija Izetbegovic during the Bosnian War: “What is being defended in Bosnia today is not just Bosnia itself; what is being defended is Europe. For in Bosnia today, the values vowed to be upheld by Europe are being defended.”","Jamal Khashoggi Was My Fiancé. A Year After His Murder, I'm Still Fighting for Justice","October 2, 2019"
221,Associated Press,"(TAIPEI, Taiwan) — Searchers have recovered four bodies and are looking for two people missing from three fishing boats that were struck when a bridge collapsed in Taiwan. The National Fire Agency on Wednesday identified two of the victims as Indonesian and another as Filipino. The fourth body had not been identified. Taiwan’s military deployed a floating platform to help workers remove debris and try to extract two of the boats from under collapsed sections of the bridge. The third boat was recovered the previous day. All the victims are believed to be fishing boat workers from Indonesia and the Philippines. The 140-meter (460-foot) -long arched bridge collapsed Tuesday into a bay on Taiwan’s east coast, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of Taipei, the capital. A typhoon swept by the island earlier, but the weather was sunny when the bridge collapsed, and it wasn’t clear if the storm was a factor. Ten people were taken to hospitals with injuries, including the Taiwanese driver of an oil tanker truck that fell off the bridge. The other nine are Filipino and Indonesian fishermen, with one, an Indonesian, in serious condition, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency said, citing an employment agency that recruited the workers. Many Filipinos and Indonesians work on fishing boats registered in Taiwan, where the pay is better than in their home countries. The 18-meter-high (nearly 60 feet) high bridge in Nanfangao, a Pacific coast fishing port, opened in 1998 and replaced a lower span that prevented large fishing vessels from passing underneath. The company that designed the bridge, MAA Consultants, says it’s the only single-span arch bridge in Taiwan supported by cables and the second single arch-cable steel bridge in the world.",Four Bodies Have Been Found After the Bridge Collapse in Taiwan,"October 2, 2019"
222,TIME Staff,"Amid worsening political tensions, hundreds of protesters gathered in the streets of Hong Kong’s financial quarter from lunchtime Wednesday in a spontaneous demonstration of anger at the shooting of an 18-year-old protester during the enclave’s worst unrest in more than 50 years. Suited office workers joined young, black-clad activists in marching through the streets of Central district chanting “Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!” They sang the democracy movement’s anthem, “Glory to Hong Kong,” as passing bus drivers and vehicle passengers leaned out of their windows to offer gestures of support. Some carried signs accusing the police of attempted murder. “I think we really need foreign countries to intervene,” said Chun, a 20-year-old protester. “I don’t know how or what they can do, but it’s becoming clear we can’t fight this government alone” The latest demonstration comes after thousands of young protesters rampaged across the city Tuesday, clashing with police, setting fires in government offices, and smashing the premises of businesses, organizations, and politicians with mainland Chinese connections. The protester who was shot by police at close range has been identified as high school student Tony Tsang Chi-kin and is in hospital in stable condition. According to official figures, 25 police officers and 66 protesters were injured and 269 people arrested in the violence, which saw protesters attack the police with petrol bombs, rocks, poles, slingshots and other homemade weapons. One officer suffered third degree burns after he was attacked with corrosive liquid. Police responded with 1,400 rounds of tear gas, hundreds of rubber bullets, water cannon, and several live rounds, but appeared unable to control the disturbances, which erupted in multiple districts across Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon peninsula and the suburban New Territories. The government issued a statement late Tuesday condemning “online orchestration of violent acts in various districts across the territory” and what it called “very dangerous riots.” It accused those behind the disturbances of “leading Hong Kong to a chaotic and panic [sic] state.” The police also issued a statement saying “Public safety has been jeopardized and the public order of the whole city is being pushed to the verge of a very dangerous situation.”",Hong Kong's Political Crisis Deepens After the Worst Day of Violence in Decades,"October 2, 2019"
223,Franklin Briceño and Christine Armario / AP,"(LIMA, Peru) — A bitter struggle between Peru’s president and congress over who will govern the South American country threatened to become a lengthy and destabilizing legal battle as each side dug in Tuesday amid the deepest constitutional crisis in nearly three decades. President Martín Vizcarra dissolved the opposition-controlled congress and called new elections on Monday, saying the step was needed to uproot the nation’s endemic corruption. Defiant opposition lawmakers voted to suspend him from office and appointed a vice president who recently broke ranks in his place. The 35-member Organization of American States on Tuesday urged Peru’s Constitutional Tribunal to weigh in on the feud as both sides accused the other of abusing power and jeopardizing the nation’s stability. The military and governors stood by Vizcarra while several private business coalitions announced they would back Mercedes Aráoz, who legislators swore into office late Monday night as the country’s rightful chief of state. “It seems we are facing a protracted political crisis, with the dispute potentially ending up before courts,” said Maria Luisa Puig, an analyst for the Eurasia Group consultancy. For now, Peruvians appeared overwhelmingly in favor of Vizcarra’s decision, but the events nonetheless could threaten to fuel social unrest. Vizcarra is likely to continue governing as president while any challenge from the opposition works its way through court. He has already called for new legislative elections in early 2020. But if congress prevails, lawmakers would be entitled to stay in their posts till 2021, calling off Vizcarra’s elections and likely moving to impeach him, all moves that could irritate an already angry public with little to no faith in elected leaders.

224,Kim Tong-Hyung and Hyung-Jin Kim / AP,"(SEOUL, South Korea) — North Korea fired a ballistic missile from the sea on Wednesday, South Korea’s military said, a suggestion that it may have tested an underwater-launched missile for the first time in three years ahead of a resumption of nuclear talks with the United States this weekend. The North Korea missile flew about 450 kilometers (280 miles) at a maximum altitude of 910 kilometers (565 miles) after liftoff from an unspecified place in the waters off the North’s eastern coastal town of Wonsan, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing more details of the launch, it said. Japan lodged an immediate protest against North Korea, saying the missile landed inside Japan’s economic exclusive zone. If confirmed, it would be the first North Korean missile that has landed that close to Japan since November 2017. South Korean military officials wouldn’t officially disclose whether the missile was fired from a submarine, a barge or another possible platform. But during an emergency National Security Council meeting, council members placed weight on the possibility that North Korea performed a submarine-launched missile test and expressed “strong concerns” over the North Korean move, according to South Korea’s presidential office. North Korea having the ability to launch missiles from submarines would be alarming because such weapons are harder to detect in advance. Some experts say the North is attempting to raise the stakes and ramp up pressure on the United States before their nuclear negotiators meet on Saturday. “The North is trying to convey a message that time is not on the side of the United States and that it could take a different path if the working-level talks don’t go the way it wanted,” said Du Hyeogn Cha, a visiting scholar at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies. The Joint Chiefs of Staff statement said the weapon fired Tuesday is believed to be a “Pukguksong-class” missile. It refers to a solid-fuel missile that North Korea tested-launched from an underwater test platform in 2016, with the hope that it could eventually be a part of its submarine weaponry. That missile flew 500 kilometers (310 miles), and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said at the time that his country had gained “perfect nuclear-attack capability.” North Korea has been trying to obtain the ability to fire ballistic missiles from submarines, though the tests needed for that appear to have been put off while it has been engaged in nuclear diplomacy with the United States since early last year.",North Korea Has Fired a Ballistic Missile Days Before Resuming Nuclear Talks With the U.S.,"Updated: October 2, 2019 2:28 AM ET"

Media information provided with the announcement confirmed Meghan Markle is suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday after the tabloid newspaper published a “private letter” from the Duchess of Sussex. “My deepest fear is history repeating itself,” Harry wrote. “I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.” At issue specifically, according to numerous publications, is the publication by the Mail on Sunday of a handwritten letter said to be from Meghan to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018, a few months after her wedding to Harry in May 2018. Thomas Markle did not attend the wedding, bowing out of the proceedings amid a paparazzi scandal that also involved the Mail on Sunday. “The contents of a private letter were published unlawfully in an intentionally destructive manner to manipulate you, the reader, and further the divisive agenda of the media group in question,” Harry wrote in the statement. “In addition to their unlawful publication of this private document, they purposely misled you by strategically omitting select paragraphs, specific sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year.” A spokesperson from Schillings, Meghan’s legal representatives, said in a statement: “We have initiated legal proceedings against the Mail on Sunday, and its parent company Associated Newspapers, over the intrusive and unlawful publication of a private letter written by the Duchess of Sussex, which is part of a campaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her, as well as her husband. Given the refusal of Associated Newspapers to resolve this issue satisfactorily, we have issued proceedings to redress this breach of privacy, infringement of copyright and the aforementioned media agenda.” Mail on Sunday, along with the Daily Mail and other publications, is owned by DMG Media, which was formerly known as Associated Newspapers. The company could not be immediately reached for comment. Meghan, Harry wrote, “has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences.” The “continual misrepresentations” of Meghan have escalated in the last year, Harry wrote, continuing throughout her pregnancy and birth of the couple’s newborn son.",'My Deepest Fear Is History Repeating Itself.'

228,Jari Tanner / AP,"(HELSINKI) — A man wielding a sword and a firearm killed a woman and wounded nine others Tuesday at a vocational school inside a shopping center in central Finland, police said. The attacker was seriously wounded after police opened fire, and he was taken into custody. The police superintendent for eastern Finland, Mikko Lyytinen, told a news conference that officers were forced to shoot the man to prevent more bloodshed at the Herman shopping center in the town of Kuopio. Police didn’t give the suspect’s age, but said he was born in 1994 and he’s a Finnish national without a prior criminal record. He was a student at the Savo Vocational College, which occupies the shopping center’s second floor. The man’s apartment was later raided by police, and a cache of firebombs were found there. But it wasn’t immediately clear whether they were used in the rampage. The motive for the attack remained unclear. The National Bureau of Investigation has taken over the investigation. Police wouldn’t provide further details on the woman who was killed, but Finnish newspaper Keskisuomalainen said she was a student at the school and “the primary target” of the dark-clad attacker. One police officer was slightly injured, and the rest of the wounded were students and staff of the school, mostly women aged 15-50. They were treated at a hospital for cuts. It wasn’t clear if the attacker used his firearm.

229,Jasmine Aguilera,"An iceberg larger than the size of greater London has broken off the Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica — the largest iceberg the shelf has produced in more than 50 years. Scientists at the Australian Antarctic Devision and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego have been monitoring the area for more than 20 years, and expected a large section would break off between 2010-2015, though they expected it would be an area they named “Loose Tooth” because of it’s resemblance to a child’s tooth hanging on. A different area of the ice shelf broke off on Sept. 26. and is now named D-28. It is 1,636 square kilometers in area, roughly 631.6 square miles. “I am excited to see this calving event after all these years,” said Helen Amanda Fricker, a professor at Scripps, said in a public statement. “We knew it would happen eventually, but just to keep us all on our toes, it is not exactly where we expected it to be.” The scientists say the iceberg break off — or calving — is not the result of climate change, but a part of the shelf’s normal cycle of major calving events taking place every 60-70 years. The event is also not expected to directly affect sea level rise because the ice shelf was already floating. “But what will be interesting to see is how the loss of this ice will influence the ocean melting under the remaining ice shelf and the speed at which the ice flows off the continent,” Fricker said in the statement. Amery Ice Shelf is the third largest in Antarctica, located on the eastern side of the continent. While scientists expected calving at Amery, glacial melt does pose a risk to global sea level rise.   Write to Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com.","An Iceberg the Size of London Just Broke Off Antarctica, But Scientists Say There's No Cause For Alarm Yet","October 1, 2019"
230,RALPH JENNINGS / AP,"(TAIPEI, Taiwan) — A towering arch bridge over a bay in eastern Taiwan collapsed Tuesday, sending a burning oil tanker truck falling onto boats in the water below. An air force helicopter, fishing vessels and more than 60 military personnel including divers were searching for possible victims. Six people, all foreigners, were missing and believed trapped on one of the fishing boats, the National Fire Agency said. Interior Minister Hsu Kuo-yung told reporters that five people were feared to have been on the bridge when it collapsed. Ten people were sent to hospitals, six of them with serious injuries. The 140-meter (460-foot) -long bridge collapsed about 9:30 a.m. in Nanfangao, a tiny but often-crowded Pacific coast fishing village. The weather at the time was sunny, but the collapse occurred hours after a typhoon swept by the island. Disaster relief officials would not say if the storm had weakened the bridge or give other details on the cause. Government-run Central News Agency said a bridge pier may have collapsed. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said she hoped all government departments would do everything possible to save people and “keep the number of deaths and injuries as low as possible,” CNA reported. National Fire Agency spokesperson Su Hong-wei said the oil tanker truck’s fall smashed three fishing boats. It also set off a fire on the truck, but it did not spread beyond the vehicle. Rescue workers have removed one of the boats from under the collapsed bridge and are still working on the two others, the agency said in a statement Tuesday evening. Of the 10 people hospitalized, six are Filipinos and three are Indonesians, the agency said. People from both countries regularly work on fishing boats registered in Taiwan, where pay is better than in their home countries.","Arch Bridge Collapses in Taiwan Bay, Sending Divers to Search for Victims","October 1, 2019"
231,JILL LAWLESS / AP,"(MANCHESTER, England) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed Tuesday that Britain will make firm proposals for a new divorce deal with the European Union within days, saying “this is the moment when the rubber hits the road.” Britain is due to leave the 28-nation bloc at the end of this month, and EU leaders are growing impatient with the U.K.’s failure to set out detailed plans for maintaining an open border between the U.K.’s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland — the key sticking point to a deal. Johnson said details would be disclosed “very soon.” The U.K. plans to send them to Brussels within days after the governing Conservative Party conference ends Wednesday in Manchester, northwest England. Johnson says Britain will leave the EU on the scheduled Oct. 31 date with or without a deal. A Brexit agreement between the EU and his predecessor, Theresa May, was rejected three times by the U.K. Parliament, largely because of opposition to the “backstop,” an insurance policy designed to ensure there is no return to customs posts or other infrastructure on the Irish border. An open border underpins both the local economy and Northern Ireland’s peace process. British Brexit supporters oppose the backstop because it would keep the U.K. tightly bound to EU trade rules in order to avoid customs checks — limiting the country’s ability to strike new trade deals around the world. “There is no point in doing Brexit if you stay locked in the (EU) customs union and locked in the single market with no say,” Johnson told the BBC. He didn’t say what Britain’s proposed alternative is. So far the U.K. has floated the idea of a common area for livestock and agricultural products, plus largely untested “technological solutions.” The EU says that is inadequate.",Boris Johnson Says U.K. Will Submit Concrete Brexit Proposals Within Days as Leave Date Looms,"October 1, 2019"
232,KIM TONG-HYUNG / AP,"(SEOUL, South Korea) — North Korea and the United States have agreed to resume nuclear negotiations this weekend following a months-long stalemate over the withdrawal of sanctions in exchange for disarmament, a senior North Korean diplomat said Tuesday. Choe Son Hui, North Korea’s first vice minister of foreign affairs, said the two nations will have preliminary contact on Friday before holding working-level talks on Saturday. In a statement released by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency, Choe expressed optimism over the outcome of the meeting but did not say where it would take place. “It is my expectation that the working-level negotiations would accelerate the positive development of the DPRK-U.S. relations,” Choe said in the statement, using an abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The U.S. confirmed the talks. “I can confirm that U.S. and DPRK officials plan to meet within the next week. I do not have further details to share on the meeting,” said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, who is traveling with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Rome. Nuclear negotiations have been at a standstill for months following a February summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam. Those talks broke down after the U.S. rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for partially surrendering its nuclear capabilities. North Korea followed the summit with belligerent rhetoric and a slew of short-range weapons tests that were widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage ahead of a possible resumption of negotiations.",U.S. and North Korea Agree to Resume Nuclear Negotiations This Weekend,"October 1, 2019"
233,TIME Staff,"One year after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, his name remains atop a list of the most severe examples of threats to press freedom around the world. The monthly list — released by the One Free Press Coalition, which was created by a dozen news organizations, including TIME, with the goal of defending journalists under attack — identifies the 10 most urgent cases of press freedom violations. Khashoggi, a journalist and commentator who had fled Saudi Arabia and criticized Saudi’s Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate on Oct. 2, 2018. He was one of four journalists and one news organization recognized as the TIME 2018 Person of the Year for “taking great risks in pursuit of greater truths.” A United Nations special report released in June found “credible evidence” warranting a deeper investigation into the role of bin Salman in Khashoggi’s killing. Free press and human rights advocates have called for a stronger response from President Donald Trump’s administration over the killing. In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, bin Salman said he takes “full responsibility” for Khashoggi’s murder, but denied that he had ordered the killing, calling the death “a mistake” and “a heinous crime.” Others on the One Free Press list this month include a freelance photographer who has been detained in Venezuela for a year without trial and a journalist in Azerbaijan who started a hunger strike to protest his prison conditions. Read about the 10 journalists on the October list here: As of October 2, one year has passed without justice or resolution for the death of Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered inside Istanbul’s Saudi consulate.

234,TIME Staff,"China’s national day was marked in Hong Kong Tuesday with citywide unrest, as pro-democracy protesters fought running battles with police in a stark repudiation of Beijing’s sovereignty over the enclave. Protesters gathered in at least a dozen districts across the territory, building barricades, setting fires and throwing petrol bombs and rocks at police, who responded with baton charges and tear gas. At one stage, smoke from several fires could be seen above Hong Kong Island’s iconic skyline. A protester, reportedly a grade 11 student, was shot in the chest in the Tsuen Wan district, north of Kowloon and is said to be in critical condition. In a statement cited by local media, a police spokeswoman said: “The police force really did not want to see anyone being injured, so we feel very sad about this. We warn rioters to stop breaking the law immediately, as we will strictly enforce the law.” Live warning rounds were also reportedly fired in Kowloon after a group of officers was set upon by a large crowd. Authorities said 51 people had been injured, including two in critical condition and 96 arrested. Demonstrations began in the early afternoon, when pro-democracy politicians defied a police ban to lead tens of thousands on a march through downtown districts. Marchers chanted the democracy movement’s slogan—”Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time!”—and sang “Glory to Hong Kong,” a song that many are calling the enclave’s “national anthem.” Said Danny Wo, a taxi driver who joined the march: “I wish for Hong Kong independence. I am not Chinese, I am a Hongkonger. Hong Kong is still a colony under this Chinese government.” “It’s the 70th anniversary of China, so it’s even more important to come out today,” added Apple, a 17-year-old student protester. “China is getting more powerful.

The military showed off China’s most advanced weapons, some being shown for the first time, as rows of soldiers marched in lockstep past President Xi Jinping and other leaders in Tiananmen Square, the country’s symbolic political heart. Thousands of spectators waved Chinese flags and fighter jets flew low overhead. “No force can shake the status of our great motherland, and no force can stop the progress of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation,” Xi, wearing a gray Mao jacket, said in a nationally televised speech. Xi was joined on the Tiananmen rostrum by Chinese leaders including Premier Li Keqiang and former Presidents Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin. The event marks the anniversary of the Oct. 1, 1949, announcement of the founding of the People’s Republic of China by then-leader Mao Zedong following a civil war. Invoking Mao’s memory, Xi made his speech Tuesday on the same spot as the former leader’s 1949 declaration. Xi, who is chairman of the body that commands the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, rode in an open-topped limousine past dozens of rows of truck-mounted missiles, armored personnel carriers and other military gear.

236,FRANKLIN BRICEÑO and CHRISTINE ARMARIO / AP,"LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra dissolved congress Monday, exercising seldom used executive powers to shut down the opposition-controlled legislature that he accuses of stonewalling attempts to curb widespread corruption. In a televised address, Vizcarra told the South American nation that he had decided to call new legislative elections after lawmakers proceeded with holding a controversial vote to replace almost all the members of the Constitutional Tribunal. “We are making history that will be remembered by future generations,” he said. “And when they do, I hope they understand the magnitude of this fight that we are in today against an endemic evil that has caused much harm to our country.” The stunning turn could spell new instability as Peru grapples with the fallout of the Odebrecht corruption scandal, plummeting faith in public institutions and an inexperienced president struggling to govern. Nonetheless, Vizcarra’s decision is likely to be widely welcomed by Peruvians who have been clamoring for new congressional elections to replace the majority party, led by a former first daughter and presidential candidate who is now behind bars. “Peruvians will not shed many tears,” said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist who has extensively studied the nation. Opposition leaders denounced the move as the work of a “dictator” and proceeded with pushing an impeachment vote against him, though it would carry only symbolic weight since their positions in congress are now considered vacated. “This was the plan from the start,” said Milagros Salazar, a spokeswoman for Fuerza Popular, the party of Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori who was once a commanding force herself in the country’s politics but is now jailed. “They think this is a monarchy, that’s what they want to impose.”",Peru's President Has Dissolved Congress Amid an Anti-Corruption Push,"October 1, 2019"
237,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong braced for widespread protests Tuesday as activists announced plans to use China’s National Day to continue their push for democratic reform. The raising of the Chinese flag took place without incident at 8:00 a.m. local time, but in subdued fashion. The public were not invited and VIPs attending the ceremony were asked for security reasons to gather at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center to watch the event on closed circuit television. In his speech to the dignitaries, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, said “Violence and confrontation are never solutions to problems. To resolve the current acute social conflicts, we need more than ever the solidarity of all Hong Kong people to work towards the same goal, seek common ground and accommodate differences.” The surrounding streets were on lockdown, but a small procession by the League of Social Democrats political party was able to approach within a few hundred meters of the venue. Marchers carried banners that read “No national celebration, only national tragedy” and “End authoritarianism.” Live news streams showed a brief scuffle breaking out between them and a pro-Chinese group. Addressing the procession, longtime dissident and former legislator Leung Kwok-hung, said: “With no democracy, Hong Kong will not have a future.” Afterward, he told TIME: “If there [is no] right to choose our leaders, to have self-governance, and if there is one-party rule, what is there for us to celebrate?” Earlier, chairman Avery Ng said that the party’s warehouse had been broken into and vandalized by a dozen men and that party members were being followed. Local media meanwhile reported that 6,000 police had been deployed in anticipation of unrest, with several roadblocks set up across the city. Hong Kong’s subway operator, which has come under sustained attacked by protesters who accuse it of colluding with police, shut 14 stations. More than two dozen shopping malls also brought down their shutters and major office buildings took precautions against vandalism and criminal damage.

238,Tara Law,"Climate change is expected to affect every country in the world, but its impact will not be felt equally across all regions and some will be worse hit than others because of a range of different threats. Developing countries, places with widespread poverty, and countries with ineffective governments sometimes face the gravest risks from the changing climate, and are usually poorly equipped to find ways to prepare for and prevent environmental threats. Measuring the future impact of climate change is very challenging, because scientists’ climate change projections cannot be completely exact and because there are many different factors that come into play such as the risk of extreme weather events and rising temperatures. There are other non-climatic factors that also determine how severely a city or country will be impacted by climate change. Niall Smith, who analyzes regions’ climate change vulnerability for the global risk consulting firm Maplecroft, tells TIME that it’s also necessary to weigh in what’s happening politically and socially in a region to figure out if the country can prepare. “The places with the least level of economic development are certainly in line to feel the impacts with the greatest degree, partially just due to their geographic fate — or their location — but more so based on the socio-economic and governance factors,” says Smith. Many developing countries are also uniquely vulnerable, says Kelly Levin of the World Resources Institute, “their livelihoods are dependent on natural resources. And if those natural resources are affected by climate change, their ability to feed their families and make a living is significantly impacted.” To get a sense of the challenges different regions are facing, TIME spoke to experts about six countries and cities will be be particularly affected by climate change. Lagos is at “extreme” risk on Maplecroft’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index. This is especially concerning because its population is expanding rapidly, and it is considered to be a major economic engine for the region. The governor boasted that Lagos had reached a GDP of $136 billion in 2017, which is about a third of the entire country’s GDP. The city is also a major transportation hub, with multiple ports and a major international airport and is a regional hub for high tech industry. Lagos has “transformed” over the last 18 years, Lamido Sanusi, a former central bank governor, told the Financial Times last year. “In terms of roads, in terms of infrastructure, in terms of a general investment environment, in terms of security, the government has given people a greater opportunity to thrive.”","The Climate Crisis Is Global, but These 6 Places Face the Most Severe Consequences","September 30, 2019"
239,MICHAEL BALSAMO / AP,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump recently asked the Australian prime minister and other foreign leaders to help Attorney General William Barr with an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that shadowed his administration for more than two years, the Justice Department said Monday. Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Trump made the calls on Barr’s behalf. “At Attorney General Barr’s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials,” Kupec said. Trump was requesting help for U.S. Attorney John Durham’s investigation into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The investigation outraged Trump, who cast it as a politically motivated “witch hunt.” Mueller wrapped up his report earlier this year with an inconclusive finding about Trump — the president was not charged with any crimes, but Mueller pointedly said he did not exonerate Trump. The president promptly called for an investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe. Justice officials said that has involved seeking help from numerous foreign countries, including Australia. One official said Trump told Prime Minister Scott Morrison that the attorney general would be contacting his Australian counterpart. The revelation comes amid new scrutiny of Trump’s dealings with foreign leaders. The House opened an impeachment inquiry into Trump that centers on a summertime call in which he pressed for help investigating Democrat Joe Biden. Morrison’s office said in a statement, “The Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation.”",President Trump Sought Australia's Help to Investigate Russia Probe Origins,"September 30, 2019"
240,Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim,"Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, from the Mbororo pastoralist community in Chad, has spent a decade trying to get international policy on climate change to consider perspectives from indigenous communities like her own. In the lead up to the historic 2015 climate-change meetings in Paris, she was designated as co-chair of the International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change, established in 2008 as the caucus for indigenous people participating in the U.N. Climate Summit. And she has worked with the government of Chad on their Nationally Determined Contributions plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions in a feasible way. Ibrahim tells TIME what lessons indigenous communities hold for the rest of the world in protecting the environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change. — There cannot be a solution to combat climate change if it does not include indigenous people. The wisdom we hold is based on living in harmony with nature. We know how to keep the balance of nature. If you are in Paris or New York or any big city, if it’s hot outside, you can turn on the air conditioning. But in a community like ours, you have to be creative. When we build houses, we know the windows need to face a particular way so wind can enter. This kind of basic, grassroots knowledge is just one way in which indigenous communities are mindful of the environment. Including indigenous people in decision-making can help us reach a climate solution in a quicker, more sustainable way. Climate policy at the international level still does not provide enough representation for indigenous communities. Most climate policies and solutions are not being designed for the people, by the people, with the people. Often, they are designed by experts with a masters degree or PhD. But that’s not enough. A lot of expertise is local. Locals are experts of their own land in ways that academics are not. Our solutions are not only about writing reports that barely anyone in my community can make sense of. There is a misconception that if you don’t know the technical words, you do not understand climate. But that’s not true.  When I was working with meteorological experts with the government at the international level, I invited them to visit us. They would usually not venture beyond towns but they agreed. For them, we probably appeared to be exotic people. During their visit, some women from the community told them: “it’s going to rain.” They didn’t believe it would because they did not see any clouds. But the rain came down heavy in the next few hours. The meteorological experts asked how the community knew. It was because the women saw insects taking their eggs down to their nest. An insect cannot check its smartphone meteorological app to know whether it is going to rain. They were impressed by our observations and we decided to talk about ways to exchange our knowledge and organized a workshop for the community. In Chad, our calendars have different seasons that are based on the ecosystem. Those living in drier areas, near the desert, have five seasons. Greener areas have seven seasons. We know which season it is from observing trees, flowers and animal behavior. This helps us learn when the dry or rainy season is coming, so the community knows how to best plant crops. We are now working with meteorologists from the state to combine traditional and scientific knowledge. We found the sciences alone can sometimes be limited because they only consider physical aspects, like clouds, but at the community level we observe physical and ecological indicators.  This practical work and expertise guides us to make policy change at the national level. When Chad was designing it’s Intentionally Nationally Determined Contributions — plans that governments around the world have to cut greenhouse gas emissions — we had a gathering where we brought people from the community and we invited the minister of environment from Chad. We told them your NDCs are not responding to the needs of the community. And we were able to include traditional knowledge in Chad’s final agenda, as well as a human rights based approach — which only around two dozen of the NDCs from 196 countries mention.",‘We Know How to Keep the Balance of Nature’.

Authorities blocked streets leading to the Parliament building in Jakarta, where 560 members of the House of Representatives whose terms ended Monday held their last session. Clashes between rock-throwing students and riot police broke out in the evening when police tried to disperse the protesters, ranging from high school to university students, who attempted to reach Parliament after calm had largely returned to the country’s capital over the past four days. Protesters set fires to tires and pelted police with rocks, gasoline bombs and firecrackers near blocked streets. Riot police responded by firing tear gas and water cannons. Similar clashes also occurred in other Indonesian cities, including in West Java’s Bandung city and in Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province, where a student was badly injured on Friday after being accidently hit by anti-riot armor. A protest also turned violent in President Joko Widodo’s hometown of Solo city in Central Java, where an angry mob threw rocks at police, injuring at least four female officers in the head. The demonstrators are enraged that Parliament passed the law reducing the authority of the corruption commission, a key body fighting endemic graft in the country.

Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington for the negotiations, Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said. He didn’t give exact dates, but said the talks would be after China’s National Day holiday, which runs through Oct. 7. “The two sides should find a solution through equal dialogue in accordance with the principle of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,” Wang said at a news conference with other officials, including Commerce Minister Zhong Shan. The Trump administration first imposed tariffs on Chinese imports last year in a bid to win concessions from China, which responded with tit-for-tat tariffs. The escalating dispute between the world’s two largest economies has depressed stock prices and poses a threat to the global economy. Both sides have made conciliatory gestures ahead of the next round of talks, but a deal remains elusive. The U.S. postponed a further tariff hike on Chinese goods, and China lifted punitive duties on soybeans. The move helps both American farmers and Chinese pig breeders, who use soy as feed and are struggling with a devastating outbreak of African swine fever. The Chinese government released a third round of 10,000 tons of pork from its reserves Sunday to try to stabilize rising prices ahead of the holiday, Vice Commerce Minister Qian Keming said at the news conference.

People stood in lines all day Sunday under a brutal sun to get water, gasoline and other basic supplies before the next round of protests that many worried would turn more violent than a demonstration Friday during which several homes and businesses were burned as police fired tear gas at protesters. Several people have died in the past three weeks amid the political clashes. “I have a feeling that the country is going to change,” said Yves Bon Anée, a mason standing next to eight empty plastic gallons that he would fill with gasoline at $2 a gallon for friends, family and himself. He planned to resell his portion to make some money because he hasn’t been able to find work in weeks amid Haiti’s crisis. “My kids are suffering,” he said of his three young boys. Opposition leaders and supporters say they are angry about public corruption, spiraling inflation and a dwindling supply of gasoline that has forced many gas stations in the capital to close as suppliers demand the cash-strapped government pay them more than $100 million owed. Protesters also are demanding a more in-depth investigation into allegations that top officials in the previous government misused billions of dollars in public funds that were proceeds from a Venezuela subsidized oil plan meant for urgent social programs. Moïse, who took office in 2017 following an election redo, has said he will not step down despite the unrest and instead called for calm, unity and dialogue during an address televised at 2 a.m. Wednesday.

245,Associated Press,"(NEW YORK) — Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in a television interview that he takes “full responsibility” for the grisly murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but denied allegations that he ordered it. “This was a heinous crime,” Prince Mohammed, 34, told “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday. “But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.” Asked if he ordered the murder of Khashoggi, who had criticized him in columns for The Washington Post, Prince Mohammed replied: “Absolutely not.” The slaying was “a mistake,” he said. Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Turkey on Oct. 2, 2018, to collect a document that he needed to marry his Turkish fiancee. Agents of the Saudi government killed Khashoggi inside the consulate and apparently dismembered his body, which has never been found. Saudi Arabia has charged 11 people in the slaying and put them on trial, which has been held in secret. As of yet, no one has been convicted. A U.N. report asserted that Saudi Arabia bore responsibility for the killing and said Prince Mohammed’s possible role in it should be investigated. In Washington, Congress has said it believes Prince Mohammed is “responsible for the murder.” Saudi Arabia has long insisted the crown prince had no involvement in an operation that included agents who reported directly to him. “Some think that I should know what 3 million people working for the Saudi government do daily,” the powerful heir told “60 Minutes.” ”It’s impossible that the 3 million would send their daily reports to the leader or the second-highest person in the Saudi government.” In an interview Thursday in New York, Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, told The Associated Press that responsibility for Khashoggi’s slaying “was not limited to the perpetrators” and said she wanted Prince Mohammed to tell her: “Why was Jamal killed?

The matter arose from a Sunday Times report saying Arcuri was given 126,000 pounds in public money and privileged access to trade missions to the United States, Israel and Asia that Johnson led as mayor, even though her fledgling business had not yet met eligibility requirements for such trips. “Everything was done in accordance with the code … and everything was done with full propriety,” Johnson said Sunday. When pressed again by BBC journalist Andrew Marr, Johnson added: “There was no interest to declare.” The scandal worsened Sunday as Johnson’s Conservative Party was opening its annual party conference in Manchester following a tumultuous week for a leader who has only been in the job since July. In just the last few days, the U.K. Supreme Court declared Johnson’s attempt to suspend Parliament illegal and he cut short a trip to the United States, racing home to face the House of Commons, where lawmakers greeted him with cries of “Resign!” He then lost a vote on a normally routine matter — a request to adjourn for a week so that Conservatives could attend their conference. Complicating things further, questions were raised about the 55-year-old Johnson’s links to Arcuri, now 34, who set up a cyber firm in East London after moving to the capital seven years ago. Yet even as the British leader visited North Manchester General Hospital on Sunday to talk about his government’s plans to build 40 hospitals, his efforts failed to change the subject.",U.K.'s Boris Johnson Denies Wrongdoing in Ties With American Tech Entrepreneur,"September 30, 2019"
247,Associated Press,"PARIS — Thousands of mourners paid tribute Sunday to former French President Jacques Chirac, who died at 86. Chirac was lying in state Sunday afternoon inside the Invalides monument in Paris, where France honors its heroes, after he died Thursday. People were holding a moment of silence in front of the casket draped in the French flag under a large, smiling picture of Chirac. A booklet prepared by Chirac’s family was handed to those who came to the Invalides. Titled “Chirac in his own words”, it includes some quotes evoking key moments of Chirac’s presidency, like when he defiantly opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, saying: “War is always the worst of all solutions.” Chirac was also the first French president to acknowledge France’s role in the Holocaust in 1995. Remy Clovel came from Paris’ western suburb of Saint-Germain-en-Laye to pay his respects. “I have Jewish origins, so it’s important for us that he (Chirac) acknowledged the responsibility of the French state in the persecution of Jews during the Second World War,” he said. Nicole Pats from Boulogne-Billancourt, west of Paris, has recalled Chirac as “a simple man.” ”He watched you, smiled at you and he loved you. We had the impression (that we belonged) to his family,” she said.",Mourners Line Up to Pay Tribute to Late French President Jacques Chirac,"September 29, 2019"
248,EILEEN NG / AP,"HONG KONG — Protesters and police clashed in Hong Kong for a second straight day on Sunday, throwing the city’s business and shopping belt into chaos and sparking fears of more ugly scenes leading up to China’s National Day this week. Riot police repeatedly fired blue liquid — used to identify protesters — from a water cannon truck and multiple volleys of tear gas after demonstrators hurled Molotov cocktails at officers and targeted the government office complex. It was a repeat of Saturday’s clashes and part of a familiar cycle since pro-democracy protests began in early June. The protests were sparked by a now-shelved extradition bill and have since snowballed into an anti-China movement. “We know that in the face of the world’s largest totalitarian regime — to quote Captain America, ‘Whatever it takes,'” Justin Leung, a 21-year-old demonstrator who covered his mouth with a black scarf, said of the violent methods deployed by hard-line protesters. “The consensus right now is that everyone’s methods are valid and we all do our part.” Protesters are planning to march again on Tuesday despite a police ban, raising fears of more violent confrontations that could embarrass Chinese President Xi Jinping as his ruling Communist Party marks 70 years since taking power. Posters are calling for Oct. 1 to be marked as “A Day of Grief.” “So many youngsters feel that they’re going to have no future because of the power of China,” Andy Yeung, 40, said Sunday as he pushed his toddler in a stroller. “It’s hopeless for Hong Kong. If we don’t stand up, there will be no hope.” Hong Kong’s government has already scaled down the city’s National Day celebrations, canceling an annual fireworks display and moving a reception indoors. Despite security concerns, the government said Sunday that Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, will lead a delegation of over 240 people to Beijing on Monday to participate in National Day festivities.",Violence Grips Hong Kong Protests Ahead of China's National Day,"September 29, 2019"

Uyinene Mrwetyana, a female student in Cape Town, was raped and murdered in August. Her death launched a wave of outrage and protests as women across the country demanded South Africa address the issue of gender-based bias, launching the social media campaign #AmINext? 39,633 rapes and 6,253 sexual assaults were reported in the country in 2017, according to Amnesty International. According to CNN, the Dutches of Sussex initially visited the memorial in secret because she wanted to attend in private as a “personal gesture.” The official Sussex Royal Instagram account posted a photograph of Markle Saturday morning, tying a ribbon at the post office where Mrwetyana was killed. The post said Markle wanted “to pay her respects and to show solidarity with those who have taken a stand against gender-based violence and femicide.” Markle also spoke with Mrwetyana’s mother, per the social media post. Markle began an official 10-day tour with her husband Prince Harry and their 4-month-old son Archie on Sept 23. Harry’s trip includes Botswana, Angola and Malawi, while Markle stayed in South Africa. She spoke out against gender violence during a speech organized by African human rights organization Justice Desk, saying, “On one personal note, may I just say that while I am here with my husband, as a member of the royal family, I want you to know that for me, I am here with you as a mother, as a wife, as a woman, as a woman of color and as your sister.” Write to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com.",Meghan Markle Privately Visited a Memorial to Murdered 19-Year-Old South African Student Uyinene Mrwetyana,"September 28, 2019"
250,FARAI MUTSAKA / AP,"(ZVIMBA, Zimbabwe) — A priest asked God to take pity on Robert Mugabe as the family of the longtime Zimbabwean leader buried him Saturday at his rural home. They chose a private farewell for one of Africa’s most divisive figures after a weeks-long dispute with the administration that forced him from power. “This man lives forever,” declared the priest, to cries of approval. Mugabe died this month in Singapore at age 95 after leading the country for nearly four decades and being pushed into a shocking resignation as thousands danced in the streets. “I was ridiculed,” a relative said Mugabe told them. His coffin, draped in the country’s flag, was carried by military pallbearers as his black-veiled wife, Grace, looked on. On display was a photo of Mugabe holding up his fist in a classic gesture of defiance, and a floral arrangement spelled out “Dad.” Many mourners wore T-shirts saying “Liberator” and “Torch bearer.” Grace later stood motionless as the coffin was lowered into the grave and a choir sang “Remember me.” Mugabe, who led the bitter guerrilla war to end white-minority rule in the country then known as Rhodesia, was Zimbabwe’s first leader and ruled from 1980, overseeing a years-long slide from prosperity to economic ruin and repression. He was forced by the military and ruling party to retire in late 2017 after bitter political feuding centered in part on his wife’s political ambitions. Some of Mugabe’s political rivals, including opposition figures who were routinely arrested or harassed during his 37-year rule, attended the service while longtime colleagues did not. Notably absent were senior officials from the ruling party that he led for more than four decades, including during the fight for liberation. Just a handful of people in the gathering of some 200 wore party regalia, a sign of how the bookish, combative former leader died isolated from the people he called comrades for much of his adult life. Mugabe’s family earlier had agreed to a government request to bury him at the National Heroes Acre shrine in the capital, but only after a hilltop mausoleum was built to set him apart from the rest. Then the government on Thursday abruptly announced the family had changed its mind, leaving it with scaffolding around the partially completed memorial.",Zimbabwe Leader Robert Mugabe Is Buried at His Rural Home,"September 28, 2019"
251,RAHIM FAIEZ and KATHY GANNON / AP,"(KABUL, Afghanistan) — Afghanistan’s presidential polls closed Saturday amid fears that accusations of fraud and misconduct could overwhelm any election results, while insurgent attacks aimed at disrupting voting in the country’s north and south caused dozens of casualties. An upsurge in violence in the run-up to the elections, following the collapse of U.S.-Taliban talks to end America’s longest war, had already rattled Afghanistan in the past weeks. Yet on Saturday, many voters expressed equal fear and frustration over relentless government corruption and the widespread chaos at polling stations. A deeply flawed election and contested result could drive the war-weary country into chaos. Many Afghans found incomplete voters’ lists, unworkable biometric identification systems aimed at curbing fraud, and in some cases hostile election workers. Ruhollah Nawroz, a representative of the Independent Complaints Commission tasked with monitoring the process, said the problems are countrywide. Nawroz said he arrived at a polling center in the Taimani neighborhood of Kabul, the capital, at 6 a.m. and “hour by hour I was facing problems.” Polls opened at 7 a.m. local time and closed at 5 p.m. after the Independent Election Commission (IEC) extended polling by one hour. Preliminary results won’t be out until Oct. 17, with a final vote count on Nov. 7. If no candidate wins 51 percent of the vote, a second round will be held between the two leading candidates.",Afghanistan Presidential Polls Close Amid Allegations of Fraud,"September 28, 2019"
252,AYA BATRAWY / AP,"(UNITED NATIONS) — Syria’s top diplomat demanded Saturday the immediate withdrawal of American and Turkish forces from the country and said his government reserves the right to defend its territory in any way necessary if they remain. “The United States and Turkey maintain an illegal military presence in northern Syria,” Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem told the U.N. General Assembly. “Any foreign forces operating in our territories without our authorization are occupying forces and should withdraw immediately.” If they refuse, he said, “we have the right to take any and all countermeasures authorized under international law.” There are around 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria on a mission to combat Islamic State group militants. The United States also backs and supports Kurdish groups in the northeast that are opposed to the Syrian government and have fought against Sunni extremist groups. U.S. President Donald Trump had said he wants to bring the troops home, but military officials have advocated a phased approach. Al-Moallem described Turkey and the United States as “arrogant to the point of holding discussions and reaching agreements on the creation of a so-called ‘safe zone’ inside Syria” as if it was on their own soil. He said any agreement without the consent of the Syrian government is rejected. The deal between Washington and Turkey details an area five to 14 kilometers deep (three to eight miles), as well as removal of heavy weapons from a 20-kilometer-deep zone (12 miles) along Syria’s northeastern border with Turkey. The length of the zone has not yet been agreed to by both parties, but will likely stretch hundreds of kilometers. For more than eight years, Syria’s devastating civil war has drawn numerous foreign militaries and thousands of foreign fighters battling for power.

254,EILEEN NG / AP,"(HONG KONG) — Thousands of people gathered Saturday for a rally in downtown Hong Kong, belting out songs, speeches and slogans to mark the fifth anniversary of the 2014 protest movement that called for democratic reforms in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The rally at Tamar Park by the Civil Human Rights Front was approved by police but security was tight, with barriers blocking access to government offices and the Legislative Council building, which was stormed by protesters in July. Demonstrators unfurled a big banner that read “We are back” on a footbridge to the government office. A staircase leading to the bridge was turned into a veritable art gallery of protest art, with posters stuck on every available surface of the walkway. One read “Persevere until final victory.” Some protesters trampled on pictures of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam that were glued to the floor. At one of the gates to Lam’s office, the Chinese word for “hell” and an arrow pointing to the building were spray-painted on the sidewalk. “We think we will lose because their force is so strong,” said one demonstrator, 22-year-old Sang Chan. “But if we don’t do anything now, we’ll have no other chance.” A 32-year-old protester who would give only his surname, Chau, said they hope to wear down the government. “It’s like a marathon to see who gets tired first,” he said. Just before the rally started, a small group of black-clad protesters wearing goggles and masks attempted to scale barricades outside the government offices, prompting riot police behind the barriers to fire pepper spray. The protesters retreated but returned, heckling police and thumping metal fencing. Police used pepper spray again, and the scene repeated several times.

255,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong announced Saturday that he will run in the city’s upcoming district council elections, a statement timed with the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Revolution protests he led in 2014. “I hope to make clear that involvement in small scale community work can make a difference in our city’s politics,” Wong said, standing on a pavement outside government headquarters in the early autumn sun. “I’m convinced democracy will grow from the ground up, from the community. The battle ahead is a battle for our home and for our homeland.” He was addressing a small gathering of media and supporters, including several pro-democracy lawmakers. Supporters chanted “For our homeland!” and “Democracy now!” “Hong Kong is a small city of seven million, and it is facing a battle,” lawmaker Fernando Cheung told the gathering. “Joshua Wong is at the front of the battle lines. It is not an easy thing to do at all. He should be renamed as the David of David and Goliath. His strength is insurmountable.” The 22-year-old will run for a seat on a district council in the city’s south, where he has lived for over a decade. Although such councils are the lowest level of municipal organization, they can potentially be a fast track to the city’s legislature, because the 431 members of district councils across Hong Kong are entitled to elect one of their number to become a lawmaker. Speaking earlier to TIME, Wong said: “The fight for democracy relies on community support.

256,Joseph Hincks,"Saudi Arabia has announced it will open its doors to international tourists for the first time ever, pledging to provide e-visas and visas on arrival to visitors from 49 countries. Travel to the Kingdom has until now been almost entirely restricted to expatriate workers or those with business visas, and to religious pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. That’s about to change, according to a press release issued ahead of a new visa regime expected to be implemented Friday night. Under a new program, Saudi Arabia will welcome overseas visitors outside of the auspices of the Hajj visa. The Kingdom will also relax its strict dress requirement for female visitors, exempting them from wearing the otherwise obligatory head-to-toe robe, or Abaya, in public places and permitting them to travel without a male companion. Tourists will still be required to dress modestly and Mecca remains off-limits for non-Muslims. The announcement is the latest in a series of measures undertaken by Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman aimed at liberalizing the Saudi economy and reducing its dependence on hydrocarbons. But the murder of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi one year ago and crackdowns on women’s rights campaigners in the country have undermined the Crown Prince’s attempt to cast himself as a modernizing reformer.  Saudi Arabia says it expects to attract 100 million foreign and domestic visitors by 2030 and create 1 million new jobs in the tourism sector. The Chairman of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage invited investors to be part of what he billed as “the fastest growing tourism sector on earth” in another press release that announced $27-billion worth of new agreements in the tourism sector. The expected visitor numbers are “very ambitious”, says John Sfakianakis, the chief economist at the Gulf Research Center and probably more “guidance” than cast in stone figures. Saudi Arabia’s ability to deliver on its aims will depend on the competitiveness of its tourist offering with those of regional rivals such as Egypt, Jordan, and the UAE, its global connectivity, and the ease of its visa provisioning system, he says. Regional security will also be paramount. “Geopolitical risks will have to stay low as we know all too well from Egypt’s and Turkey’s recent tumultuous past,” Sfakianakis tells TIME. Among the destinations Saudi Arabia hopes tourists will visit are five UNESCO listed heritage sites including the ancient city of Mada’in, home to the Nabateans before Roman annexation in 106 CE; Riyadh’s Masmak Fortress—which Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Faisal Al Saud seized in 1902 before conquering the regions’ disparate tribes and uniting them to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; and the world’s largest oasis, which has 2.5 million date palms. Jim O’Brien, director of the U.K.-based boutique travel company Native Eye, says he hopes the introduction of tourist visas will boost business for his company—which until now has offered tours of Saudi Arabia to foreigners who already have business visas—but he doesn’t expect the Kingdom to experience the sort of overnight boom that happened in Myanmar. “First of all it needs to raise its profile as a possible holiday destination,” says O’Brien. “For years it has been very closed to visitors, so this may take some time.”",Saudi Arabia Is Opening Its Doors to Foreign Tourists for the First Time,"September 27, 2019"
257,Associated Press,"(GENEVA) — An international conservation group is warning that more than half of the European tree species that exist nowhere else in the world are threatened with extinction. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature said in a new report Friday that 58% of the continent’s 454 native trees are threatened and 15% are “critically endangered” – one step away from extinction. More than 150 experts contributed to the report, which the conservancy called the first comprehensive assessment of the extinction risk of trees in Europe. The findings in the “European Red List of Trees” come amid heightened concern about environmental issues and extinction risks in Europe and beyond. A U.N. report on biodiversity released in May warned that extinction looms for over 1 million species of plants and animals. IUCN, a 71-year-old organization known for its “Red List” classification of threatened species, said that “invasive and problematic” species are the top threat to European trees, with urban development and “unsustainable logging” as other factors. The group’s Europe director, Luc Bas, said “human-led activities” were resulting in population declines of important tree species. Among the recommendations , the report’s authors called for the creation of protected areas, improved monitoring and increased research on the impacts of climate change on forests and individual tree species. The conservancy highlighted Aesculus hippocastanum, or the horse chestnut tree, native to southeastern Europe. The polished brown conker inside its spiked fruit “is perhaps more famous than the tree itself” because of its use in children’s playground games, the report said.","58% of Native European Tree Species Face Extinction, Report Finds","September 27, 2019"

260,Billy Perrigo,"A U.S. military airstrike killed 17 people allegedly affiliated with ISIS in southwest Libya, the military announced Friday—the third strike against militants there this month. The strike was carried out Thursday by U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) in conjunction with the U.N.-backed Libyan Government of National Accord. AFRICOM said it did not believe any civilians were injured or killed. This month’s strikes in Libya are the first in more than a year by the U.S. military, according to the Associated Press. “This ongoing campaign against ISIS-Libya demonstrates that U.S. Africa Command persistently targets terrorist networks that seek to harm innocent Libyans,” said Navy Rear Adm. Heidi Berg, director of intelligence at AFRICOM. “We will continue to pursue ISIS-Libya and other terrorists in the region, denying them safe haven to coordinate and plan operations in Libya.” AFRICOM told TIME that for “operational security reasons” it could not disclose whether the coordinates for the airstrike came from U.S. or Libyan intelligence services. “It is important to preserve operational advantage and not signal to these terror elements when, where, and the various means available to disrupt them,” a spokesperson said in an email. An airstrike on Tuesday killed 11 people and a strike Sept. 19 killed eight—all associated with ISIS, AFRICOM said. Human rights groups have not called the lack of civilian deaths in Thursday’s strike into question. But the U.S. military has understated civilian death tolls in the past. The U.S.-led coalition in Syria killed more than 1,600 civilians during the bombardment of Raqqa, Syria in 2017, according to an investigation by Amnesty International and Airwars. The U.S. has publicly admitted responsibility for only 10% of those. “There has never been a more precise air campaign in the history of armed conflict,” the commander of the Raqqa operation, Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, wrote at the time.

It will have consequences for the world,” Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a wide-ranging, at times apparently extemporaneous U.N. General Assembly speech in which he called Modi’s actions in Kashmir “stupid” and “cruel.” “That’s not a threat,” he said of his war comments. “It’s a fair worry. Where are we headed?” An hour earlier, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the U.N. meeting with a speech that focused primarily on his country’s development, though he warned of the spreading specter of terrorism. He never mentioned Kashmir directly. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region. They’ve been locked in a worsening standoff since Aug. 5, when Modi stripped limited autonomy from the portion of Kashmir that India controls. Modi’s Hindu nationalist government imposed a sweeping military curfew and cut off residents in the Muslim-majority region from virtually all communications. Khan said there were 900,000 Indian forces in the region policing 8 million Kashmiris. “What’s he going to do when he lifts the curfew? Does he think the people of Kashmir are quietly going to accept the status quo?” Khan said. “What is going to happen when the curfew is lifted will be a bloodbath.” He added: “They will be out in the streets.

262,Associated Press,"(VATICAN CITY) — Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good. Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers, physicists and ethicists. A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at “The Common Good in the Digital Age” conference. The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence. The debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage. In his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor. But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor. “If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress,” he warned. “If mankind’s so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.” Organizers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants’ expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues.

263,Joseph Hincks,"After Israel’s Sept. 17 election ended in political deadlock, a top lawmaker from an Arab-dominated political party this week became the first since 1992 to endorse an Israeli candidate for prime minister.  For the past 25 years, Israeli Arab party leaders have declined to endorse a Prime Ministerial candidate in Israel’s coalition-dependent system. But Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, an alliance of Israel’s four Arab-dominated parties, recommended centrist candidate Benny Gantz be given the mandate on Sept. 22. His party, Blue and White, won 33 parliamentary seats, one more than Netanyahu’s right wing Likud, which finished on 32. With 13 seats, the Joint List became the third-largest party in Israel’s parliament. “We will be the cornerstone of democracy,” Odeh wrote in an OpEd published in the New York Times. “Arab Palestinian citizens cannot change the course of Israel alone, but change is impossible without us.” Odeh added that although he was endorsing Gantz for prime minister, he would not join him in a coalition. Despite the historic recommendation, the withdrawal of three Joint List lawmakers left Gantz with just 54 endorsements, compared to 55 for Netanyahu. Late on Wednesday, after fresh talks on forming a Blue and White–Likud unity government broke down, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin gave Netanyahu the first crack at forming a coalition. He faces an uphill struggle. Blue and White has refused to sit in a coalition led by Netanyahu, who faces a pre-trial hearing next week on corruption allegations. Meanwhile, secular nationalist party leader Avigdor Lieberman has declined to recommend either Netanyahu or Gantz for prime minister. With no guarantee Rivlin will give Gantz the mandate should Netanyahu fail, Israel remains mired in political uncertainty, and a third election can’t be ruled out. In a recent interview translated from Hebrew and edited for length and clarity, Odeh talked with TIME about his historic decision, why Arab Israeli turnout rose to above 60% in September, and why a top Blue and White lawmaker urged the Joint List to withhold some nominations for Gantz. That’s an important question. The Nation-State law, and also the incitement that was really extreme under Netanyahu was a very important part of the decision to make the recommendation. But it’s not only that we were looking at the past, we were also looking to the future with President Trump’s “Deal of the Century” and the potential for annexation that would end prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace. This is a main factor in why we are saying no to Netanyahu. There were some lawmakers in Blue and White that preferred Netanyahu to have the first attempt at forming a government. Their thinking is that he will fail and then there will be a lot of public pressure, so they will have a greater chance of forming a government if they go second. But there was no coordination between Blue and White’s strategy and Balad, the Joint List party whose three elected members abstained from recommending a Prime Minister. Balad was opposed to the endorsement in principal. Personally, I’m against the tactic of Blue and White and Balad in this matter. I was in favor of all 13 of our party members endorsing Gantz for prime minister. Not because he was the right candidate to represent our interests, but because this is the only chance for us to get rid of Netanyahu. We also wanted to send a message to the Prime Minister that after his incitement against us, we will be the ones to put him down.",'I Think and Hope That Netanyahu Will Fail.'

The period of his presidency, from 1995 to 2007, marked one of the most profound shifts in Europe, first with the huge expansion of the European Union, and then with the tumultuous aftermath of the Sept.11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington D.C., where Chirac broke sharply with President George W. Bush on the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Perhaps no one witnessed so closely that era as Dominique De Villepin, one of Chirac’s closest aides, who served as his chief of staff in the Elysée Palace, and then as his Foreign Minister, where, on the floor of the United Nations in 2003, he famously told the world that Chirac’s France would not go to war against Saddam Hussein. He would go on to serve as Prime Minister of France from 2005 to 2007. De Villepin spoke to TIME on Friday about his memories and impressions of the leader he calls “a man of history.” The interview has been edited for length and clarity. De Villepin: He was very deeply rooted in French history, France culture, and a vision of France looking at the world. He had a really deep understanding of the people and at the same time he thought that France had something special to say to the world, that France was committed to give answers in an independent way taking into account the different challenges of the world. He really tried to convince George Bush that he had an opportunity to go with the U.N. But progressively we found out that the real objective of the Bush Administration was regime change. So when Chirac realized that he thought it was important to show to the world that the United Nations should not embark without any legitimacy. He thought the risk of a division between the West and the Muslim world was very high, and that France had a role to mediate between those two worlds. Unfortunately after 9/11 the Bush Administration thought the best way was to use military intervention. That is where you come to Jacques Chirac as a man of memory, a man of history, a man of full knowledge of the Arab world. By 2003, we already knew that Afghanistan [France sent troops in Afghanistan after 9/11] was not the success that the international community was awaiting. We knew from Vietnam that military intervention could create a disaster. We knew as French that in Algeria also military intervention was not the option. Contrary to many other leaders, Jacques Chirac had personal experience of war, of fighting in the Algerian War during the 1950s. That made a huge difference in terms of his personal experience and the experience of some other leaders.",'He was a Man of History.'

265,Will Davies / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) –– Australia has given clearance for Singapore Airlines Ltd.’s SilkAir to store its six Boeing Co. 737 Max aircraft in the country, as the global grounding of the jet continues following two deadly crashes within the past 12 months. SilkAir has provided flight plans and the first aircraft is expected to arrive in Alice Springs, central Australia, on Monday, according to Peter Gibson, a spokesman at the Australian government’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The aircraft will be flown by experienced Boeing pilots using a “flight profile which ensures there can be no activation of MCAS,” Gibson said in an email, referring to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System feature linked to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. The pilots have also received training in recovery actions in case an MCAS-related event occurs, Gibson said. CASA has worked closely with aviation regulators in Singapore and Indonesia to review and coordinate the ferry flights, he said. A Singapore Airlines representative said the company doesn’t have information to share about the matter at this point. It is still unclear when the Max 737 will resume scheduled flights as investigations by various authorities around the world are ongoing. CASA said it is following flight profiles for ferrying the aircraft in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In one California facility, the cost of storage runs to about $2,000 a month for a plane, according to an industry veteran.

266,Uma Mishra-Newbery,"Banning abortions isn’t particularly effective. When governments restrict access to abortion, abortions actually continue to take place at roughly the same rate, according to the World Health Organization. But they get less safe. When abortion services are denied or limited, coat hangers, toxic herbal medicines and unqualified practitioners step into the breach, while medical professionals who provide proper care are criminalized. Total bans or restrictive abortion laws in countries like El Salvador, Poland and more recently several U.S. states (including Louisiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri) are designed to control and confine women and girls to stereotypical gender roles. They are an affront to their human rights and dignity and constitute gender discrimination. For transgender and queer people who need abortions, such restrictive laws are the latest in a long line of attacks on their rights and freedoms. Organizations defending human rights have documented the agony and despair stemming from restrictive abortion laws around the world. One of the most harrowing stories is that of “Ms Y”, a woman who was granted asylum in Ireland after being beaten and raped by paramilitaries in her own country. Ms Y tried to kill herself several times when she was told she could not end her pregnancy, which was the result of rape. She was eventually forced to give birth by C-section. At every step of the way, the Irish authorities’ concern for the protection of the fetus trumped any consideration of Ms Y’s mental and physical health. Last year Ireland joined the list of nearly 50 countries that have expanded access to lawful abortion over the last few decades. It was a historic move which came too late for Ms Y, but which will protect others from suffering the same trauma. More recently, we have seen the horrific impact of criminal abortion laws being used to punish people for suffering pregnancy-related complications. In El Salvador, women who suffer miscarriages or stillbirths are routinely “suspected of having abortions” and charged with homicide. In April 2016, Evelyn Hernández, a 21-year-old El Salvadorian woman, suffered an obstetric emergency at home, resulting in the loss of her pregnancy. She was arrested, tried and sentenced to 30 years in jail for aggravated homicide. In February this year, a higher court overturned this ruling and ordered a re-trial — which found Evelyn innocent. However, on Sept. 6, the Salvadoran Public Prosecutor’s Office announced that it would appeal that judgement – showing the authorities’ obsession with charging her under the country’s draconian laws. We must continue to stand up to governments’ efforts to control women’s and girls’ bodies. According to the US-based reproductive health non-profit the Guttmacher Institute’s latest report, as of 2017, 42% of women of reproductive age live in the 125 countries where abortion is highly restricted (prohibited altogether, or allowed only to save a woman’s life or protect her health). Jurisdictions around the world are going to extreme lengths to restrict abortion access — stripping those who can get pregnant of their human rights and bodily autonomy. Any person who does not control what happens to their body cannot be free. The debate around abortion should go beyond whether a person’s life is endangered by pregnancy. At the core of the issue is a person’s right to make decisions about what happens to their body. This right is critical to enabling all people who can get pregnant to fully exercise their human rights and to live their lives with dignity. Governments must not only decriminalize abortion and ensure access to safe abortion in practice, but also create social conditions in which people can make pregnancy-related decisions free of oppression, discrimination, stigma, coercion, violence, lack of opportunities or punishment.",Abortion Bans Strip People of Their Human Rights. Here's Why We Must Stand In Solidarity Against Them,"September 27, 2019"
267,Associated Press,"(LONDON) — British police say they have come up empty-handed in their search for the culprits behind December’s drone disruptions at Gatwick Airport. More than 140,000 travelers were stranded or delayed after dozens of drone sightings shut down Britain’s second-busiest airport for parts of three consecutive days. Sussex Police said Friday the perpetrators had “detailed knowledge” of the airport. The force said detectives had identified 96 people of interest, took 222 witness statements and made 1,200 house-to-house inquiries. Two suspects were arrested but were released without being charged. Assistant Chief Constable Dave Miller said “without new information coming to light, there are no further realistic lines of inquiry.” Police said the incident was not deemed terror-related “and there is no evidence to suggest it was either state-sponsored, campaign or interest-group led.” Contact us at editors@time.com.","U.K. Police Still Have No Idea Who Launched Gatwick Airport Drones That Disrupted 140,000 Travelers","September 27, 2019"
268,Cara Anna / AP,"(JOHANNESBURG) — A body armor-wearing Prince Harry on Friday followed in the footsteps of his late mother, Princess Diana, whose walk through an active mine field in Angola years ago helped to lead to a global ban on the deadly weapons. The prince walked through a mine field and was set to visit the spot where Diana was famously photographed on a similar walk during her own Africa visit in 1997. That field in Huambo is now a busy street. The southern African nation is now years past a grinding civil war and hopes to be land mine-free by 2025. “Land mines are an unhealed scar of war,” Prince Harry said in the town of Dirico. “By clearing the land mines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity.” The Angola country director for mine-clearing organization The HALO Trust said Diana’s visit is still very much discussed today in Huambo after people were struck by her warmth and willingness to acknowledge their devastating 27-year conflict. “The main impact of Diana’s walk in 1997 was the level of global exposure it provided for land mines not only in Angola but the world,” Ralph Legg said. She was a great advocate for a land mine ban, and “her willingness to visit an actual mine field, to place herself right in that context, provided great impetus and gave it a great boost.” The international ban on anti-personnel mines was signed that year and entered into force two years later. So far 164 countries have signed on. “More than 48 million stockpiled mines have been destroyed and 31 countries have been completely cleared of land mines,” The HALO Trust said, while production of the weapons has almost dried up. Prince Harry on his visit also remotely detonated a mine, met with mine-clearing teams and was visiting the orthopedic hospital his mother visited for her meetings with mine victims. “I think that will be a very poignant moment of coming full circle,” Legg said. “Very striking once people compare those images from the two visits to see how far Angola has come.”",Prince Harry Follows in Princess Diana's Footsteps With a Walk Through a Mine Field in Angola,"Updated: September 27, 2019 4:20 AM ET"
269,"Natalie Lung, Adela Lin and Blake Schmidt / Bloomberg","After four months of unprecedented violent demonstrations in Hong Kong and no end in sight, the city’s beleaguered leader has one more thing to worry about: the suspect in the murder case that led to the social unrest could soon walk free. When Chief Executive Carrie Lam proposed amending the extradition law in February, she cited the case of Chan Tong-kai, wanted in Taiwan in connection with the February 2018 slaying of his girlfriend, Poon Hui-wing. Chan was sentenced by a Hong Kong court in April to 29 months for money-laundering after he used Poon’s bank card for ATM withdrawals, but no legal framework exists for him to be returned to Taiwan to face the murder charges. While Lam was forced to eventually say she would withdraw the extradition bill, it wasn’t enough to appease the protesters who’ve since broadened their demands to include an independent inquiry into police conduct and a more democratic form of governance. Meanwhile, Chan could be released as early as October on good behavior, Hong Kong’s security head John Lee said in April. Emails sent to Lee and his department this week went unanswered. “This administration has all the reasons to bring Chan to justice — not only was his alleged conduct serious and lethal, but also it was this administration who presented the victim’s mourning family as a moral motive to push the now-withdrawn extradition bill,” Alvin Yeung, a barrister and pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong, said this week. “Now the chief executive has abandoned the murder case and the victim’s family.” Emails to Ronnie Leung, a lawyer who represented Chan in Hong Kong, and to the Secretary for Justice’s Office went unanswered. Chan and Poon, both Hong Kong residents, went to Taiwan on vacation in February 2018, the South China Morning Post reported. When Poon failed to return, her parents filed a missing persons report and her father traveled to Taiwan to find her, it said. Poon’s decomposed body was found by Taiwan police on March 13, the day Chan was arrested, according to the Post. Hong Kong police said that Chan confessed under caution to killing his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan, the Morning Post said. Chan said that after an argument he strangled Poon and stuffed the body in a suitcase, which he later disposed of in a park, according to the report, citing evidence at his trial. He was remanded in custody for 13 months, it said. Reports gave their ages at around 19 and 20. “I suppose he will be a free man but I doubt he can stay in Hong Kong with such attention on his every move,” said Bernard Chan, a top adviser to Lam and convener of the executive council.",Murder Suspect Whose Case Sparked Hong Kong’s Protests May Soon Be Free,"September 27, 2019"
270,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"This time five years ago, a bespectacled 17-year-old stood atop a podium outside the Hong Kong government headquarters. Holding two microphones in his hand, student activist Joshua Wong addressed thousands of pro-democracy protestors who had taken over all eight lanes of Harcourt Road—a major thoroughfare running through the political district. His speech, punctured by sporadic bursts of cheers and applause, helped to kick off what became known as the Umbrella Revolution. Named for the everyday item that protestors used to protect themselves against police pepper spray, the protest saw the city’s key districts paralyzed for almost three months. Demonstrators demanded that Hong Kong be able to freely elect its own leader. But while the 79-day street occupation captured world headlines, and got Wong on the cover of TIME, the protesters won no concessions. Fast forward five years and unrest is again roiling the former British colony, this time sparked by a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed for the transfer of fugitives to mainland China. The bill has since been withdrawn, but the campaign against it has snowballed into a broader democratic rebellion and challenge to Chinese sovereignty. Wong is just as visible today—in fact, even more so. He is the subject of a Netflix documentary and he has been on overseas tours, drumming up support for Hong Kong’s democracy movement. When the current protests broke out, he was serving jail time for his involvement in the 2014 movement. On the day of his release in June he proceeded immediately to join a rally. Together with members of his political party, Demosisto, he remains at the forefront of Hong Kong’s push for political freedom. TIME spoke to Wong, now 22, to mark the five-year anniversary of the Umbrella Revolution. You were the face of the protests five years ago. How would you describe your role today?

271,Nick Perry / AP,"(WELLINGTON, New Zealand) — Tens of thousands of people marched to New Zealand’s Parliament on Friday, launching a second wave of worldwide protests demanding swift action on climate change. The protests were inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who spoke to world leaders this week at a United Nations summit in New York. A march to the Parliament in New Zealand’s capital Wellington was one of the largest protests ever held there and organizers needed to change their security plans to accommodate the swelling crowd. Several million people took part in the so-called global climate strike last Friday, which was timed to coincide with the U.N. meeting. New Zealand and a number of other countries focused their protest efforts on the second wave, bookending a week in which climate change was at the forefront of the global conversation. Thunberg tweeted that she planned to attend a protest on Friday in Montreal. In Wellington, 18-year-old university student Katherine Rivers said it was great to see young people taking action and personal responsibility by marching. “We need to stop pandering to some of the people who are making money off climate change. The big oil companies, the dairy industry etc.,” she said. “And make a change for the future of these kids that are here.” Rivers, who is studying marine biology and environmental studies, said she hopes to make her career about improving the environment, adding that “hopefully I get to have a career.”",Protesters March in New Zealand in Second Wave of Global Climate Change Protests,"September 27, 2019"
272,YUNG-JIN KIM / AP,"(SEOUL, South Korea) — North Korea said Friday it wants President Donald Trump to make a “wise option and bold decision” to produce a breakthrough in stalled nuclear diplomacy, in an escalation of pressure on the U.S. ahead of an expected resumption of talks. The statement by Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan came days after Trump said another meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “could happen soon” without elaborating. Kim Kye Gwan says he doubts another summit could make any breakthrough because of what he describes as prevailing opinions in Washington that North Korea must first disarm before getting major concessions and that U.S.-led sanctions brought the North to a negotiating table. He accused the U.S. of not acting to implement a joint statement issued after the first summit between Kim and Trump in Singapore last year. He said North Korea, for its part, made “sincere efforts” to build mutual trust and carry out the Singapore statement, citing the repatriation of three American detainees and U.S. war remains. “But I came to know that President Trump is different from his predecessors in political sense and decision while watching his approach to the DPRK, so I would like to place my hope on President Trump’s wise option and bold decision,” Kim Kye Gwan said, using the abbreviation of his country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “I and the DPRK Foreign Ministry will follow the future moves of the U.S.” Kim, in his mid-70s, is a veteran diplomat who led the North Korean delegation at much of the now-dormant six-nation nuclear disarmament talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008. North Korea entered talks with the United States last year saying it’s willing to negotiate away its advancing nuclear arsenal in exchange of U.S. security guarantee and sanctions relief. The North wants a slow, step-by-step disarmament process, in which each of its denuclearization step is matched by a corresponding U.S. reward.

273,Ian Bremmer,"This week’s TIME international cover was of Ian Bremmer’s interview with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he faces a tough reelection battle and reels from scandals. Bremmer also spoke to a prominent Canadian Conservative, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. Below is an edited transcript of their conversation, which took place prior to TIME’s revelations of a photo showing Trudeau in brownface. Ian Bremmer: First give us broadly the case against re-electing Trudeau. I started with a softball right, right? Premier Kenney: Well, the primary concern of Canadians right now is the growing cost of living. His government is contributing to that leading with their carbon tax. And I think their fiscal irresponsibility implies higher taxes down the road. This is an epically challenged government. This is a Prime Minister who has been found twice to be in violation of the law, which was without precedent in Canadian political history. People actually are more shocked about this and the commentary I’ve seen seems to be- Ian Bremmer: In the US we think it’s okay now. Premier Kenney: But I can certainly say from the perspective of people attached to our resource industries that this has been a very damaging government, that has prolonged an extended downturn in what was the great engine of Canadian economic growth and middle-class growth in particular in recent decades, adding massive uncertainty to major infrastructure with the Bill C69. We call it “the no more pipelines law.” Killing the Northern gateway pipeline, killing energy East, surrendering to a US veto on Keystone XL, bungling trans mountain, a prejudicial attack on our exports, Bill C48, the so-called tanker ban… all of these things collectively have done deep damage to an industry that has helped to create enormous wealth for the whole country. Alberta, for example, has contributed over $600 billion net in fiscal transfers to the rest of the Federation over the past five decades because of our energy industry, which has also been a huge engine of social mobility. People with modest levels of education moved to Alberta from unemployment to six figure incomes, a great engine of blue collar and middle-class jobs that is being deeply damaged by a government that’s openly hostile to that industry. So certainly, from my regional, our regional perspective, it would be problematic. Ian Bremmer: In the United States right now, trade has been on everybody’s mind. To what extent are you aligned or not with the Canadian government’s engagement both with Europeans, with the, with TPP minus the United States and perhaps most importantly the now new NAFTA/USMCA? Premier Kenney: Well, obviously we’re deeply concerned, Alberta exports $100 billion a year goods and services to the United States and the trade with United States that is existential for the Canadian economy. So, the continued uncertainty around USMCA is, it is, is deeply problematic. We, but you know, we that this is not, ultimately, it’s up to the challenges with the Democrat caucus and the House of Representatives, I think. And I understand the administration here is doing what they can to try to get this across the line. We certainly hope that happens, but more generally, Canada’s a pro-trade, pro trading nation, there has been very little of the kind of populace pushback against trade that we’ve seen in the United States and some other places. There’s actually a fairly broad cross partisan consensus for this, the NDP being an outlier, but generally there’s a pro-trade consensus in Canadian politics and … and so growing protectionism is a real problem for us.

274,Abigail Abrams,"The United Nations body governing worldwide mail systems will remain intact after it agreed to a compromise on Wednesday that will change the way its postal fees are structured. The decision will keep the United States from leaving the group, which the Trump Administration had threatened to do — a move that many feared would create a chaotic situation of changing prices and mail disruption. President Donald Trump announced last October that the U.S. would exit the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in one year if the group’s 192 members did not agree to reform the rates that countries charge each other when delivering mail and small packages across borders. His main complaint was that the system allowed countries such as China to pay heavily subsidized rates, thanks to a system meant to help developing countries, even though its economy has grown substantially since the system was put in place. As a result, it can sometimes be cheaper for companies in China to send merchandise to the U.S. than for domestic American manufacturers to mail similar items between states. The pressure to achieve reform before the Oct. 17 deadline set by Trump created a situation that one industry executive told TIME earlier this month was “like Trump is having his own Brexit.” But the new deal, reached after emergency talks at the group’s extraordinary congress in Geneva this week, means that particular shipping scramble can come to an end. The U.S. will get to set its own postal rates starting in July 2020 and other countries will be allowed to move toward setting their own fees in 2021, with a five-year period of phasing in new rates. Representatives at the UPU summit eagerly applauded when “Option V” — the final compromise — passed on Wednesday. Bishar Hussein, the director general of the UPU, had warned on Tuesday that a U.S. withdrawal from the group could have dire consequences. But after the consensus was reached, Hussein smiled broadly as he declared the union “stronger than ever before.” Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, said in a call with reporters that the deal was a “huge victory” for American manufacturers and that the change in postal dues would save the U.S. between $300 and $500 million per year. “This agreement will also transform an antiquated, discriminatory system into a modern, resilient one,” he said.",U.S. Avoids Postal 'Brexit' as Universal Postal Union Reaches a Deal,"September 26, 2019"

277,ALMUDENA CALATRAVA / AP,"(BUENOS AIRES, Argentina) — Sandra shows little interest as she slowly shuffles past the structure of beams and ropes built for her to climb on inside her concrete enclosure in Argentina’s capital. Outside are tall buildings and traffic that bear no resemblance to the lush forests where orangutans naturally live. But the unstimulating, solitary life of the 33-year-old orangutan with gentle eyes and dark-red hair will take a turn Thursday when she leaves Buenos Aires for the United States. After a quarantine period in Kansas, she is expected to become the new resident of the Center for Great Apes in Florida, a sanctuary much better suited to her needs. “There she will be able to spend the rest of her life in a more dignified situation,” said Argentine judge Elena Liberatori, who in 2015 ruled that Sandra was legally not an animal but a non-human person who has rights, turning the orangutan who has only known limited concrete enclosures into a focus of world attention. It has been a long journey for Sandra, who was born in a zoo in Germany and moved to Argentina a quarter century ago. She has lived most of her life in a basketball court-sized cell in the more-than-century-old Buenos Aires zoo, in conditions protested by animal rights groups as inadequate. Her release seemed possible in 2014 following a landmark court ruling that she was entitled to some legal rights enjoyed by humans and better living conditions. Then came Liberatori’s ruling. Her release seemed nearer in 2016 when the Buenos Aires zoo closed its doors and officials said that hundreds of its animals would be set free as it was transformed into an eco-park. But Sandra’s caretakers argued that it might be better just to improve the conditions of her cage because sending her to a reserve abroad or releasing her into the wild would put her life at risk. Since Sandra is classed genetically as a hybrid orangutan — half Sumatran, half Bornean — experts fear she might not be able to adapt if sent to Indonesia, where most of the world’s wild orangutans live and there are a number of sanctuaries. Suitable facilities might be found abroad but they would need to be reviewed carefully. Enter the sanctuary near Wauchula, Florida, whose mission is to provide a permanent home for orangutans and chimpanzees rescued or retired from the entertainment industry, research or the exotic pet trade. “Sandra will have bigger compounds and special caregivers” in the Center for Great Apes, which is in a more forested and humid area than Argentina’s capital, said Federico Iglesias, director of the eco-park created after the closure of the Buenos Aires’ zoo. Liberatori’s 2015 ruling was in response to a complaint by an Argentine animal rights group that Sandra was living in inadequate conditions. “With that ruling I wanted to tell society something new, that animals are sentient beings and that the first right they have is our obligation to respect them,” she told The Associated Press. Liberatori has a large picture of Sandra in her office. On the picture is a twig that Sandra passed through the bars of her enclosure to anyone outside willing to interact with her.","After 25 Years in 'Inadequate' Argentine Zoo, 33-Year-Old Orangutan Sandra Heads to Floridian Ape Sanctuary","September 26, 2019"

The Speaker of the House of Commons warned that the country’s political culture had turned “toxic.” In a raucous, bad-tempered debate on Wednesday, Johnson characterized an opposition law ordering a Brexit delay as a “surrender act” and a “humiliation bill” and said delaying Brexit would “betray” British voters. He also brushed off concerns that his forceful language might endanger legislators as “humbug.” Johnson took power two months ago with a “do or die” promise that Britain will leave the European Union on the scheduled date of Oct. 31, with or without a Brexit divorce deal. He’s pitting himself against lawmakers who are determined to avoid a no-deal exit, which economists say would disrupt trade with the EU and plunge the U.K. into recession. Opponents accuse the prime minister of fomenting violence and hatred with his populist, people-versus-politicians rhetoric. Some in Parliament warned Johnson to be more cautious, given the 2016 killing of legislator Jo Cox. The Labour lawmaker was murdered a week before Britain’s EU membership referendum by a far-right attacker shouting “death to traitors.” Labour lawmaker Paula Sherriff brought up the death of Cox — and the death threats many legislators still face — and implored the prime minister to stop using “pejorative” language. There was uproar in the Commons after Johnson replied: “I’ve never heard such humbug in all my life.” Labour legislator Jess Phillips on Thursday accused Johnson of deploying a “strategy to divide.”",U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Faces Backlash for Confrontational Language About Brexit Opponents,"September 26, 2019"
281,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong’s embattled leader faced a barrage of criticism Thursday night as she held a town hall-style meeting in her first overture to the public since pro-democracy protests erupted in the Chinese-ruled city nearly four months ago. The over two hour-long dialogue, which at times descended into emotional tirades and salvos directed at the Beijing-backed leader, comes as Asia’s financial center is gripped by its greatest political crisis in decades. Businesses, especially tourism dependent sectors, have begun to complain of an economic sting as the protracted, sometimes violent upheaval scares off visitors. As she met face-to-face with her critics, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam pledged this was no “PR stunt.” Everyone in the course of these past few months has felt worried and anxious, she said, adding that the responsibility for resolving the unrest lies with her government. Via lottery, 150 members of the public were invited to come and express their concerns. Speaker after speaker blasted Lam’s handling of the situation, questioned why the police were not being held accountable for perceived abuses against protesters and criticized the electoral system. “We are really rather desperate,” one woman said, after insisting telling Lam, “You’ve caused hurt and disappointment.” “Good leaders,” she added, do not “cause society to tear apart.” “Even [Chinese President] Xi Jinping is ashamed of you,” another speaker said, according to local media. Many of the three dozen or so attendees who were called on to speak urged Lam to step down. Others expressed uncertainty about how they could be expected to continue living with weekly pitched battles.",'You've Caused Hurt and Disappointment.'

282,Simon Shuster,"When President Donald Trump asked his counterpart in Ukraine to help investigate Trump’s political opponents, the Ukrainian President and his team did not see the request as linked to the release of U.S. military aid, a senior Ukrainian official tells TIME on Wednesday. “I’m telling you – no, there was no such connection,” says the official, who took part in the call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 but would only discuss it on condition of anonymity. Trump has come under intense criticism in recent days for withholding nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine this summer, days before asking the country’s president to help investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading challenger to Trump in the next presidential race. Congressional leaders have called Trump’s moves an attempt to blackmail a foreign government for domestic political gain, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday to investigate the alleged abuse of power. But the official was adamant that the Zelensky administration, which took office in May, did not interpret Trump’s requests as a form of blackmail aimed at releasing U.S. aid money in exchange for help with investigations of Biden. “We actually had a different suspicion,” the official says. Zelensky and his advisers believed that the White House may have frozen the aid package to Ukraine because of the proposed sale of Motor Sich, a Ukrainian factory that produces engines for missiles and jets, to a Chinese company. The U.S. has objected to that sale on national security grounds, and Trump’s then-National Security Adviser John Bolton urged Zelensky and his government to stop the sale during a visit to Kiev in August. “At the time China was more acute,” as an issue in U.S.-Ukrainian relations, than was the question of investigating Biden, says the official. As part of its response on Wednesday, the White House took the extraordinary step of declassifying and publishing its record of that July phone call between Trump and Zelensky. It appears to show that Trump asked the leader of Ukraine to work with Attorney General William Barr on an investigation of Biden. “The United States has been very very good to Ukraine,” Trump told Zelensky, according to the White House memorandum of the call. “I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good.” He then went on to ask Zelensky to do “whatever you can do” to help investigate Biden.","Ukraine Saw 'No Connection' Between U.S. Aid and Trump Request on Biden, Official Says","September 26, 2019"
283,Elaine Ganley / AP,"(PARIS) — Jacques Chirac, a two-term French president who was the first leader to acknowledge France’s role in the Holocaust and defiantly opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, died Thursday at age 86. His son-in-law Frederic Salat-Baroux told The Associated Press that Chirac died “peacefully, among his loved ones.” He did not give a cause of death, though Chirac had had repeated health problems since leaving office in 2007. Chirac was long the standard-bearer of France’s conservative right, and mayor of Paris for nearly two decades. He was nicknamed “Le Bulldozer” early in his career for his determination and ambition. As president from 1995-2007 he was a consummate global diplomat but failed to reform the economy or defuse tensions between police and minority youths that exploded into riots across France in 2005. Yet Chirac showed courage and statesmanship during his presidency. In what may have been his finest hour, France’s last leader with memories of World War II crushed the myth of his nation’s innocence in the persecution of Jews and their deportation during the Holocaust when he acknowledged France’s part. “Yes, the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state,” he said on July 16, 1995. “France, the land of the Enlightenment and human rights … delivered those it protects to their executioners.” With words less grand, the man who embraced European unity — once calling it an “art” — raged at the French ahead of their “no” vote in a 2005 referendum on the European constitution meant to fortify the EU. “If you want to shoot yourself in the foot, do it, but after don’t complain,” he said. “It’s stupid, I’m telling you.” He was personally and politically humiliated by the defeat. His popularity didn’t fully recover until after he left office in 2007, handing power to protege-turned-rival Nicolas Sarkozy.","Ex-French President Jacques Chirac, Who Opposed the U.S. on Iraq Invasion, Dies at 86","September 26, 2019"
284,Richard Stengel,"If the Russians had tried to find a more inhospitable space for our meeting, I don’t know how they could have succeeded. I was led into a narrow trapezoidal room with one grimy window in a faceless building off Red Square. It was 10 days before the 2016 presidential election, and I was the last State Department official to visit Moscow before the vote. I had been Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy for almost three years, and a big part of my job had been trying to counter the deluge of Russian disinformation that we saw beginning with the invasion of Crimea in 2014. But I was under strict orders from the National Security Council to not bring up Russian disinformation or interference in the U.S. election. No one wanted any hiccups. The two Russian officials seemed to be channeling Putin: chilly, inhospitable, inflexible. They made no effort to be pleasant–or even diplomatic. I brought up Russian harassment of American diplomats. They shrugged. I brought up the forced closing of American cultural facilities. They shrugged. I did not bring up Russian interference in our election. I wish I had. I had come to State after being a journalist for many years and the editor of TIME for the previous seven. My job was to help shape America’s image in the world–I thought of myself as the chief marketing officer for brand USA. But then a funny thing happened. Within a few weeks of my being on the job in 2014, the Russians invaded and then annexed Crimea, the southernmost peninsula of Ukraine. The largest violation of another nation’s sovereignty since Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. And Vladimir Putin lied about it–over and over again. President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry condemned this willful act of aggression and called for sanctions against Russia. I shared their outrage, but I couldn’t impose sanctions or call up troops. What I could do was, well, tweet about it. After all, I was the head of all of State’s communications, and I could marshal department messaging against Russia and the invasion. So I decided to tweet on my own, hoping others would follow. Here’s the first: “The unshakable principle guiding events must be that the people of #Ukraine determine their own future.” As I started tweeting, I noticed something odd. Within the first few minutes and then for months after, I started getting attacked, often by Russian-sounding Twitter handles. A single tweet would get dozens, sometimes hundreds of comments. I soon started getting hundreds of tweets calling me a fascist propagandist, a hypocrite and much, much worse. At the same time, we observed a wave of social media in the Russian periphery supporting the Russian line on Ukraine, accusing the West of being the source of instability, claiming Ukraine was a part of Russia. Who knew that the Russians were so good at this? We didn’t realize or even suspect it at the time, but this tsunami of Russian propaganda and disinformation became a kind of test run for what they did here in the 2016 election. In many ways, these were also the first salvos in the global information war we are living in now. Today, we are all actors in a global information war that is ubiquitous, difficult to comprehend and taking place at the speed of light. When I was at the State Department, there were hundreds of thousands of cyberattacks a day. The Pentagon says it thwarts more than a million malware attacks an hour. About 600,000 Facebook accounts are compromised every day. More than 25 million data records are lost or stolen from businesses each day. And all that doesn’t even take into account the rising tide of disinformation, which is impossible to measure. It is a war without limits and boundaries, and one we still don’t know how to fight. Governments, nonstate actors and terrorists are creating their own narratives that have nothing to do with reality. These false narratives undermine our democracy and the ability of free people to make intelligent choices. The disinformationists are aided by the big-platform companies who benefit as much from the sharing of the false as from the true. The bad guys use all the same behavioral and information tools supplied by Facebook, Google and Twitter. Just as Nike buys your information to sell you sneakers, the Russians bought your information to persuade you that America is a mess. Autocrats have learned the same tools once seen as spreading democracy can also undermine it. Studies show that more than a quarter of Americans recall seeing at least one false story leading up to the 2016 election. Sometimes experience can be a barrier to discovery. My very ignorance of how things worked at State helped me launch something new. I had looked around the department and didn’t see any entity that could push back against all the Russian disinformation and propaganda around Ukraine and Crimea. I called a meeting of the senior leaders of public diplomacy and public affairs. By coincidence, we had a public-affairs officer visiting from our Kiev embassy. He was a big, bearded burly fellow from the Midwest, and after listening to some of the milquetoast comments, he stood up, banged the table and said, “The Russians have a big engine. They are building a compelling narrative. They repeat the same lies over and over. They don’t feel the need to be truthful. We are being outmessaged. We are too timid and reactive.”",We're In the Middle of a Global Information War. Here's What We Need to Do to Win,"September 26, 2019"
285,Ian Bremmer,"It’s been 84 years since a first-term Canadian Prime Minister with a parliamentary majority lost a bid for re-election, but Justin Trudeau was in a position to shatter that record even before those photos hit the Internet. Blackface is a bad look for any candidate, but it’s especially unbecoming for an incumbent who has built his political brand on inclusion, immigration, multiculturalism and a liberal global order. Trudeau now finds himself defending not just the record of his four years in office but also his personal sincerity, all while fending off a Conservative challenger who is smart, likable, polished and even younger than he is. How seriously can anyone take his impassioned speeches about diversity now? “Actions speak louder than words,” Trudeau told me, in a follow-up to an exclusive interview with TIME. “I know that my actions in the past have been hurtful to people, and for that I’m deeply sorry. Our government has acted to fight discrimination and racism consistently over our first term, and if we earn the right to govern Canada again, we’ll move forward to fight racism and discrimination in our next term.” I sat down with Trudeau on Sept. 3 in his Parliament office, 15 days before TIME published on its website what would prove to be only the first photograph of the leader of the Liberal Party in brown- or blackface. That one was taken at age 29, at a costume party at the Vancouver private school where he was teaching. Within hours two more images had popped up from high school, and the Prime Minister was in the midst of a full-on media storm. Polls taken in the days afterward showed scant change in Canadians’ assessment of their Prime Minister, or at least of the party he leads: the Liberals continue to trail the Conservatives within the margin of error. By the time we spoke again, on Sept. 23, the world’s attention had largely moved on, to the attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure, and to Donald Trump’s phone call to Ukraine. The world’s leaders were gathering in New York City for the U.N. General Assembly, and it seemed at least possible that the essential variable facing Canada’s battered Premier was, once again, a global order that shows every sign of moving away from him. Trudeau, the unapologetic globalist in a populist world, has work to do. Four years ago, the firstborn son of Pierre Trudeau–the cosmopolitan leftist who served nearly 16 years as Prime Minister–burst onto the global stage looking every inch the scion of a resurgent liberalism. Trudeau’s party entered the campaign in third place, but when the votes were counted the Liberals had moved in one election from 36 to 184 seats in Parliament, the largest surge in Canada’s federal history. Barack Obama was the leader of the free world, and Trudeau’s first visit to Washington had a glow of a torch being passed. The young children of the Prime Minister and his wife, the former television host Sophie Grégoire, scampered on the steps of Blair House. In the Rose Garden, the Prime Minister quoted JFK. That’s all history. These days when Trudeau strides onstage to greet the leaders of other advanced industrialized democracies, he’s shaking hands with a Brexiteer British Prime Minister, a technocrat struggling to lead an Italy under the sway of a populist protest party, a German Chancellor in decline and a French President cornered by strikes and protests back home. Canada’s “special friend” is now Trump, a U.S. President with kind words for autocrats like China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In the name of principle, Trudeau’s government has run afoul of the last two, with repercussions for both diplomacy and the Canadian economy. When greeting voters, he’s still the Sunny Delight candidate, the charismatic political natural born on Christmas Day, 1971. (Not the ideal birthday, he admits.) And as we sat down for our initial interview in Ottawa, Trudeau was smiling and seemed genuinely eager to talk. But it’s easy to see that four years in power have taken a toll. He’s made his share of mistakes in office, including a political-influence scandal that deeply stained his reputation for openness. An August tracking poll from Angus Reid Institute set his approval rating at 31% and disapproval at 61%.",Justin Trudeau Wants to Keep His Job.

286,Laignee Barron,"The streets are swept, the soldiers rehearsed and the stealth drones ready to be put on display. As Beijing prepares to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1, even the trade war will suspend hostilities, with the U.S. delaying additional tariffs. Yet one key birthday wish will not be granted: an end to the protests that have rocked semiautonomous Hong Kong for over three months. The unrest could reach a turning point come National Day, as China’s ruling Communist Party vows to let nothing spoil its big parade. What began in Hong Kong as a protest against a controversial bill has spawned a rebellion against the city’s political masters in Beijing. The bill that sparked the dissent, which would have allowed extradition to mainland China, was withdrawn in early September, but protesters insist four other demands must be met, including one for fully democratic elections. Weekend protests now routinely turn violent, with black-clad demonstrators hurling bricks and gasoline bombs, smashing train stations and setting garbage alight in the street. In response, police have started making more arrests and on Sept. 23 reiterated a threat to fire live ammunition. It’s rumored that Beijing gave Hong Kong authorities until Oct. 1 to quell the pro-democracy protests, but no amount of deadlines, tear gas or aggression by government supporters has been able to bring them to an end. With the sensitive anniversary looming, some demonstrators have targeted more overtly the symbols of the Chinese government. On Sept. 21, protesters set fire to a Chinese national flag. The next day, they tossed another into the Shing Mun River north of the city center. But the date of modern China’s founding represents the biggest target yet for protesters. In a sign of just how jittery officials are about potential disruptions, the Hong Kong government’s invitation to its National Day flag raising calls for guests to arrive before 7:15 a.m., long in advance of rallies planned for the day. For Beijing, the stakes are high. “Celebrations like the 70th anniversary certainly lend legitimacy to the Chinese Communist Party,” says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Center for China Studies. “The propaganda being projected is that even though the Communist Party does not have ballot-box legitimacy, it is beloved by the Chinese people and is going from strength to strength.” This milestone is particularly significant, as China’s communist state has now outlived the Soviet Union’s 69 years, a staying power it attributes to economic and military prowess. For President Xi Jinping, who abolished term limits last year, the celebrations offer another chance to burnish his credentials as party leader for life. The extravaganza in store includes Xi’s expected address to the nation, cultural performances across the country and fireworks. But the real centerpiece is the military parade. Some 15,000 members of the armed forces will goose-step down Beijing’s Avenue of Eternal Peace as fighter jets fly overhead and 580 pieces of military hardware go on display, including intercontinental ballistic missiles and the new Sharp Sword stealth drone. But as Xi seeks to project an image of Chinese strength and unity, the discontent in Hong Kong offers an alternative picture. “Under Xi Jinping, China’s message to the world is that the China model is superior to the liberal values and the universal suffrage practiced in the West,” says Lam. But this “is belied by the fact that in Hong Kong, the one free place in China, the China model is being rejected.” The situation in Hong Kong also threatens Xi’s long-held ambition of Chinese reunification with the self-governing island of Taiwan. Beijing had hoped the “one country, two systems” framework for semiautonomy in Hong Kong, a former British colony, could be a model for bringing Taiwan back into the fold after seven decades of estrangement. But as the framework has eroded in Hong Kong, popular support for sovereignty among Taiwan’s citizens has swelled further. “We will not become another Hong Kong,” President Tsai Ing-wen pledged in July. An empire beginning to fray at the edges is not the vision Xi wants to present to the world on Oct. 1. It’s still unclear how long China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong will tolerate this state of affairs. Beijing has not followed through on its threats in the summer to activate troops in Hong Kong, and analysts generally agree that the optics of a bloody intervention would have global repercussions, especially for Xi’s ambitions overseas. But with the Communist Party’s pride on the line, a brazen escalation by protesters on China’s National Day could finally prompt serious retaliation.",Will Unrest in Hong Kong Spoil China’s Big Party?,"September 26, 2019"

Frontline said the crown prince made the comments in December 2018, two months after the murder in the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. The prince blamed unnamed officials for acting without his knowledge. The question of the prince’s role in the murder has particularly weighed on the kingdom’s relations with the U.S., a key ally. President Trump has shielded the prince even as Congress condemned Saudi Arabia. Prince Mohammed first spoke publicly about the killing in October last year at an investor conference in Riyadh, calling it a “heinous crime” and promising that the killers would be brought to justice. While the kingdom has said 11 Saudi citizens are being tried for the killing, it never said what happened to the late columnist’s body and it has vehemently denied the crown prince ordered or knew of the killing in advance.

290,"Ben Livesey, Dan Murtaugh and Serene Cheong / Bloomberg","The U.S. is imposing penalties on a handful of Chinese shipping firms for continuing to carry Iranian oil after sanctions waivers lapsed in May. China Concord Petroleum Co., Kunlun Shipping Co., Pegasus 88 Ltd., and COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman & Ship Management Co. have been charged with knowingly violating restrictions on handling and transacting Iranian petroleum. Additional restrictions were also imposed on five executives at the companies, as well as Kunlun Holding Co. and COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co., which own or control one or more of the sanctioned entities. The sanctions bar U.S. citizens and companies from dealing with the shipping companies, effectively blocking them from American banks at the heart of the global financial system. They also block any property or interests the firms or people have in the U.S. and forbid any American assets from being paid or transferred to them. China, the world’s largest crude buyer, continues to import relatively small amounts of oil and petroleum products from the Persian Gulf nation in the face of the White House’s sanctions on the OPEC producer. It took 788,000 tons of crude from Iran in August, compared with a monthly average of 2.4 million tons last year, Chinese customs data show. The sanctions could complicate talks to end the U.S.-China trade war, which resume in Washington next month. The penalties don’t apply to COSCO’s ultimate parent, COSCO Shipping Corp., or any of its other subsidiaries or affiliates, the Treasury Department said in a statement on its website. COSCO Shipping Energy, the parent of COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian), halted trading in Hong Kong on Thursday after the announcement. “This is one of the largest sanctions actions the United States has taken against entities and individuals identified as transporting Iranian oil since our sanctions were re-imposed in November 2018,” Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in the statement. The move is aimed at denying the Iranian regime critical income to engage in foreign conflicts, advance its ballistic missile development, and fund terrorism around the world, Pompeo said. These sanctions are over the transport of Iranian crude oil, and the U.S. is similarly concerned about the export of Iranian refined petroleum products, he said.",U.S. Sanctions Chinese Shipping Companies for Iranian Oil Dealings,"Updated: September 26, 2019 12:43 AM ET"
291,EDITH M. LEDERER / AP,"(UNITED NATIONS) — Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Wednesday that the world is facing “an unprecedented threat from intolerance, violent extremism and terrorism” that affects every country, exacerbating conflicts and destabilizing entire regions. The U.N. chief told a Security Council ministerial meeting on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders that “the new frontier is cyber-terrorism — the use of social media and the dark web to coordinate attacks, spread propaganda and recruit new followers.” He stressed that the response to the unprecedented terrorist threat “must complement security measures with prevention efforts that identify and address root causes, while always respecting human rights.” Russia, which holds the council presidency this month, organized the meeting on cooperation between the U.N. and three Eurasian organizations in countering terrorism — the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Collective Security Treaty Organization, and Commonwealth of Independent States. The United States and its Western allies echoed the secretary-general, stressing the importance of respecting human rights in counter-terrorism operations. “Efforts to counter terrorism that do not respect human rights ultimately breed resentment and violent extremism,” U.S. deputy ambassador Jonathan Cohen said. “When member states or regional organizations conflate terrorism with non-violent political dissent, they do a disservice not only to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, but to our global effort to defeat terrorism.” He said the world is witnessing this “dangerous approach” in Syria, where the government and its Russian allies “justify as legitimate counter-terrorist operations airstrikes on civilians, schools, ambulances and hospitals that have killed over a thousand people since April and wounded over 2,000.” The United States is also “deeply concerned” by the plight of more than one million ethnic minority Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province who have been arbitrarily detained “under the guise of counter-terrorism.”",U.N.

292,MARTIN CRUTSINGER / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — A Bulgarian economist who grew up when her country was a communist nation has been selected to be the next leader of one of capitalism’s premier institutions, the 189-nation International Monetary Fund. Kristalina Georgieva, a top World Bank official, was chosen by the IMF’s executive board on Wednesday to become the fund’s managing director. She succeeds Christine Lagarde who is stepping down to take over as head of the European Central Bank. The IMF is the world’s lender of last resort, providing emergency loans when countries are facing financial crisis. Georgieva takes over at a time when the global economy is slowing and the two biggest economies, the United States and China, are engaged in an escalating trade war. The troubles have raised worries that the global economy could dip into a recession. Last year, Argentina was forced to seek a $57 billion bailout package from the IMF, the largest in the institution’s history. Speaking to reporters after the IMF’s 24-member board approved her nomination, Georgieva cited a host of challenges, from disappointing global growth, to trade tensions and high debt burdens in many countries. “Warning signals are flashing and we must be ready to be tested,” she said. “My immediate priority for the IMF is to help members minimize the risk of crises and be ready to cope with downturns.” Georgieva, who will take over at the IMF on Oct. 1, is the fund’s first leader to come from an emerging market economy rather than one of the traditional European economic powers such as Germany or France. David Malpass, a Trump administration official, was chosen this year to lead the World Bank, continuing a seven-decade tradition in which the head of the World Bank has always been an American and the head of the IMF has been from a European country.",Economist Who Grew up in Communist Bulgaria Is Named New IMF Chief,"Updated: September 25, 2019 10:03 PM ET | Originally published: September 26, 2019"
293,Tessa Khan,"There couldn’t be a greater contrast between the roaring climate strikes all over the world ahead of the U.N. Climate Summit last week and the austere discipline of a courtroom. But these days the same demand is ringing out in streets and in courts: those responsible for the climate crisis must be held accountable. At key moments in our history, notably in fights for racial and gender equality, courts have helped to accelerate social change. Litigation that is driven by those most affected has personalized abstract injustices, put facts on the public record, and exposed misinformation and political spin. It has also given the imprimatur of a formal hearing to the righteous demands of social movements. For the global movement for climate justice, these cases also help to drive a clear narrative of responsibility: as much as we have been made to grapple with our individual guilt, the truth is that governments and the fossil fuel industry bear the real responsibility for this crisis. Moreover, they know—and have known for decades—what they need to do to get us out of it.  The power of litigation to throw a wrench into the dangerous business-as-usual machinery of governments was first made clear in 2015. Less than two years after environmental group, the Urgenda Foundation and 886 Dutch citizens filed a lawsuit against the government of the Netherlands for its inaction on climate change, a Dutch District Court issued a groundbreaking decision. It found that the government’s failure to take reasonable steps to avoid dangerous levels of climate change was unlawful and ordered it to significantly reduce the Netherlands’ emissions by 2020. Although the Dutch government appealed the decision, it agreed to implement the court’s order in response to the intense public spotlight that the lawsuit trained on its climate policy. Since 2015, the Dutch parliament has taken a range of measures to reduce emissions, including closing at least one coal-fired power plant, and has enacted some of the most ambitious climate policies in Europe. In 2018, a Court of Appeal emphatically upheld the original decision, citing the human rights obligations of the government. A final appeal by the government will be decided by the Dutch Supreme Court at the end of the year. At this point, the transformative political impact of the litigation is beyond dispute. Urgenda’s case proved that governments cannot escape legal responsibility for the decades of promises that they have made to address climate change. Those promises date back to at least 1992, when the first international treaty on climate change committed governments to ‘stabilizing’ the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, with rich countries taking the lead. In the 37 years since, we have moved at a terrifying pace in the opposite direction. The concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is higher now than it has been for millions of years and climate change has destabilized and devastated communities all over the world, punishing those who have contributed the least to our planet over-heating.  At the same time, the fossil fuel industry has continued to extract and sell products that its own scientists warned decades ago will have catastrophic consequences for humanity. A recent study confirmed that 71% of all greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 can be traced to just 100 fossil fuel producers. It should therefore come as no surprise that people around the world, from typhoon-devastated communities in the Philippines, to a Peruvian farmer watching local glaciers disappear, to coastal cities in the US at risk of sea level rise, are taking oil and gas companies to court as well.  Since Urgenda’s victory in 2015, cases demanding more ambitious climate action have been filed against governments in Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific. A recent tally concluded that climate change-related lawsuits have been filed in at least 28 countries, and that these cases are being initiated by groups including young people, First Nations, women, farmers, families, migrants, students and organizations working for environmental and social justice. The diversity of plaintiffs reflects the full spectrum of people that have been and will be profoundly affected by climate disruption. In short, they represent all of us. Climate litigation is still a new and evolving phenomenon. We will win some cases and lose others. The law does not always deliver justice. Lawyers will have to work hard to earn legitimacy among communities on the frontlines of climate change. But in the years to come, the demands of those who are fighting for their lives, their rights and their communities will inevitably, inexorably be vindicated. Justice is unquestionably on their side.",Litigation is a Powerful Tool for Holding Those Responsible for the Climate Crisis to Account,"September 25, 2019"
294,Tara Law,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sat beside President Donald Trump on Wednesday as he denied that Trump pressured him to investigate former Vice President and current 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son for his work in the country. The two leaders held a meeting at the U.N. one day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump following reports of the President’s phone call with Zelensky in July. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Zelensky declared that he had not been pressured during the July phone call, and insisted that he does not want to interfere in a foreign election. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House released a summary of the phone call, which is comprised of “notes and recollections” from staff assigned to listen to the call and is not a transcript of the call. In one exchange from the White House memo, Zelensky thanks Trump for his support of Ukraine’s defense. Trump responds, “I would like you to do us a favor though” and asks for Ukraine to investigate a matter related to the 2016 hacking of Democratic National Committee servers. “I think you read everything. I think you read text,” Zelensky said to the gathered reporters on Wednesday. “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic, open elections of U.S.A. No, you heard that we had good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things. I think, and you read it, that nobody pushed me.” “So no pressure,” Trump added. President Trump has been embroiled in controversy since last week, when reports emerged that a whistleblower in the U.S. intelligence community had filed a complaint about a phone call between the two heads of state. An official said that the whistleblower “found troubling” “certain representations concerning U.S. policy” during the call. Trump had previously admitted that he and Zelensky discussed former Biden’s son Hunter Biden during the phone call, but has denied that the call went into inappropriate territory and has insisted there was “no quid pro quo.” The Washington Post reported last week that Trump froze nearly $400 million in aid from the country at least a week before the July 25 phone call with Zelensky. The funds were eventually released on Sept. 11. Taking questions in Ukrainian and English on Wednesday, Zelensky said that he doesn’t have the authority to pressure Ukrainian law enforcement, and did not attempt to do so.",'Nobody Pushed Me.'

295,Madeleine Carlisle,"Researchers with Utrecht University in the Netherlands have uncovered what became of a lost continent that broke off from Africa and wedged itself under Europe, creating mountain ranges that span across 30 different countries from Spain to Iran. “What we have studied is the very complex history of the geology of the Mediterranean region,” Utrecht professor Douwe van Hinsbergen, the lead researcher on the project, tells TIME. Researchers had already known for decades that a continent created the mountain ranges of Europe and the Middle East. “What that continent might have looked like, however, was until now estimated with rather schematic cartoons,” van Hinsbergen says in an email. With the help of modern software, a clearer picture of that hidden continent emerged. “What we have done is use very elegant and useful and free plate reconstruction software, called ‘GPlates’ to systematically piece together what that continent looked like… how many there were… and how [it] broke away from Africa,” van Hinsbergen writes. The project was originally scheduled to take three years, but ended up taking 10. They found that over 200 million years ago, shifting continental plates caused a continent — which the researchers named Greater Adria — to break off from Northern Africa. This created a deep ocean, the last remains of which are the Ionian sea and the Eastern Mediterranean sea between Libya and Turkey. If you look at a map of modern day Africa, van Hinsbergen points out, you can see a “bite” from where the continent broke off, running from Tunisia to Israel. Greater Adria was then pushed under southern Europe, creating the mountains the region is known for today, such as the Apennine Mountains of Italy, the Dolomites of Italy, the Balkan mountains of Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, Kosovo, and Albania. It also created Greece and much of Turkey. “Suppose you have a sweater on with thick sleeves on your arms,” he explains. “And you try to shove your arm below the table… what you will see is your sleeves will crumple up while your arm is going under. That sleeve is the Apennines. That sleeve is Greece. That sleeve is Turkey.” The last intact remains of the continent lie under the Adriatic Sea. He adds that while Greater Adria was “by far” the biggest continent, there were more, smaller continents that broke away from Africa and were consumed under Europe.","Researchers Discover What Became of a Lost Continent, Now Hidden Under the Adriatic Sea","September 25, 2019"
296,COLLEEN BARRY / AP,"(MILAN) — Italian officials sounded an alarm Wednesday over climate change due to the threat that a fast-moving melting glacier is posing to a picturesque valley near the Alpine town of Courmayeur. Courmayeur mayor Stefano Miserocchi closed down a mountain road and banned access to part of the Val Ferret, a popular hiking area outside of town on the southern side of the Mont Blanc massif. Those moves came after experts warned that a 250,000-cubic-meter mass of the Planpincieux glacier was at risk of collapsing. The glacier, which spreads 1,327 square kilometers (512 square miles) across the mountain, has been moving up to 50 centimeters (nearly 20 inches) a day. “There are no models to tell us if it will fall entirely or in pieces,” the mayor told Sky TG24. “We need to keep an eye on the monitoring.” He emphasized that even if a large chunk of the glacier collapses, no residents would be at risk, just the area of road that has been closed. The glacier is located in the Alps on the Grande Jorasses peak of the Mont Blanc massif, which straddles the borders of Italy, France and Switzerland and contains the highest peak in Western Europe. Officials said unusually high temperatures during August and September had accelerated ice melt at the Planpincieux, which has been monitored by the Safe Mountain Foundation since 2013. Environment Minister Sergio Costa said the emergency shows “the necessity and urgency of strong and coordinated action for the climate, to prevent extreme events that risk dramatic consequences.” Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte alerted world leaders to risk of the glacier’s collapse during his address Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, telling them “it is an alarm that we cannot be indifferent to.”",Alpine Glacier at Risk of Collapsing Due to Climate Change Threatening Italian Valley,"September 25, 2019"
297,JOSEF FEDERMAN / AP,"(JERUSALEM) –– Israel’s president on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form a new government, giving the longtime leader the difficult task of breaking a post-election deadlock that has paralyzed the country’s political system. After a divisive campaign, Netanyahu called for a “broad unity government” with his chief rival former military chief Benny Gantz. But he faces an uphill struggle, with his future clouded by a likely corruption indictment and his opponents opposed to sitting with him. President Reuven Rivlin announced his decision late Wednesday after a second meeting aimed at brokering a unity deal between Netanyahu and Gantz ended without an agreement. Standing alongside Rivlin, Netanyahu said it was clear that neither his Likud party nor Gantz’s Blue and White could put together a coalition on its own, and that the only option was to band together. “The two of us cannot form a government unless we are together,” he said. “The order of the moment is a unity government, a broad national unity government that is formed quickly.” He said the country faced great security challenges, highlighted by Iran, economic challenges and the “great opportunity” of settling its borders when President Donald Trump presents an expected Mideast peace plan. In a statement, Gantz appeared to rebuff Netanyahu, citing the Israeli leader’s legal problems. “Blue and White, led by me, does not agree to sit in a government whose leader is facing a severe indictment,” he said. “This issue, among a number of other critical factors, is more important to us than any delegation of ministerial posts or rotation.”",Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu Tasked With Forming a New Government After Tight Election,"Updated: September 25, 2019 10:45 PM ET"
298,AYA BATRAWY / AP,"(UNITED NATIONS) — Iran’s president warned world leaders Wednesday that security in the energy-rich Persian Gulf could collapse quickly with a “single blunder,” and he accused the United States of engaging in “merciless economic terrorism” against his country. On the same day as President Hassan Rouhani spoke, the U.S. ramped up oil-related sanctions on Iran, imposing penalties on six Chinese companies and their chief executives for continuing to transport Iranian crude. Rouhani said in his speech to the annual U.N. General Assembly that the United States was engaging in “international piracy” against his country by re-imposing economic sanctions after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Iran “will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty,” Rouhani said in his highly anticipated speech. “Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.” Iranian state television broadcast Rouhani’s speech live across the country of 80 million people, many of whom are struggling under the weight of crippling U.S. sanctions that have sent the Iranian economy into freefall and limited Tehran’s ability to sell its oil abroad. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Treasury Department announced the latest sanctions, which freeze any assets the firms may have in U.S. jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them, “We’re telling China and all nations, know that we will sanction every violation of sanctionable activity,” Pompeo said at an event for United Against a Nuclear Iran, a lobby group opposed to the nuclear deal. Tensions in the region have been increasing as the nuclear deal unravels under pressure from President Donald Trump. Iran has turned back to expanding its nuclear enrichment program after Trump’s decision last year to pull out of the accord and impose expansive sanctions on Iran despite that Tehran was in compliance with the nuclear deal.",Iranian President Warns That Security in Persian Gulf Could Collapse 'With Single Blunder',"Updated: September 25, 2019 3:54 PM ET"

300,Justin Worland,"To most people, the world’s oceans can seem dark and distant. Billions live in close proximity to them and rarely venture in; billions more live with the world’s bodies of water out of sight and out of mind. But as humans continue to pump global-warming causing gases into the air, oceans are playing a role shaping all of human civilization, according to a new report from the United Nations’ climate science body.  “The world’s ocean and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades,” says Ko Barrett, a vice chair of the IPCC. “The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe.” Changes to oceans caused by man-made global warming have worsened the impact of hurricanes, shifted the food supply and contributed to rising sea levels. Significant no matter where you live on the planet, oceans have absorbed heat in recent decades that would otherwise have led to warmer — and unsustainable — land temperatures, but the report warns that the oceans will soon no longer be able to play that role. Since the 1980s, oceans have absorbed as much as 30% of global carbon dioxide emissions and an even larger share of the excess heat, according to the report. The rate of ocean warming has doubled in the last quarter century since the rate in 1970 as humans as have rapidly grown their carbon emissions. “For decades the ocean has been acting like a sponge,” says Barrett. “But it can’t keep up.” The ocean’s role absorbing carbon and heat is a good news for humans concerned about the warming — at least in the short term — but it’s bad news for the underwater ecosystems disrupted by the change in the resulting change in acidity. Warmer temperatures lead to a spike in marine heat waves, which disrupt life much like a terrestrial heat wave. Meanwhile, higher carbon levels lead to ocean acidification and in turn contribute to a slew of effects, including the destruction of coral reefs. As with most of effects of climate change, the challenges of the changing ocean will not be distributed equally. Coastal communities will face sea levels that rise increasingly quickly. Event with urgent action to stem emissions sea levels may rise by almost half a meter on average by the end of the century; if climate change is left unaddressed sea levels could rise by almost a meter, especially if Antarctic ice sheets collapse. “Sea level rise has accelerated and will accelerate further,” says Regine Hock, a study author and a professor at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. The report also addresses the effects of climate change on what’s known as the cryosphere, or frozen water. Changes to ice coverage in the Arctic are “likely unprecedented for at least 1,000 years,” according to the report. Ice coverage is decreasing every month of the year, and coverage at the lowest point, in September, has declined around 13% per decade since 1979.","The World's Oceans Are in Trouble.

301,Katie Reilly,"Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg on Wednesday was named one of the 2019 recipients of the Right Livelihood Award, known as the “Alternative Nobel Prize,” days after imploring world leaders to take the threat of climate change more seriously in an emotional speech at the United Nations. Thunberg, 16, received the prize from the Stockholm-based Right Livelihood Foundation — established in 1980 after the Nobel Foundation rejected a proposal to create an environmental prize — for “inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts.” The other 2019 Right Livelihood laureates are Aminatou Haidar, a human rights advocate from Western Sahara; Guo Jianmei, a lawyer defending women’s rights in China; and Davi Kopenawa, an indigenous leader in Brazil fighting for indigenous rights and rainforest conservation. The award includes a cash prize of about $103,000. “I am part of a global movement of school children, youth and adults of all ages who have decided to act in defense of our living planet,” Thunberg said in a statement. “I share this award with them.” During the past year, Thunberg has earned international attention for her solo protests over climate inaction that grew last week into a global strike that drew an estimated four million participants around the world. Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize as well, but her candidacy is controversial to some, in part because of her willingness to call out political leaders and shame those who travel by airplane, Reuters reported. If she is selected next month, Thunberg would become the youngest person ever awarded a Nobel Prize — a distinction currently held by Malala Yousafzai, who received the Nobel Peace Prize when she was 17. Thunberg spoke at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on Monday, denouncing world leaders for failing to take action to stop climate change. “You all come to us young people for hope.

303,TED ANTHONY / AP,"(UNITED NATIONS) — Things the beleaguered British prime minister said in his astonishing speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday night: “Pink-eyed Terminators from the future.” ”Terrifying limbless chickens.” ”Your fridge will beep for more cheese.” Things Boris Johnson didn’t address with any substance: Brexit (though he mentioned it in a quip). The British court ruling earlier in the day that said he acted illegally by dissolving Parliament. The take-no-prisoners politics that some say are threatening his premiership and undermining his influence as Britain’s leader. Many didn’t know what to expect Tuesday after the court ruling came down hours before Johnson’s inaugural U.N. General Assembly speech as prime minister. But it’s safe to say few anticipated what he dramatically and energetically delivered: a caffeinated screed about the damage that technology can do if misused — and the glories it can hand humanity if it is delivered properly. In his notably energetic speech, which ended after 10 p.m. as more than 12 hours of U.N. speeches were inching to their end, Johnson said he was optimistic about technology’s future — if humanity finds “the right balance between freedom and control.” The first potential future that Johnson mapped out was decidedly dystopian — one where technology permeates every corner of human life, and not in a good way.

304,Justin Worland,"On Sept. 20, millions of young people around the world took to streets demanding bold action on climate change. When world leaders gathered at the United Nations Climate Action Summit three days later, the activists’ demands were left unmet. The problem, by and large, isn’t that countries are denying the science of climate change. Instead, the issue is the entanglement of a slew of other issues that have gotten in the way: China’s trade war with the United States; the European Union’s Brexit distraction; and long-time concerns about economic development exacerbated by a lack of support from the U.S, among others. This new reality has left the most concerned leaders grappling for the next move. Some called this week to give preferred trading status to other countries pursuing aggressive climate action. Others called for a broad campaign to shame countries that have failed to meet their commitments. The details varied, but as the dust settled on the summit it seemed clear to many that more aggressive climate measures would not be achieved without a paradigm shift, moving from diplomatic cooperative engagement to forceful pushes. “What I see is governments still reluctant in changing the regulations, in adopting the adequate tax policies and in making the other moves to allow the markets to work in the way markets will inevitably work,” U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at a lunch for business leaders Monday, departing from his typical diplomatic tone. “Make sure that governments feel the heat.” Guterres, who convened the summit, had for months demanded that countries attend the conference with plans of action to address climate change and not just offer rhetoric. Among his calls were demands that countries tax pollution and commit to ending the construction of new coal-fired power plants. Some countries stepped up to the plate. More than 75 leaders pledged to eliminate their carbon emissions by 2050, though mostly from smaller economies, and a handful of European countries touted their commitment to spend billions to fund climate programs in developing countries. But the world’s biggest economies were largely absent. The U.S. and Brazil brought nothing to the table while China promised to follow through on its previous commitments and India said it would increase its deployment renewable energy, statements that fell short of hopes. It’s this reality that has pushed forward long-simmering discussions about how to punish inaction. On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated his support for using the international trade regime to penalize countries that failed to live up to the Paris Agreement. “We need to have a trade agenda that serves the climate agenda,” he said. “I don’t want to see new trade negotiations opened with countries that are running counter to the Paris Agreement.” Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries are supposed to update and strengthen their pledges to reduce emissions made in the lead up to deal by the end of next year, and, behind the scenes, climate policy experts say that the political environment is such that countries that come to the table may include new trade restrictions.",Global Action on Climate Change Blocked By Political Disruptions,"September 25, 2019"
305,James Grant,"On Sept. 24, the U.K. Supreme Court handed down its most politically explosive judgment in its almost ten years of existence. No one could confidently predict which way it would go, right up until the last moment. Then, as Lady Hale, the Court’s President, calmly read out the summary of the judgment, there was a gradual realization that it went further than most lawyers had expected. The conclusion was unanimous. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to “prorogue,” or suspend, parliament for five weeks was unlawful. On the advice of Johnson, Queen Elizabeth II had agreed to prorogue parliament ahead of the Queen’s Speech, the formal beginning of the parliamentary year. The government claimed it was a routine suspension to give it time to set out its domestic priorities. But critics said it was intended purely to deny parliament the ability to alter or block the Brexit process ahead of the Oct. 31 withdrawal date. The abnormally long duration of parliament’s suspension was, some critics argued, unconstitutional and unlawful. Yesterday, the highest court in Britain sided with that view. The reaction was more predictable than the ruling. Some critics in Johnson’s Conservative party and the media portrayed the Court as making a “power grab,” elbowing its way into territory that has traditionally been reserved for the Prime Minister. For some, this was a step too far—a step on the road toward a more politicized Court, along the lines of its U.S. counterpart. But that criticism rests on a misunderstanding about the role of judges in the U.K.’s unwritten constitution. That role did not change when the highest court in the land was symbolically renamed “the Supreme Court” in 2009, and moved into a new home opposite the Houses of Parliament. The British Supreme Court does not have the power, for example, to review legislation as the Justices do in the U.S. The U.K. Supreme Court’s decision was not a power grab. It was consistent with long-established constitutional principles, which hold that all executive powers have limits that are determined by the courts. In one sense, that’s all this case was about. It was an ordinary case of judicial review of executive power, albeit in extraordinary circumstances. The circumstances are complicated by the fact that the authority to prorogue parliament is held by the Queen, and in practice is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister, in what’s known as a “prerogative power” of the Crown. The lawyers for the Prime Minister argued that the exercise of this power was solely a matter of politics, immune from judicial review (“non-justiciable,” to use the jargon). But the Supreme Court rightly rejected that argument. It recognized that there’s nothing unprecedented about a court of law determining the limits to the Crown’s powers. That’s clear from a long line of judicial precedents dating back over 400 years, such as the Case of Proclamations in 1610, when the court held that the King, then James I, “hath no prerogative, but that which the law of the land allows him.” What was unprecedented about this case was that the courts had never before been called upon to review the Crown’s power to prorogue parliament. This lack of precedent meant the Court had to develop the law in a new direction. But in doing so it drew attention to Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s famous observation in 1995: “the constitutional history of this country is the history of the prerogative powers of the Crown being made subject to the overriding powers of the democratically elected legislature as the sovereign body.”",What Boris Johnson's Defeat in the U.K. Supreme Court Means,"September 25, 2019"

Trump urged the sides to resolve their differences even as he gushed over Modi, saying he was as popular as American rock legend Elvis Presley. Khan had a much different description for Modi when talking to reporters Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly in New York: “racist.” The nuclear-armed rivals, which have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, have been locked in a worsening standoff since Aug. 5, when Modi stripped the portion of Kashmir that India controls of its limited autonomy. Modi’s Hindu nationalist-led government imposed a sweeping military curfew and cut off residents in the Muslim-majority region from virtually all communications. “For 50 days, the people of Kashmir have been locked down by 900,000 soldiers,” Khan said, describing mass arrests, non-functioning hospitals and “a total news blackout.” “Eight million people in an open jail is unprecedented in this day and age. … The biggest worry is what happens once the curfew is lifted? We fear with 900,000 soldiers there, there will be a massacre,” Khan said. “There’s a potential that two nuclear-armed countries will come face to face at some stage.” India and Pakistan’s conflict over Kashmir dates to the late 1940s, when they won independence from Britain.

307,Joshua Goodman / AP,"(NEW YORK) — The Trump administration is more than tripling U.S. support for pro-democracy work in Venezuela and for the first time directly funding opposition leader Juan Guaidó as he attempts to set up a government to rival the socialist administration of Nicolás Maduro. The $52 million in new aid was to be announced Tuesday by Mark Green, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, following a meeting in New York with Guaido’s envoy Carlos Vecchio, who the Trump administration recognizes as Venezuela’s ambassador in Washington. The funding was mostly repurposed from humanitarian aid originally earmarked for Honduras and Guatemala that President Donald J. Trump cut last year after over what he said was the Central American countries’ failure to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. The funding boost represents a major doubling down in U.S. support of Guaidó, who has drawn recognition as Venezuela’s rightful leader by more than 50 nations. But he has been unable to translate the international support and popularity at home into real power capable of helping regular Venezuelans suffering from hyperinflation and an economic collapse akin to the destruction wrought by war. A senior Trump administration official said the new U.S. aid package seeks to address that deficit, providing about $19 million to pay for secure communication devices, travel stipends and training in budget planning and other tools to effectively govern should they manage to force Maduro from power. The U.S. official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to publicly discuss details of the aid package. The Trump administration had budgeted $9 million during the 2017 fiscal year and $15 million in 2018 to promote free press, the monitoring of human rights abuses and anti-corruption initiatives — work by civil society groups that will be greatly expanded by the additional funding. A U.S.-backed uprising in April by a cadre of security forces failed to break the armed forces’ loyalty to Maduro. The embattled socialist in recent days has gone on the offensive, announcing a deal with a small group of minority opposition parties to reshape the nation’s electoral council and other reforms after talks with Guaidó sponsored by Norway broke down. Trump, speaking at the United Nations on Tuesday, delivered a sharp warning to Venezuela, declaring that he awaited the day “when Venezuela will be free and when liberty will prevail throughout this hemisphere.” He also called socialism “the wrecker of nations” and “destroyer of societies.”",Trump Administration Set to Triple Pro-Democracy Aid in Venezuela,"September 24, 2019"
308,Ciara Nugent,"More than 44 years after the death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, a long-simmering political battle over his resting place may finally be at an end. Spain’s Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday that the government can exhume the former leader, against his family’s wishes. Spain’s congress had approved a controversial plan to remove Franco’s remains from the Valley of the Fallen, a sprawling mausoleum just outside of Madrid, in 2018. Acting Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s centre-left Socialist Party have long argued that the dictator should not lie in a grand public monument, a monument he shares with some 34,000 victims of the three-year civil war he started by overthrowing Spain’s democratically-elected government in 1936. Many of the bodies belong to Franco’s opponents and most have never been identified. But Franco’s grandchildren mounted legal challenges to both the exhumation and the government’s choice of reburial grounds — a public cemetery on the outskirts of Madrid — arguing that they have a right to choose what to do with their grandfather’s remains. The court’s controversial ruling comes at a time of political chaos in Spain, just a week after Sánchez was forced to call Spain’s second election of 2019  — and fourth in four years — when he was unable to get enough support in congress to form a government. Here’s what to know about the controversy over Spain’s exhumation of Franco. General Francisco Franco led a military uprising against Spain’s government in 1936. The uprising ignited a three-year civil war, during which some 500,000 people died. Franco’s forces won the war and he went on to install a far-right nationalist dictatorship, which he led until his death in 1975. Early on, Franco’s regime violently repressed political dissent, disappearing 140,000 people in the years during and after the Civil War. In 2008 the regime’s human rights abuses were declared crimes against humanity. The regime also persecuted minorities, tightly censored the media, and imposed strict gender roles on women for decades.

309,Associated Press,"(UNITED NATIONS) –– President Donald Trump is suggesting that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi be known as the “father of India” because of his success in uniting the nation. Trump had nothing but laudatory words for Modi as the two met Tuesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly for their second meeting in three days. Trump had traveled to Houston, Texas, on Sunday to join 50,000 Indian Americans in a big Texas welcome for Modi. In his meeting with Modi on Tuesday, Trump took note of how Modi was cheered in Texas by members of the Indian diaspora, saying it was like Elvis had returned. Trump says the U.S. and India are close to signing a trade agreement that would set the stage for a more comprehensive deal down the road.

310,Associated Press,"(UNITED NATIONS) –– President Donald Trump is seeking to assure British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that he’ll win future court battles after his suspension of Parliament was ruled illegal. Trump says his administration lost a series of rulings during his first months in office, but it has since won major cases regarding funding for the border wall and granting asylum. Trump says that after the initial losses, “we’ve almost run the table.” He says “we’ve won a lot of decisions.

311,Madeleine Carlisle,"In his third-ever address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump spoke in support of his administration’s “America First” policies, arguing that the future belongs to “patriots” over “globalists.” Speaking before the U.N.’s 193-member body, Trump used his platform to argue in favor of his Administration’s withdrawal from multiple internationally agreed-upon treaties, including the Iran nuclear deal and the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. “Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first,” he said. “The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.” President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal — formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — in May of 2018. The deal was one of the principal diplomatic achievements of the Obama administration, agreed upon with six countries: The U.S., France, the United Kingdom, China, and Russia. In exchange for Iran restricting its ability to develop nuclear weapons, sanctions against the country would lessen. Trump had long been critical of the deal, arguing it would not successfully prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. Since the U.S. has withdrawn from the treaty and intensified sanctions on Tehran — going against the wishes of key U.S. allies France, Germany, and the U.K. — tensions between the two countries have risen and intensified in recent months. In April, Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw its support of the Arms Trade Treaty in a speech before the National Rifle Association. The treaty, which went into effect in 2014, regulates international trade of conventional weapons, including small arms. The NRA has long argued that it posed a threat against the Second Amendment. Democratic leaders condemned the move, including Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Senator Bob Menendez, who said in a statement, “The Arms Trade Treaty has no impact on Americans’ Second Amendment rights, nor imposes any restrictions on U.S. arms exports… it is disturbing to see this administration turn back the clock on the little progress we have made to prevent illicit arms transfers.” Trump’s foreign policy approach has repeatedly pushed back against multilateralism: He has also withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement, UNESCO, negotiations on the Global Compact on Migration, and the U.N.’s Human Rights Council. So far, Trump’s time at the U.N. has been a lonely one. He briefly stopped by the main hall of the U.N. to discuss global climate change, but then headed to a separate meeting on global violations of religious freedoms. He is scheduled to spend much of his three days at the U.N. in one-on-one meetings with other leaders.","Trump Defends 'America First' Policy in U.N.

312,RAF CASERT / AP,"(BRUSSELS) — Google won a major case in the European Union on Tuesday, when the bloc’s top court ruled that the U.S. internet giant doesn’t have to extend the EU’s “right to be forgotten” rules to its search engines outside the region. The case stems from a 2014 ruling that said people have the right to control what appears when their name is searched online. They can ask Google, for example, to remove a link. The French privacy regulator then wanted that rule applied to all of Google’s domains, even outside the EU, and asked the EU’s top court for advice. The European Court of Justice said Tuesday that there “is no obligation under EU law for a search engine operator” to extend the rule beyond the EU states. It said, however, that a search engine operator must put measures in place to discourage internet users from going outside the EU to find that information. The decision, which matches a preliminary opinion in January from the court’s adviser, highlights the need to balance data privacy and protection concerns against the public’s right to information. It also raises questions about how to enforce differing jurisdictions when it comes to the borderless internet. In a reaction to the ruling, Google’s Senior Privacy Counsel Peter Fleischer said “it’s good to see that the Court agreed with our arguments” and added that Google had worked hard “to strike a sensible balance between people’s rights of access to information and privacy.” The European Commission noted that the court again confirmed that the “right to be forgotten” exists in the EU. The 2014 ruling that people in the EU have the right to control what appears when their name is searched online forced Google to delete links to outdated or embarrassing personal information that popped up in searches within the 28-nation bloc.",Google Wins Case in E.U.

313,Brian Bennett,"President Trump got the smaller room. On Monday, the world’s leaders convened in the grand, main hall of the United Nations to discuss the changing global climate. Donald Trump, who wasn’t scheduled to attend the day’s headline event, popped by briefly after it started, then headed to a separate meeting on global violations of religious freedom. His quick, ineffectual appearance made plain a hard truth about Trump’s presidency: he has global goals but is unwilling to build broad coalitions to accomplish them. Previous Presidents have set the agenda for major international gatherings like the United Nations General Assembly. President Bush used the moment to make his flawed case for invading Iraq. President Obama used the venue to get countries to bring policy initiatives to address climate change and agreements to take in more refugees. Trump spoke to the full body on Tuesday and, as a senior administration official said, wanted to use the opportunity to highlight the U.S. as “a positive alternative to authoritarianism” and “showcase the administration’s commitment to upholding democracy and protecting religious freedoms.” Reading his speech from a TelePrompter in steady, measured tones, Trump delivered a critique of international institutions and told the leaders in the room to put the interests of their own people and their own country first. “If you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. And if you want peace, love your nation,” Trump said. But those fundamental principles aren’t driving the agenda for the week, and Trump hasn’t gotten other countries to sign on to major initiatives to back them. Instead, Trump will spend most of his three days in New York meeting one-on-one with other world leaders. “It’s just not very Trumpian to say, “Let me gather 30 of the world’s leaders together,'” James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation and a former member of the Trump transition team, tells TIME. “Trump’s comfort zone is in the bilateral talks. That’s his sweet spot,” Carafano says. Trump touts his personal relationships with authoritarian world leaders such as North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. But Trump hasn’t marshaled those one-on-one relationships to deliver on his broader policy objectives. Trump wants to force China to use fair trade practices. He wants to bring U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. He wants to pressure Iran to stop its malign activity in the Middle East. Those are all initiatives that Trump could advance using the traditional American convening power to convince other countries to act along with him. “In many areas, the things he’s ostensibly said are his priorities in the foreign policy realm have actually been impeded because he’s pursued a unilateral approach,” says Alex Pascal, a national security expert who was a senior policy advisor in the U.S. Mission to the U.N. during the Obama administration. “U.S. standing in the world is a real material asset to U.S. presidents in pursuing policy objectives, and the lack of it hurts America’s ability to advance its interests and values,” says Pascal.","For Trump, It's Lonely Going It Alone","Updated: September 24, 2019 11:10 AM ET"
314,Billy Perrigo,"The U.K.’s Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Boris Johnson’s request for the Queen to suspend Parliament was “unlawful, void and of no effect,” in a severe blow for the British Prime Minister. The ruling means lawmakers are free to reconvene, possibly as soon as Wednesday, allowing them to scrutinize Johnson’s Brexit preparations ahead of the U.K.’s Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union. They had previously been scheduled to return on Oct. 14. Parliament, the Supreme Court said, “has a right to a voice.” Supreme Court President Brenda Hale continued: “No justification for taking action with such an extreme effect has been put before the court.” “The Court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue [suspend] Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.” The opposition Labour Party and the Scottish National Party both responded by calling for Johnson to resign. Parliament’s speaker, John Bercow, said lawmakers must “convene without delay,” adding he was making arrangements for lawmakers to return on Wednesday morning. Before the ruling, the government said it would “abide by” whatever the court decided, and on Tuesday morning Johnson told the BBC he would respect the ruling. But Johnson has not ruled out suspending Parliament for a second time. The Supreme Court said it was for lawmakers — not the Prime Minister — to decide what to do next. Johnson is currently in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. He was scheduled to return late Wednesday, but is reportedly planning to fly back earlier to address the crisis. Johnson advised the Queen to suspend Parliament on Aug. 28, and Parliament was formally suspended for five weeks on Sept. 9. The suspension meant that lawmakers have since been unable to sit in Parliament or work on committees scrutinizing the government. Many observers said Johnson’s team took the decision to suspend Parliament in order to prevent lawmakers from blocking a “no deal” Brexit, which Johnson wanted to keep as a possibility in Brexit negotiations with the E.U. But days before the suspension officially began, lawmakers launched a concerted effort to take over the parliamentary schedule, and passed a law making a “no deal” Brexit illegal.",U.K. Supreme Court Rules Boris Johnson's Suspension of Parliament Was Unlawful,"September 24, 2019"
315,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Just outside a Hong Kong subway station, dozens are gathered around a projector screen, transfixed. They watch footage of riot police advancing towards protestors. After 16 weeks of protests, many in the audience know this type of scene well. They are gathered — along with people at about a dozen street corners, parks and other public spaces across Hong Kong — for screenings of Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom, an Oscar-nominated documentary about Ukraine’s anti-government protests of 2013. The three-month-long protest, centered on a square in the capital Kyiv, successfully toppled the country’s pro-Russia leadership. Hongkongers are drawing parallels between the Euromaidan movement, as Ukraine’s uprising was called, and their own struggle for democracy. Both were sparked by a single controversy — in Hong Kong, a detested (and now withdrawn) extradition bill, in Ukraine, the president’s refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union. But each quickly snowballed to include much broader demands for greater political freedom. The overall political situation in the movie resonates with Hongkongers, as Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University points out. “Ukrainian protestors felt that their leaders were puppets of the Russian government, in the way that many in Hong Kong see theirs as puppets of Beijing,” he tells TIME. The pace of both movements also has similarities. “The way the protests developed in Ukraine is very similar to in Hong Kong, starting out peacefully and then becoming more and more radical and extreme,” says Hansa, a 23-year-old protestor who organized a screening of Winter on Fire, and who, like many here, believes that Euromaidan is a case study to learn from. There are other parallels.

316,JONATHAN LEMIRE and DEB RIECHMANN / AP,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump made his political priorities clear Monday within an hour of arriving at the United Nations for a three-day visit: He breezed by a major climate change summit to focus instead on religious persecution, an issue that resonates with his evangelical supporters. The climate summit, a centerpiece of this year’s U.N. schedule, was not on Trump’s agenda at all. But he stopped in to observe for about 15 minutes before heading to what he saw as the main event, a meeting on protecting religious freedom. Trump said it was an “urgent moral duty” for world leaders to stop crimes against faith, release prisoners of conscience and repeal laws restricting religious liberty. “Approximately 80% of the world’s population live in countries where religious liberty is threatened, restricted or even banned,” Trump said, adding that when he first heard the statistic, he didn’t believe it and asked for verification. Trump’s speech Monday extends a long-running focus on international religious freedom that speaks to a key priority of his evangelical base. His administration has hosted annual meetings on the topic in Washington, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced during this year’s event that he would create an international alliance dedicated to the issue. Underscoring the importance of Trump’s action on the issue to evangelical voters who are critical to his 2020 reelection bid, one prominent evangelical backer Dallas-based pastor Robert Jeffress lauded Trump for focusing on religious freedom instead of climate change. “What president in history would have the guts to do what President Trump is doing?” Jeffress, who was set to be in the audience for Trump’s speech, said on Fox News. “And it’s this kind of leadership that is absolutely infuriating the president’s enemies, but it’s also energizing his base, especially his religious base of voters.” Trump listed his administration’s efforts on religious freedom and declared, “We’ve done a lot.”","At the U.N., Trump Focuses on Religious Freedom not Climate","September 24, 2019"
317,NINIEK KARMINI / AP,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — At least 20 people were killed Monday, including three shot by police, in violent protests by hundreds of people sparked by rumors that a teacher insulted an indigenous student in Indonesia’s restive Papua province, officials said. An angry mob torched local government buildings, shops and homes and set fire to cars and motorbikes on several roads leading to the district chief’s office in Wamena city, said Papua police chief Rudolf Alberth Rodja. Papua military spokesman Eko Daryanto said at least 16 civilians, including 13 from other Indonesian provinces, were killed in Wamena, mostly after being trapped in burning houses or shops. He said at least one soldier and three civilians died in another protest in Jayapura, the capital of Papua province. About 65 civilians were injured in Wamena and five police officers were critically injured in Jayapura, he said. Television video showed orange flames and black smoke billowing from burning buildings in Wamena. Rodja said the protest was triggered by rumors that a high school teacher in Wamena who is not from Papua called an indigenous Papuan student a “monkey” last week. He said a police investigation did not find any evidence of racism against the student, and that false rumors have been spreading among students in other schools and native communities.",Twenty People Have Been Killed and Seventy Hurt After Protests in Indonesia's Papua Province,"September 24, 2019"
318,FOSTER KLUG / AP,"UNITED NATIONS — U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that a fourth summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “could happen soon” as diplomacy over the North’s nuclear program has stalled. Trump didn’t elaborate in comments to reporters at the United Nations in New York, and it was not clear if concrete plans were in the works for another summit meant to address a growing diplomatic impasse over the North’s development of nuclear-armed missiles targeting the U.S. mainland. There is extreme interest, especially in Japan and South Korea, in whether Trump and Kim can settle differences that have led to the stalemate despite past high-profile meetings. The sides have failed even to set up lower-level negotiations on restarting talks. At the heart of the dispute is the impoverished North’s desire for relief from harsh sanctions imposed as it has boosted its nuclear and missile capabilities. Washington, however, is demanding that Pyongyang first take more comprehensive steps to dismantle a nuclear program that has been painstakingly built over decades. In recent months, the North has displayed its unhappiness with the tough U.S. stance in a series of short-range weapons tests that experts see as an attempt to increase pressure on Washington and Seoul and build leverage ahead of any new talks. Trump has repeatedly played down tests of weapons that could strike allies South Korea and Japan, which host tens of thousands of U.S. troops. He also has trumpeted the strength of his relationship with Kim. Trump is the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader and the first to set foot on North Korean territory. As he arrived at the U.N. for the start of the annual General Assembly of world leaders, Trump responded to a question about when he planned to meet with Kim, saying, “It could happen soon.

320,EDITH M. LEDERER and JILL LAWLESS / AP,"(UNITED NATIONS) — Britain, France and Germany joined the United States on Monday in blaming Iran for attacks on key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, but the Iranian foreign minister pointed to claims of responsibility by Yemeni rebels and said: “If Iran were behind this attack, nothing would have been left of this refinery.” Fallout from the Sept. 14 attacks is still reverberating as world leaders gather for their annual meeting at the U.N. General Assembly and international experts continue, at Saudi Arabia’s request, to investigate what happened and who was responsible. The leaders of the U.K., France and Germany — who remain parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal — said in a statement that “there is no other plausible explanation” than that “Iran bears responsibility for this attack.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said late Sunday while flying to New York that the U.K. is now “attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran” for the attacks by drones and cruise missiles on the world’s largest oil processor and an oil field. He said the U.K. would consider taking part in a U.S.-led military effort to bolster Saudi Arabia’s defenses. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, denied any part in the attacks. He said Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who claimed responsibility, “have every reason to retaliate” for the Saudi-led coalition’s aerial attacks on their country. He also stressed that on the eve of President Hassan Rouhani’s visit to the United Nations — which sits in the middle of New York City — “it would be stupid for Iran to engage in such activity.” France has been trying to find a diplomatic solution to U.S.-Iranian tensions, which soared after the Saudi attacks. French President Emmanuel Macron said at a news conference at the U.N. that he planned to meet separately with both Trump and Rouhani over the next day and would work to foster “the conditions for discussion” and not escalation.","Britain, France and Germany Join U.S. in Blaming Iran for Attacks on Saudi Oil Facilities","Updated: September 23, 2019 5:03 PM ET"
321,Ian Bremmer,"Israel held repeat elections last week after having gone to the voting booths just 5 months prior. It was the first time the country has ever had to hold consecutive elections, prompted by Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu’s inability to pull together a right-wing coalition last time around. Rather than let opposition parties attempt to form a coalition when he failed, Bibi dissolved parliament and forced the country back to the polls. He was rewarded with a second-place showing, leaving him in an even worse position than he was back in April. Why It Matters: Because this looks like the end of the reign of “King Bibi”—as he is referred to by both supporters and detractors alike—who surpassed David Ben-Gurion this summer to become the longest-serving Prime Minister in Israeli history. Netanyahu is a polarizing figure in Israeli society, more so in recent years as he has tacked to the right to retain his grip on power, employing racist language against the country’s Arab citizens, attacking the media, police and the Supreme Court, and vowing to annex parts of the West Bank to appease his ultra-religious and far-right political partners (more on that below). Bibi is an unabashed political opportunist, but that same political opportunism has also allowed him to forge strong personal relationships with Israel’s Arab neighbors—particularly those that share his view of the existential threat posed to the region by Iran—as well as with the Trump administration. And while those personal relationships have benefited Bibi politically, they’ve also benefitted Israel a great deal, too. But back to Israeli domestic politics. Over more than a decade in power, Netanyahu has presided over a country where the issue of how religious “the Jewish state” should be has come to the forefront of Israeli politics. This is not a new fight by any means—issues like the lack of civil marriages and the banning of public transport in major cities on Saturdays in honor of the Jewish Sabbath have long been sore points for the country’s non-ultra-Orthodox majority who feel forced to live by the rules of the country’s more religious elements. But the most explosive fight of late has come over the issue of mandatory conscription of the country’s ultra-Orthodox population. Most men in that community who choose to study the Jewish scriptures full-time receive exemptions from military service, a practice that Israel’s Supreme Court has in the past ruled unconstitutional for being discriminatory. The right-wing ultra-Orthodox parties that Netanyahu has partnered with insist that the practice continues, prompting Avigdor Lieberman, a former Netanyahu deputy and the head of the right-wing but stridently secular Yisrael Beitenu, to pull his support from the previous round of coalition talks. That made it impossible for Netanyahu to form a government and drove the country back to elections. Further adding to Bibi’s headaches? He is waiting to hear this fall whether the country’s attorney general will indict him on corruption charges. What Happens Next: The country’s president, Reuven Rivlin, has until October 2 to decide who will get first shot at forming a government. Netanyahu, Lieberman, and Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue & White party that won 33 seats to Likud’s 31 (Israel’s parliament has 120 seats total), all say they want the same thing: a national unity government, involving at least Likud and Blue & White. But that’s easier said than done. The most likely outcome is a national unity government led by Gantz, which would include elements of Likud that decide to abandon the severely weakened Netanyahu, as well as a constellation of other parties including Lieberman’s Yisrael Beitenu and possibly center-left Labor. Lieberman would probably demand the defense ministry and key policy concessions to bless this government. It would be a motley bunch—leftists and right wingers, hawks and doves, free marketeers and union bosses. But it would be a majority, and that’s all Gantz needs. Netanyahu is not going down without a fight. His singular goal is staying prime minister, and it’s not just about lust for power. Being prime minister may shield him from the judicial proceedings against him (though it’s never been tested before); if he is a mere member of parliament or minister, he has no such hope. Netanyahu said he would be willing to unite with Gantz’s Blue & White party on the condition that he remains prime minister, even if it’s just a rotation. In exchange, Netanyahu would need to give Blue & White the keys to the kingdom: deciding foreign policy and the budget, and all the perks of office. But even that’s a tough sell for Blue & White, whose members have spent the last nine months campaigning against him and holding him up as the exemplar of what’s wrong with Israeli politics today. Lieberman will also work to undermine this particular outcome, as it would mean he could be cut out of government (Likud + Blue & White have enough seats between them to form a coalition on their own).",What Will Happen Next in Israel After the Elections,"September 23, 2019"
322,Tara Law,"About 250 mourners, including many dressed in black, ascended a Swiss mountainside on Sunday to bid farewell to a longtime resident of the Alps: the Pizol Glacier, the Agence France Presse reported. The marchers put down flowers to honor the glacier, and others played alphorns — a 12-ft wooden instrument shaped like a pipe. The glacier, which is located at an altitude of around 8,850 feet and near the borders with Liechtenstein and Austria, was eulogized by a local chaplain, Eric Petrini, who called for “God’s help to tackle the enormous challenge of climate change,” and Matthias Huss, a glaciologist at the university ETH – Zurich, according to the AFP. The event, which took place the day before the start of a United Nations climate summit in New York City, was organized by environmental and Christian groups, the university’s Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciolgy wrote on Twitter. “R.I.P., Pizolgletscher!” the laboratory tweeted. Pizol has lost about 80 to 90% of its volume since 2006, Huss told the AFP. Huss was among the authors of a study that found that more than 90% of the glacier volume in the European Alps as a whole could be lost by 2100. According to Huss, the Pizol glacier is just one of the Swiss glaciers to have melted away over the last two centuries. “Since 1850, we estimate that more than 500 Swiss glaciers have completely disappeared, including 50 that were named,” Huss added. March organizer Alessandra Degiacomi, of the Swiss Association for Climate Protection, told CNN that if Pizol disappears, it should be a “warning sign. This is what is going to happen if we don’t change something about our behavior.” Degiacomi told CNN that the Association has gathered 120,000 signatures to demand that Switzerland become CO2 neutral by 2050. At least one other funeral has been held for a glacier before. In August, Iceland residents mourned the first disappearance of Okjokull, a glacier in the country which was declared dead in 2014.","With 'Deepest Sadness,' Swiss Mourn the Passing of Alps Glacier","September 23, 2019"

324,SETH BORENSTEIN / AP,"(UNITED NATIONS) — Leader after leader told the United Nations on Monday that they will do more to prevent a warming world from reaching even more dangerous levels. But as they made their pledges at the Climate Action Summit, they conceded it was not enough. Sixty-six countries have promised to have more ambitious climate goals and 30 swore to be carbon neutral by midcentury, said Chilean President Sebastian Pinera Echenique, who is hosting the next climate negotiations later this year. Heads of nations such as Finland and Germany promised to ban coal within a decade. Several also mentioned goals of climate neutrality — when a country is not adding more heat-trapping carbon to the air than is being removed by plants and perhaps technology — by 2050. U.S. President Donald Trump dropped by, listened to German Chancellor Angela Merkel make detailed pledges, including going coal-free, and left without saying anything. The United States did not ask to have someone speak at the summit, U.N. officials said. And Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had told countries they couldn’t be on the agenda without making bold new proposals. Even though there was no speech by Trump, who has denied climate change, called it a Chinese hoax and repealed U.S. carbon-reduction policies, he was talked about. In a none-too-subtle jibe at Trump’s plans to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, said countries “must honor our commitments and follow through on the Paris Agreement.” “The withdrawal of certain parties will not shake the collective goal of the world community,” Wang said to applause.",President Trump Makes an Unexpected Appearance at U.N.

Harry danced a bit as a musical welcome greeted them in the township of Nyanga, whose location was not made public in advance because of security concerns. Violent crime is so deadly in parts of Cape Town that South Africa’s military has been deployed in the city, and its stay was extended last week. Frustration over high unemployment and lack of services also has exploded into protests and attacks on foreigners elsewhere in South Africa in recent weeks. “As someone who has visited this amazing country many times, and as someone who regards Cape Town as a uniquely special place in Africa, I wanted to ensure that our first visit as a family – with my wife by my side – focused on the significant challenges facing millions of South Africans, while acknowledging the hope that we feel so strongly here,” the prince said. The royal couple also was meeting Monday with former residents of District Six, a vibrant mixed-race community that was relocated from the inner city during South Africa’s harsh period of apartheid, or white minority rule, that ended in 1994. Their visit also will focus on wildlife protection, entrepreneurship, mental health and mine clearance — a topic given global attention by Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana, when she walked through an active mine field during an Africa visit years ago. Harry later this week will break away for visits to Botswana, Angola and Malawi. The couple arrived in a South Africa still shaken by the rape and murder of a university student, carried out in a post office, that sparked protests by thousands of women tired of abuse and impunity in a country where more than 100 rapes are reported every day. This is “one of the most unsafe places in the world to be a woman,” President Cyril Ramaphosa said last week, announcing new emergency measures and vowing to be tougher on perpetrators.","Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Baby Archie Begin First Official Tour as a Royal Family in Cape Town","September 23, 2019"
326,JOSPHAT KASIRE / AP,"(NAIROBI, Kenya) — A school collapsed in Kenya’s capital on Monday and killed at least seven children, officials said, while some outraged residents alleged shoddy construction. Two other children were in critical condition. “We were in class reading and we heard pupils and teachers screaming, and the class started collapsing and then a stone hit me on the mouth,” one survivor, 10-year-old Tracy Oduor, told The Associated Press. “When we got out of the gate we heard that pupils were dead. I feel so sad!” Parents wailed over the remains of The Precious Talent Top School in Nairobi, and hundreds of people gathered as emergency workers picked through debris. It was not clear whether anyone was trapped underneath. Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna confirmed the deaths, and Kenyatta National Hospital later said 64 children had been admitted, most with minor injuries. “The children here were all running away and crying,” resident Michael Otieno said. More than 800 students are enrolled at the school, officials said. It was not immediately clear why the building of corrugated metal and wood collapsed around 7:30 a.m. Construction can be poorly regulated in some fast-growing Kenyan communities. “You can easily break it with your own hands, as easy as that,” Peter Ouko, a resident, said of the building materials. “This is chicken wire, not construction material, and someone had the guts to use this to build a construction for our kids. I think this is basically premeditated murder.” Nathaniel Matalanga, a structural engineer with La Femme Engineering Services Ltd., told reporters that he didn’t think “any professionals” were involved in the school’s construction and he blamed “greed.” There was no immediate comment from school officials.

327,Suyin Haynes,"The tour across southern Africa begun Monday by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex; Meghan, Duchess of Sussex; and their son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, will surely be as modern as they are — but Prince Harry’s plan for Thursday and Friday has also echoed the past. Harry is honoring Princess Diana’s advocacy against landmines in Angola by making a trip very similar to the one his mother made in January of 1997, when she walked across a minefield in Huambo in central Angola. The photographs of Princess Diana wearing protective clothing and equipment, as well as her meeting landmine survivors, raised the profile of the work being done to clear landmines around the world. Her untimely death in August 1997 came only a few months before the United Nations Mine Ban Treaty — a legally binding prohibition on the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of landmines — was opened for signature. Since then, 164 countries have become parties to the agreement, which is informally known as the Ottawa Treaty. Here’s what to know about Princess Diana’s work on landmines, why it was so significant and how Prince Harry is continuing her legacy. At the time of Princess Diana’s visit to Angola in January 1997, Prince William and Prince Harry were 14 and 12 years old, and her divorce from Prince Charles had been finalized the previous year. She was already known for her other charitable endeavors, such as her role in the 1987 opening of the U.K.’s first HIV/AIDS unit in London, which was designed specifically to treat patients with the virus at a time when it was perceived with much stigma. Princess Diana brought her signature determination to her campaigning against landmines. She had been involved with the British Red Cross for several years before the charity organized and supported her January 1997 trip to Angola. It was there, in Huambo province, that she came across the work of the HALO Trust, which had been working to clear mines in Angola since 1994 amid the then-ongoing civil war there. (The civil war in Angola, which remains one of the world’s most heavily landmine-contaminated countries, ended in 2002 after more than 25 years of intermittent conflict.) She met children who were landmine survivors, and she was also escorted by HALO students and mine-clearance experts through a cleared lane in one of the active minefields wearing protective armor and headgear. Images from her trip were immediately circulated across international media and provided a striking portrait of the princess among people in a humanitarian context. “Diana’s visit is something that people in Huambo still talk about today,” says Ralph Legg, program manager of HALO Trust’s operations in Angola. “For the people that were here at that time, which was obviously still a time of conflict, it led to a feeling of acknowledgement, and that their plight was recognized around the world. The people I’ve spoken to who met Diana on that trip have all said how kind, considerate and how genuinely interested she seemed in them.” After her visit to Angola, Princess Diana wrote a letter to the British Red Cross saying: “If my visit has contributed in any way at all in highlighting this terrible issue, then my deepest wish will have been fulfilled.”",Prince Harry Is Honoring His Mother's Work in Angola.

328,Sanya Mansoor,"FIFA said Saturday in an unambiguous statement that Iran must admit women into its soccer games. The sport’s global governing body stated “women have to be allowed into football stadiums in Iran. For all football matches.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a conference on Sunday that Iranian officials assured FIFA that “women will be allowed to enter football stadiums,” according to the BBC. “This is something very important — in 40 years this has not happened, with a couple of exceptions.” The announcement comes the same month that a female Iranian soccer fan set herself on fire, after learning that she could be imprisoned for six months because she snuck into a stadium to watch a match, according to the Associated Press. Sahar Khodayari, 29, was detained by police after an altercation and released after three nights in jail, pending her court case, the AP reported. Her self immolation prompted international condemnation, with human rights organizations calling Iran’s policy on gender in soccer stadiums a “discriminatory ban.” “What happened to Sahar Khodayari is heart-breaking and exposes the impact of the Iranian authorities’ appalling contempt for women’s rights in the country,” Phillip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director, said in a statement two weeks ago in reaction to Khodayari’s death. “Her only ‘crime’ was being a woman in a country where women face discrimination that is entrenched in law and plays out in the most horrific ways imaginable in every area of their lives, even sports.” Luther’s statement said that it appears “Iran is the only country in the world that stops and punishes women seeking to enter football stadiums” and that “the discriminatory ban must end immediately.” FIFA and the Iranian government seem closer to doing just that. “I am hopeful that the Iranian Federation and the Iranian authorities were receptive to our repeated calls to address this unacceptable situation,” FIFA president Infantino previously said in a statement on Thursday. FIFA said in its statement on Saturday said that there are “no noteworthy operational obstacles” to these changes being adopted at the Azadi stadium in Tehran as soon as Oct. 10, when Iran is scheduled to play Cambodia for a World Cup qualifier match for the tournament in Qatar in 2022.",FIFA Says Women 'Have to Be Allowed' Into Iran's Soccer Stadiums,"September 22, 2019"
329,Sanya Mansoor,"Tropical Storm Karen, which is moving through the Southern Windward islands and could hit Puerto Rico early next week, has inspired the internet to make memes poking fun of the storm’s name. #Karen was trending on Sunday afternoon on Twitter.   “Karen” has become synonymous with the persona of an annoying entitled, woman, according to the internet’s meme database, KnowYourMeme, which says the meme may have first come about because of its association with Mean Girls’ ditzy, popular high school character Karen Smith. The Karen meme is also associated with a side-swept haircut that is “short in the back and longer in the front” and “mocked as representative of middle-aged women” obsessed with complaining to store managers, KnowYourMeme says.  Haircut and manager memes are making the rounds on Twitter as Tropical Storm Karen dumps rain on the southern Windward Islands. One meme shows this haircut sitting atop of the storm’s forecast cone. Another refers to the cone as a “visual representation of the rising anger of everyone in line behind Karen as she argues with the manager because her coupons are not working.” It’s still important to know that this is a potentially life-threatening storm. A tropical storm warning, indicating that tropical storm conditions are expected within the next 12 hours, is already in effect for St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada and its dependencies, according to the National Hurricane Center.

331,Paul Moakley,"Associated Press staff photographer Ramon Espinosa is no stranger to covering hurricanes. He’s been reporting from the Bahamas since Aug. 29 as the islands braced for the impact of Hurricane Dorian. “I’ve covered hurricanes in the Caribbean the last fourteen years,” says Espinosa, “but nothing compared to this one.” Dorian’s death toll currently stands at 50, but over 1,000 people are still missing.  Dorian hit the Bahamas as a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest storm on record to hit the islands. It battered the Bahamas with 185 mph winds, visiting punishing damage on Abaco and Grand Bahama for at least 24 hours. In the first days of the storm, his images of dramatic rescues felt startling and immediate — the closest thing to being there. More recently, he’s been able to travel to the areas most deeply affected, producing images that show the epic destruction, yet feel like a lament to what was lost — an attempt at at trying to absorb the incomprehensible landscapes of destroyed homes, churches, missing bodies and rubble. With poor internet and phone connections still making it difficult to report, Espinosa took a few moments to tell TIME about the what he has witnessed in the hurricane’s wake. His answers have been edited for length and clarity. TIME: When did you arrive in the Bahamas? Espinosa: The trip started waiting for Dorian in Puerto Rico. We arrived on Aug. 26th to San Juan, but after following the hurricane, we realized the storm was heading directly to Grand Bahama. After checking with the office we took a flight to Freeport on Aug. 29th to wait for Dorian there. Have you covered lots of Hurricanes? How does this one compare? I’ve covered hurricanes in the Caribbean over the last 14 year.

332,Helene Fouquet and William Wilkes / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — The manicured estate of the Versailles Palace was designed for an absolute monarch and withstood the French revolution. But now climate change is threatening its survival. Hornbeam trees overlooking the estate’s Grand Canal died this summer, and in Marie Antoinette’s Trianon gardens, the beeches are withering. The worrying thing is that these weren’t only varieties from the era of Louis the XIV, but also new plantings meant to withstand the effects of global warming. “It’s heart breaking,” said Alain Baraton, Versailles’s chief gardener, pointing to shriveled hornbeams and the parched leaves of once-luscious chestnut trees. “I’m forced to dump history and be pragmatic.” Northern Europe’s normally temperate weather is rapidly becoming hotter and drier, forcing gardeners on the 800-hectare (2,000-acre) park to adapt. The stately elms, chestnuts and birches that were favored by French royalty are being selectively replaced by species that stand better chances of resisting higher temperatures, new parasites and more volatile precipitation patterns. The urgency to act was underscored when France’s National Center for Scientific Research on Tuesday released a climate model that showed the world becoming even hotter than previously expected. Trees are one of nature’s biggest forms of carbon storage. The European Environment Agency estimates forests absorb 13% of all of the European Union’s carbon-dioxide emissions. But more frequent droughts and increasingly violent storms put the region’s woodlands at risk. “Trees used to have hundreds of years to adapt, but they don’t have that time anymore,” said Xavier Bartet, an officer in France’s National Forestry Agency. “And in nature, if you can’t adapt, you die.” The effects are being felt across Europe. About 50 million spruce trees are believed to have perished, with extensive damage to larch, oak, beech and pine varieties, according to Gert-Jan Nabuurs, forestry expert at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. In eastern Germany, pine canopies have been bleached a sickly brown with ground water the lowest since records began in 1961, according to the country’s DWD weather service. Charred stumps point to a disturbing new trend of wildfires. The BDF forestry association estimates 100 million German trees have died in droughts and storms since 2018.",Climate Change Is Devastating the Lush Gardens of Versailles,"September 21, 2019"
333,Rachael Bunyan,"As U.S. troops landed in Haiti on Sept. 19, 1994, they were welcomed by a large enthusiastic crowd at the port of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital. It was a moment of euphoria for Haitians who hoped for change after three years of instability at the hands of a military junta. “There’s a whole sea of Haitians looking into their [the American soldiers] eyes, just glad that they’re here,” a source told TIME in 1994. The intervention, known as “Operation Uphold Democracy,” was billed as a success by Clinton Administration officials and made headlines in 1994. Twenty-five years later, it has been all but forgotten by many Americans — but scholars say that this moment in history still holds an important lesson. The winter of 1990 marked a historic moment for Haiti, as Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected president with an overwhelming majority in the nation’s first-ever democratic presidential election. Aristide promised change and challenged the elites. However, the hope he and his government represented was cut short by a military coup, led by Raoul Cédras in 1991. The coup, which started after Haiti’s civilian and military elite rejected the new policies, forced Aristide into exile just seven months after the presidential elections. The military junta led what U.S. President Bill Clinton called a reign of terror, raping civilians and killing around 5,000 Aristide supporters over the next three years. Then, in April 1994, paramilitaries in a group led in part by Louis-Jodel Chamblain murdered at least 15 supporters of Aristide. Many of the victims were “tortured and made to lay in open sewers before being shot,” TIME later reported. Back in the U.S., the Congressional Black Caucus had been pushing President Bill Clinton to intervene, but he was wary of doing so. Less than a year earlier, in October 1993, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in the Black Hawk Down battle in Somalia during a peacekeeping mission, and humanitarian crises were also ongoing in Bosnia and Rwanda. But in light of the atrocities, Clinton in 1994 decided that the time had come. During the President’s Radio Address on Sept. 17, 1994, he spoke of America’s interest in helping to “restore democratic government in Haiti.” Attempts to make change via diplomacy had failed. “The dictators rejected all of our efforts, and their reign of terror, a campaign of murder, rape, and mutilation, gets worse with every passing day,” he said. “Now we must act.” Clinton told the public during his address that he had sent former President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn to Haiti that morning in a last ditch attempt to “provide a peaceful, orderly transfer of power.”","25 Years After 'Operation Uphold Democracy,' Experts Say the Oft-Forgotten U.S. Military Intervention Still Shapes Life in Haiti","Updated: September 24, 2019 11:47 AM ET | Originally published: September 20, 2019"
334,Alejandro de la Garza,"After years of equivocation on climate issues by politicians and leaders around the world, young people have had enough. That’s the message from the young leaders of Friday’s global climate protests, which drew hundreds of thousands of people to climate “strikes” around the world in anticipation of a U.N. summit in New York. “We see the world as it is, we see it really clearly,” says activist Jeremy Ornstein, 18. “Seeing it as it is and as it could be — that’s what we call moral clarity.” In Boston, Ornstein and thousands of other young activists gathered at City Hall Plaza, before making their way to the Massachusetts Statehouse building. Ornstien gave an address to a cheering crowd, as did older figures, like Obama Administration EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. Similar scenes played out across the U.S. on Friday, with more than 800 climate protests were planned across the nation, according to the Associated Press. In city after city, from New York to San Francisco, images emerged of streets packed with young people demanding their voices be heard.  In Washington D.C., thousands of protesters marched to the Capitol Building, carrying signs calling out an urgent climate crisis. Many were teenagers taking time off school to gather outside the nation’s seat of power. “Our Earth is dying,” A.J. Conermann, 15, told the Associated Press. “And if we don’t do something about it, we die.” Many liberal-leaning leaders lent their support to the protests aligning themselves with what may be emerging as a global youth movement. Massachusetts Senator and Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren sent out a message of support to climate protesters in her state’s capital. “You’re building a grassroots movement that will make sure that we fight back before it’s too late,” Warren said in a video address.",Hundreds of Thousands Demand Climate Action in Massive Youth-Led Strikes Around the World,"Updated: September 20, 2019 6:27 PM ET"
335,Madeleine Carlisle,"On Friday, hundreds of thousands of young people around the world took part in strikes to demand action on climate change. More than 4,500 strikes were planned worldwide in over 120 countries, and more than 500 strikes are registered in the U.S. alone. The strike, which is organized by The Climate Strike Coalition, was intended to kick off a week of events to highlight climate change. One of the flagship protests on Friday was in New York City, three days before the U.N. Climate Summit. Tens of thousands of people turned out for the strikes with climate group 350.org estimating that as many as 300,000 attended. New York’s strike was held jointly with a Puerto Rico Day of Action; Friday marks the second anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which experts estimate killed at least 2,975 people on the island. The New York protest culminated in a rally featuring speeches from several prominent climate leaders, including Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who launched the global Fridays for Future — which led to the climate strike — movements last year. In August of 2018, Thunberg began protesting in front of the Swedish parliament, rather than attending school, to demand action on climate change. Her actions soon sparked a movement and led young people around the world to start to “strike” from school on Fridays to demand action. To reach the United States, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic for two weeks in a racing sailboat designed to be emissions free. Last week, the New York City Department of Education announced it would grant excused absences with parental consent of all students participating in the New York climate strike. “This is an emergency. Our house is on fire,” Thunberg told the crowd. “We will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse.” “Why should we study for a future that is being taken away from us. That is being sold for profit.” “Everywhere I have been the situation is more or less same. The people in power, their beautiful words are the same,” she said. “The number of politicians and celebrities who want to take selfies with us are the same. The empty promises are the same. The lies are the same, and the inaction is the same.”",'This Is an Emergency. Our House Is on Fire.' Greta Thunberg Addresses New York's Climate Strike,"Updated: September 20, 2019 6:34 PM ET"
336,Billy Perrigo,"The fastest growing terrorist threat to the U.K. comes from the far-right, Britain’s top counter-terrorism police officer said Thursday. Seven of the 22 terrorist plots to cause widespread loss of life in the U.K. since March 2017 came from people with extreme right-wing ideologies, said Neil Basu, the assistant commissioner to the Metropolitan Police in charge of counterterrorism. Basu told journalists his unit had seen “significant increases” in far-right terrorism. “When nearly a third of the plots foiled by police and security services since 2017 relate to right-wing ideology, it lays bare why we are taking this threat so seriously,” he said. “Together, we are bringing the full might of the U.K. [counterterrorism] machine to bear against those extremists of any ideology who wish to do us harm or incite violence,” he added. Unlike in the U.S., where guns are far more widely available, far right terrorists in the U.K. have not yet succeeded in carrying out a mass-casualty attack. But in 2016, the Labour Party lawmaker Jo Cox was attacked and killed by a rightwing extremist who shouted “Britain first” after shooting and stabbing her on the street in the run-up to the Brexit referendum. And in June 2017, a far-right attacker drove a van into a crowd of people outside a mosque in London, resulting in one death. But the response of U.K. law enforcement has been more robust. After the El Paso attack in August, when a man opened fire in a Walmart in the border city killing 22 people, U.S. officials complained to TIME that the White House had ignored FBI warnings of a rise in right-wing terrorism, and that attempts to direct more federal spending toward the issue had been thwarted. President Donald Trump has been criticized for comments seen as emboldening white nationalist extremists, and for not doing enough to make tackling white nationalism a priority. Far-right and white nationalist extremism is on the rise globally. In March, a gunman live-streamed an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, leaving 51 people dead. The gunman posted a hate-filled “manifesto” online justifying his actions, and experts say social media has encouraged a copycat effect. The El Paso attacker posted a similar “manifesto” online, crediting the Christchurch shooter with his inspiration.","Far-Right Terrorism Is the Fastest Growing Threat to the U.K., Police Say","September 20, 2019"

338,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Amnesty International on Friday accused Hong Kong police of employing “reckless and indiscriminate tactics” against protesters in what amounts to an alarming pattern of abuse, and called for an independent investigation. In a new report, Amnesty documented a series of arbitrary arrests and retaliatory violence against pro-democracy protesters held in custody, some of which, it said, amounted to torture. “The evidence leaves little room for doubt—in an apparent thirst for retaliation, Hong Kong’s security forces have engaged in a disturbing pattern of reckless and unlawful tactics against people during the protests,” said Nicholas Bequelin, East Asia Director at Amnesty International. The police’s use of force, Bequelin added, is “clearly excessive, violating international human rights law.” One of the key demands of the protests that have rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese enclave for three months has been an independent inquiry into the police response. While protesters have repeatedly accused the force of exercising excessive violence, the city’s embattled leader Carrie Lam has defended the police and resisted calls for independent accountability measures. In preparing its report, Amnesty spoke with 48 people, including arrested protesters who shared accounts of being severely beaten and suffering other ill-treatment at the hands of police. One detainee said that after he refused to answer a question he was taken to another room where several officers attacked him and threatened to break his hands. Another said he saw officers force a boy to shine a laser pen into his own eye in what appeared to be retribution for protesters’ use of laser pointers during the demonstrations. Protesters spoke of similarly heavy-handed tactics at the time of arrest.

Thae Yong-ho, one of the highest-level North Korean officials to defect, told TIME in a recent interview that regime leader Kim Jong Un has no intention of abandoning his nuclear program and is only “trying to buy time” until the world accepts his country’s nuclear status. Convincing Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear arsenal, Thae says, will require ramping up the pressure through punitive measures. “Kim Jong Un is not interested in the denuclearization process,” he says, adding that “America has to take very resolute action by increasing additional economic sanctions.” U.S. intelligence similarly concluded that Kim is not ready to relinquish his nuclear arsenal, Defense Intelligence Agency director Lieutenant General Robert Ashley told Fox News in June. According to Thae, who served as the North’s former deputy ambassador to the U.K., President Donald Trump’s current approach of buddying up to the dictator and holding high-profile summits “is a failure.” Thae’s comments come as Washington and Pyongyang both signal interest in resuming the stalled denuclearization talks. North Korea announced its willingness to reenter the discussions earlier this month in a statement that preceded its latest round of short-range missiles launches by just hours.

340,Madeleine Carlisle,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau admitted Thursday that he’s unsure whether there are more images of him in blackface or brownface beyond the ones that have already been released. Trudeau has been under fire since Wednesday, when TIME published a photograph of him in brownface at a party at the private school where he was teaching in the spring of 2001.  In his initial apology on Wednesday night aboard his campaign plane in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Trudeau admitted to wearing blackface once before, during a high school performance of “Day-O,” a Jamaican folk song famously performed by African American singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte. Since then, a third instance of the Prime Minister with darkened features has emerged—a video from the early 1990s that shows Trudeau in blackface, raising his hands in the air and sticking out his tongue. Zita Astravas, the media relations head of the Liberal Party of Canada, first confirmed that the video was of Trudeau. On Thursday afternoon, Trudeau—who is currently in the midst of a reelection campaign—spoke in Winnipeg, Manitoba, about the scandal. After he was asked multiple times whether more photographs or videos of him in blackface or brownface exist, Trudeau said, “I am wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out I had not remembered.” “And I think the question is: ‘How can you not remember that?’” he continued. “The fact is I didn’t understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day.” The 47-year-old leader of the Liberal Party of Canada also reiterated his apology for the scandal while speaking to the press. “I want to begin by saying a few words directly to racialized Canadians who face discrimination every single day in their lives, even in a country like Canada.

341,Abigail Abrams,"As an American, Jeanne Glenz prizes her right to vote. But, because she lives near Munich with her German husband, exercising that right isn’t always easy. This year, it could get even harder, depending on the results of an obscure international meeting scheduled to take place in Geneva on Sept. 24-25. If the Trump Administration doesn’t get what it wants at that summit, the United States is set to withdraw from an arcane treaty that governs global mail delivery—leaving commercial shippers and military mail managers fretting, and election officials concerned that millions of overseas Americans will struggle to cast a vote. “This represents taxation without representation,” says Glenz, a 79-year-old retired psychologist from California. The White House says it is working “around the clock” to facilitate a smooth exit from the agreement if it comes to that, but the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has telegraphed a more cautious outlook in industry conversations. With few details made public, experts in everything from elections to trade worry the U.S. may be about to upset the stability of the mail system around the world. The current system isn’t perfect—a letter may get lost; a gift may arrive the day after a birthday—but it’s still an impressive bit of international cooperation. After all, if you want to send a letter from the U.S. to Glenz in Germany, you can use American stamps and still expect Deutsche Post to deliver it. That’s thanks to the Universal Postal Union (UPU), a 144-year-old organization that sets technical and security standards to keep international mail and small packages moving around the globe. Now part of the U.N., it’s the second oldest ­international organization in the world, and not typically ­involved in high-profile disputes. But one main part of the arrangement has drawn President Donald Trump’s ire: “terminal dues,” the rates the 192 member countries pay one another to deliver mail across borders. Because the fees were developed in the 1960s based on factors including a nation’s economic development at that point, countries like China, whose economy has grown enormously since then, still pay heavily subsidized rates while the U.S. pays much more. That means it can sometimes be cheaper to send a package from China to the United States than it is for Americans to send packages between states. “What’s really made this a disastrous system is that in the last 10 years or so, international document volume has plummeted and international e-commerce has boomed,” says James Campbell, a lawyer and UPU expert who consults for international shipping companies. “The United States and the Europeans have been flooded with e-commerce goods that come from China and other countries. We are delivering those goods at terminal dues rates that are substantially less than what the Postal Service charges domestic mailers for the same service.” This discounted shipping cost industrialized nations $2.1 billion in 2014, per a study cited by the USPS. Trump, who has long complained about trade imbalances and NATO spending, called this discrepancy “discriminatory” in the  presidential memorandum he issued before announcing last October that he intended to leave the UPU. Though his was not a new complaint—administrations going back to Ronald Reagan’s have voiced it, and many trade experts agree the treaty’s rates need an update—the decision to quit the group outright was, like many Trump Administration actions, a surprise. But the withdrawal process takes a year, and the State Department says the U.S. will stay put if allowed to “self-declare” its own terminal-dues rates.",'Trump Is Having His Own Brexit': The Race to Prepare for a Potential U.S. Exit From the World's Mail System,"September 19, 2019"
342,Vivienne Walt / Paris,"When TIME first interviewed President Emmanuel Macron in 2015, he was an Economy Minister with a grand plan for a new kind of politics. The next time, in 2017, he had won power at the age of 39 and was putting that plan into action. For our third interview at the halfway point of his first term, our opening question was about the chaotic and sometimes violent reaction to what he has done in office. Yet Macron hardly looked like a man who had weathered one of the most violent years in modern France, with Yellow Vest protesters burning barricades and hurling vitriol at him. Relaxed in his shirtsleeves in his office in the Elysée Palace on Sept. 9, he betrayed little sign of the turmoil some in his inner circle say he has been through in the past months. “There have been moments, very tough, especially on a personal standpoint,” says Ismael Emelien, a long-time advisor of Macron who left the Elysée in February. “He always knew that since we were transforming the country, it would come with some costs.” Early this year, it seemed to many French that those costs might be as high as his presidency itself. But just a few months later Macron is riding a surge in the polls, and vowing not to be as aloof and impatient as before. And he is attempting to resume his position as a key, global champion for multilateralism. The turnaround in his popularity is not the only change we found. Inside the 300-year-old palace once occupied by Napoleon, the heavy antique furnishings and wooden desk are gone. Now his office is all sleek black leather and neutral-color drapes. Some decorating touches, we were told, were from his wife Brigitte.  For more than an hour, Macron settled into one of the leather couches, to discuss his determination to change France, how the West has failed its middle classes, and how he spends his downtime. Here, extended highlights from the conversation, edited for length and clarity. MACRON: For me, the most important thing is what it told [us] about the current deadlock of democracies. Our global economy failed to improve the situation of the middle classes. There is an over-concentration of wealth in some hands. We have a crisis of capitalism. On top of that you have a big technology transition. It creates a lot of opportunities, but at the same time creates emotions, resentments, and disruption, killing jobs and creating new anxieties for a lot of people. I think this is the French system. We are a country where we like leadership and we want to kill the leaders. I don’t mind if it’s fair or not, to be honest with you. I was elected, I’m in charge, and I’m the leader, so I take it. I don’t care. The deep roots is much more how to deal with inequalities in our society. We have a unique role in Europe. Our role is to build a new model on ecology, industry, education. That’s what we are doing. In a certain way, you have a ‘Death Valley.’ I’m in this Death Valley. When you get rid of the past system you enter into this new road.

343,Billy Perrigo,"After six days at sea on Sept. 14, the Ocean Viking sailed into port carrying 82 asylum seekers. It was the first rescue ship to dock in Italy since Matteo Salvini, one of Europe’s most fervent antimigrant politicians, lost his job as Interior Minister. He had shut Italian ports to rescue ships like the Ocean Viking, but his coalition government collapsed in August over the direction of migration policy. On Sept. 10 a new coalition took office without his far-right League party. “This is the end of Salvini’s propaganda,” a new minister tweeted. After becoming Interior Minister in June 2018, Salvini threatened fines of up to €1 million and human-smuggling charges for captains who defied his migrant-entry ban. It had the desired effect: arrivals have fallen to around 6,200 so far in 2019, down from over 20,000 in the same period in 2018. But it also made the journey deadlier; for every 10 migrants who arrived in Italy by sea this year, one has died en route. That’s roughly double the 2018 rate. With Salvini gone, reformers in Italy and Brussels see a chance to act. Their focus is on the E.U.’s so-called Dublin regulation, which forces migrants to apply for asylum in the first member state where they set foot. Since 2014, more than 600,000 have arrived in Italy. Moderates say the burden on Italy helped Salvini’s antimigrant populism to flourish. “The Dublin regulation must be modified,” said Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Sept. 10. For now, more piecemeal reforms may have to do. As the Ocean Viking prepared to dock, France, Germany and other E.U. countries agreed to share in relocating those on board. But a long-term solution has yet to be agreed upon. On Sept. 23, E.U. Interior Ministers are meeting to decide how to deal with future ships. Germany said it was ready to accept 25% of all arrivals. But the window to act might not last long. Salvini is still hugely popular in Italy and is the favorite to win an election, if the new coalition is unable to govern.

344,Vivienne Walt/Paris,"It’s a bright early September day inside France’s presidential Élysée Palace, and President Emmanuel Macron is reflecting on the grueling 12 months just past, with the so-called Yellow Vests (gilets jaunes) protesters raging across the country, many aiming their fury at him. That was surely enough to rattle any leader. Yet Macron, leaning forward on his leather couch, offers another view. “In a certain way, the gilets jaunes were very good for me,” he says, as the afternoon shadows lengthened on the lawn outside. “Because it reminded me who I should be.” The question of who Emmanuel Macron should be has occupied the French, and many around the world, in the three years since the then Economy Minister launched a grassroots uprising of his own. That movement would deliver him the presidency in May 2017 and smash a political order that had lasted for half a century. Macron first and foremost saw himself as a reformer, throwing himself into dismantling rules that he believed had long strangled France’s economic prospects. He and his La République En Marche party (LREM) scrapped a wealth tax levied on France’s richest residents, trimmed the country’s labyrinthine labor regulations and made it less costly for companies to hire and fire staff. But Macron also saw himself as a global leader. In the two years since his victory, the President, just 41, has inserted himself into every international crisis, striding into the vacuum left by the weakened German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Brexit-distracted U.K. and a U.S. President in retreat from the role of leader of the West. In a fractious European Union, Macron has quietly worked to shape the agenda on pivotal issues like the environment, defense, trade and data privacy. TIME called him the “next leader of Europe” on its November 2017 cover, adding a caveat–“if only he can lead France.” Over the past year, he has struggled to answer the question raised by the second part of that headline. As the President bestrode the world stage and dreamed up far-reaching reforms to transform France, many of his constituents grew restless. From the start, some in France regarded Macron as an arrogant know-it-all, whose past as an investment banker suggested membership in a hated elite. Macron did little to assuage that opinion in office; scrapping the wealth tax saved the richest French millions. He was quickly nicknamed le Président des riches (the President of the rich). Then, in November 2018, Macron announced an increased fuel tax to help pay for his ambitious green-energy rollout. Thousands snapped in anger, providing the raw ingredients for the Yellow Vests movement to detonate full force. Unlike the other popular revolts that have periodically rocked France in past decades, this one was not organized by any labor or student organization; it mushroomed leaderless on Facebook, then ricocheted across the country, with protesters battling police, smashing storefronts and burning barricades for months on end. By December, Macron’s popularity had shrunk to about 23%, forcing him to make a chastened retreat from his fuel tax and commit an additional $11 billion to social benefits. With his ambitious reform agenda on the line, Macron decided to launch a monthslong listening tour through the heartland–what he called a grand débat, or big debate. It grew out of what he learned from the street violence, he says–that he was too disconnected from the average French person. “My challenge is to listen to people much better than I did at the very beginning,” he says now. His town-hall meetings across France seem to have rescued his presidency. Macron’s popularity now sits between 34% and 43%, up nearly 10 points from January. Although the Yellow Vests have resumed their Saturday street battles with police after a summer break, their numbers have shrunk.",France’s President Emmanuel Macron Is Ready to Reset His Troubled Presidency,"September 19, 2019"
345,Ian Bremmer,"Newly selected British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stormed into 10 Downing Street this past summer vowing to do the impossible: secure a better deal from Brussels than the one offered to his predecessor Theresa May. Johnson threatened to pull the U.K. out of the E.U. on Oct. 31 should that deal not materialize. Two months later, Johnson’s impossible promise remains very challenging. Not only have the Europeans refused to reopen negotiations, but Johnson’s move to sidestep the British Parliament by suspending it for five weeks triggered parliamentary mutiny–Johnson and his Conservative Party lost their working majority in the House of Commons, and a cross-party alliance of MPs (including a number of high-profile Tories) banded together to pass legislation preventing Johnson from pulling the U.K. out of the E.U. absent a deal. Johnson then demanded a general election to secure himself a mandate to move forward with his do-or-die negotiations strategy with Brussels, but British parliamentarians refused that as well until Johnson obtained either an extension or a deal from Brussels. Now Johnson has gone to the Continent in search of a deal and political salvation. The sticking point, as former Prime Minister May learned, is what happens between Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the E.U.). The Good Friday Agreement that helped end much of the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland did away with any hard border between the two sides, which worked fine so long as both remained part of the E.U. Once the U.K. opted to leave the E.U., Brussels insisted that Northern Ireland remain part of the European customs union as a “backstop” until a system could be devised to keep the border open while protecting the integrity of the E.U. marketplace. This was a nonstarter for May and, more important, for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which was propping up her government. For them, none of the constituent elements of the U.K. (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) could be subject to a different customs framework from the rest of the kingdom, lest it jeopardize the unity of the country. In the only real significant concession Brussels made to the British, it allowed the backstop to apply to the whole of the U.K. rather than just Northern Ireland until alternative arrangements could be found. Hard-line Brexiteers (Johnson among them) didn’t consider this a concession at all and demanded that the backstop be scrapped entirely. Europeans refused to budge and told Johnson to come up with a workable alternative. They’re still waiting. Staring political realities in the face, Johnson knows he cannot accept May’s deal after campaigning to replace it with a better one, and he cannot leave the E.U. without a deal because of the British Parliament. Talks with European leaders have been cordial but not particularly productive. At the end of the day, his best bet may indeed be accepting a tweaked version of May’s deal with a Northern Ireland–only backstop–which the E.U. is likely to grant, since that was its proposal in the first place–and putting it to a vote in the Commons. Since Johnson has lost the working majority anyway, appeasing the DUP is no longer an issue, and plenty of parliamentarians–maybe even a majority of them–could vote for the deal as the least bad option available and finally put an end to the Brexit drama. Then the Brits can hold an election and fight about Brexit at the ballot box–at that point, they’ll be the only ones who still care. Contact us at editors@time.com.

346,Brian Bennett,"As President Donald Trump weighed how to respond to a Sept. 14 drone and missile attack on Saudi oil facilities, which temporarily cut the kingdom’s output in half and roiled markets, he had several options. One, U.S. officials briefed on the White House deliberations tell TIME, was familiar: a Pentagon plan to bomb Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps targets on Persian Gulf islands. Trump was offered that plan after the Iranians shot down a U.S. Navy drone on June 20, and top advisers recommended he act on it then, but he turned it down, the officials say. A second option was quite different. In recent weeks, Trump had pressed aides to arrange for him to talk to Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York City at the end of September. One idea, the officials say, was to set up a moment of stagecraft when France’s President Emmanuel Macron would be talking to Rouhani and, seemingly impromptu, encourage Trump, press cameras in tow, to join them. Trump went with a third option: slapping new sanctions on Iran. Now, Iran may back out of the U.N. gathering altogether. That Trump was even considering meeting with Rouhani was remarkable. No U.S. President has met with an Iranian leader since the 1970s. Iran has upped its uranium enrichment program and increased attacks on world energy supplies and U.S. allies in the Middle East in recent months, targeting ships in and around the Gulf on May 12 and June 13. (Iran denies it was involved.) Days later, it shot down a Global Hawk surveillance drone, before allegedly hitting the world’s largest oil-processing plant. Trump’s desire for a meeting with Iran “is absurd at this point,” says Mark Dubowitz of the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But apparently, he says, “regardless of how destructive the regime in Iran’s behavior is, that will not dissuade him.” The episode lays bare Trump’s faith that he can solve the world’s most challenging and dangerous conflicts, from the Middle East to Afghanistan and North Korea, with a promiscuous combination of bravado and bonhomie. But recent events have shown the costs of that approach. As Trump pursued and then called off peace talks with Afghanistan’s Taliban, a series of Taliban-linked attacks killed at least 50 people this month. He continues to tout the possibility of peace with North Korea, even as Kim Jong Un tests missiles that could reach American and allied targets in the region. And the attack on Saudi oil facilities, which Trump’s aides attributed to Iran even as he hedged, spiked global oil prices by more than 10%, an ominous sign for the world economy–and for a President seeking re-election. The Iran challenge, to Trump’s critics, is a crisis of his own making. His Administration has been headed toward confrontation with Tehran since last year, when he walked away from the 2015 deal that curtailed Iran’s nuclear program, then imposed ever tighter sanctions on its oil and other exports, triggering an exodus of foreign corporations and financial institutions. Iran’s oil exports have plunged to historic lows, crippling its economy. “Trump finds himself backed into a corner because for a year now he has marched down an escalatory path while insisting he doesn’t want a conflict,” says Jeffrey Prescott, former senior adviser on the region under President Obama. U.S. intelligence officials, who believe Iran is behind the strike, are divided over Tehran’s motives. One camp has told Trump the recent attack reflects the economic pressure Iran feels and is a sign of increasing desperation. Another sees Iran’s months of strikes as Tehran testing Trump. None of which makes it easier to come up with a longer-term response to Iran’s latest moves. The Pentagon has long argued against a direct military strike on the Iranian mainland for fears that could trigger a wider war. Moreover, Tehran has maintained some deniability over the attack. Two Cabinet secretaries publicly attributed the attack to Iran, and military officials told Trump as recently as Sept. 16 that “they were planned and directed by Iranian officers with the knowledge of the government,” says a defense official. A Saudi military spokesman said debris showed Iran “unquestionably sponsored” the strikes. But the U.S. and its allies reportedly failed to track the incoming projectiles, apparently because they were advanced cruise missiles and low-flying drones. Diplomacy offers its own problems. Macron is pushing a plan to create a $15 billion line of credit for Iran, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has backed it, says a U.S. official briefed on the discussions. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the official says, has argued that easing pressure on Iran before it makes concessions on its nuclear program or reduces its use of proxy forces in the region would be dangerous, as it would reward that behavior. And if conflict with Iran would be bad politics for Trump in an election year, making a bad deal with Iran could be worse. The dilemma leaves him in an unusual spot, the sources familiar with White House talks say: looking for help from allies. “They want to respond, but as a group, or with allies,” says a former senior Trump Administration official in contact with U.S. and Gulf officials. That response will test Trump’s seemingly conflicting impulses, to look tough and to get the U.S. out of conflicts.","As Iran Gets Tough, Trump Seeks a Deal","September 19, 2019"
347,Anna Purna Kambhampaty,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized Wednesday night for wearing brownface at a 2001 “Arabian Nights”-themed party—less than two hours after TIME published a previously unreported yearbook photo from the event at the private school where he was teaching.  In a new revelation, Trudeau also admitted that he wore blackface “makeup” in high school to sing “Day-O,” a Jamaican folk song famously performed by African-American singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte. “When I was in high school I dressed up at a talent show and sang ‘Day O.’ With makeup on,” he said. A third instance emerged Thursday—this one a grainy video showing Trudeau in blackface, raising his hands in the air. Zita Astravas, the media relations lead of the Liberal Party of Canada, which Trudeau is the leader of, confirmed that the video showed Trudeau from the early 1990s. It comes despite Trudeau being asked Wednesday whether there were any other incidents he wanted to own up to. “The fact of the matter is that I’ve always—and you’ll know this—been more enthusiastic about costumes than is sometimes appropriate,” he responded. TIME’s publication of the photo embroiled his campaign in scandal, with Canadian reporters asking why he had not been forthcoming about the image if he knew it existed. Five weeks before election day on Oct. 21, Trudeau is in a dead heat with the Conservative Party. According to CBC News’ poll tracker on Sept. 18, which aggregates all publicly available polling data, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party were polling at 34.4% and 34.2% respectively. The New Democratic Party was polling at 13.5% and the Green Party was polling at 9.7%. Responding to the brownface photo to reporters, Trudeau acknowledged he was in the picture, which shows his face, neck and hands darkened. “I shouldn’t have done that. I should have known better but I didn’t and I’m really sorry,” Trudeau said. During his statement, which he made aboard his campaign plane in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Trudeau was asked multiple times by reporters if he would resign. The prime minister avoided answering the question directly. “I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn’t have done it. I should’ve known better,” he said.",Justin Trudeau Admits to Also Wearing Blackface 'Makeup' in High School Following TIME Report,"Updated: September 19, 2019 1:13 PM ET"
348,Laignee Barron / Taipei,"An influx of capitalist culture and a swelling desire for material goods could one day spell the end for North Korea’s Kim dynasty and hasten the pariah state’s re-entry into the international community. That’s according to a high-ranking defector who spoke recently to TIME. Thae Yong-ho, a former diplomat who held posts in Denmark, Sweden and the U.K. said that while the regime’s elusive leader, Kim Jong Un, may have no intention of undertaking reforms or giving up his nuclear weapons, change is inevitable. Thae, who was once a member of North Korea’s elite, defected to South Korea with his wife and two sons in 2016. He lives under the protection of the South Korean government, and travels with an entourage of body guards. As the DPRK’s deputy ambassador in London, Thae’s main responsibility was to counter criticism of Pyongyang’s human rights record and any negative media coverage. He has described becoming disenchanted with Kim Jong Un’s rule and escaped just as he was being recalled to Pyongyang. Since defecting, Thae has been sharing his insights on the secretive regime and advocating for tougher sanctions. TIME sat down with Thae in the Taiwanese capital Taipei, amid news that U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim have been expressing interest in another summit. North Korea says it wants to restart denuclearization talks with the U.S., but it’s also been conducting new missile tests. What’s going on? It has long been North Korea’s policy to make America and South Korea used to North Korea’s pattern of provocations [even] amid the dialogue campaign. It is not the first time North Korea did this. North Korea wants control. They do not want to be controlled.

349,Aria Chen / Hong Kong,"When he heard that people in Hong Kong were forming a human chain to call for democracy on Aug. 23, a local designer who goes by the name Phesti borrowed from the imagery of local subway signs to create a logo of figures holding hands. Underneath, in typography identical to that used by the train system, he wrote “HongKongers stand as one.” The image quickly went viral. Like many involved in Hong Kong’s protests, Phesti hides his identity behind a pseudonym. He is one of hundreds of anonymous creators turning out protest art to support the city’s push for greater political freedom. Phesti says his designs are for “people like me, who are in the peaceful camp don’t dare to protest on the front line and engage in more aggressive action.” He hopes the work will make such individuals “feel like they can still participate in something and find a way of saying what’s on their mind.” Since Hong Kong’s young people rose up in a pro-democracy rebellion three months ago, protest-related digital graphics, illustrations and paintings have exploded. The collection of agitprop ranges from infographics and memes, to illustrations based on news photos, and various adaptations of the famous 1830 painting by French artist Eugène Delacroix, Liberty Leading the People. Not all of the work is serious. Some is designed purely to give viewers a good laugh. “A lot of people are holding in their feelings, so some of these illustrations may offer them emotional relief,” says Arto, a satirist whose cartoons are hugely popular. “Fighting ridicule with humor is probably more effective than waging a public opinion war,” he tells TIME. Much of the work plays on Cantonese slang and makes reference to local music, global pop culture and advertising. Creations such as Phesti’s and Arto’s thrive in online forums, chat groups, social media and on so-called Lennon Walls, where people leave supportive messages on colorful post-it notes. At protests and on public transport, iPhone users often share images via mass Airdrops.

350,Madeleine Carlisle,"A Canadian teenager has been diagnosed with “severe respiratory illness” linked to use of vaping products, health officials in Ontario, Canada, confirmed Wednesday. “As far as we are aware this is the first case of vaping related illness that’s been reported in Canada,” said Dr. Christopher Mackie, the medical officer of health and CEO of the Middlesex-London Health Unit, at a press conference. According to Mackie, the unidentified individual was a “high school age youth” who had “no other health issues whatsoever.” He added that “[the individual] had quite a severe illness course, including ICU life support.” The teenager recovered and is now at home. Mackie’s said his team was notified of the case late last week. Mackie would not comment if the individual had vaped cannabis, which some have argued is driving the rise of vaping-related illnesses in the United States. As of Sept. 11, the Center for Disease Control in the U.S. had identified 380 confirmed and probable cases of lung disease associated with vaping in 36 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Seven people have died from vaping-related respiratory illnesses in the U.S. since the first case was reported on Aug. 23. “It’s important to point out that there are limitations to the science here,” Mackie said. “Many of the chemicals used in e-cigarettes have not been tested for their health impacts… It’s not known how e-cigarettes are causing these health concerns.” But he stressed that there was “no other potential cause [for the illness] identified other than vaping.” “The use of these products is escalating, especially by high school-aged youth, which is a major concern for us,” Linda Stobo, the manager of chronic disease and tobacco control at the Middlesex-London Health Unit, said at the press conference. Stobo cited a study by Professor David Hammond of the University of Waterloo that found vaping among Canadian youth ages 16-19 increased 74% between 2017 and 2018.",Canadian Teenager Diagnosed With 'Severe Respiratory Illness' Linked to Vaping,"September 18, 2019"
351,Joseph Hincks,"Israel’s second election in fewer than six months has ended in political deadlock, leaving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing an uncertain future and paving the way for protracted coalition negotiations. As the official count filtered in on Wednesday, no side emerged with a clear path to government.   “The era of Netanyahu is over,” claimed one opposition lawmaker as exit polls emerged Tuesday night. But while the prime minister is down, he’s not yet out. As pre-election polls had predicted, Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party together with allied right-wing nationalist and religious parties fell well short of securing the 61 seats required for a parliamentary majority. But so did his principal opponent Benny Gantz, who leads the nominally centrist party Blue and White. With 91% of the votes counted, Blue and White had 32 seats, with Likud on 31. It remains to be seen which of the two leaders Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin, who occupies a largely ceremonial role, will ask to form a coalition.  Both, predictably, claimed they could. “In the next few days, we will begin negotiations to form a strong, Zionist government and in order to avert a dangerous, anti-Zionist government,” a weary looking Netanyahu told supporters in the Likud headquarters late Tuesday night. In Tel Aviv, Gantz said his party would “act to form a broad unity government that will express the will of the people.” With Israel now set for coalition negotiations all options are on the table, including a third election. Here are some of the scenarios that might emerge in the coming weeks. The most likely outcome, although it’s far from assured would be a so-called government of national unity, bringing together the two largest parties, and possibly others across the political spectrum. Gantz and secular nationalist party leader Avigdor Lieberman — who, as polls predicted, has emerged as a kingmaker — have both expressed their preference for a liberal national unity government. It would revolve around a partnership between Likud and centrist Blue and White, with or without Lieberman’s party, Yisrael Beiteinu. There are several obstacles: the largest being Gantz’s vow not to sit in a government with Netanyahu, citing three looming corruption charges on which Israel’s attorney general has said he would indict Netanyahu, pending a hearing. Over the coming weeks Netanyahu is expected to pull out all the stops to persuade Gantz to rescind on his promise. On Wednesday evening, a senior member of Likud said the door was open for negotiations with Gantz, provided he drop his demand for the party to abandon Netanyahu. Likud jettisoning Netanyahu is a remote possibility but there is unlikely to be any talk of a putsch until the implications of the election results are clearer. For now, the party Netanyahu has molded in his image has vowed to stick with its leader. Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin will soon decide whether to give Gantz or Netanyahu the first shot at forming a government. Given the latter’s failure to do so in May, and Blue and White’s marginal lead at the latest count, Gantz seems the likelier bet, Israel’s Haaretz suggests. Whomever is given the mandate would have 28 days to form a government, with the option to ask for a short extension.",Israel's Election Has Ended in Deadlock.

353,Arsalan Shahla and Josh Wingrove / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) –– U.S. President Donald Trump ordered tighter sanctions on Iran days after strikes on Saudi Arabia’s biggest oil installation rattled energy markets and raised the specter of a slide toward regional war. “I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!” Trump said in tweet. Trump didn’t say what the new measures may involve. The U.S. has already imposed sweeping sanctions on much of Iran’s economy — especially its oil sales — since exiting the landmark 2015 nuclear deal last year in an effort to curtail Tehran’s regional influence and military capabilities. Tightening U.S. penalties have battered the Iranian currency, driving up prices and causing shortages. Iran is gradually scaling back its commitments under the deal and has said it won’t reopen talks without sanctions relief. The confrontation has sporadically convulsed the Gulf, with the strikes on oil tankers, an American drone and a key pipeline pushing the region to the brink of open conflict. Saturday’s attack on the heart of the Saudi oil industry drove tensions to new heights. Trump’s announcement comes hours before Saudi Arabia unveils what it says is evidence of Iran’s involvement in the attack, which shook crude markets and slashed output at OPEC’s largest producer. U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo is also due to arrive in the kingdom on Wednesday. While Trump hasn’t directly blamed Iran for the attacks, Pompeo has, and U.S. officials have said the location of the damage and weapons used suggest the attack wasn’t launched from Yemen. Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen have repeatedly claimed responsibility and have carried out numerous strikes on Saudi territory during a four-year war with a military coalition led by the kingdom. Earlier on Wednesday, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said his country wasn’t looking for a war as the Islamic Republic sent a cable to Washington formally denying any role. Addressing a cabinet meeting, Rouhani said the assault was carried out by Yemeni rebels retaliating against Saudi Arabia’s military campaign in their country.",Trump Orders Tighter Sanctions on Iran After Attack on Saudi Arabia,"September 18, 2019"
354,Laignee Barron,"Geneva, Sydney, Taipei, New York—at another point in Denise Ho’s career these might have been stops on a concert tour. Instead, the Cantonese pop diva turned icon of Hong Kong’s protest movement has been traveling around the world drumming up support for her city’s struggle against authoritarian China. Ho has spent the last five years hitching her stardom to Hong Kong’s democracy fight, and in response, has been banned from the lucrative mainland Chinese market and dropped from sponsorship deals and by her record label. As a singer, Ho hit the mainstream in the 2000s. Then, in 2012, she was the first major female star in Hong Kong to come out, and began advocating for LGBT+ rights. In 2014, she was arrested for joining the “Umbrella Revolution,” a protest movement calling for free elections and an end to Beijing’s encroachment on semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Amid the enclave’s latest political upheaval, Ho continues to be one of the most prominent celebrities on the front lines. When she’s not calling on the U.N. Human Rights Council to drop China from the international body, Ho can be spotted sporting the protester’s black t-shirt uniform and joining the chants of “Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time.” TIME caught up with Ho on the sidelines of the Oslo Freedom Forum in Taipei, Taiwan last week. You’ve paid a price for your political activism. Do you feel more Hongkongers are now also having to choose between their careers and political views? For sure. The main thing we can see is that people are restraining themselves from speaking their minds, not only public figures and celebrities, but also really anyone who might, say, travel to China, or who might be working in the corporate [sector]. I have close friends who are scared to even take a photo with me. So you see this kind of fear and self-censorship, and it is a very dangerous thing really, because that is how Communist governments always work. They instill fear and then people do these things on their own. You’ve said the ‘one country, two systems’ framework Beijing uses to govern Hong Kong is doomed.

355,Rachael Bunyan,"An American cancer survivor has made history after becoming the first person to swim the English Channel four times non-stop. Sarah Thomas began her historic 130-mile feat (209 km) early on Sunday morning and finished just over 54 hours later on Tuesday morning at about 6:30am, according to her GPS tracker. Thomas, from Colorado, was met with cheers by a small crowd and given champagne and chocolate as she reached the shore at Dover for the final time, the Associated Press reported. She told AP she felt “a little sick” after 54 hours in the water and thanked her husband and supporters for their encouragement. The 37-year-old was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer in November 2017 and underwent chemotherapy, surgery and radiation last year. Thomas had booked her turn to swim the English Channel before her diagnosis and has been pushing towards the marathon swim since her first round of chemotherapy. Thomas admitted she was scared before the marathon swim. “I’ve been waiting for this swim for over two years now and have fought so hard to get here,” she said in a Facebook post. “Am I 100%? No. But I’m the best that I can be right now, with what I’ve been through, with more fire and fight than ever.” The swim was supposed to be around 80 miles in length, but because of the strong tides, Thomas ended up swimming closer to 130 miles. The ultra marathon swimmer dedicated her historic achievement to fellow survivors of breast cancer. “This is for those of us who have prayed for out lives, who have wondered with despair about what comes next, and have battled through pain and fear to overcome,” she said in a Facebook post.",American Cancer Survivor Becomes First Person To Swim English Channel 4 Times Non-Stop,"September 17, 2019"

357,Gilead Sher,"First there was the moving of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Then came a recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, followed by a qualified U.S. statement that Israel has the right to annex portions of the West Bank. All positive declarations, all contested issues in an eventual peace process, all exercises in declaratory futility, not substance. All these, while Trump’s long-awaited Israeli-Palestinian “Deal of the Century” is yet to be laid out – if at all. Now, ostensibly, comes a new stunt: A U.S.-Israel Defense pact or Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT), which conveniently serves two personal-political agendas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu desperately needs the appearance of a diplomatic coup ahead of the Sept. 17th election. President Donald Trump, seeking re-election next year, will be happy to oblige. Israel’s relations and effective alliance with the U.S. are the central tenet of its national security, a diplomatic shield and a military force multiplier. These relations are an invaluable and irreplaceable asset that Israel cherishes deeply. A formal “defense pact”, however, would be an entirely different story — and the reasons for and against it bear some thinking about. In the past, Israel refrained from raising the issue of a formal treaty, since the U.S. demanded two prerequisites that Israel could not deliver: Permanent and recognized borders, and signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Additionally, a defense pact would require approval by the U.S. Senate. This is not necessarily a process Israel wants. Those in Israel who supported such a pact argued it would amplify Israel’s deterrence, that it would formalize the existing defense relationship and elevate Israel’s stature in U.S. foreign policy, and that it would enhance regional stability. A U.S.-Israel defense treaty, the thinking went, would also conceivably serve as a component of a regional security system, under U.S. auspices, in a foreseeable future. These arguments are undoubtedly not without merit and substance. But in 2019 they are flawed in one major way: They were predicated on a different Middle East, in a totally different regional and global reality. In its 72nd year of independence Israel is under no existential threat and enjoys an unrivaled military advantage and technological superiority. The military threats Israel does face are from non-state actors, not amenable to conventional deterrence. U.S. support of Israel, both diplomatically and militarily, is already factored into their behavior and calculus. In short, a treaty would not deter anyone or anything. The arguments against a defense pact, shared by a majority in the Israeli defense and diplomatic establishment, were more compelling in our view. The main argument against a pact was that it would not be realistically practicable, at a time when some form of a “peace process” still existed: that in exchange for a pact, Israel would be asked to make major concessions and take such security risks that a pact would not adequately address.",Netanyahu's Defense Treaty with Trump Is a Bad Idea.

358,Tara Law,"President Donald Trump says the United States is “locked and loaded” after an attack against oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, an American ally and a major producer of the world’s energy supply. A rebel group in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attacks, which targeted a facility belonging to Saudi Aramco, the Kingdom’s national oil company. However, American officials claim Iran, Saudi Arabia’s regional rival, is to blame. The finger-pointing has led to a rapid escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran, already at a fever pitch following the Trump administration’s withdrawal from a nuclear agreement with Tehran, as well as a series of incidents in the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping lane. Here’s what to know about the drone attacks in Saudi Arabia and what lies ahead as the U.S. grapples with an attack against a key ally. Oil facilities belonging to Saudi national energy company Saudi Aramco were struck by a drone attack on Saturday. The strikes hit the Abqaiq processing facility, the largest crude processing plant in the world, and the Khurais oil field, which is said to produce more than 1 million barrels of crude oil a day, the Associated Press reports. The attacks caused major fires and a large plume of smoke. The U.S. released satellite photos that it says shows that two Saudi energy facilities had been struck at least 19 times, the AP reports. Saudi oil facilities have been hit by similar strikes in recent weeks, but previous attacks didn’t cause as much damage.

359,TIME Staff,"A human rights group has called on the Chinese government to release an undetermined number of Uighur children being arbitrarily held in so-called “child welfare” institutions and boarding schools in Xinjiang. In a statement Monday, the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said “Chinese authorities have housed countless children whose parents are detained or in exile in state-run child welfare institutions and boarding schools without parental consent or access.” An estimated one million Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims are held in Chinese political reeducation camps in Xinjiang. HRW says an additional unknown number are held in prisons and other detention centers. The rights group’s China director, Sophie Richardson, said “The Chinese government’s forced separation of children is perhaps the cruelest element of its oppression in Xinjiang. Children should be either immediately returned to the custody of relatives in China or allowed to join their parents outside the country.” According to HRW, Xinjiang government documents do not indicate whose consent is needed for children to be held in institutions, which government agencies make decisions about removals, or “whether there are procedures for determining consent or challenges to such determinations.” It added that it was “deeply concerned about practices in these facilities that appear to deny children their basic rights and cultural heritage,” pointing out that the children were taught in Chinese instead of their own language, and made to “sing and dance to propagandistic songs.” Beijing’s treatment of Uighurs has been strongly condemned.

360,TIME Staff,"Protesters in Hong Kong once again defied a police ban Sunday to march through the territory’s downtown districts in their push for greater political freedom, but what began as a peaceful demonstration quickly turned violent. Shortly after the march began, protesters set up barricades on Harcourt Road, near the city’s legislature and main government offices, and hurled bricks and petrol bombs. Police responded with water cannon, rubber bullets, and tear gas, while the legislature was evacuated. Local news broadcasts showed protesters burning the Chinese flag and tearing down and burning a large banner that had been erected to commemorate China’s upcoming national day on Oct. 1. Protesters also vandalized subway stations, venting their fury at a train operator that they accuse of being in league with the the authorities by transporting riot police to demonstrations but shutting stations when protesters need to leave. As the night wore on, there were reports of pro-government gangs armed with rods beating protesters in eastern districts of Hong Kong Island. Earlier in the day, protesters waved the U.S. flag, and even banners for President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, as they flooded the streets in their thousands chanting “Resist Beijing!

The pair spoke after a swarm of explosive drones hit key oil-industry targets in Saudi Arabia. The state-run Saudi Press Agency earlier reported on the call. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the strikes, which forced Saudi Aramco to cut daily oil production in half. The U.S. “strongly condemns today’s attack on critical energy infrastructure,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an emailed statement that was also posted on Twitter. The U.S. government “is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied.” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a confidant of Trump, earlier urged a decisive U.S. response against Iranian targets. “It is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,” Graham of South Carolina said on Twitter. “Iran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries.” John Abizaid, the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said in a tweet “attacks against critical infrastructure endanger civilians, are unacceptable, and sooner or later will result in innocent lives being lost.” Contact us at editors@time.com.",President Trump Offers Support for Saudi Self-Defense in Call With Prince Mohammed Bin Salman,"September 14, 2019"

In a statement, Detective Inspector Jess Milne, said: “The piece of art that has been stolen is a high value toilet made out of gold that was on display at the palace.” Police said the burglars broke in overnight and left the scene around 4:50 a.m. BST Saturday morning. Law enforcement received a call about the burglary at 4:57 a.m. No one was injured. The artwork, titled “America,” was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan and was first displayed in the Guggenheim in New York City, N.Y. in 2016. The fully functioning toilet — which visitors were welcome to use — is made of 18-karat gold and reportedly estimated to be worth more than $1 million. It had just opened at Blenheim Palace on Sept. 12, and was scheduled to run through Oct. 27. In a press conference Saturday, Inspector Richard Nicholls said a 66-year-old man has been arrested “in connection with this incident.” He also said police believe the burglars used two vehicles. “Due to the toilet being plumbed into the building, this has caused significant damage and flooding,” Detective Inspector Milne said in the police statement.

363,Benki Pyãnko,"As TIME reported in its recent special climate issue, the fires from the Amazon seen across the skies of Brazil in August “helped illuminate something the world can no longer ignore.” On the front lines of the fight to protect the land is 46-year-old Benki Pyãnko, who has experienced these significant — and devastating—changes to the environment firsthand. An ambassador of the Ashaninka people, Pyãnko has led environmental and reforesting projects in his community of Apiwtxa, inhabiting the indigenous territory of Terra Kampa do Rio Amônia in the Brazilian state of Acre, located close to the border with Peru and covered by the Amazon rainforest. There are around 3,000 Ashaninka people living across four indigenous land areas in Brazil, and over 120,000 Ashaninka living over the frontier in Peru. Pyãnko’s Apiwtxa community won the United Nations Equator Prize in 2017, a prize honoring indigenous communities, for its reforesting initiatives and defense of Ashaninka rights and culture. As part of the Flourishing Diversity Series at University College London, Pyãnko was one of several indigenous leaders invited from around the world to gather and share their experiences of protecting their environments. TIME spoke with Pyãnko about the solutions that indigenous people can offer to tackle climate change, and what lessons the rest of the world can learn from them. Where we live, there is still a great deal of richness as far as forests, animals, plants. These species still exist because of the way we guarded and tended the forest since around 1986 when we began this work of preservation. Our people still maintain our culture very protectively and very well, but with all that we have protected, we also carry great worry, because of all that surrounds us where we live. People who use the forest hunt animals to a great extent, take part in logging activities, and deforest the forest to make way for pastures. Our rivers cannot exist without the forest, our animals cannot live without the forest, and we ourselves depend on these plants and animals for our consumption, for our existence.  Deforesting was one of the greatest catastrophes that happened in our territory. People felled our forests, and that made our rivers very dry. There were many species of fish that disappeared, as the forest has been cut down, many kinds of animals also disappeared, or disappeared from that region at least. We have experienced a lot more heatwaves now, almost unbearable heatwaves. There would be rains during the summer time as if it were winter time, and also dryness during the rainy season. There’s been growing lightning storms and hurricane storms that would come and uproot many trees. We had great floods that caused many animals to die, and even people. Because of climatic changes, there are many species of trees whose fruits are borne before the correct time of the year. All the people who live in the forest realize that over the last 30 years, the changes have been very significant.  It is man who has been perpetrating all this disaster. We see mining and oil business coming into our area and invading our rivers. There were gold mines, with many areas of the forest burned or logged, and we have seen many industries moving into the area that pollute the air, significantly. We see all the rubbish created by these industries, not only plastic but also cans and all the waste being thrown in our rivers.  All our worry about the destruction that is happening makes us take our message as indigenous peoples to the whole world, speaking about these problems. Our environment, our natural fruits, animals and plants are the security of our lives. And if we don’t take care of all these species, of this richness of nature, we are heading towards a great catastrophe that may affect us in a very deep way. That’s why my work as a leader is to try to show people how we can change this attitude, and we can change all of this. That’s why I have come out of my village to go outside and show to other people with my projects what can be done to protect our environment.  One of our projects is how to maintain the balance of the environment, reforesting the areas that have been cut down and degraded, both with native species and with fruit trees, in order to create an environment that will bring the forest back and provide food to people. We have planted over 2 million trees already for this project, which is called Yorenka Ãtame, and by doing so, we have recovered many water sources and brought life back to our rivers. My project is to plant another 10 million trees, and I want to show young people in particular how they can tend the forest in order to guarantee their futures, to create a sustainable situation consciously, without harming the environment in such a violent way as man does. The idea is to put people in connection with nature again. We intend to cure the world through curing people’s minds.  I see today a big confrontation between people and nature. That comes from our industrial-scale economy, and a society that lives only for consuming. Our governments are creating projects that actually harm people’s lives, perhaps slowly, but in a very pervasive way. People are just trying to get rich, and they are killing one another, sometimes without even knowing it. Our governments today, in my view as an indigenous leader, need to respect nature more. They also need to respect everyone’s lives, the lives of all human beings, who depend on the land to survive. It is our very governments who are killing the earth.  Brazil shows the catastrophe that happens when nature and indigenous peoples are not respected. We know Amazonia sustains other environments in other regions of the planet, and it needs to be respected. The international community needs to call to attention the behavior of our president in Brazil as a child who hasn’t yet learnt how to deal with all this, because what our president is doing is a great betrayal for all humanity, not only for us Brazilians. I call upon all the youth of the world, all those concerned with our future, to unite.

Joseph Hillhouse, assistant fire chief at Gainesville Fire Rescue, was part of a six-man team that collaborated with local emergency services on urban search and rescue missions in the town of Marsh Harbour in the Abaco Islands. The team collaborated with the other U.S. search and rescue groups, local emergency operations center and the Bahamian Police, who Gainesville Fire Rescue chief Jeff Lane says provided them with their missions and logistical support. “[They] basically said we’re going where the damage is the worst and the resources are the least. That’s how they ended up at Marsh Harbour, which was in the eye of the hurricane on Sept 1,” Lane explains. Lane says the team is trained to deal with covering large areas, rapidly searching for survivors and extricating them from debris. Given the extent of Dorian’s impact, however, their work mostly involved helping find and identify the storm’s victims, as well as assisting with providing humanitarian aid for survivors in need of first aid, water, and direction to emergency facilities. On Sept. 1 Dorian made landfall on the Bahamas as a category 5 hurricane, with up to 185 mph winds. The storm completely devastated the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama. According to Prime Minister Hubert Minnis, 43 people have been confirmed dead. As of Friday however, 1,500 people are still missing. Hillhouse tells TIME that the team helped recover 10 bodies, describing that as a relatively low number because of how bad conditions were. “I think the amount of devastation played into [our search efforts],” he says. “There are so many structures that were destroyed, it wasn’t as simple as just going inside… some [bodies] we had to get to, we had to tunnel through debris to be able to reach them.” Hillhouse tells TIME that certain areas in Marsh Harbour were so hard hit that there were no remaining buildings. While his team has worked on other search and rescue missions in Florida and Mexico, he says nothing compares to what they saw there. “[It] was the worst natural disaster I’ve ever seen,” Hillhouse says, placing the devastation at “somewhere in the 90th percentile.”",'The Worst Natural Disaster I've Ever Seen.'

A tropical storm warning for the northwestern Bahamas has since been discontinued and no coastal watches or warnings related to Humberto are in effect. As of 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, the Tropical Storm Humberto was moving away from the Bahamas, towards the north-northwest at 7 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was located 135 miles north northwest from Great Abaco with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. The storm is expected to strengthen over the next couple of days and turn into a hurricane later on Sunday. But, by then, it will be over open water and no longer be a threat to land. Although earlier forecasts showed that the storm could move onto Florida’s east coast, it is now expected to stay “well offshore” Florida. A tropical storm watch was originally in place for east-central Florida, but it was discontinued late on Friday night. “Since the forecast track has shifted farther to the east, the chance of heavy rainfall affecting the southeastern United States has diminished,” the National Hurricane Center said. Most of the heaviest rain occurred north and east of Center as winds of 40 miles per hour hit the island.

The death of secularist President Beji Caïd Essebsi, 92, in July forced the presidential elections to be held earlier than originally scheduled. Tunisia, the only democracy to emerge from the 2011 Arab Spring, is plagued by economic stagnation, security threats, and political instability – all key themes of the candidates’ campaigns.  There are 26 candidates vying for the position, including two women, a current prime minister, a defense minister and a former president. Although the race is still wide open the pollsters’ favorite is Nabil Karoubi, a media mogul who is currently campaigning to be president from behind bars. The secular candidate was sent to jail on charges of tax evasion and money laundering.  Tunisians will head to the polls on Sunday, Sept. 15. Over seven million are registered to vote – an increase of nearly two and a half million since the May 2018 local elections. Voters will be selecting their second democratically elected president from 26 candidates. A second-round vote could be held in November if no candidate secures an absolute majority. This is likely, given the high number of candidates this year.  Nabil Karoui, a media mogul, is one of the most noteworthy secularist candidates for the presidency. Karoui, who owns Nesma, a private TV station critical of the government, was imprisoned on charges of tax evasion and money laundering in August. He denies the charges, and is appealing. On Wednesday, he started a hunger strike demanding to be allowed to vote in the presidential elections this week, media reports say.  The 56-year-old is only able to continue his bid for the presidency because his charges do not explicitly disallow him from running.

Throughout the morning of Aug. 21, its diplomats at the United Nations in Geneva took the floor, nitpicking language in a document meant to pave the way for an eventual ban on lethal autonomous weapons, also known as killer robots, an emerging category of weapons that would be able to fight on their own and decide who to target and kill.  “They were basically trying to waste time,” says Laura Nolan of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, who watched with frustration in the hall. But while Russia vigorously worked to derail progress, it had a quieter partner: China. “I very much get the impression that they’re working together in some way,” says Nolan. “[The Chinese] are letting the Russians steamroll the process, and they’re happy to hang back.” China has stayed coy at these discussions, which have taken place at least once a year since 2014. Its delegates contribute just the minimum, and often send ambiguous signals on where they stand. They have called killer robots a “humanitarian concern,” yet have stepped in to water down the text being debated.  Stakes are high for the emerging military power.

368,"Dalia Hatuqa / Ramallah, West Bank","On a chilly April evening, several elderly Palestinian men sat in a smoke-filled downtown Ramallah cafe watching the news. The anchor on the enormous flat-screen mounted on the wall read election results that would affect their lives in every way imaginable. The tally was not from Palestinian polls, which haven’t been held in 14 years, but next door, in Israel.  As the days went on, Palestinians saw how much Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was willing to secure an electoral victory, including vowing to annex West Bank settlements. They watched as Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, made compromises with the most fringe elements of the Israeli far-right to draw votes from his competitors. Though Netanyahu had won the elections, he failed to form a coalition, spurring a do-over that has left him more politically exposed than he has been in over a decade. And with that, he has gone even further to secure another victory in the next elections on Sept. 17: On Tuesday, he announced plans to annex the Jordan Valley, a large and important part of the West Bank, if his party wins. “This has gone far beyond lip-service and vows, it’s now just contingent upon finding the right place and the right time for Israel to annex parts of the West Bank,” says Ghassan Zaqtan, a renowned Palestinian writer and poet based in Ramallah. “Netanyahu will not hesitate to do anything — and that includes annexing West Bank settlements — to stay prime minister.” Zaqtan, and others like him in the West Bank and Gaza, say they have grown used to watching Israeli politicians use them as political pawns. And so, despondency has become a mainstay of Palestinian life. Since the Oslo Accords were signed in the 1990s, Palestinians have placed their bets on successive American administrations, hoping that despite all odds, the U.S. will deliver them a state of their own.  But hearing Netanyahu make promises to formally exercise authority over the West Bank has pushed the already-waning dream of a two-state solution even further away. Palestinians watched in anger over the last two years as the dominoes fell one by one: First, in December 2017, Trump recognized the holy city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital; then in March, he recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights (Syrian territory, considered occupied by Israel under international law), a badly needed boost for Netanyahu as he faced unprecedented election competition. And on Tuesday, Netanyahu confirmed that the annexation of West Bank settlements required “maximum coordination” with Washington. Whether Washington will endorse this move remains to be seen; the Trump Administration is expected to unveil its much-vaunted plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace after the Israeli elections on Sept. 17. But Zaqtan thinks an endorsement is likely. “The Trump administration has gone beyond supporting the decisions of the right-wing government in Israel to pave the way for annexation,” he says. “It has given a continuous green light for everything it has done so far.” Annexation in the West Bank has been occurring on the ground for decades. Starting in and around Jerusalem after the 1967 war, the settlement enterprise soon expanded into the West Bank proper, with an especially large push using “outposts” — settlements built without government permission — during the Oslo years (1993-97) under Shimon Peres’ and Yitzak Rabin’s premierships. But in the years since, the aggressive push in East Jerusalem, along with retroactive legalization of outposts, accelerated settlement construction, and the destruction of Palestinian homes, all indicate that annexation is a primary policy within Israel’s government and has indeed become the new norm.  “Annexation has been de facto the case for a long time, some might argue from the beginning of the occupation, but certainly since the Second Intifada [2000-2005],” said Tareq Baconi, a Ramallah-based analyst with the International Crisis Group. “But this process of creeping annexation has been gathering pace under Netanyahu’s government as officials push for formal annexation and have begun introducing bills to the Knesset in that direction.”",'Less Space to Breathe.'

369,Gina Martinez,"Officials from the Dominican Republic gathered in New York City, along with the U.S. Ambassador, on Thursday to announce new safety measures months after 11 American tourists died in several resorts there last spring. Javier Garcia, the Dominican Republic’s Minister of Tourism, told reporters at the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan that these new safety measures were put in place to specifically address safety at resorts that were at the center of the coverage.  The measures introduced include reinforcing mandates that require emergency information and the availability of 911 in every guest room, and a new emergency tourist center in Bávaro in Punta Cana, where multi-lingual specialists can communicate with tourists and their families. The Ministry of Tourism also announced that it partnered with Ecolab, a United States-based water, hygiene and energy technology lab to provide training and certification to all Department of Tourism Services and Companies inspectors. Garcia also announced that an additional 4,000 agents have been hired for both the tourist security agency and the national police, and that 3,000 more public security cameras have been installed. U.S Ambassador to the Dominican Republican Robin Bernstein said that an “unfounded negative campaign” contributed to a “tourism crisis” on the island, and pointedly noted that the U.S. State Department has maintained a level-two advisory to the Dominican Republic — similar to that of countries including Spain, Denmark, and Belgium. “American tourists should feel safe and secure,” she said. “I am totally comfortable with safety level, it is one of the safest tourist destinations I have ever visited. In fact, it has now become an even safer place to come because of the initiatives.” Bernstein also specifically addressed reports that tainted alcohol led to the deaths, noting that if there were a problem with alcohol there would be far more reports of deaths.",Dominican Republic Announces New Safety Measures After Deaths of 11 American Tourists,"September 13, 2019"
370,Sanya Mansoor,"After an artist printed out 62,000 pages of Hillary Clinton’s emails as part of an art exhibition titled “HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails” in Venice, Italy, the former Democratic presidential nominee showed up and spent an hour reading them. She even posed for a picture that she posted on Twitter Thursday morning, joking that someone should “alert the House GOP.” The artist behind the show, Kenneth Goldsmith, downloaded and printed emails that were already publicly available on the internet — after the Clinton campaign and internal Democratic party email accounts were hacked — via WikiLeaks and the state department with the redactions intact. Goldsmith, who teaches writing at The University of Pennsylvania, has created a makeshift White House in a historic Venice building that used to be an theatre hall. The space was converted into a supermarket in 2016 after being restored and renovated. Heaps of documents sit on a replica of the desk in the Oval Office for the public to read through. They are pulled from the domain clintonemail.com between 2009 and 2013, per WikiLeaks, according to an online description from the curators. The exhibition aims, its curators say, to show that “the pile of papers is rather unimpressive, rebutting Trump’s efforts to make them monumental.” And it’s also to examine how the case “”changed irrevocably” issues about privacy, transparency, propaganda and democracy in Western politics. Francesco Ragazzi, a curator of the exhibit, says the team behind the show wanted the art to center facts, instead of of “ideological narratives.” “In this exhibit you can actually read all these emails by yourself,” Ragazzi tells TIME. “It’s an invitation to study, to research for the truth.” Clinton flipped through copies of the documents for about an hour in a bizarre spectacle that the curators described as a “sort of vertigo.” “The subject was in front of her portrait,” Francesco Urbano, a second curator of the exhibit tells TIME. They had no idea that Clinton would get involved, and had not formally invited her. She apparently found them after a friend visited the Italian exhibition and her staff later reached out. “At the beginning we were thinking it was a bad joke or something,” Ragazzi says. “We quickly realized everything was true when we saw the security services inside the supermarket on Tuesday.”","'Alert The House GOP.'

372,Rachael Bunyan,"Australian police have thwarted a billion-dollar international drug smuggling operation — reportedly with the help of a giant seal. An international investigation into the drug gang reached its climax last week after an abandoned yacht was found on the shoreline of Stick Island, off the coast of Western Australia, sparking a search for its occupants. “The fishing community of Geraldton played a significant role in this detection and seizure and maintained regular contact with police as this matter unfolded,” police said later in an incident report. “These people have helped protect Western Australia’s borders… and we are grateful for their efforts.” As planes searched the area, two men were spotted attempting to hide among bushes on the nearby Burton Island. The men, Antione Dicenta, 51, and Graham Palmer, 34 — French and British nationals respectively — were allegedly trying to hide 40 bags containing more than a tonne of cocaine and ecstasy under seaweed. According to Australian media reports, the drugs’ street value is estimated at AUD$1 billion. When police arrived on the island, Dicenta and Palmer tried to flee. But there was huge seal in their way, Damien Healy, a vice commander of the area’s volunteer marine rescue service told ABC radio. “They woke it up and it jumped up with its big chest out and bellowed at them,” he added. “The guys basically had the choice of going through the seal or getting arrested and they ended up choosing to get arrested.” The pair have since been charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. Three other men have also been charged for their involvement in the drugs operation. Australian police believe these men were nearby in another boat and “were ready to receive” the haul from Dicenta and Palmer, Western Australia’s police commissioner Chris Dawson explained. “We’ve disrupted a big international drug syndicate here,” Dawson said.

373,Sanya Mansoor,"Hurricane Dorian’s 185 mph winds and punishingly slow pace smashed entire neighborhoods in the Bahamas, killing at least 50 people. But now, Bahamians are facing a different kind of threat. The lack of access to toilets, clean water and medications puts tens of thousands at risk for disease, public health experts warn. Bahamians in the hardest-hit areas are already suffering from cuts and gashes caused by widespread debris and wreckage. But now aid groups are saying survivors are beginning to show signs of gastrointestinal issues from contaminated water. Those with chronic illnesses are struggling without access to treatment for chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. And if water that the storm dumped on the islands remains stagnant and untreated for long enough, it could become a breeding ground for mosquitos, giving rise to diseases like dengue, chikungunya and Zika. “There’s a lot of downstream cascading effects people don’t think about,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells TIME. Previous disasters in the Caribbean have brought infectious disease outbreaks that wreaked havoc after the initial disaster. Cholera killed thousands in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and and at least two dozen are believed to have died in Puerto Rico from a leptospirosis outbreak following Hurricane Maria in 2017. Heart to Heart International, a Kansas-based organization experienced in disaster relief, sent a team of about a dozen people, including eight medical professionals, to Abaco last week, where they have been working alongside the government in the town of Treasure Cay. “The clinic doesn’t have a toilet. People don’t have toilets. They’re going to have to go to the bathroom somewhere. Food will get contaminated. Water will get contaminated. Hands will just pass things, even under the best of circumstances that happens,” says CEO Kim Carroll, who is in the U.S. but has been communicating regularly with her team in the Bahamas. The Heart to Heart team arrived on the islands “completely self-sufficient” so that they could “go in ready to handle their own waste,” she adds. The staff uses a bucket with a special trash bag that’s been treated with a product to help break down human waste — a method that most regular Bahamians do not have access to. Many patients who have come to see them are dehydrated, Carroll tells TIME. Others have chronic conditions unrelated to the storm, including hypertension and diabetes. Untreated hypertension can lead to strokes, Carroll says. Diabetics are at risk, too. “If there are any type-1 diabetics there, if they haven’t had access to insulin by now, they’ve died, most often,” she says. Dr. Rick Randolph, a chief medical officer for Heart to Heart working in the Bahamas, tells TIME the clinic has been seeing about 30 to 40 patients a day; many of them are low-income. “Disasters are the diseases of the poor,” he says. One diabetic patient had to be airlifted after he came in with a blood infection that crept into his leg. He had a puncture wound that became infected.",Hurricane Dorian Is Gone.

374,Joseph Hincks,"Facing a re-run election on September 17, embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to extend his country’s sovereignty over a large swath of the West Bank — a move that if implemented would deal a mortal blow to the prospect of a two State Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While Netanyahu has a history of making dramatic plays to his right wing base in the run up to elections, what’s surprising is how little his rival candidate Benny Gantz, has pushed back on the idea of annexation. Standing before an easel-mounted map late on Tuesday, Netanyahu promised to “apply Israeli sovereignty” over the Jordan Valley and Northern Dead Sea “immediately after the election,” should he win. He also said he would look to apply Israeli sovereignty over all West Bank settlements in co-ordination with the U.S. It was a significant expansion of his pledge, made days before Israelis took to the polls in April, to annex parts of the West Bank. Netanyahu’s map depicted the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea—which comprises almost one third of the occupied West Bank—mostly shaded in blue to represent what he said would constitute “Israel’s eastern border” with Jordan. Annexing the shaded portion sometimes referred to as Area C would mean Israeli land would completely encircle any future Palestinian state. “We haven’t had this kind of opportunity since the six-day war [of 1967] and may not have it again for another 50 years,” the Prime Minister said. Palestinian leaders, liberal American Jewish organizations, and Jordan’s Foreign Minister have all condemned Netanyahu’s plan, the latter warning it would “push the whole region towards violence” and calling the plan “a serious escalation that undermines all peace efforts.” U.N. chief Antonio Guterres said Netanyahu’s plan would be “devastating” to the potential for regional peace and constitute a violation of international law. The Israel Policy Forum (IFP), a Jewish American organization that advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict said in a statement that annexation, no matter how partial, “would have disastrous consequences for Israel, its security, and its status as a Jewish and democratic state.” However, Netanyahu’s main election opponent, Benny Gantz and his Blue and White party issued no such condemnation and instead claimed ownership of the origin of the plan. “Blue and White have made clear that the Jordan Valley is part of Israel forever. Netanyahu drafted a plan to cede the Jordan Valley in 2014,” the party said in a statement shortly after Netanyahu’s announcement. “We are happy that the Prime Minister has come around to adopt the Blue and White plan to recognize the Jordan valley.” Gantz, a retired Israel Defense Force (IDF) general, went on to describe Netanyahu’s vow as spin designed to divert the electorate’s attention from Gaza rocket attacks. He called it an “empty promise” and said that he would replace with “actions and deeds.” It was not immediately clear what action Gantz intended to take on the Jordan Valley, and he did not use the word annexation or sovereignty. The timing of Netanyahu’s announcement so close to elections gives credence to Gantz’s claim that it is spin: fulfilling a long held ambition of some Israelis who see the occupied Palestinian territories as part of biblical Israel. Facing a shrinking coalition after failing to form a government in May and three corruption charges on which Israel’s attorney general said he would indict Netanyahu pending a hearing, the prime minister needs hard right support to bolster his chances of political survival. But Gantz’s Blue and White’s ambiguous response will “at a minimum” be interpreted as “not opposing [Netanyahu’s] annexation plans” says IPF policy director Michael Koplow, even if it falls short of giving them explicit assent. Some 2.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, which Israel has controlled since it fought a war with its Arab neighbors in 1967. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis also populate West Bank settlements, which the overwhelming majority of the international community considers illegal. The Trump Administration is yet to comment publicly on Netanyahu’s hint that its peace plan would green light annexing the Jordan Valley, but precedent suggests it might.",Israel's Netanyahu Vowed to Annex a Large Part of the West Bank.

375,Angelina Jolie,"The technological sophistication of modern life masks a simple reality: we all need oxygen, water and food to survive. But the divide between those who have the resources they need to exist and those who don’t only continues to grow. And with the growing specter of climate change, people who live in vulnerable regions like Oceania—the countries and territories within the southwest Pacific Ocean—face the loss of their livelihoods, homes and future. Twenty-four million people globally are displaced within their countries each year on average because of climate- and disaster-related causes, and it’s only getting worse: the likelihood of any of us being displaced in this way is twice what it was in the 1970s. This comes on top of unprecedented levels of forced displacement worldwide because of conflict and persecution. If unchecked, climate change and environmental degradation have the potential to exacerbate global displacement beyond anything humanity has ever experienced, with low-income countries and fragile states set to bear the brunt of the impact. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a rise in sea levels by 1 m could cause Bangladesh to lose an estimated 17.5% of its land. A similar rise in sea level could put 3 million people in northern Nigeria at risk of displacement. How are we preparing for this? Better still, how are we working to prevent it? More than 40 million people live in Oceania. In 2018, the region—which spans Australia and the islands that make up Micronesia, Polynesia and Melanesia—had its third warmest year on record. Many of the islands that make up this region are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and sea levels, two of the many consequences of climate change. If these places are lost under the waters or become uninhabitable, humanity will lose so much: wildlife, natural resources, unique cultures, languages and values. But the people who live there will lose everything. From my experiences meeting refugees all around the world, whenever people are displaced, their first instinct is to seek a practical local solution inside their own country. Only when that is not sustainable do they usually cross a border. And even then, they tend to remain in their region. About 80% of all refugees—people who have fled conflict or persecution in their countries—are living in nations neighboring their nations of origin. Fewer than 1% of refugees are permanently resettled in foreign countries.

376,Jeffrey Kluger,"Humans were not around to see Antarctica in the good times, tens of millions of years ago, when it was home to palms and baobab trees, reptiles and marsupials. It had some of the same mountains it has today, some of the same valleys and inlets. But it didn’t have the same address. Long ago, Antarctica was located in the mid-­latitudes, once part of the super­continent Gondwana, until it slowly broke away, leaving continental kin like Africa and South America behind. It then went its own way, carried off by continental drift at just 1 to 2 in. per year, until it wound up where it is today, banished by tectonics to the bottom of the world. There, the 5.4 million sq. mi. ­continent—larger than Australia’s 2.9 million and Europe’s 3.9 million—gets its sunlight only laterally, never vertically, and will thus ever be sunk in a deep freeze, until the same crustal migration carries it to a kinder part of the planet. For now, Antarctica is buried under a layer of ice that averages 7,100 ft. deep—or 1.3 miles. That dense covering represents 90% of all the world’s ice and 70% of its fresh water, locked in a wasteland. Sign up for One.Five, TIME’s climate change newsletter Only it’s not a wasteland. Antarctica is home to penguins, seals, visiting whales, gulls, krill, albatross and more. Like all continents, it has its complex food web; like all continents it has its seasons and its landscapes and its peaks and valleys. They aren’t the seasons we might like; it’s not a landscape we could survive. But our species is not the sole measure of a continent’s worth. What’s more, all of that entrained ice is serving us well. In a world in which Antarctica were situated elsewhere, the ice would be water and the oceans would be deeper, inundating what are now our coasts. It wouldn’t have mattered to us if we’d been born into that world. If there had been no Florida in the first place, we never would have built a Miami. But there is, and we did. And now, thanks to our industrial enterprise and our fossil-fuel gluttony, we’re raising the temperature and melting the ice. The Arctic is already vanishing and the Antarctic is following, threatening us with the very inundation the polar ice spares us.

377,"By Ciara Nugent / Wallasea Island, U.K.","Avocets, terns and gulls swoop down onto Wallasea Island on England’s eastern coast, searching for food between blades of grass ruffled by the summer sea breeze. Aside from the wind, and the odd chirp or squawk, it’s quiet—the kind of peaceful scene that seems like it’s been going on for centuries. Yet five years ago, these wetlands didn’t exist. The mud the birds have landed on once lay under the streets of central London. In 2015, as part of a railway project, a construction crew scooped more than 3 million metric tons of dirt out from beneath the capital and piled it onto farmland on the coastline of the county of Essex, 50 miles east. In summer 2019, a crane hoisted old heavy machinery out of the water, removing the last vestiges of human interference. Wallasea is the largest restored coastal wetland in Europe, an exemplar of a growing movement to “rewild” land and return it to the way it was before humans began exploiting it millennia ago. It’s good for the birds. But it’s also increasingly understood as crucial for ensuring a world hospitable to people. As water sloshes in and out of Wallasea’s restored mudflats and salt marshes, carbon dioxide that could otherwise escape into the atmosphere and contribute to global warming gets buried. “Bits of decomposing leaves and seaweed come down rivers to the coast,” explains Rob Field, a senior conservation scientist at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which runs Wallasea. “When it gets to the [slow-flowing] salt marshes, the carbon falls out of suspension and gets stored there, in the thick, gloopy mud.” Ecologists say coastal wetlands like these are capable of trapping carbon up to 40 times faster per hectare than tropical rain forest. But over the past 400 years, farmland, coastal development and rising sea levels have combined to destroy 91% of wetland habitats on the Essex coast. Worldwide, 35% of global wetlands were destroyed from 1975 to 2015, according to the U.N. Scientists say it’s too late to prevent catastrophic climate change by only reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. As well as rapidly phasing out fossil fuels, the world also needs to deploy so-called negative-emissions technologies to draw down large amounts of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. Many believe that nature restoration is the cheapest and simplest way to do it. Other options, including machines that catch carbon as it is being emitted by power plants or suck carbon out of the atmosphere to store it underground, need research, money and time to mature before they can be used on a large scale. For that reason, most Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pathways for limiting warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels rely on forestry and better land management to make up the bulk of carbon drawdown over the next 30 years. To save the planet, we may need to give some of it back to nature. In Europe, home to some of the most densely populated land in the world, and where true wilderness has become almost nonexistent, the idea of bringing nature back while also fighting climate change has captured the imagination. Dozens of privately and publicly funded rewilding projects have popped up across the continent. Europeans are reviving coastal habitats like Wallasea in the U.K., reversing the drainage of peatland bogs in Germany and replanting forests in the Scottish Highlands. The projects not only sequester carbon but also boost biodiversity and help the land adapt to the changing climate by preventing floods and wildfires. Advocates of nature restoration say those benefits give rewilding an edge over simple tree planting, which has been popular with European governments for decades. From 2005 to 2015, Europe’s forest cover grew by the equivalent of 1,900 football fields every day, as the E.U. spent several billion euros to fund tree planting, often on farmland that had been abandoned because of changing agricultural practices in places like France and Italy. Some of that was reforestation, using native species to restore forests to what they were before, but much of it was so-called afforestation, the planting of many of one species of tree where there was none before, in regular lines. Many afforested trees are regularly cut down and used to produce timber, paper or biofuel. Rewilding advocates say afforestation, while offering similar carbon-sequestration capacity to reforestation, offers little benefit to wildlife and carries risks. Studies have found that the large-scale planting of nonnative trees in Canada and China have disturbed natural ecosystems, worsened wildfires and depleted groundwater levels. Meanwhile, other landscapes have been neglected. “I think politicians like planting trees because it’s a very clear, simple action,” says Timon Rutten, head of enterprise at Rewilding Europe, a Netherlands-based NGO that oversees nature-restoration schemes from Portugal to Bulgaria. “But peatlands, wetlands and grasslands are just as good or sometimes even better at storing carbon.”",The Best Way to Save Nature?

378,"Aryn Baker / Mbar Toubab, Senegal","The seedlings are ready. One hundred and fifty thousand shoots of drought-resistant acacia, hardy baobab and Moringa spill out of their black plastic casings. The ground has been prepared with scores of kilometer-long furrows leading to a horizon studded with skeletal thorn trees. It’s early August, and in less than a week, 399 volunteers from 27 countries will arrive in this remote corner of northern Senegal to participate in one of the world’s most audacious efforts to combat the effects of climate change: an $8 billion plan to reforest 247 million acres of degraded land across the width of Africa, stretching from Dakar to Djibouti. The Great Green Wall project, spearheaded by the African Union and funded by the World Bank, the European Union and the United Nations, was launched in 2007 to halt the expansion of the Sahara by planting a barrier of trees running 4,815 miles along its southern edge. Now, as concerns mount about the impact of climate change on the Sahel, the semiarid band of grassland south of the Sahara that is already one of the most impoverished regions on earth, the Great Green Wall is filling a new role. The goal now, say its designers, is to transform the lives of millions living on the front line of climate change by restoring agricultural land ruined by decades of overuse; when done, it should provide food, stem conflict and discourage migration. When the project is completed in 2030, the restored land is expected to absorb some 250 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the equivalent of keeping all of California’s cars parked for 3½ years. Over the course of a week, the volunteers descending upon the Senegalese village of Mbar Toubab will try to turn 494 acres of barren land into another forested brick in the Great Green Wall. There is only one problem: the annual rains have yet to arrive, and without them, none of the seedlings will take root. “The rain used to come in June. Here we are in August, and still there is no rain,” says El Hadj Goudiaby, who has spent the past nine years overseeing Great Green Wall projects in Mbar Toubab for Senegal’s forestry department. How is it possible, he asks, to grow trees to combat climate change if climate change is making it impossible to grow trees? The answer may have more to do with changing attitudes than changing the landscape. When people think of potential fixes for global warming, they tend to focus on big projects. But if human activity is at the root of climate change, whether it be the carbon emissions of the industrialized world or the overgrazing of the Sahel, then that is where the solution lies as well. Environmentalists celebrate the Great Green Wall for its epic territorial ambition, but its biggest impact will come from allowing people to meet their needs without destroying nature in the process. The Sahara isn’t expanding so much as the Sahel is shrinking, destroyed by decades of overgrazing, climate-change-induced drought and poor farming practices that have stripped the once lush grasslands of the fertile topsoil needed to regenerate. Cattle herders resort to the few remaining trees for animal fodder, denuding the landscape even further in a downward spiral of desertification. Planting trees not only reduces carbon on a global scale—research in the journal Science estimates planting more than 2 billion acres of trees could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that human activity has pumped into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution­—it also recharges the water table and creates micro­climates that increase local rainfall. (For more on rewilding and carbon reduction, click here.) But if pastoralists have nothing to feed their herds in the time it takes those trees to mature, they are likely to use the saplings, starting the cycle all over again. Which is why, though it may not sound like much, the solution to climate change in the Sahel starts with getting grass to grow. “If we can solve people’s problems by improving their living conditions now,” says Goudiaby, “they will be able to help themselves by protecting the trees that protect their future.” After all, stopping global warming isn’t about saving the planet; the earth will survive no matter how much the climate changes. It’s about saving humanity. One way to do that is by helping those who are most vulnerable to what chaos we have already created. Just 25 miles south of Mbar Toubab, near the village of Koyli Alpha, 50-year-old Dienaba Aka pulls her heavily laden donkey cart to the side of the road. She and her extended family have spent the day cutting grass in a “forage bank” managed by the national Great Green Wall agency. For the past eight months, the 1,700-acre field has been fenced off to let the grass, along with 250,000 saplings, grow undisturbed by the cattle, sheep and goats that roam free in this region. The field reopened in July, and now herders pay $1.70 a day to harvest the waist-high grass for their cattle until the rains bring new grazing opportunities. For Aka, the idea of a grass “bank” is a radical departure from an itinerant childhood spent following the family herd in search of forage. Now she can feed her cattle in the lean season without stripping trees. Aka, like women from many villages in the region, has been planting trees for the GGW project since 2012. She earns $96 during the six-week planting season. It’s good money, she says, but most women do it because they have been told it will bring back the rain, which in turn brings the grass that feeds their livestock.","Can a 4,815-Mile Wall of Trees Help Curb Climate Change in Africa?","September 12, 2019"
380,Vivienne Walt / Paris,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not floated any negotiable changes to the Brexit deal with E.U. officials in the two months since he came to power, according to French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he had heard only “a lot of noise without a lot of serious discussion.” In an interview in the Elysée Palace on Monday, Macron told TIME that the U.K. had not suggested “any clear or concrete proposals” to E.U. negotiators, and that the E.U.’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who is French, had told him last Friday that he had conducted “very few discussions with British negotiators” since Johnson became Prime Minister on July 24. “This deadlock is a British deadlock, it’s not a European deadlock,” the French President said, displaying clear irritation over the ongoing battles within the British parliament. “So if they propose something which is compliant with the E.U. requirements, our negotiator can move.” British lawmakers voted on Sept. 4 to make leaving the E.U. without a deal illegal, despite widespread speculation that a so-called “no deal” Brexit is Johnson’s preferred option. Johnson insists publicly that he would prefer to leave with a good deal than without one. However he has also said Britain will leave on Oct. 31 “do or die.” On Sept. 7 Amber Rudd, a member of Johnson’s cabinet, resigned, saying that she had seen no evidence that the U.K. government had offered new options to the E.U. to break the deadlock. “I no longer believe leaving with a deal is the Government’s main objective,” she wrote in her resignation letter. But the vote to make “no deal” illegal means that Johnson might be forced to request another delay to Brexit in order to continue negotiations, which E.U. leaders including Macron would have to agree to at the European Council summit on Oct. 17-18. On Sept. 8, Macron’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, suggested France might veto any extension to Brexit. Macron himself would not be drawn on that possibility but said Johnson could yet propose a workable deal to E.U. officials. “The important point is to have a U.K. that is fully engaged in the discussion with Europe,” he said. “Let us propose and let us see if it is acceptable.” Deal or no deal, Europe’s top officials increasingly talk as though Brexit is in the past, and they are simply waiting for the dust to settle in London in order to sign the exit document. “Our position is not for the E.U. to be moving along the lines of British domestic politics,” one of Macron’s top aides told TIME last week, who spoke on condition he was not named. “You become crazy, because you cannot know what will happen this afternoon in parliament,” he said. “The Brexit crisis is mainly a British domestic crisis.”",France's Macron Says U.K. Has Given E.U.

381,Julia Webster,"In February, Alberto Biancheri, the mayor of a small Italian coastal town near the French border, walked onstage carrying a statuette of a golden lion: the prize of the 2019 Sanremo Festival, awarded every year to the best new Italian song. TV cameras zoomed in on the winner’s shocked face, immediately sparking memes on social media. Mahmood, then 26, had pulled off a surprising upset and managed to conquer Italy’s most prestigious music competition with his song ‘Soldi’ (‘Money’). His victory quickly became a cultural turning point in Italy’s polarized climate around immigration, drawing scorn from Italy’s leading populist and far-right politicians, and catapulting Mahmood into the national spotlight.  Released on Feb. 6, after Mahmood’s first EP came out in late 2018, ‘Soldi’ was performed in public for the first time at Sanremo and instantly became a hit. ‘Soldi’ is not really about money. Written by Alessandro Mahmoud (stage name Mahmood), who was born in Milan to an Italian mother and Egyptian father, the song tells the story of Mahmood’s father’s absence during his childhood, after his parents separated when he was 5 years old. The lyrics describe a father who disappears and reappears as he pleases, smokes a hookah, drinks champagne during Ramadan and keeps asking: “come va?” (“how’s it going?”). “There’s quite a bit of anger in Soldi, it was a way to let off steam,” says Mahmood, speaking over the phone from Milan. It also includes a verse in Arabic: “waladi habibi ta’aleena” (my son, my love, come here), which recalls memories of his father calling him from the playground in a language he doesn’t speak himself.  Since its launch in 1951, the Sanremo Festival has become one of the country’s biggest televised events, with the winning song going on to represent Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest in May. That Soldi could win what is widely regarded as a traditional festival of Italian music, seemed to be a moment redefining “Italianess.” Mahmood agrees. “I’m very happy that people appreciated my style,” he says. “I think it was one of the more modern festivals in the past years, also thanks to other artists who brought a “new wave,” and breathed new life into Italian music.” Not everyone saw it that way. The country’s leading politicians were among the first to express their dissatisfaction on social media, saying Mahmood’s victory — which was decided in part by music industry personalities and journalists— represented the division between ordinary Italians and the liberal elite. Luigi di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and then Deputy Prime Minister complained in a Facebook post that it represented the wishes of a jury made up of “journalists and the radical chic” rather than those of the voters at home. “Sanremo has shown to millions of Italians the abysmal distance that exists between the people and the ‘elite,’” he said. “Maybe next year the winner could be chosen only with the tele-voting, given that it costs Italians 51 cents, let’s make it count.” Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party who was recently ousted from government as Interior Minister, tweeted: “#Mahmood….mah….The most beautiful Italian song?!? I would have chosen #Ultimo, what do you say??” He later told Italian daily La Repubblica: “Sanremo is the mirror of Italy. There’s the jury and then there’s ordinary people: they are two worlds far apart. And the winners are victims of the system.” So far, Mahmood has seemed unperturbed by the xenophobic rhetoric coming from politicians like Salvini, who implemented several anti-immigration policies while in office. “Of course, I don’t like the idea that my music may be used for a political cause,” he says. “But in the end, all this stuff about politics only lasted a while and Soldi has continued to travel a lot since Sanremo, and people are no longer talking about it in this way.” And ‘Soldi’ has traveled unusually far for an Italian song. It has been streamed over 100 million times on Spotify since February, topped the charts in Italy and reached platinum status in Spain, Switzerland and Greece. It also made it to second place at the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv in May, and in June it became the most listened to Italian song in Spotify’s history. A European tour of his debut album, Gioventù Bruciata (“Wasted Youth”), has been announced for October, and tickets are selling out fast. Extra shows have been announced in London, Paris and Berlin.",This Italian-Egyptian Singer Was Attacked By Populist Politicians. His Groundbreaking Success Is Silencing Critics,"September 11, 2019"
382,Leonid Ragozin,"Russian liberals are celebrating the relative success of the Communist Party and other Kremlin-friendly quasi-opposition parties in the elections to the Moscow city council on Sunday as an almost revolutionary breakthrough — but it takes some unpacking to explain why. Candidates from these parties gained around 20 out of 45 seats in the council; meanwhile the ruling United Russia party, which supports Russian President Vladimir Putin, only just retained a majority, losing about 13 seats in the city council (from the current 38 down to just 25). But the Communists & co would be fooling themselves if they credited this victory to themselves. The real winner is Smart Voting — an electoral strategy promoted by the indisputable leader of the Russian liberal opposition, Alexei Navalny. Smart Voting essentially asked voters in the Moscow election to back anyone who might be able to defeat a United Russia candidate. The strategy was based on the fact that United Russia candidates tend to win elections with just 30-35% of the votes, while the majority of votes are scattered among candidates.  Smart Voting helped draw away from pro-government parties toward the Communist Party and others who don’t make up the traditional liberal opposition. (Such parties are still largely aligned with the government.) But the Smart Voting strategy wouldn’t have been necessary, had the candidates nominated by Team Navalny and its liberal allies been allowed to run against Kremlin candidates. Earlier this summer, these opposition figures overcame seemingly insurmountable hurdles designed to prevent anyone unapproved by the Kremlin from participating in the election. But electoral commissions managed to find just enough highly dubious technical “errors” (as simple as avenue abbreviated to Ave.) in the lists of voter signatures collected in their support to disqualify them at the last stage of registration. At least some of these candidates would have easily crushed Kremlin nominees, according to polls.  The Kremlin’s stubborn refusal to let its opponents run even in a local election sparked a major wave of protests in the Russian capital, which continued almost every weekend throughout July and August and resulted in brutal clampdowns, mass arrests (over a thousand people in a single day, on two occasions) and surreal charges brought against some of the participants. One of them faced a prison sentence for throwing a paper cup at the police, though he was eventually released. But in the end, Smart Voting helped the activists win a small victory — by showing that Putin can be undermined. “We can say clearly that in Moscow this result is a triumph for Smart Voting,” Navalny reportedly said, as the results were released. To understand how we got here, it helps to look at the past. This summer’s events often felt like a remake of Bolotnaya Square protests of 2011 and 2012. Also sparked by a rigged election, that wave of unrest precipitated a dramatic political cycle which saw Putin embark on military expeditions in Ukraine and Syria, as well as meddle in the U.S. presidential elections in 2016. While the Soviet Union was — at least in theory — a dictatorship of the proletariat, Putin’s Russia is truly a spin doctor dictatorship. Having grown out of the weak democracy of the 1990s, this increasingly authoritarian regime is obsessed with propping up a genuinely high popularity rating of its leader, thus ensuring the regime’s perceived legitimacy. This is achieved by the means of the latest political technology imported from the West as well as incessant propaganda, which has infinitely more in common with Fox News infotainment than Soviet TV. For Putin to maintain his grip on power, ensuring the loyalty of business and security elites, his popularity ratings must be exceptionally high. Back in 2012, they were sliding. But the Maidan Revolution in Ukraine helped Putin to outsource his domestic conflict to a neighboring country by showing Russians what might happen to them if they chose to rebel. For the next six years, grotesquely exaggerated or outright fake horror stories from Ukraine formed the bulk of Russian television news, contrasting sharply with highly glossed over domestic stories. When Putin annexed Crimea on the grounds of protecting the peninsula’s Russian-speaking majority from Ukrainian nationalists (pictured as bloodthirsty neo-nazis by Russian TV), his ratings soared to a whopping 89%. The annexation demoralized and split the opposition, giving Putin a much needed breather.",Moscow's Elections Show Putin Is Losing the War at Home,"September 10, 2019"
383,Madeleine Carlisle,"The United States reportedly extracted a high-level CIA informant from Russia in 2017, CNN first reported Monday. Citing “multiple Trump administration officials with direct knowledge,” CNN reports the “previously undisclosed secret mission” to extract the Russian spy. A spokesperson for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to comment to CNN. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told CNN, “CNN’s reporting is not only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger.” The New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence officials first thought the informant might be in danger in late 2016 after the U.S. government revealed the severity of Russia’s election interference and the media began following up on details about the CIA’s Kremlin sources. The Times reports that the informant first declined the extraction, citing “family concerns,” but agreed months later after media inquiries increased. According to CNN, the Russian spy had been a crucial asset for the United States government, having access to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The spy had reportedly been providing information for more than a decade. The Times reported that the informant was crucial to the U.S.’s understanding of the scope of the Russian government’s interference in the 2016 election, and the extraction “effectively blinded” American intelligence officials to “the view from inside Russia as they sought clues about Kremlin interference in the 2018 midterm elections and next year’s presidential contest.” The information the informant provided during his time in Russia was so sensitive the Times reports, that even prior to the Trump Administration, CIA John O. Brennan sent President Obama the intelligence reports in separate sealed envelopes to the Oval Office.

384,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Hong Kong’s protestors want greater autonomy from mainland China, a grievance they’re expressing through a song some are calling their new “national anthem.” “Glory to Hong Kong” has spread like wildfire: on a quiet Monday night, hundreds of people spread out across four floors of a suburban shopping mall to sing it. The song has been watched on YouTube over a million times, and at least half a dozen English translations, and a Japanese iteration, have surfaced. The composer is Thomas, a full-time musician in his mid-twenties who asked to be identified only by his first name. He says he recruited performers, as well as people to help with the mixing and arrangement, on Hong Kong’s Reddit-like forum LIHKG, after sharing a demo version last month. “Music is a tool for unity,” he tells TIME. “I really felt like we needed a song to unite us and boost our morale.” While he wrote the first draft of the lyrics, LIHKG users contributed suggestions in a thread that was upvoted more than a thousand times. One of them was the incorporation of “Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our time,” which has become one of the most commonly chanted phrases at pro-democracy protests. “The message to listeners is that despite the unhappiness and uncertainty of our time, Hong Kong people will not surrender,” the composer says. He adds that he wrote the song as a protest march and that listeners are free to interpret it in any way they want to — including as a “national anthem,” as many have called it. While some protestors don’t agree with the label due to its implications with the controversial idea of separatism, all believe the song reflects the trials and tribulations of the now three months-long movement. “K,” a 23-year-old who responded to Thomas’ online call for volunteers, helped with the song’s mixing. “I think it’s an honor to join the production of a song so many people like,” he says.",Listen to the Song That Hong Kong's Youthful Protesters Are Calling Their 'National Anthem',"Updated: September 12, 2019 4:30 AM ET | Originally published: September 10, 2019"
385,Sanya Mansoor,"Dozens of Bahamians trying to evacuate from the hurricane-wrecked islands were told to get off a ferry headed towards Florida last weekend, and were told that was because they did not have U.S. visas. In response, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said on Monday afternoon at a White House press briefing that they would grant entry into the U.S. to anyone from the Bahamas on “humanitarian reasons.” “We will accept anyone on humanitarian reasons that needs to come here,” said Mark Morgan, Acting Commissioner of CBP on the subject of Bahamians seeking refuge from the islands hit by Hurricane Dorian. “We’re not (…) telling a cruise line that you cannot allow anyone without documents,” he added. “That’s just not being done. There’s just some confusion there.” Morgan said that, in Dorian’s aftermath, the agency has already processed people from the Bahamas who have travel documents and those who do not — but added that individuals still need to be vetted “to make sure we’re not letting dangerous people in.” Anyone deemed “inadmissible” would not be returned to the Bahamas but turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which would detain them appropriately, Morgan said. The Department of Homeland Security later issued additional guidance on visa requirements for Bahamians:  “Bahamians arriving to the United States by vessel must be in possession of a valid passport AND travel visa,” the department said. “The bottom line is that all travelers must possess government-issued identity documents, such as passports. All travelers who arrive directly to a U.S. Port of Entry by air or sea must possess a U.S. visitor’s visa.” Last week, U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott wrote an open letter to Trump asking the president’s administration to “waive, or otherwise suspend, certain visa requirements” for Bahamian citizens who have relatives in the U.S. as the country recovered from Hurricane Dorian. Rubio also noted that many lost — or lost access to — their identification and other relevant documents during the hurricane. DHS did not respond immediately to a request for clarification from TIME about how the new guidance will be implemented. Morgan had also tweeted on Sunday that evacuees from the Bahamas who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, as well as those with proper documentation to enter the U.S. are able to enter as usual. “No visa document requirements have changed,” Morgan said. Just over a week ago, Hurricane Dorian had slammed and stalled over the Bahamas, killing more than 40 people and rendering large swaths of land uninhabitable. The 185 mph winds and rapid flooding destroyed houses, drowned people and animals and left entire neighborhoods submerged in water.","After Dorian Survivors Are Kicked Off Rescue Ship, U.S. Border Patrol Says All Bahamians Welcome — Except Those Who Aren't","Updated: September 10, 2019 10:27 AM ET | Originally published: September 9, 2019"
386,Suyin Haynes,"When you visit a museum, chances are you think more about the items you’re there to see than about the museum itself — much less about the meaning of museums in general. But while art and antiquities are what draw millions of curious visitors to museums each year, that last matter has long preoccupied the people who work in them. Is a museum simply a building to house objects? Is it there to engage with the public? To take an active stance on political issues? All of the above? As the institution’s role evolves, a universal definition of museum has become the subject of heated argument. In fact, while the International Council of Museums (ICOM)’s Extraordinary General Assembly — a United Nations-style body for museums, in which 119 countries are represented — was supposed to vote on the matter over the weekend, the vote was postponed after “profound and healthy debate,” with little clarity as to when it might be rescheduled. “From my perspective — and that of a number of other committees — the Extraordinary General Assembly was a strange and un-transparent descent into chaos,” Danish curator Jette Sandahl, who chaired the committee proposing a new definition, told TIME after the postponement. At the heart of the matter is an attempt to outline exactly what a contribution to broader society could look like for museums today. The proposed new definition, which may be amended before another vote takes place, describes museums as “democratizing, inclusive and polyphonic spaces for critical dialogue about the pasts and the futures,” with a goal of contributing to “human dignity and social justice, global equality and planetary wellbeing.” That’s a departure from the current ICOM definition. Last updated in 2007, it states that a museum is a “non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society” with traditional functions such as acquiring, conserving, researching, communicating and exhibiting. (A similar definition was agreed upon by the U.K.-based Museums Association in 1998.) To some, the new wording represents a worthy mission statement: updating a years-old definition and acknowledging that museums have a role to play in civic society, no matter where they are. But other experts have condemned the new definition’s “political tone,” decrying it as an “ideological” manifesto and expressing concerns that it doesn’t address the traditional functions of a museum. The ICOM vote has brought new stakes — and attention — to a contentious debate that has raged within the industry for years, and has taken on higher stakes as institutions grapple with their role in countries facing increasing political and social change. European and U.S. museums have also found themselves held to greater accountability by historically marginalized and underrepresented communities, who now have the access to openly critique them on social media, and by those who call for greater acknowledgement of the history of colonialism in many museums’ collecting practices. “As museums become more and more conscious of the strong social role they play, there’s a need for a more explicit platform of values from which we work,” says Sandahl, who is the founding director of the Museum of World Cultures in Sweden and the Women’s Museum of Denmark. “Saying that museums can only fulfill traditional functions or play these new roles is what I feel we’ve outgrown in the 21st century.” Sandahl wants that “or” to be replaced with an “and.” She also firmly rebukes the criticism that the new definition has a “political” tone: “When you say that something is political or ideological, well, is it political to work with marginalized communities and women, as many museums are doing now, or is it political not to?” For the past two years, the U.S.-based #MuseumsAreNotNeutral online campaign has articulated similar sentiments, building on decades of activism work challenging the supposedly “neutral” status of institutions. “For me, it came from a lot of frustration in working in different places and being told the ideas I was proposing were too political,” says LaTanya Autry, a curatorial fellow at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Cleveland, who co-founded the campaign with Mike Murawski, director of learning and community partnerships at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. “It doesn’t make any sense when people say museums are neutral and can’t be political. If you know the history of these places, you know they’re a product and project of colonialism.”",Why a Plan to Redefine the Meaning of 'Museum' Is Stirring Up Controversy,"September 9, 2019"
387,TIME Staff,"Clashes took place in the heart of Hong Kong Sunday as thousands of protesters marched on the U.S. consulate, calling for Washington’s help in their struggle for greater political freedom. What began as as peaceful demonstration was cut short in the late afternoon as hardliners started fires and began erecting barricades on some of the city’s most prestigious streets, including Chater Road—location of the Court of Final Appeal, Cenotaph, and the ultra-exclusive Hong Kong Club. They also smashed entrances to Central subway station, which serves the financial district and is one of Hong Kong’s most important transport hubs. The station was quickly closed down as scuffles took place between protesters and police; the district’s glitzy boutiques also brought down their shutters. A kilometer away, chanting crowds filled Admiralty station, which is situated by the legislature, main government offices, and the Chinese military garrison. “We can’t let police think that what they do will scare us off,” said Lita, a 19-year-old university student, as her friends broke up the paving slabs outside the Hong Kong Club. “We’re doing this because the police beat and arrested our fellow protesters.” As night fell, police pursued protesters into the Causeway Bay retail district, firing tear gas as shoppers ran for cover. Earlier in the day, many protesters waved the Stars and Stripes and played “The Star Spangled Banner” on speakers as they walked up Garden Road to the American legation. Marchers called on the U.S. to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act—a measure that would require Washington to annually assess the enclave’s level of autonomy from Beijing and cancel its trading privileges if that autonomy is compromised. The idea is to incentivize Beijing to keep its hands off the former British colony, because scrapping Hong Kong’s privileges would economically hurt mainland China, which regards the city as a valuable entrepôt and capital market. “We hope Congress will pass the act.

As he’s traveled around the island in Dorian’s aftermath to get supplies and care for his family, he’s been forced to walk over the feces and debris-strewn ground barefoot. His feet are gashed and his toenails are falling off, he says, but the 34-year-old crab fishing business owner knows he’s been relatively lucky. “I’ve seen dead bodies. I’ve seen bodies of people crushed by debris, hanging out [of] windows. It’s not good,” Symonette tells TIME. “I’ve seen seven dead bodies under a [shipping] container… It looks to me like the 40-ft container flew up and crushed all of them at the same time. The storm was so intense that it picked those things up like paper and flew them around,” Symonette says. “You can’t imagine a 40-ft container coming down on you and pinning you down.” Symonette’s girlfriend, 23-year-old Dayna Hill, says her grandfather was killed by falling debris when he stepped outside during the storm. “He was trying to get out of the house when the house collapsed. First he got pinned in his truck, and once his son was able to get him out of the truck, he was struck by a heavy object that cracked his skull,” Symonette explains. Hill is four months pregnant and is desperate to get an ultrasound; she and Symonette are afraid that all the stress will harm their unborn child. Abaco, the chain of islands the couple calls home, is a community of about 17,000 people best known for its boat-building and tourism. But since the Category 5 storm smashed through the islands on Sunday, it seems like they are in the midst of an “apocalypse,” Symonette tells TIME.

Symonette says that the island has endured many hurricanes, but nothing like this in his lifetime. The Bahamian government has announced that 43 people have been confirmed dead, but Hill and Symonette agree with the Prime Minister’s warning that there could be more.

389,Olivia Konotey-Ahulu / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — It’s a nightmare scenario for a cocoa farmer: walking through your plantation you spot some red-veined leaves. Maybe it’s a big lump on one of the branches. You know immediately the tree is doomed, infected by the deadly swollen-shoot disease. Even worse, the plants around it are probably contaminated too, but you can’t be sure because the symptoms can take years to appear. Swollen shoot is unique to West Africa, where about three-quarters of the world’s cocoa is grown. The disease was identified nearly a century ago, yet scientists say a cure is years away and early detection methods are only just being introduced. This year, a devastating outbreak in the world’s No. 2 cocoa grower is renewing urgency to find a solution. Ghana has cut its crop forecast by 11% this season because of the disease, people familiar with the matter said previously. About 16% of the country’s cocoa crops are infected, according to George Ameyaw, a senior scientist at the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana. “Looking at the Ghana situation, it’s bad, very, very bad,” he said. “The situation is already devastating, there’s a need for a radical regeneration of all those areas.” Cocoa is a vital part of the economy in both Ghana and neighboring Ivory Coast, the biggest producer. The crop is grown in often remote and mostly poor areas by hundreds of thousands of small-scale farmers. Swollen shoot reduces yields on infected trees and eventually kills them. “I wish more people would understand the sort of magnitude of the lives impacted,” said Judith Brown, a virologist studying swollen shoot at the University of Arizona. “It’s affecting people who rely on it 100% for their income.” Francis Gyaben, who grows cocoa near Ghana’s southwest border with Ivory Coast, said about 60% of his 20-acre (8-hectare) farm has been ravaged by the swollen shoot virus. “I’ve been reduced to a young man starting life again, I’ve lost most of my source of livelihood to this virus invasion,” Gyaben, 60, said by phone. “I know some of the remaining trees have been affected by the disease and it’s only a matter of time that it becomes evident.’”",Cocoa Trees in West Africa Are Being Ravaged By a Disease With No Known Cure,"September 6, 2019"
390,Ian Bremmer,"Violent riots broke out in South Africa’s largest city and commercial capital, Johannesburg, with mobs targeting foreign-owned shops and stores. Many South African workers resent the influx of foreigners, particularly those coming from other parts of Africa, out of fear that they are taking jobs away from them. Matters were compounded by the spread of fake news and images claiming that Nigerians were targeted in the attacks, inciting mobs in Nigeria to attack South African-owned businesses in reprisal. While the death toll in South Africa has reached double-digits, it does not appear that any Nigerians were among the casualties. Violence has also flared in other African countries in response to the developments in South Africa. Boycotts have begun against South Africa by sports teams (Zambia withdrew from a friendly football match that was to have taken place against South Africa over the coming weekend) as well as musicians. Why It Matters: Violence against foreigners is not new to South Africa, but this week’s scenes were reminiscent of the countrywide xenophobic violence of 2008 that brought the honeymoon phase of a post-apartheid South Africa to an abrupt end. Similar attacks have taken place in recent weeks and months with working class African immigrants being the primary targets of the violence, prompting African governments in the region to condemn South Africa and its president, Cyril Ramaphosa, for their inability to stabilize the situation. For Ramaphosa the timing could not have been worse as the country hosts the annual World Economic Forum meeting on Africa this week in Cape Town. Visiting investors—whom Ramaphosa is desperately wooing in an attempt to revive the sluggish economy—will struggle to believe his pitch that his country has put the volatile years of his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, behind it. Delegations from Rwanda (which is vying to replace South Africa’s position as the preferred destination for Western investment on the continent), Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo withdrew their participation in the meeting. Nigeria, which is also rivaling South Africa for the position as the largest economy on the continent, is supporting the efforts of a Nigerian airline to evacuate Nigerian citizens out of South Africa for free. The violence is bad enough, and the political maneuvering makes matters worse. So is the fake news that is inflaming tempers across the continent. It is a combustible situation. What Happens Next: South Africa will continue to attract immigrants from across the continent to its shores, and to its cities in particular, given that its level of economic development is unrivaled in Africa and immigrants tend to thrive in the informal retail sector. But despite South Africa offering many people better economic opportunities than they tend to have in their home countries, the country’s overall economic malaise is set to continue; GDP growth continues to be outstripped by population growth rate, which translates into a real decline of GDP per capita. Unemployment is also the highest in a decade—far higher among the youth population—and is combined with inequality rates that are the highest in the world. Given that some politicians are willing to incite xenophobia for political gain (as has happened under the current mayor of Johannesburg) and that isolated incidents of crime by foreigners have the potential to fuel vigilantism by locals (and that’s before factoring the ability of technology to spread the violence across borders near-instantaneously), attacks like these are likely to increase.

391,Aaron Clark / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Hurricane Dorian has left oil seeping into the ground on the island of Grand Bahama after the storm blew the tops off five crude-storage tanks on the island. “According to the information we have right now, the roofs of five tanks are gone,” Norway’s Equinor ASA, which owns the storage facilities, said in a statement. “We do not know if they are been carried away by the winds or fallen into the tanks.” Equinor said Thursday that a flyover it conducted showed oil had seeped into the ground but not the sea. The tanks can hold 6.75 million barrels — almost 1 million tons. The terminal was shut on Saturday in preparation for the storm and will stay closed until further notice, the company said Friday. A video tweeted by Coral Vita, which works to protect coral reefs on the island, appeared to show that crude reached a nearby road and was outside a perimeter fence. The environmental impact from the spill is one of many brutal blows for Grand Bahama after the storm put large tracts of the Bahamian island under water and left thousands homeless. Equinor said Friday that it’s still too soon to estimate how long the response will take and that it doesn’t have information about oil reaching the sea. “The situation in the Bahamas is still challenging and infrastructure has sustained severe damage,” Equinor said. “All required resources are being mustered and our primary concern is to ensure the safety of our employees and the environment.

392,Evan Mawarire,"There can be no mixed feelings, misconceptions or complications about Robert Mugabe’s legacy. He presided over the destruction of millions of people’s lives over a span of 37 years. Some he murdered in cold blood, others it was a slow roast and for many it was a silent death as they lived in fear of upsetting the brutal ruler that was Robert Mugabe.  My dad called me a few days after I had started the #ThisFlag citizen’s movement in 2016 that challenged Robert Mugabe’s misrule. He was upset, scared and in a panic that I had never seen before. “Stop this craziness immediately!” he shouted. “You have no idea what you’re dealing with. Mugabe and his people will kill you and all of us for this.” I was scared too but I was driven by something else that completely overrode my fears – the urgent need for change. What had Mugabe done to cause my parents’ generation to be so scared that it was unthinkable to say a single bad thing about him, even in private? Mugabe demonstrated one thing very clearly throughout his leadership of Zimbabwe, and it was that he had no regard for anyone’s life except for his own and those of his children.  For political expediency he was not afraid to train a whole brigade of soldiers with one purpose — to subdue if not completely wipe out an entire tribe. The killings of Ndebele people in the south of our country in the early 1980s is not a phase that any good deeds done afterward could erase; nobody can claim ‘but he was a good man.’ Men women and children, many still unaccounted for, were murdered in cold blood and buried in shallow graves just because he felt insecure. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Mugabe’s desire to be the supreme, unchallenged and lifetime leader of Zimbabwe birthed political violence, forced disappearances, tortures, rigged elections, corruption and an economy that collapsed multiple times in one generation, leaving millions desperately poor. Sitting in Chikurubi Maximum Security prison in February 2017, the first of many times I was arrested, I couldn’t imagine how this man whom I had loved as a small child had become such a monster. The fact is he hadn’t “become” a monster overnight — he had always been. I just hadn’t experienced it yet. Since July 2016 he had hunted me down and threatened me with expulsion from the country or imprisonment if I persisted with my campaign. He went as far as calling me a foreigner in my own motherland in his desperate attempt to demonize me for speaking out against misrule and corruption. Central intelligence operatives had visited my home, my office, and my church and issued threats to my family and colleagues and even beating up some of them. I’ll never forget that the CIO showed up at my kid’s school wanting to “see” them. I’ll never forget that in the middle of the night while I was in prison, my pregnant wife was besieged by his men who threatened to rape her. His administration charged me with treason for simply demanding a better nation. Arrest after arrest and interrogation upon interrogation, I came face to face with the reality that Robert Mugabe was not the admirable pan-African liberator that many had made him out to be. I speak of experiences that I thankfully survived but what can be said of those who are either no longer alive or those still too scared to speak of the worst fear of their lives. Whatever good things Mugabe did pale enormously in comparison to his brutality against his own people and the future he robbed us of. The phone call with my dad was a defining moment in how I felt about Robert Mugabe’s legacy. After dad had warned me of the danger of what I was doing I responded, “Dad, I hear you but this man has taken away the dreams of three generations: My grandfather’s, yours and mine. I will not stand by as he takes my children’s dreams too.”  My culture tells us that when a person dies, he must be remembered by his good deeds and that we must not expose the bad things he did as a sign of respect. While I have forgiven Robert Mugabe for what he did to me personally, I find it hard to be silent about how I experienced him. I find it hard to be silent after his death, especially because the hallmark of his leadership is that we had to be silent while he lived. My respect is instead for those who died and were brutalized at his command. But while he transitions from this land, he is leaving scars of his ruthless rule.

393,Lily Rothman,"It’s not hard to see why Robert Mugabe, whose death was announced Friday, would have wanted control. In 1965, the area in Africa then known as Rhodesia — the colonialist name for the region that’s now Zimbabwe — had established a new regime in the wake of British colonial rule. When the country’s white-supremacist leaders declared its independence late that year, TIME noted that it was “the first nation in history to launch itself into a world all but unanimous in its hostility.” The U.N. also called it an “illegal racist minority regime.” By the time a decade had passed, it was clear to all — except maybe some white Rhodesians who were in denial — that the regime would not last much longer in the face of guerrilla resistance at home and disapproval around the globe. In a desperate attempt to stall the coming change, black activists were routinely jailed. Robert Mugabe, a one-time schoolteacher who had become a radical guerrilla, was one of them. When Prime Minister Ian Smith finally conceded that he would allow the nation’s black majority to assume control of their own country, Mugabe was an obvious contender for leadership. But there was conflict over how exactly the transition would take place: “For years black nationalists have been divided between relative moderates, such as Bishop Abel Muzorewa and the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, and the more extreme forces, which now call themselves the Patriotic Front, headed by Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe,” TIME noted in 1977. “The moderates, while willing to accept a gradual transfer of power, have also been insisting that black Rhodesians be allowed to choose their leaders in free elections. But the Patriotic Front wants first to take power and then hold elections.” Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter In 1978, the moderates won. Mugabe and his fellow Patriotic Front leader, Joshua Nkomo, swore they would not accept gradual change. They would keep fighting. Violence rippled throughout the area for about a year more before a compromise was reached. The country would host elections. In early 1980, after a bloody campaign and election, Mugabe, then 56, emerged victorious. TIME reported: “We are beginning a completely new chapter with the hope that there will not be any victimization of anybody for political reasons,” Mugabe told the magazine in an interview that week.

394,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"Hong Kong is bracing for its latest weekend of unrest, despite the government announcing Wednesday that it will officially withdraw the extradition bill that kicked off the summer of dissent. “Five Demands, Not One Less!” has become the protester’s new rallying cry, indicating they will not give up on the further actions they want the government to take. Pro-democracy activists and politicians say the concession on the extradition bill was too little, too late.  In addition to formally scrapping the legislation, the demand list includes establishing an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality and allowing direct elections for the city’s leaders.  For three months, protests have roiled semiautonomous Hong Kong, at times paralyzing the Chinese entrepôt and turning the streets into a battleground between demonstrators and police. The 14th consecutive weekend of protests kicked off Friday afternoon with a call to gather at the Prince Edward subway station—the scene of violent clashes last weekend. Video footage from last Saturday showed police storming into train carriages and indiscriminately beating passengers, some whom were cowering on the ground crying. By late afternoon Friday, dozens of people had already turned up at the Prince Edward station, aiming to pressure subway authorities into releasing surveillance footage from the incident. The station announced it had called the police to clear the area. On Saturday, protesters plan to once again block transportation links to the city’s international airport. In mid-August, rallies inside the terminals shut down the busy regional hub, forcing hundreds of flights to be cancelled or delayed. Ahead of the planned disruptions, the city’s Airport Authority placed ads in several local newspapers pleading with protesters not to block travelers from getting to the airport. “Spare our passengers further disruption,” the ad says. “We again strongly urge protesters not to disrupt the journey of tens of thousands of travellers who use our airport every day.”",Hong Kong Braces for Another Weekend of Protests Despite Extradition Bill Withdrawal,"Updated: September 6, 2019 6:32 AM ET"
395,Amy Gunia,"Retail giant H&M announced Thursday that it will suspend leather purchases from Brazil over concerns that the material is linked to fires that have devastated the Amazon this year. H&M said that it is issuing a temporary freeze on orders until it is confident that the material is not causing “environmental harm,” according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). “Due to the severe fires in the Brazilian part of the Amazon rainforest, and the connections to cattle production, we have decided to place a temporary ban on leather from Brazil,” the Swedish fashion firm said in a statement to AFP. Another major company, VF Corporation, which owns brands Timberland, Vans and The North Face, announced late last month that it would stop buying Brazilian leather due to concerns about destruction of the Amazon, according to AFP. A record number of forest fires have burned in the Amazon this year, according to Brazil’s Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, a space research center, which tracks fires through satellite data. In late August, the agency said that it had detected more than 74,000 fires in the Brazil, an 83% increase in fires from the same time in 2018. There are signs that the recent fires in the Amazon were at least, in part, started deliberately. According to a publication from the southern part of the Amazonian state Pará, farmers and ranchers in the region organized coordinated action on Aug. 10 to set fires to clear land for pastures, and in doing so, demonstrate their desire for work.

396,Charlie Campbell / Shanghai,"The escalating U.S.-China trade war is unwinnable by either side, according to new research shown exclusively to TIME. On Sept. 1, the Trump Administration slapped 15% levies on an additional $125 billion of Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to retaliate with 5-10% tariffs on 1,717 American products, including soybeans, crude oil and car parts. The average U.S. tax on Chinese imports now stands at 21.2%, up from just 3.1% when President Donald Trump took office. The bruising trade tussle has roiled bourses and upset supply chains for over a year, hastening fears of a global recession. Nevertheless, there is no sign of a resolution in sight, with Trump tweeting on Aug. 23, “We don’t need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them.” Economists at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) and Open University of Hong Kong disagree. A new number-crunching analysis says only China has the manufacturing capacity to satisfy the U.S.’s huge appetite for products, meaning American consumers must continue to buy from China or U.S. retailers will suffer. Conversely, American demand far outstrips the rest of the world combined, meaning China cannot replace its American customers with those elsewhere for the foreseeable future—or at all. “Replacing the [U.S.-China trade] relationship with any other country is impossible in the short to medium term and possibly in the long term also,” says Professor Bala Ramasamy, associate dean at CEIBS. “It is the relationship between a very large and insatiable market and a very well-oiled production machine.” Take cellphones, for example, which alone accounted for 13% of total imports from China to the U.S. last year, worth some $70 billion. If all the cellphones the U.S. exports—some $10 billion’s worth—were kept for domestic consumption and combined with all those produced by second-place exporter Vietnam—around $30 billion’s worth—it still wouldn’t be enough to satisfy the U.S. market. By the same token, Beijing would require the Netherlands, the U.K., Germany, India, Sweden and France to source all their cellphones from China just to replace the value of American imports. It’s a picture repeated for a myriad of other consumer products.",Exclusive: New Study Says U.S. Can't Win the Trade War and Neither Can China,"September 6, 2019"
397,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"“I was using magic last night when someone messaged to ask if I needed to be picked up from school.” No, that’s not a line from Harry Potter. It’s the kind of thing a Hong Kong protestor might say after a clash with police. Hong Kong’s protestors have their own argot. Cantonese, Hong Kong’s lingua franca, is complicated enough with its nine tones. But even a native speaker might not understand a conversation between protestors, who have created between them a unique vocabulary. Although many would accuse them of making light of violent unrest, the use of slang “keeps people sane,” argues Wee Lian Hee, a language professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. “If [protestors] talk formally all the time, I suspect the movement would soon become tiresome,” he tells TIME. The recent withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill, initially the trigger of the demonstrations, has done little to pacify public anger. Protestors continue to take to the streets, communicating in a jargon that reveals much about how they see each other, the authorities, and their actions. Protestors refer to each other as “hands and feet.” The term conveys the idea of unity: when the hands and feet of a protestor are injured, other protestors feel his or her pain. “I dreamed that I threw a petrol bomb last night,” a protestor might say — except he wasn’t actually dreaming. Many use the word to avoid directly stating that they were involved in unlawful activity. Similar to “dreaming,” the term “shopping” (literally to stroll around, or walk the streets) is used euphemistically to mean one was out at a protest. With clashes between police and protestors often occurring in busy retail districts that are home to glitzy malls, the “shopping” metaphor is oddly apt. Ever since it started shuttering train stations closest to protest sites, the city’s subway operator has been accused by protestors of siding with the police, who in turn are seen as an arm of the Beijing-backed government. Protesters have responded by vandalizing stations, destroying equipment such as ticket machines, and referring to the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) with this derogatory term, which rhymes with the actual name of the MTR in Cantonese.",Hong Kong's Protestors Have Their Own Special Slang.

398,Aryn Baker,"Robert Mugabe, the former freedom fighter-turned-wily and ruthless autocrat who ruled the southern African nation of Zimbabwe for 37 years before he was forced out in 2017 following a military takeover, died Friday. He was 95 years old. “It is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe’s founding father and former President, Cde Robert Mugabe,” President Emmerson Mnangagwa said in announcing the death on Twitter. “Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace.” Mugabe came to power in the wake of Zimbabwe’s battle for independence from Britain in 1980, promising prosperity and democracy only to undermine both in his single-minded pursuit of political dominance. Though initially celebrated as a liberator, the Savile Row-suited (at least until international sanctions put a stop to his frequent U.K. visits) dictator’s most enduring legacy is a once-promising nation crippled by corruption and mismanagement. Mugabe was the only leader Zimbabwe had known until Vice President Mnangagwa succeeded him in elections in 2018. A year later, the country still staggers under massive debts, a worthless currency and an impoverished population, all directly related to Mugabe’s time in power. Residents of the capital, Harare, only have access to running water once a week, and many rural communities have no electricity at all. The education system, once the best in southern Africa, has collapsed.  Mugabe’s death follows an extended stay in a Singaporean hospital, where he was being treated for an undisclosed condition that, over the last few years of his life, required annual trips abroad for health care. His treatment abroad earned him criticism at home as Zimbabwe’s public health system crumbled for lack of government investment.  The confirmation of Mugabe’s passing puts an end to persistent speculation. Rumors of his death were so frequent in Zimbabwe that he once bragged about besting Jesus: “I have died many times—that’s where I have beaten Christ. Christ died once and resurrected once,” he said on his 88th birthday. In September 2016, just after another such rumor sent Twitter into a tailspin, he told reporters, with his signature Cheshire-cat grin, “It is true that I was dead. And I resurrected. As I always do.” Nonetheless, Mugabe’s final days in power were marked by a visible decline: At the opening of Parliament in September 2015, he launched into the same State of the Nation speech he had delivered just a few weeks prior. Assembled parliamentarians either didn’t notice, or didn’t dare comment, until he was finished.  Catching the nonagenarian’s frequent stumbles and gaffes became something of a two-edged sword for Zimbabwe’s beleaguered media—lapped up by citizens desperate for signs of the end of his reign, but cause for government retaliation as well. When Mugabe tripped and fell on the red carpet at the Harare airport upon his return from a meeting at the African Union, local papers covered the incident, but heralded it as a sign of his continued good health: “President Mugabe showed that he is mentally agile by having the reflexes to break that fall and that he is physically fit by walking away unscathed,” was the pro-government Sunday Mail’s take. “The incident proved why Zimbabweans vote for him consistently: he is as mentally alert and physically capable as he has ever been.” It was that deft wielding of rewards, and punishment, for supporters and detractors alike that put Mugabe in power and kept him there for so long, says Zimbabwean-born Charles Laurie, director and head of politics at the London-based Verisk Maplecrof risk analysis firm. Mugabe was a “master politician, and something of a tragic figure, never having been able to escape his own ambitions,” says Laurie. “If Mugabe had left office in a peaceable and timely manner, he would be regarded as one of the icons of the African political scene.” Instead, he used his skills to manipulate elections and extend his terms long beyond those mandated by Zimbabwe’s constitution, according to Laurie. “The essence of his rule is the single-minded purpose of him remaining in power, and the willingness to use all means to achieve that goal.”","Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwean Revolutionary Who Later Ruled With an Iron Fist, Dies at 95","September 6, 2019"
399,Tara Law,"Bahamians are scrambling to respond to a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane that the nation’s Prime Minister has described as a “historic tragedy” since the slow-moving storm made landfall Sunday. Hurricane Dorian has claimed at least 43 lives and destroyed many buildings, especially on the islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco. Governments and nonprofits are offering money, workers and other aid to help with the rescue and recovery effort. According to the Red Cross, about 45% of the homes on Grand Bahama and Abaco — about 13,000 houses — are believed to be severely damaged or destroyed as a result of the storm, and some 62,000 people will need clean drinking water, the Associated Press reports. U.N. officials said that more than 60,000 people will need food assistance. At the same time, Bahamians have carried out their own efforts to account for loved ones, posting frantic photos and notes on Facebook and WhatsApp begging for word about missing friends and family members. Here’s what to know about the devastation the Bahamas is facing now that Dorian has roared through. The death toll has steadily risen as officials have gained access to areas cut off by the storm. Forty-three people have been confirmed dead, but Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis has warned that more people are likely dead. “So many families have been impacted by the devastation, including those trapped during the storm,” Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said Wednesday at a press conference. “Just about every Bahamian throughout the country has been worried about loved ones on Grand Bahama and Abaco.” Much of the severe damage appears to be concentrated on the Abaco islands, a chain of islands in the northern Bahamas known as a boating destination. The Prime Minister said Tuesday that parts of Abaco are 60% destroyed. Local communities within the Abaco islands have reported significant damage. A community known as The Mudd, which was built over time by Haitian immigrants, was “razed” by the storm, according to the AP.

400,Julia Webster,"Boris Johnson‘s younger brother, Jo Johnson, has resigned from his roles as Member of Parliament and cabinet minister, saying he has been “torn between family loyalty and the national interest.” His announcement appeared on Twitter on Thursday morning. He said there was an “unresolvable tension” and that it was time to hand over his roles. It came after his brother, the U.K. prime minister, faced a double defeat in Parliament on Wednesday, after 21 members of Johnson’s own party joined opposition lawmakers to pass a bill to prevent a “no-deal” Brexit on Oct. 31, and later turned down Boris Johnson’s request for a new election. The Conservatives Party “rebels” who voted against the government included senior members such as former cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, Kenneth Clarke, Oliver Letwin and David Gauke––along with Winston Churchill’s grandson Nicholas Soames. They were expelled from the party as a result. This decision appears to have crossed a line for Jo Johnson. In response to his tweet, Gauke said: “Lots of MPs have had to wrestle with conflicting loyalties in recent weeks. None more so than Jo.”   Jo Johnson voted to remain in the E.U. in the 2016 Brexit referendum––even as his brother helped lead the campaign to leave.

401,Ian Bremmer,"Hong Kong’s protests continue. The unrest began in response to a proposed law that would allow Hong Kong to extradite its citizens to face prosecution in mainland China’s court system, a plan that stoked fears China could use the law to seize political dissidents and journalists deemed insufficiently compliant to Beijing. But when Hong Kong’s police launched a heavy-handed response to the demonstrations, the list of protester demands expanded to include police accountability and new protections for the territory’s democracy. On Sept. 4, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s beleaguered chief administrator, finally withdrew the bill. For many it will be “too little and too late now,” in the words of Joshua Wong, a key figure in the protest movement. Millions have now taken to the streets over the past 14 weeks, and a few demonstrators have resorted to violence. Some protesters are setting fires. Others have thrown bricks and even fire bombs. Police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and warning shots of live ammunition. Thousands of university and high school students boycotted classes to join the protests. Some organizers have called on Taiwan to grant asylum for activists. Beijing has so far taken a cautious approach. State media has issued increasingly dire threats, and Chinese soldiers have made a show of strength. But President Xi Jinping has avoided a military crackdown. That leaves Lam to try to calm things down. For more than three months, she has failed utterly, and leaked audio emerged recently in which she told business leaders during a closed-door meeting that she would resign if she could. If Beijing’s direct role in all this weren’t already clear, she’s also heard on tape explaining that she “unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution, that is the central people’s government and the people of Hong Kong.” Withdrawing the extradition bill is a victory, but not enough of one to end the protests. But things will get more difficult for the protesters from here. The protest movement does not have unified leadership. Those who want demonstrations to remain peaceful have little sway with rioters. As with the gilets jaunes movement in France, poorly coordinated demands extend from the controversial to the impossible, making it hard for the movement to maintain public support indefinitely. President Xi can take his time, confident in the knowledge that people will have to return to work to make a living, and students will eventually go back to class. The economic damage to Hong Kong is already considerable. There is also little useful international support for the demonstrations. European leaders can do no more than issue statements on the subject, and Donald Trump has tried to keep open hopes for trade negotiations with China by protecting his relationship with Xi. Trump has publicly expressed sympathy for Xi and his Hong Kong predicament, and he’s made clear he has no intention of siding with protesters. That’s part of why Xi believes he can outlast the protesters, as China did following the Umbrella Movement five years ago. Some will be tempted to fault Trump for refusing to side with those who demand democracy, but it is Xi who has fueled these protests, by his refusal to allow Lam to resign and his uncompromising approach. Many in Hong Kong believe that Beijing means to fundamentally undermine their government. It’s clear that Xi won’t try to persuade them otherwise. Contact us at editors@time.com.

402,Charlie Campbell/Beijing,"To manufacture flat-rolled steel, you need to start with a steel slab. For a company called NLMK USA, which makes carbon flat-rolled steel in Farrell, Pa., there’s nowhere to get those slabs domestically. That’s meant it has to source them from abroad and pay a 25% import tariff, even as prices have climbed as companies scramble to find new supplies. As its costs rise, NLMK USA is taking fewer orders and running fewer shifts. “It’s made it very difficult for us to compete,” says Bob Miller, president and CEO of NLMK USA. The Trump tariffs that have already led to cutbacks across the U.S. were joined on Sept. 1 by a new round of 15% levies on more than $125 billion in imports, from wireless headphones to lawn mowers. This brings the average tax on Chinese imports up to 21.2% from just 3.1% when Donald Trump entered the White House, per the Peterson Institute for International Economics. American businesses like NLMK USA are being drafted into the trade war whether they like it or not. “[This hike] is going to have a bigger negative effect on the U.S. economy than any of Trump’s previous increases,” says James H. Nolt, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute. “This is hitting the United States where it’s particularly vulnerable right now.” In retaliation, Beijing on Sept. 1 began imposing additional tariffs on 1,717 U.S. exports, such as soybeans and car parts. While European exporters say they’re being offered incentives to set up in a newly expanded free trade zone in Shanghai, their American competitors are complaining of increased red tape. Beijing’s 5% levy on American crude oil marks the first time the fuel has been in the crosshairs since the world’s two biggest economies began their tussle over trade more than a year ago. The Chinese economy is also feeling the pinch. Growth in its manufacturing sector slowed in August for the fourth month in a row, and Trump has also threatened to use emergency presidential powers to force American companies out of China. On Sept. 2, China’s Commerce Ministry complained to the World Trade Organization that the new tariffs “severely violated” a truce that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to at the G-20 summit in Osaka in June. “It’s costly for China and the whole global economy,” says Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego, School of Global Policy and Strategy. “It’s really slowing down human progress in so many ways.” Far from nearing an amiable conclusion, the trade war has now reached the stage where “each side [is] defending itself and figuring out how to impose costs on the other,” says Paul Haenle, a former White House adviser under the Obama and Bush Administrations and current chair of the Beijing-based Carnegie-Tsinghua Center. The question is how much both the U.S. and China can lose and still declare victory. Trade’s function as a political cudgel has lately seen a renaissance, as evidenced by its use in situations like Japan and South Korea’s escalating dispute over reparations for historic abuses during Japanese colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. But even as the tactic grows in popularity, its usefulness remains in question–especially given the increased risk of trade wars’ fueling diplomatic or even military confrontations. Trump’s hard line with China is popular with his base, and even some Chinese business leaders quietly praise the U.S. President for pushing Beijing to enact what they consider to be much needed reforms to the state-oriented economy. But there is little sign China plans to enact the sweeping systemic changes to its policies on intellectual property, forced technology transfers, market access and industrial subsidies that would appease the Trump Administration. Beijing has consistently denied Washington’s accusations that it engages in unfair trade practices, and portrays the U.S. as the aggressor. In uncharacteristically spiky rhetoric, state news wire Xinhua accused the U.S. of “acting as a ‘school bully'” in a Sept. 1 op-ed. It’s also unclear what exactly Trump hopes to achieve. He wants China to cut assistance for state-run companies, for example. But it’s unlikely that doing so would address the $419 billion U.S. trade deficit with China, which the President claims costs American jobs. Around 80% of China’s exports come from the purely private sector, and almost half from multinationals like Walmart that simply manufacture in China, according to Nolt.","As the U.S.-China Trade War Escalates, Pocketbooks Feel the Pain","Updated: September 8, 2019 10:08 AM ET | Originally published: September 5, 2019"
403,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong’s embattled top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has stuck to her approach to ending Hong Kong’s political crisis, despite the poor reception shown to her announcement yesterday that she was formally withdrawing a divisive extradition bill. Appearing stiff and formal at a press conference Thursday morning, Lam largely repeated the plan outlined a day before, when she said that aside from withdrawing the bill she would support the work of the territory’s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) in looking into allegations of police brutality, as well as “start a direct dialogue” with “people from all walks of life,” inviting “community leaders, professionals and academics to advise the government” on policy. “After more than two months of social unrest,” she said, “it is obvious to many of us that discontent in society extends far beyond the bill—to housing and land supply, income distribution, social justice and mobility, and opportunities for the young, and how the public can be fully engaged in the government’s decision making.” But her initiatives fall far short of the key demands of Hong Kong’s democracy movement, which include universal suffrage, exoneration for the 1,140 protesters arrested so far during the unrest, and a Commission of Inquiry into how the police have handled the protests, instead of referring the matter to the IPCC, which protesters say is dominated by pro-establishment figures. The IPCC also lacks the legal power to summon witnesses. Speaking to TIME after Lam’s press conference, prominent campaigner Joshua Wong said “The cause of Hong Kong people to get free elections will never stop” and added that the Hong Kong government would “never” be “the decision maker” when it came to initiating dialogue. Willy Lam (no relation), adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Center for China Studies, told TIME that “The possibility of a dialogue happening is very low indeed. Most of the protesters, particularly the radical fringe, consist of university and high school students and this group has made it known they have no interest in speaking to Carrie Lam.”  He added: “If she had made the announcement [of the bill’s withdrawal] say two months ago, it would have helped to appease the public, but now the goalposts have moved, and the public is demanding some concrete, democratic development.”  Conservative politician Michael Tien said that the bill’s withdrawal “may not be able to put the unrest away, to a level under control.” He told TIME: “I think they need to think about the issue of the Commission of Inquiry. In the last two months, things have taken a turn. The priority of the Commission of Inquiry is higher.”","Hong Kong's Leader Sticks to Her Plan to End the Unrest, Despite Its Poor Reception","Updated: September 5, 2019 5:37 AM ET"
404,Billy Perrigo,"U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was dealt two harsh rebukes in a showdown with Parliament this week over his plans to take a hard line in Brexit negotiations with the E.U. First, a “rebel alliance” of opposition lawmakers and members of Johnson’s own Conservative Party voted Tuesday and Wednesday to make a “no deal” Brexit illegal. (Johnson has repeatedly said the U.K. will Brexit by the Oct. 31 deadline, no matter what.) Johnson had pinned his short tenure so far on using the threat of crashing out of the E.U. without a deal––and the chaos and economic pain that’s likely to cause––to get the bloc to agree to more favorable terms. When lawmakers––including respected former members of Conservative governments and Winston Churchill’s grandson––voted to take that option off the table, Johnson said the only option left was a general election. Then, they denied him that, too. Late Wednesday, his bill to hold an early election on Oct. 15 failed to win over the two-thirds of lawmakers required, thanks to a 2011 law requiring a supermajority. Opposition lawmakers have said they will withhold their support until Johnson revealed his plan for an alternative Brexit deal––and until it was certain a “no deal” Brexit would not happen during or directly after the campaign. Johnson had been pinning his hopes on public fatigue with Brexit. He bet it would help him unite the “leave” side of the British public and benefit from a split in the opposition “remain” camp––and ride what remains of his political honeymoon to victory on a “people versus Parliament” election. “He’s basically appealing to one half of the electorate, i.e. those who voted leave and nearly all of whom would still vote to leave,” says Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, one of the U.K.’s most respected polling experts. “Of course, that section of the public is rather unhappy about the fact that it’s all taking so long.” Curtice says that Johnson is hoping that by driving a hard line on Brexit, Johnson can win back defectors to the Brexit Party, uniting the “leave” vote, while benefiting from a split in the “remain” vote among the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, a smaller opposition party that has seen a recent revival in fortunes.",Why Boris Johnson Lost His Bid for a New Election Before Brexit,"September 4, 2019"

The “agreement in principle” that U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has hammered out in nine rounds of talks with Taliban representatives in Qatar would take the first tentative steps toward peace since U.S. and allied forces deployed to Afghanistan following the attacks on 9/11, according to senior Afghan and Trump Administration officials familiar with its general terms. Defense Secretary Mark Esper was scheduled to discuss the closely held details of the deal with President Donald Trump in a Sept. 3 meeting, according to senior administration officials. If Trump approves and a deal is struck, it could begin a withdrawal of some 5,400 U.S. troops, roughly a third of the present force, from five bases within 135 days. But the deal doesn’t ensure several crucial things, those familiar with the discussions tell TIME. It doesn’t guarantee the continued presence of U.S. counterterrorism forces to battle al Qaeda, the survival of the pro-U.S. government in Kabul, or even an end to the fighting in Afghanistan. “No one speaks with certainty. None,” said an Afghan official taking part in briefings on the deal with Khalilzad. “It is all based on hope. There is no trust. There is no history of trust. There is no evidence of honesty and sincerity from the Taliban,” and intercepted communications “show that they think they have fooled the U.S. while the U.S. believes that should the Taliban cheat, they will pay a hefty price.” That may explain why Pompeo declined to put his name on the deal. The Taliban asked for Pompeo to sign an agreement with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the official name of the government founded by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 1996, four U.S., Afghan and European officials familiar with the discussions tell TIME. Having the Secretary of State sign such a document would amount to de facto recognition of the Taliban as a legitimate political entity, and he declined to do so, the Afghan officials say. Pompeo’s office declined to comment before publication of this story. After it was published, Pompeo said through a spokesperson that he might sign if Trump and all parties struck a deal. “There is no agreement to sign yet. If and when there is an agreement that is approved by all parties, including President Trump and if the Secretary is the appropriate signatory, he will sign it,” State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus emailed TIME Wednesday evening. There are two alternatives. Khalilzad himself may sign it. Or the U.S. and the Taliban may simply issue a joint statement, supported in turn by the U.S.-backed government in Kabul and a number of other countries, including Japan, Russia and China, two Afghan sources familiar with the deliberations tell TIME. That diplomatic sleight of hand might solve the signature problem, but it won’t do much to address the core challenges facing those who want to give peace in Afghanistan a chance after four decades of war. As it stands, the agreement would set the stage for the withdrawal of most American forces by the end of November 2020 if the Taliban do three things: open negotiations with the U.S.-backed Afghan government; reduce violence near areas U.S. forces control; and keep foreign militants out of the areas they control, according to current and former U.S., Afghan and European officials, who all spoke anonymously to describe the sensitive and fractious deliberations. U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats who have served in Afghanistan worry that once a withdrawal is underway, it will be irreversible, given Trump’s promise to end the U.S. involvement in the war there, the fast-approaching 2020 U.S. elections and the absence of public support for the war. The price of peace, they fear, might include reversing much of the hard-won progress towards building a stable country over nearly two decades of war. These officials fear a roll back of civil, human and women’s rights in Afghanistan; a weakening of the national, regional and local governments; the deterioration of anti-Taliban military and law enforcement forces; and a rise in corruption.",Exclusive: Secretary of State Pompeo Declines to Sign Risky Afghan Peace Deal,"Updated: September 5, 2019 11:25 AM ET | Originally published: September 4, 2019"
406,Milda Seputyte / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Its streets helped form the backdrop for this year’s hit TV show Chernobyl, which depicted a deadly explosion at the Soviet-era nuclear plant in 1986. Now, the Baltic city of Vilnius is preparing for its own potential real-life atomic catastrophe. The Lithuanian capital is on edge over the imminent opening of a nuclear-power facility just 40 kilometers (25 miles) away in Belarus. Following a string of incidents during construction — and attempts to conceal them — many deem the Russian-built Astravets plant unsafe. The government is buying 900,000 euros ($1 million) of iodine tablets in the event of a radiation leak, which could affect a third of Lithuania’s 2.8 million population. Nationwide drills will be held to test readiness should the unthinkable happen. “Everything you saw on the Chernobyl TV series will be here: the sirens, the rescuers and the helicopters,” said Edgaras Geda, head of Civil Protection Board, which is organizing the exercises. “People still remember Chernobyl. Many of our relatives, including my uncles, were sent to the rescue missions so we have first-hand experience. We’re not going to guess whether an accident could happen, we’re getting ready for one.” The four-day drills will start Oct. 1 and involve a Chernobyl-like scenario where a nuclear accident at Astravets sends out a radioactive cloud helicopters monitor. Sirens will sound, warning messages will be sent to all mobile phones and the national broadcaster will report on the disaster. In some areas, rescuers and the military will evacuate. In others, volunteers playing victims will be registered, washed and given fresh clothing before being taken to safe locations for medical tests and food. Astravets’s safety record is the concern. Since construction began in 2012, there have been at least three deaths. Lithuania is worried about transparency, with some incidents initially going undisclosed, including when the 330-ton casing for the plant’s atomic core slipped from a crane and plunged to the ground. The 2,400-megawatt facility’s two reactors are being built by the export arm of Russia’s state-run Rosatom Corp., which also has projects in Turkey, China and Finland. It’s the same company that oversaw Russia’s failed nuclear-missile test on Aug. 8. Five scientists were killed in that incident. Radiation levels spiked in the White Sea near the Arctic Circle. Russia is providing the lion’s share of Astravets’s $11 billion cost via loans and will be the sole supplier of fuel. Lithuania, once part of the USSR and ruled from Moscow, refuses to purchase the electricity and wants its neighbors to refrain too.",This Lithuanian City Played Host to Filming For HBO's 'Chernobyl.'

407,Julia Webster,"Peter Lindbergh, the renowned German fashion photographer, died on Tuesday at the age of 74.  A message from his family, shared on his official Instagram account, confirmed the news on Wednesday morning: “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Peter Lindbergh on September 3rd 2019, at the age of 74,” the post read. “He is survived by his wife Petra, his first wife Astrid, his four sons Benjamin, Jérémy, Simon, Joseph and seven grandchildren. He leaves a big void.” Recognized as one of the most influential photographers of his generation, Lindbergh worked with countless fashion designers and international magazines throughout his career. His unfussy, intimate black and white images of models are credited with having a significant impact on the fashion industry and pop culture. Lindbergh was born in 1944 to German parents stationed in Leszno, a city in Poland then annexed by Germany. He studied at the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts and moved to Paris in 1978 to pursue his career, his website says. In the 1990s, his photography of models such as Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista helped launch the supermodel era. His work has appeared in magazines such as Vogue, Vanity Fair, Harper’s Bazaar and The New Yorker. He was known for capturing the natural beauty of his subjects. “I hate retouching, I hate make-up. I always say, ‘Take the make-up off!'” he told British Vogue earlier this year. Lindbergh shot the Pirelli calendar three times — in 1996, 2002 and 2017, taking pictures of actresses rather than models. For the 2017 edition, he photographed them with little makeup or styling. In a statement he wrote about the work, he said: “In a time where women are represented in the media and everywhere else as ambassadors of perfection and youth, I thought it was important to remind everyone that there is a different beauty, more real and more truthful, not manipulated by commercial or any other interests, beauty which speaks about individuality, the courage to be yourself, and your very own sensibility.”",German Fashion Photographer Peter Lindbergh Dies at 74,"September 4, 2019"
408,Tara Law,"Aerial images from the Bahamas have revealed catastrophic damage in the wake of Hurricane Dorian. The storm reached the island nation as a category 5 hurricane on Sunday and then slowly moved westward, ripping off roofs, flooding houses and leaving at least seven people dead. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis has described the hurricane as a “historic tragedy” for the northern Bahamas that has damaged or destroyed homes, businesses and infrastructure. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister visited the island of Abaco and surveyed the damage from a plane. “We are in the midst of one the greatest crises in our nation’s history,” Minnis said. Lia Head-Rigby, who runs a hurricane-relief organization and flew over Abaco, told the Associated Press that she saw “total devastation.” “It’s decimated. Apocalyptic,” Head-Rigby said. “It’s not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again.” She also said that her representative on the island had warned her that there are “a lot more” people dead. Early estimates suggest that in the wake of the storm, Abaco will need food for 14,500 people and Grand Bahama island will require food for 45,700 people, Herve Verhoosel, a spokesperson for the U.N.

409,TIME Staff,"The embattled leader of Hong Kong, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has formally withdrawn a divisive bill that sparked the worst political crisis the Chinese enclave has seen in decades. The move satisfies one the protesters’ key demands. But critics say the concession is unlikely to bring an end to intensifying unrest, which has rocked the city for more than 13 consecutive weeks and is now driven by a host of other objections. “The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” Lam said in a video address Wednesday evening after a closed-door meeting with pro-government lawmakers. The contentious legislation would have allowed the extradition of fugitives to mainland China where the murky court system operates under the influence of the Communist Party. Popular backlash to the proposal prompted two million people to march in the streets in June according to organizers’ estimates. In response, Lam declared work on the bill suspended. But her announcement, and later insistence that the bill was “dead,” did little to mollify the angry crowds, as many feared the measure could be revived at a later date. When news of Lam’s intention to formally withdraw the bill broke Wednesday, Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index jumped 3.73 percent, but some rejected her concessions. “Too little and too late now,” democracy campaigner Joshua Wong tweeted. Since the protests kicked off, the full withdrawal of the bill has been one of the central objectives. But the movement has swelled to encompass a growing list of demands, including an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality and direct elections for the city’s leaders. Replying to the public’s “five demands,” Lam continued to insist her administration has “in fact responded.”",Hong Kong Leader Formally Withdraws the Extradition Bill That Sparked Weeks of Unrest,"Updated: September 4, 2019 8:23 AM ET"
410,Jasmine Aguilera,"Prince Harry launched a new green initiative Tuesday in Amsterdam that aims to improve sustainability in the tourism industry––amid controversy surrounding his use of a private plane. Travalyst, an initiative that includes global partners such as TripAdvisor and Visa, is meant to incentivize “organizations and destinations to do right by the places, spaces and animals we all need to protect,” Harry said during a speech at the launch of the initiative. “By promoting and incentivizing sustainable decision-making, by helping us as consumers stay better informed, and by empowering communities, Travalyst will strive to change both the travel industry and the world for the better— and for the long term.” After the speech, Harry defended is use of a private jet on a recent trip to Nice, France, telling reporters: “I spend 99% of my life traveling the world by commercial, occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe — it’s generally as simple as that.” Harry and Meghan Markle faced criticism for their private flight to visit the home of Elton John. The couple, along with their son Archie, used a private jet for the journey and some British media outlets criticized the royals as hypocritical because of their activism on climate change. Private jets usually have a significantly larger carbon footprint per passenger than commercial flights of the same distance. Elton John later said in a public statement that he funded the plane and ensured the flight was carbon neutral by making a contribution to Carbon Footprint, an organization that aims to offset carbon emissions through special projects like establishing clean water programs and efforts against deforestation. Travalyst has been in the works for two years, according to Buckingham Palace. Other partners include Booking.com, Ctrip and Skyscanner. The partners aim to tailor sustainable tourism efforts to the needs of regions across the globe by measuring impact on a community level. “Communities will be at the center of everything we do and we’re not going to reinvent the wheel,” Harry said. “What is clear across this vast landscape is that our world faces environmental challenges of unprecedented scope and scale,” he added during his speech Tuesday. “These human-caused challenges often need a giant system shift to make a significant enough impact.

411,TIME Staff,"Journalists imprisoned, harassed and threatened for doing their work in countries spanning from Colombia to India to Iran are included on September’s list of cases that make up the most serious threats to press freedom. The list—released each month by the One Free Press Coalition, which was founded by a dozen news organizations, including TIME, with the goal of defending journalists under attack—identifies 10 of the most urgent examples of threats to press freedom around the world. Last year, TIME named The Guardians the 2018 Person of the Year, recognizing four journalists and one news organization for their work in the face of threats to press freedom. Jamal Khashoggi, one of the journalists recognized in the issue, remains on top of this month’s 10 Most Urgent list, as the one-year anniversary of his killing and dismemberment inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018 approaches. Khashoggi’s death remains controversial, particularly following a United Nations special report released in June that found “credible evidence” calling for further investigation into Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s role in the killing. The report was the result of a five-month investigation into what U.N. Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard called a “deliberate, premeditated execution” of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and an outspoken critic of bin Salman. The Trump Administration has been criticized for maintaining a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, even after U.S. intelligence officials concluded that bin Salman ordered Khashoggi’s killing. See the 10 journalists on September’s list here: As the one-year anniversary of Khashoggi’s death approaches on Oct. 2, officials have not yet opened an independent criminal investigation into his death. No one has been held responsible for Khashoggi’s killing, even as the United Nations and U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the Saudi crown prince was involved in the journalist’s death. Calls for the White House to release intelligence reports on the killing have been ignored, as was a February deadline for Trump to reply to Congress under the U.S. Global Magnitsky Act.

412,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"On a recent weekday afternoon, twelve employees sat awaiting shoppers in a luxury jewelry store in Hong Kong’s prime tourist district, Tsim Sha Tsui—known to locals simply as “TST.” Next door, in a high-end watch shop, seven workers chatted with each other, no customers in sight. The area is home to luxurious hotels, gourmet restaurants and designer boutiques, but it has also been the site of several violent clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters, who have staged weekly rallies across the city since early June calling for greater political freedoms for the former British colony. A recent weekend demonstration on TST’s main strip, the so-called “Golden Mile” of Nathan Road, ended with heated scuffles between protesters and police, who fired tear gas to disperse them. Slogans like ‘Free HK!’ and ‘Revolution!’ remain daubed on walls in the area. A smattering of shoppers still pop in and out of the glitzy stores — where long lines snaking out of the front doors were, until recently, a common sight — but there is decidedly less buzz these days. What started as a bad year for businesses in Hong Kong, due to the damaging trade war between Washington and Beijing, has now become a terrible one. With protests entering their third month, many businesses in the culinary hub and retail mecca are in deep trouble. “It’s very, very bad for customers,” said Jimmy, a tailor who works on Nathan Road, told TIME.

413,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"The head of Hong Kong Court Prosecutors Association has reportedly taken the extraordinary step of accusing the police of lying, potentially opening a unprecedented rift in the legal and security establishment as unrest in the territory enters its 14th week. According to government broadcaster RTHK, the chairman of the association, William Wong, sent an email to all staff at the Department of Justice claiming that it was clear that police lied when they described the arrests of activists and lawmakers a day before a mass rally as a “coincidence.” In his extraordinary communication, Wong said that “No court or reasonable jury properly directed would believe what police said” and, according to RTHK, added that police had also lied in “recent months.” He then called on the justice minister to ensure that the police maintained “honesty in doing their job.” The apparent rift between prosecutors and police is a sign of the strain felt by the Hong Kong authorities as they try to contain what Beijing has called a “color revolution.” Seven pro-democracy figures were arrested on August 30—including high-profile members of the Demosisto political party Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, three legislators, and a former university student union president. The roundup was believed to be an attempt to discourage participation in an Aug. 31 march planned by the Civil Human Rights Front, a coalition of pro-democracy groups that has organized several mass rallies this summer. Police continued the crackdown on Tuesday morning with several more arrests. Demosisto’s chairperson, Ivan Lam, who had been out of Hong Kong over the weekend, was detained on arrival at the city’s airport, according to the party. Student leader Keith Fong was also arrested in the early hours of Tuesday, on theft charges that the Baptist University student union claimed were “fabricated” by police. Activist Michael Mo was also arrested on Tuesday morning, according to local media, and charged on suspicion of organizing an illegal assembly. The round-up followed a day of student strikes and another night of unrest in the city, with protesters clashing with police outside the offices of Hong Kong’s embattled top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Late on Monday night, Demosisto’s vice chairperson Isaac Cheng, was attacked by three men, according to a spokesperson for the party.",A Rift Reportedly Opens Between Hong Kong Prosecutors and Police as Protests Continue Unabated,"September 3, 2019"
414,TIME Staff,"China has doubled down on what it has termed a “color revolution” in the restive enclave of Hong Kong, dismissing a hardline minority of protesters as “thugs” attempting to turn the territory into an “independent or semi-independent political entity.” At a press conference in Beijing Tuesday carried on live news feeds, spokesman Yang Guang, of the Chinese central government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said that the Hong Kong protests “far exceeded the scope of normal assemblies and rallies” and added that they would be considered “violent crimes” in “any country, any region, or under any legal system.” He also underscored Beijing’s persistent claim that foreign powers are behind the uprising. Radical protesters, he said, were “foot soldiers of external forces and anti-China forces,” bent on “making Hong Kong chaotic and paralyzing the [local] government.” While acknowledging the right of Hong Kong people to protest peacefully, Yang said violent unrest “gravely endangered the interests” of the territory and was “not at all about expressing any political demands” but instead “political intimidation and hijacking, through and through.” Striking a more conciliatory tone, he also urged Hongkongers to “focus on Hong Kong’s economic development and improving the livelihood of Hong Kong people, offering their ideas and strategies and working on solutions together. The current crisis reflects Hong Kong’s problems on very deep levels. It’s time to pay attention and figure out solutions.” His rhetoric will do little to ease tensions in Hong Kong, where a three-month push for greater political freedom shows no sign of abating. Originating as opposition to a divisive extradition bill, the movement has since broadened into a rebellion against the unrepresentative local government, with many protesters demanding self-determination or independence for the semi-autonomous territory, whose 7.2 million inhabitants are culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Chinese. The notion of full political freedom for Hong Kong is anathema to Beijing, which resumed sovereignty over the former British possession in 1997, marking the end of 156 years of colonial rule. “Some Western politicians have made comments about Hong Kong over the past three months,” Yang said. “They waste no effort to encourage and support a few rioters and pro-Hong Kong independence people … they have helped facilitate these pro-Hong Kong independence actions.”",Beijing Dismisses Hong Kong's Radical Protesters as Separatist 'Thugs' Bent on 'Political Intimidation',"September 3, 2019"
415,ADELA LIN / BLOOMBERG,"(Bloomberg) — Taiwan denied interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs to support protesters, rejecting such claims by Beijing as “talking nonsense.” The Taipei-based Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement Sunday that unrest in the former British colony stemmed from the Communist Party’s refusal to consider protesters’ democratic demands. The agency was responding to comments by a top mainland representative on Taiwan affairs accusing the island’s leadership of using the crisis to attack Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” model. “You can’t solve problems by talking nonsense,” the council said. “The CCP should boldly face up to its mistakes, carry out political reform, put in place democracy and respect human rights. Only then can they ease China’s internal and external contradictions.” Although China and Taiwan have been governed separately for 70 years, the Communist Party maintains unification as its ultimate goal and Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this year reaffirmed “one country, two systems” as his preferred framework. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party supports independence, has stepped up her criticism of Beijing as the Hong Kong protests fuel new skepticism about unification. Tsai’s critiques have led Chinese officials to list Taiwan, along with the U.S. and the U.K., among the “black hands” it says are behind almost three months of historic protests. On Saturday, Sun Yafu, vice president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait accused Tsai of taking advantage of the unrest to undercut the idea of Hong Kong-style autonomy for the island. “The DPP instigated and supported riots in Hong Kong and then used the chaos in Hong Kong to attack ‘one country, two systems,’” Sun told a gathering in Meishuan city, Sichuan, according to China Review News. “Instead of picking up a gun or cannon, Tsai is actually making these weapons to attack at the mainland.” Tsai has angered Beijing by refusing to accept her predecessor’s negotiating framework that both sides belong to “one China.” Still, even Taiwan’s China-friendly opposition has rejected the “one country, two systems” approach, which was originally devised for bringing the island back under Beijing’s umbrella. “The government is concerned about Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy, but won’t interfere in Hong Kong affairs,” the Mainland Affairs Council said, adding that Taiwan “would never accept Beijing’s ‘one country, two systems’ and would never bow to threat of a hegemony.”",Taiwan Denies Stoking Hong Kong Unrest and Blasts Communist Party for Refusing to Meet Protesters' Demands,"September 2, 2019"

As the morning got underway, pupils from both elite private colleges and government secondary schools braved the stormy weather to join hands in human chains around their campuses. At Queen’s College, one of Hong Kong’s oldest and most prestigious schools, alumni turned out with current students in protest, chanting “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time!” before singing the school song. At Chinese University, students prepared to boycott classes in defiance of an appeal from university authorities to call off the action because of the risk of unrest.

Several hundred black-clad demonstrators gathered outside the airport in the drizzly afternoon, chanting, “fight for freedom,” according to live feeds and reports from the scene. By gridlocking traffic and blocking trains and buses, protesters sought to once again bring one of the world’s busiest aviation hubs to a standstill after chaotic action there last month captured global attention. According to local media reports, a group of masked protesters stormed into Terminal 1 and shattered a glass door around 1:20 p.m. before airport police pushed them back. Outside the terminals, protesters jammed the streets with luggage trolleys and metal barriers. Live feeds from the scene showed crowds booing riot police, who accused demonstrators of hurling objects as well as insults. On Twitter, the Hong Kong Police Force dubbed the protest an “unauthorized assembly” and recalled a court injunction put in place last month to stop obstruction of the airport after demonstrators occupying the terminals caused hundreds of flight cancellations. On Sunday, an express rail line to the airport was suspended, while traffic snarled on a nearby bridge. In-town check-in services at Airport Express stations were also halted. Around 4 p.m., police said the protesters were attempting to “paralyze traffic” with water-filled barriers and warned them to leave immediately. Reports of an impending police dispersal operation prompted some to walk away by foot. The airport demonstration comes a day after violent battles between police and protesters erupted across the city.

On Wednesday in Kiev, his nation’s capital, Danyliuk met with his American counterpart, the U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, who assured him that the U.S. support for Ukraine, including military support in its five-year war with Russian-backed separatists, would only intensify. “Everything in our meeting was about how we would expand our cooperation and how everything is ready for that,” Danyliuk tells TIME. But the following day, President Trump appeared to contradict those plans. As first reported on Thursday by Politico, Trump has asked Bolton and other officials in the administration to stall $250 million in aid to Ukraine, pending an official review of whether this support is in line with U.S. interests. “It goes in a different direction,” Danyliuk says in an interview at his office in Kiev, the first detailed response to Trump’s move from a top Ukrainian official. During their talks this week, Danyliuk says Bolton did not mention any plans to review or withhold U.S. support to Ukraine. “It was never raised,” he says. “On the contrary,” says Danyliuk, “we talked about how we would expand our cooperation. In my opinion, military support to Ukraine by definition is in the interests of the U.S., taking into consideration Ukraine’s strategic role in the region. If anything, the support should be increased.” Asked about Bolton’s meetings in Kiev, a senior Administration official said in an email to TIME: “The United States has had extensive military cooperation with Ukraine, something that has been very beneficial to both nations.” The mixed signals marked another sign of discord within the White House between Trump and his top security advisers, whose efforts to take a tougher stance on Russia have been repeatedly undercut by the President. Leading Democrats in Washington expressed outrage at the apparent attempt to hinder an aid package to Ukraine that has already been approved by Congress. “Enough is enough,” Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. “President Trump should stop worrying about disappointing Vladimir Putin and stand up for U.S. national security priorities. We have a responsibility to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty and deter Russia from further aggression,” he added, referring to Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its fuelling of a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed over 13,000 people in the last five years. The U.S. President was also cautious to avoid criticizing Putin during the G7 summit held this week in France. Asked to explain his desire for Russia to be allowed back into the G7 club of industrialized nations after it was expelled in 2014, Trump appeared to blame his predecessor for the Russian annexation of Crimea that year, saying that Barack Obama had been “outsmarted” by President Putin, who ordered Russian troops to invade and seize that territory from Ukraine. The Crimean peninsula, Trump said, “was sort of taken away from President Obama.”",Ukraine Is Struggling to Make Sense of Trump and Bolton's Conflicting Messages on Russia,"August 30, 2019"
422,Olivia B. Waxman,"After roughly 1.5 million German soldiers, more than 2,000 airplanes and more than 2,500 tanks crossed the Polish border on Sept. 1, 1939, the British gave Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler an ultimatum: pull out of Poland, or else. Hitler ignored the demand, and two days later, on Sept. 3, 1939, Britain and France declared war. Thus began World War II, and this weekend Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Poland to mark the anniversary of that event. But the invasion of Poland wasn’t the first time German forces had been put to work for Hitler’s goal of European domination. Previously, however, the other European powers had pursued a strategy of appeasement, giving Hitler what they deemed reasonable concessions, in order to avoid all-out war. That strategy reached its apex when the three parties signed the Munich Agreement on Sept. 30, 1938, giving Hitler the German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia, known as the Sudetenland, on the condition that he would not invade any more territory. But six months later, in March of 1939, Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by absorbing all of Czechoslovakia. The war didn’t begin then. Rather, it took another half a year. Rumors started swirling that Hitler was eyeing Poland next. With French support, Britain promised on March 31, 1939, that if Germany made aggressive moves toward Poland, they would come to Poland’s defense. By the time that happened, not only had Hitler broken yet another promise, something else had shifted too. “When Hitler invades Poland in ’39 there is no political support any longer for appeasement,” explains Rob Citino, Senior Historian at The National WWII Museum. Though France urged Britain to wait, says Tim Bouverie, author of Appeasement: Chamberlain, Hitler, Churchill, and the Road to War, many British politicians feared the implications of not keeping the promise to Poland, and they were done giving Hitler the benefit of the doubt. “Hitler had proven, by tearing up the Munich agreement and invading Czechoslovakia in March of that year, that he could not be trusted and that he had to be stopped,” Bouverie says. By falsely claiming that he only wanted to fix damage done to Germany from World War I and restore German lands to German people, Hitler had previously been able to convince his counterparts—already wary of war—to hold off. “Both of these claims are proven as lies when he invades Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and the British government realizes that he is intent upon wider European conquest—possibly domination.” Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain laid out the argument for ending the appeasement strategy in a Sept. 4 radio address aimed at the German people: “He gave his word that he would respect the Locarno Treaty; he broke it. He gave his word that he neither wished nor intended to annex Austria; he broke it. He declared that he would not incorporate the Czechs in the Reich; he did so. He gave his word after Munich that he had no further territorial demands in Europe; he broke it. He has sworn for years that he was the mortal enemy of Bolshevism; he is now its ally.” Hitler’s propaganda endorsed the theory of Lebensraum (often translated as “living space”), his idea that the Germany needed more room. Citino points out that Poland was geographically the logical next step after Czechoslovakia, in terms of the application of that theory. In addition, the dictator believed that the Polish population was racially inferior to Germans, and thus would be easily overrun and enslaved. (On Sept. 17, the Soviet Union also invaded Poland, in accord with a non-aggression agreement Hitler and Stalin had come to that summer; that agreement would end on June 22, 1941, when the Nazis invaded Soviet territory.)",The Invasion of Poland Wasn't Hitler's First Aggression.

423,Will Wade / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) –– The voice on the television ad sounds ominous. “The Chinese government is quietly invading our American electric grid,” it says. “Now they’re coming for our energy jobs.” As the narrator speaks, images of marching soldiers and President Xi Jinping flash across the screen. It ends with a warning: “Don’t sign the petition allowing China to control Ohio’s power.” The commercial, which has the air of a political-attack ad, is the latest and most bizarre salvo in a bitter fight over a new Ohio law subsidizing two struggling nuclear power plants owned by bankrupt FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. For months, debate over the measure has spilled beyond the state’s borders. A member of President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, Bob Paduchik, urged Ohio lawmakers to support the legislation and stressed that the president backed it, too. And the measure drew opposition from groups as diverse as the Sierra Club and billionaire Charles Koch’s political organization, which blasted it as a corporate “bailout.” The law, enacted last month, carves out $150 million annually for FirstEnergy Solutions’s Davis-Besse and Perry plants, which the company had said it would close without aid. Ohio will fund it by cutting support for wind and solar. The move is unprecedented. While New York, New Jersey and Illinois all subsidize nuclear power as part of their clean-energy strategies, Ohio is the first to do so by directly yanking support from renewables. Now environmentalists and others are gathering signatures in support of a referendum to repeal it. But the group behind the television ad, Ohioans for Energy Security, says they’re circulating the petition on behalf of China. A spokesman for the group, Carlo LoParo, said loans made to natural gas plants in Ohio by state-controlled Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. give Beijing local influence. If reactors close and gas plants sell more power in the region, Chinese banks “will have significant control over Ohio’s energy grid,” LoParo said in a statement. “It’s fair to point out that they’re heavily financed not just by foreign lenders, but by a foreign government,” he said in the interview. LoParo declined to say who funded the ad.",A Fight Over Subsidies for 2 Ohio Nuclear Plants Draws Claim That China Is 'Invading' the Electric Grid,"August 30, 2019"
424,Billy Perrigo,"As many as 4 million people — many of them Muslims — may lose their Indian citizenship on Saturday, accused of being “infiltrators” by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is preparing to release the final version of a controversial list called the National Register of Citizens, the result of a six-year effort to ostensibly catalog all the legal residents of the northeastern state of Assam. But the list has been mired in controversy. The last time a draft was released, in 2018, 4.1 million people were left off, putting them at risk of being made stateless. Many of them were poor, illiterate and/or members of the Muslim minority. Observers are worried that the final list, published on Saturday, will result in families being split up, incarcerated, and even being chased out to Bangladesh — a country many have never set foot in. And rights groups are worried that the list could set off a chain of events similar to the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar in 2017, when roughly 750,000 members of the Muslim Rohingya minority were persecuted, stripped of their Burmese citizenship and forced to flee to Bangladesh. Others fear that this is the start of a disturbing trend. Modi’s Home Minister, Amit Shah, has promised to expel “infiltrators” from the rest of India, using Assam as a testing ground. “We will implement National Register of Citizens in the entire country,” Shah said when the BJP returned to power for another five years in May. “We will remove every single infiltrator.” Here’s what to know about India’s National Register of Citizens. The idea has been floated before, partly because of the local history of Assam, where indigenous Assamese people have long held anxieties about being displaced by waves of Bengali immigration — first during the partition of British India in 1947, then on the eve of the India-Pakistan war in 1971, and still today over the state’s porous border with Bangladesh. In 2013, the Indian Supreme Court ruled that the NRC be updated. The list was first drawn up in the 1950s but fell into disuse.",4 Million Indian Citizens Could Be Made Stateless Tomorrow.

425,Julia Webster,"Former U.K. Prime Minister Sir John Major has said he will join a legal action to block Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspending parliament. “I promised that, if the Prime Minister prorogued Parliament in order to prevent Members from opposing his Brexit plans, I would seek judicial review of his action,” the former conservative prime minister said in a statement. The controversial plans to suspend or “prorogue” parliament were announced by the U.K. government on Wednesday morning, effectively locking lawmakers out of the building for several weeks in early September. Several leading politicians have expressed concerns that the move would prevent lawmakers from passing legislation regarding Britain’s scheduled exit from the E.U. on Oct. 31, and allow Johnson to force through a controversial “no deal” Brexit. (Johnson has denied this is his motivation.) Major has previously warned that proroguing parliament would mean “heading in a very dangerous territory.” Speaking at Chatham House in June, Major said: “I cannot imagine Mr Disraeli, Mr Gladstone, Mr Churchill or Mrs Thatcher even in their most difficult moment saying let us put parliament aside while I carry through this difficult policy that a part of my party disagrees with.” Johnson has pledged to leave the E.U. by the scheduled departure date of Oct. 31, with or without a deal, and the government has said the five-week suspension will still allow time to debate Brexit. But the decision prompted a backlash from lawmakers and opponents of a no-deal Brexit – and the shock it could bring. The move sparked protests across the country, resignations, and a petition with over 1.5 million signatures. Johnson’s decision has been described as “a threat to democracy” and “a constitutional outrage” both by opposition leaders and by members of Johnson’s conservative party. Major, who was prime minister from 1990 to 1997, has joined a challenge launched by anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller, who previously used the courts to force parliament to pass legislation to trigger the Article 50 Brexit process. “In the view of imminence of the prorogation – and to avoid duplication of effort, and taking up the Court’s time through repetition – I intend to seek the Court’s permission to intervene in the claim already initiated by Gina Miller, rather than to commence separate proceedings,” Major said in the statement.",Former U.K. Prime Minister Joins Court Case to Stop Boris Johnson Suspending Parliament,"August 30, 2019"
426,TIME Staff,"Two prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, were released on bail Friday following their arrest earlier in the day. Speaking outside the court, Wong said the “political prosecution” will do little to dampen the movement. “I can only tell Beijing and the Hong Kong governments that the arrests and charges will not pacify the public’s anger. It will only cause us to be firmer in our fight and not give up,” he said. The 22-year-old Wong was “suddenly pushed into a private car on the street” near a subway station on the southern side of Hong Kong island in the morning, according to a statement from the pro-democracy Demosisto party. About an hour later, the party said Chow, also 22, was arrested at her home. A spokesperson for the police confirmed that Wong faces charges of inciting, organizing and participating in an unauthorized assembly in relation to an incident on June 21, when protestors besieged the police headquarters. Chow faces charges of inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly on the same day. Wong’s detention comes two weeks before he was due to travel to Washington D.C. to attend a hearing on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.

427,Jennifer Jacobs / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) –– President Donald Trump said he canceled a trip to Poland this weekend because Hurricane Dorian is poised to strike Florida, and will send Vice President Mike Pence in his place. The storm is expected to strike Florida’s east coast by Monday, delivering torrential rain and 130 mile (209 kilometer) per-hour winds. Trump said he would remain in Washington “to ensure that all resources of the federal government are focused on the coming storm.” He said he had called Polish President Andrzej Duda on Thursday to inform him of the change in plans. “The storm looks like it could be a very, very big one indeed,” Trump said. “Mike will be going.” Airlines are considering whether to cancel flights, cruise lines are rerouting ships in the region and travelers are rethinking Labor Day holiday plans as the storm approaches. About 17.5 million Americans were expected to fly during the Labor Day weekend, according the trade group Airlines for America, with Friday typically the busiest day. But that’s when the U.S. National Hurricane Center says the state could start feeling the storm’s early effects. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a close political ally of the president, declared a state of emergency on Wednesday. On Thursday he expanded it to include all 67 counties, compared with 26 in his original executive order. He said he took the step due to Dorian’s “uncertain projected path,” according to an emailed statement. Florida will again be a critical swing state in the 2020 elections.

428,Joseph Hincks,"The protracted shadow war between Israel and Iran has spilled beyond the borders of Syria following a series of attacks in Iraq and Lebanon blamed on Israel, and threats of Hezbollah retaliation that reporters in Israel and Lebanon say has prompted the Israel Defense Force (IDF) to station dummy soldiers in jeeps along its northern border.  Israel’s state of high alert over potential cross border attacks comes days after U.S. officials leaked confirmation Israel was behind a July bombing at a weapons factory in Iraq—which they said Iran was using to transport weapons to Syria. Lebanon blamed Israel for a drone strike on Sunday in the suburbs of Beirut. Following Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri’s meeting with United Nations Security Council envoys to protest what he called a “clear Israeli violation of Lebanese sovereignty” on Monday, the U.N. called on both sides to exercise “maximum restraint.” Israel, which traditionally maintains a policy of ambiguity over oversees military operations, has not taken responsibility for either the Iraq attack or the Beirut drone strike, although its military said it had carried out a separate airstrike on Saturday near the Syrian border in order to foil an “imminent” drone attack planned by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah (Iran has denied planning the strike.) Despite the lack of official confirmation, Israeli media reports that the Beirut drone strike damaged equipment that would have enhanced Hezbollah’s precision guided rocket program. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanon-based Iran-backed Shi’ite militia force claimed the strike was Israel’s first attack in Lebanon since the two countries fought a bloody war in 2006 and promised retaliation. “I say to the Israeli army on the border from tonight, stand guard. Wait for us one, two, three, four days,” Nasrallah said Sunday. Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, likened Israel’s alleged actions to a “declaration of war” and said Lebanon had the right to defend itself. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a U.S. intelligence official told TIME that Iranian responses could come in various forms: an attack from Hezbollah or other Iranian-proxies; attacks from Sunni militias with alliances of convenience to Tehran; and even attacks on Jewish or Israeli “targets” outside of Israel. A worst case scenario, the official said, might be an Iranian-backed attack on Jewish settlements in the West Bank or the Golan Heights, which could set off a war. The timing for the rise in tensions isn’t clear. While Iran’s influence in the region is growing—particularly through militias supported by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Quds Force in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen—the official who spoke with TIME said the threat to Israel has not increased substantially in recent months. The official declined to comment on why, at this juncture, Israel is expanding its shadow war with Iran. Here’s what to know about the escalation. After the Syrian conflict broke out in 2011, Sunni rebels—many financed by Iran’s Gulf rivals, Saudi Arabia and the UAE—rose up against President Bashar Assad’s regime. In response, Iran began pouring money, resources and soldiers into the country in support of Assad’s regime, with which it had been strategically aligned since the 1980s. Concerned about the entrenchment of hostile Iranian forces near its northwest border, Israel has since launched hundreds of air strikes in Syria, including against Hezbollah positions and convoys transporting arms to the group in Lebanon. Iran and Iranian proxy militias have occasionally responded with cross border strikes, such as by launching rockets over a ski resort in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights in January. Israel’s success at disrupting Iran’s infrastructure build-up in Syria has led the Islamic Republic to turn its attention to Iraq, where there have been several reports in recent months that Iran is building an array of ballistic missiles aimed at Israel. Israel appears to have followed suit, with recent attacks reported—but not acknowledged—on weapons storage facilities controlled by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. Sunday morning’s strike reportedly damaged a central component of Hezbollah’s precision guided missile program: an industrial-sized mixer used to make propellants that enhance missile engine performance and can increase their accuracy. The machine—called a plenary mixer—was likely hit as preparations were being made to move it to a secure location, according to Israel’s Haaretz.",Israel Is Escalating Its Shadow War With Iran.

429,"Madeline Roache / Puhoi, Moldova","By January 2018 the mayor of Puhoi was fed up. His assistant kept turning up to work drunk. His colleague wasn’t the only one; sometimes it seemed to him as if everyone in this Moldovan village of 5,500 people had a drinking problem. So the mayor, Petru Frunze, decided to hold a competition. Any couple who could stay sober for six months would receive a cash prize of 1,000 lei ($56) and jobs. Twenty couples signed up, but only one succeeded. As promised, Frunze found them jobs as cleaners in the capital city of Chisinau, around 15 miles away. He even covered their travel costs. But within a few months, they had both relapsed and turned back to alcohol. “This life isn’t for us,” they told him. The competition never ran again. “If we had just one success story, it would have been worth it,” says Nina Iurcu, who succeeded Frunze as mayor in April 2019.  In Puhoi, alcohol is the lifeblood of the economy and the community. Almost everybody works for the local Asconi winery, and almost everyone distills their own wine. Alcohol is currency, used to pay people for small jobs and favors. “You’re not a person if you don’t drink,” says Nicolae Rusu, a 35-year-old construction worker, who says he used to make 300 liters of his own wine each year. Puhoi is no different to many other villages in this Eastern European country that borders Romania and Ukraine. The wine industry employs almost a tenth of the national workforce and income generated from viticulture forms 15% of the national annual budget. But the country is dependent on alcohol in many more ways than one. Moldova has the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world and the highest death rate linked to drinking. One in four deaths are related to alcohol while the world’s average is one in 20. The latest 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) data found that people over the age of 15 drink on average 15.2 liters of pure alcohol (including alcohol made at home or illegally) per capita each year, the equivalent of around 167 bottles of wine. Following closely is Lithuania with 15 liters and the Czech Republic with 14.4, while Europe’s average is 9.8. “Every family has a person with a drinking problem,” says Tudor Vasiliev, a psychiatrist specializing in addiction and a coordinator of the National Alcohol Control Program.  Accurate figures for Moldova are hard to reach because up to 70% of alcohol consumed is homemade wine, says Olga Penina, a lecturer of Public Health at Chisinau’s State University of Medicine and Pharmacy. The wine-drinking culture sets Moldova and Georgia apart from other post-Soviet countries, where people prefer to drink spirits. The “cult of wine is strong”, says Penina. “Fighting it is problematic.” Although alcohol consumption levels have overall decreased in Europe, former Soviet countries like Moldova are still home to the world’s heaviest drinking populations. And it’s taking a devastating toll on public health. Alcohol contributes to the deaths of one in five Russians, and it’s among the main reasons for lower life expectancy in the ex-USSR compared to Western countries. In Moldova, where liver cirrhosis is more common than anywhere else in Europe, men live to an average age of 68 and women, 75. Europe’s averages are 79 and 84 respectively. In the Soviet Union, little was done to curb excessive drinking. It was even encouraged as alcohol production was a very profitable industry for the Soviet government, according the Marya Levintova, a public health expert on Russia. Levintova and a number of other other academics including Mark Schrad said that alcohol in post-Soviet countries has been a “statecraft”. While generating revenue for the government, it has also stymied dissent and promoted autocracy. In his 2014 book Vodka Politics: Alcohol, Autocracy and the Secret History of the Russian State, Schrad wrote that “vodka became an instrument of state domination.”  This perception also exists in Moldova, Europe’s poorest country, where corruption and political instability are rife. “It’s a way of keeping the population passive,” says Ivan Lungu, a 38-year-old recovering alcoholic, who quit drinking a couple of years ago. “Drunk people don’t protest.” Mayor Iurcu’s office in Puhoi is located in a dark and bare community center. Frayed wires poke from holes in the cracked ceiling. A warm smell of onion and garlic fills the hall. Next door, pensioners gather under a portrait of the Virgin Mary, waiting for a free bowl of soup and bread. Outside elderly men smoke around a table, watching the young construction workers balancing on a brick wall as they pass each other tools.

The volcano, on a small island of the same name just off the coast of Sicily, erupted at around midday. The explosion caused vegetation fires and created a tower of smoke and ash more than a mile high. Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology said the explosion caused a pyroclastic flow (a fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter) that extended for several hundred meters into the sea. Tourists recorded the spectacular explosion on social media. Elena Schiera, who was sailing on a boat with her family near the island when the volcano erupted, shared several videos of their escape from the cloud of smoke. “All of a sudden we heard a loud bang and saw a large black cloud spewing out of the Stromboli crater and pouring into the sea,” she told CNN. The video shows the huge cloud of smoke advancing quickly just yards away from her boat. The caption reads: “Stromboli volcano eruption at 12:17…we survived miraculously.

Ruth Davidson cited family reasons in her decision to leave the job, but her distaste for Johnson was no secret. Her departure could throw the unity of the U.K. into doubt. In her role, she was the most influential voice for Scotland remaining a part of the U.K. at a time when support for Scottish independence has risen amid widespread opposition to Brexit. Davidson, who appeared on the 2018 TIME 100, campaigned successfully to keep Scotland inside the United Kingdom during the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. And in 2017, she successfully brought the Conservatives back from the political wilderness in Scotland––winning 13 parliamentary seats, up from just one in the previous election. The total was enough to keep former Prime Minister Theresa May in power, amid a disastrous showing elsewhere in the U.K. But her position was made more difficult when Johnson became Prime Minister in July. Johnson is widely seen as toxic in Scotland: earlier in August, a poll showed support for Scottish independence surpassing 50% for the first time since 2017. Davidson––along with a majority of Scots––voted to remain in the E.U. in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But Johnson campaigned to leave, and has increasingly advocated Britain leaving the E.U. without a deal––which Davidson has said would be damaging to Scotland.

432,Hillary Leung,"Protests have gripped the Indonesian province of West Papua for more than a week as racial and political tensions boiled over into violence. Information is scarce due to an Internet blackout in the remote region, but reports claim several people have died in clashes between pro-independence demonstrators and Indonesian authorities. Here’s what to know about the demonstrations as they stretch into their second week: The most recent unrest appears to have been sparked by the mass arrest of Papuan students in Surabaya, a city on the island of Java. Citing Papuan activists, the Guardian reports that 43 students were detained in relation to the destruction of a flag during celebrations marking Indonesia’s independence on Aug. 17. The episode led to a chaotic confrontation in which students barricaded themselves inside a dormitory to fend off an angry mob, and police reportedly threw tear gas inside the building and yelled racist slurs at the Papuan students, calling them derogatory names like “monkeys” and “pigs.” The following Monday, protests erupted in the West Papuan capital Manokwari, soon spreading to other parts of the province. Demonstrations showing solidarity with West Papuans have also been held in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. The protesters are demanding independence and racial justice. West Papua, which is located on the island of New Guinea, is a former Dutch colony that was temporarily designated as part of Indonesia upon the withdrawal of the Dutch administration. A 1969 referendum on the province’s autonomy, recognized by the international community but rejected by many Papuans as deeply flawed, declared it a part of Indonesia. “Free Papua” campaigns have since emerged calling for self-determination. The independence movement has primarily taken the form of peaceful protest and diplomacy, but at times has led to guerrilla warfare tactics against Indonesian authorities. The Indonesian government has been accused of violently suppressing the indigenous community. At least six protestors and one soldier reportedly were killed during unrest in the region’s Deiyai regency Wednesday, according to Al Jazeera, and several others including children were wounded. But a national police spokesman disputed the allegation that demonstrators were killed, saying one soldier died and three police officers injured when protestors stormed a district chief’s office with arrows and machetes. The Associated Press reported that police said at least one soldier and two civilians were killed in the clashes. Last Monday, protestors in the city of Sorong torched several buildings, including a jail, Agence France-Press reports. Demonstrators reportedly threw rocks at prisoners as they set the prison ablaze, while riot police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd. A government-enforced internet shutdown has stymied the flow of information from the region, making claims difficult to verify. Authorities say the shutdown is a “matter of national security,” according to an NPR report citing local media, but human rights groups have criticized the blackout as an attempt to cover up potentially violent suppression of protestors.",Protests in West Papua Have Turned Violent Amid an Internet Blackout.

433,Hillary Leung,"Canada has deported a Chinese dissident who has a history of violent crime on the grounds that he could pose a danger to the public, the New York Times reports, downplaying concerns he could face persecution back home. Since fleeing China and obtaining residency in Canada, where he was resettled by the U.N., Yang Wei, 49, has been arrested multiple times for offenses including possession of a knife and aggravated assault. In one case, he assaulted a store worker, and in another stabbed a bus driver 13 times. Authorities justified his deportation on the grounds that he posed a danger to the public. Yang is expected to arrive in Beijing Thursday. Critics of the ruling say Yang, who has mental health problems, will likely face incarceration in China. The former political activist founded a branch of the China Democracy Party in his native province of Sichuan. He earlier served three years in a labor camp after putting up pro-democracy posters in support of the 1989 Tiananmen protests. “They’ll be waiting for him,” said Sheng Xue, a Toronto-based writer who is friends with Yang. According to Sharom Hom, executive director of the organization Human Rights in China, Canada is obliged under the international principle of non-refoulement not to deport refugees if they could face abuse back home. According to the Times, the ruling to deport Yang was based primarily on a document that evaluated whether he would receive adequate mental health care in China. The assessment, which was viewed by the Times, reportedly said there was no proof that he would be incarcerated upon his return.

434,Tara Law,"Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg arrived in New York City on Wednesday after sailing across the Atlantic Ocean to call attention to the need for quick action to save the planet. Thunberg, a 16-year-old from Sweden, embarked in the racing sailboat Malizia II from Plymouth in the United Kingdom two weeks ago on the trip to the U.S. to attend the United Nations Climate Action Summit, which is scheduled to take place in September at the U.N.’s headquarters in New York. After disembarking from the vessel at a Manhattan marina, Thunberg was greeted by a crowd of supporters, including a group of fellow high school students carrying homemade signs. The students broke into chants as the sailboat slowly pulled into the marina in Lower Manhattan, including “Sea levels are rising and so are we!” and “There is no Planet B!” Thunberg seemed a little weary from her journey, but spoke forcefully about climate change. While she doesn’t expect everyone to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a boat like she did, she said that she believes it’s time for people to come together to fight climate change. “The climate and ecological crisis is a global crisis and the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced,” she said shortly after she stepped on shore. “And if we don’t manage to work together and to cooperate… then we will fail.” Thunberg said that while she’s hoping to spread the word about climate change, one person isn’t the primary focus of her message––President Donald Trump. “My message for him is just listen to the science, and he obviously doesn’t do that. As I always say to this question, if no one has been able to convince him about the climate crisis, the urgency, why should I be able to do that?” Thunberg said. Thunberg launched her campaign for action on climate change just last August, when she sat outside of the Swedish Parliament in Stockholm holding a sign inscribed with the phrase, “Skolstrejk för Klimatet” (School Strike for Climate). In the year since, she helped to organize a March 15 strike believed to have been joined by 1.6 million people in 133 countries; met with world leaders, including Pope Francis; and was nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.","Climate Activist Greta Thunberg, 16, Arrives in New York After Sailing Across the Atlantic","Updated: August 28, 2019 6:17 PM ET"
435,Mahita Gajanan,"A police team in France has destroyed a computer hacking network that affected more than 850,000 computers around the world. Following a tip, the French cybercrime fighting team, C3N, found and destroyed the pirate server, located in the Paris area. The server controlled a network of computers infected by a virus that reportedly made millions of euros through fraud, according to the BBC. “We managed to track down where the command server was, the control tower for the ‘botnet’ network of infected computers,” C3N chief Jean-Dominique Nollet told France Inter radio, according to the BBC. “People may not realize it, but 850,000 infected computers means massive firepower, enough to bring down all the websites on the planet. Even well-protected institutions were at risk of being paralyzed.” Authorities said the French team that tackles cybercrime became aware of the private server in the spring, learning that it had sent a virus called Retadup to hundreds of thousands of Windows computers across 100 countries, mostly concentrated in Central and South America, the BBC reported. Police said the virus was sent through USB drives and emails that advertised quick money making or erotic pictures. By gaining control of the computers, hackers were able to create cryptocurrency, steal data from Israeli hospitals and use ransomware to threaten people for money.

436,Billy Perrigo,"The U.K. government announced controversial plans to suspend parliament on Wednesday morning, a gamble which could allow a “no deal” Brexit to be forced through — or preempt a vote of no confidence in the government. The Queen formally agreed Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s request to end the current parliamentary session, the government said Wednesday. The move to “prorogue” parliament will effectively lock lawmakers out of the building for several days in early September, possibly preventing them from making laws that would force Britain’s exit from the European Union to be delayed or even canceled if a deal cannot be agreed. Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U. on Oct. 31, but currently has not accepted a withdrawal agreement which would lessen the shock of its departure. Johnson has pledged to leave on Halloween with or without such a deal — but many lawmakers are opposed to the shock economists say a so-called “no deal” Brexit would bring.   The prorogation of parliament is when the Queen ends one parliamentary session so that another can begin. Prorogation can only happens when the Queen says so — which, in the modern era, is only after the Prime Minister has requested it. Lawmakers do not have a say in preventing prorogation. In practice, it means sitting lawmakers will not meet for several weeks, meaning they cannot pass laws. Prorogation also gives the government an opportunity to set out its new agenda for the coming session, which is announced by the Queen in a speech to lawmakers amid great pomp and ceremony.",U.K. Government Announces Plans to Suspend Parliament Before Brexit.

The pound fell as much as 0.7%. Under the plan, all business would be suspended from about Sept. 11 until a Queen’s speech on Oct. 14 kicks off a new session of Parliament, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg said on Twitter. Downing Street called it business as usual for a new government, she said, with the “useful political side effect” of denying time to MPs trying to stop Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31. The prime minister’s office had no immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Parliament is due to return from summer recess on Sept. 3. Members of Parliament who oppose a no-deal Brexit have feared Johnson would attempt to stop them meeting, and won’t take it lying down. Some have talked of simply continuing to meet in another building, and defying the government. Parliament has also passed measures aimed at forcing the government to let it meet. “This is an unconstitutional and undemocratic outrage not seen in recent British history,’’ Labour MP Stephen Doughty said on Twitter. “Pulls HM the Queen into major political crisis.

At least 172 people were on board, including 136 passengers and 36 crew members, according to the Associated Press. A spokesperson for the Philippines Coast Guard said the number rescued was as high as 245, far more than the number listed on the vessel’s manifest. A one-year-old girl and a 60-year-old male passenger were reportedly among those killed. The spokesperson said the Coast Guard did not have patrol vessels in the area and called on nearby boats to assist with the emergency, the AP reports. By some accounts, it took hours for help to arrive. According to local newspaper the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the ferry departed the province of Cebu at around 6 p.m. Tuesday and was headed for Dapitan City. The blaze was believed to have started in the engine room just after midnight. As of 8 a.m. Wednesday, 102 passengers had been rescued and brought to hospitals, a disaster management officer in Dapitan said according to local news site Rappler. The cause of the fire has yet to be determined. Scores of people die yearly from ferry accidents in the Southeast Asian nation, which has a poor record of maritime safety.

439,Anisah Shukry and Hadi Azmi / Bloomberg,"Malaysian prosecutors will seek to prove that Najib Razak acted together with fugitive financier Jho Low in their alleged roles in 1MDB, as the former premier faces his biggest trial linked to the troubled state fund. “In truth, Jho Low was the accused’s mirror image,” prosecutor Gopal Sri Ram said in his opening statement in the Kuala Lumpur court. “The prosecution will establish facts which will give rise to an irresistible inference that Jho Low and the accused acted as one at all material times.” The 25 charges Najib faces revolve around 1MDB’s multibillion-dollar bond sales and acquisitions. That includes accusations he received 2.08 billion ringgit ($495 million) of bribes related to a letter of government support for $3 billion of 1MDB bonds in 2013, as well as allegations he accepted 49.9 million ringgit linked to a $975 million loan facility from Deutsche Bank AG. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Jho Low, or Low Taek Jho, has denied any wrongdoing in response to charges against him in the U.S. and Malaysia. The start to the proceeding was postponed many times as it clashed with Najib’s first 1MDB trial, which involved local transactions by the state fund’s former unit. The delays point to the massive task Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has ahead of him in getting to the bottom of the 1MDB scandal. Since wresting power from Najib last year, the prime minister has prioritized investigations into the scandal, as well as recouping funds believed to be lost through the scandal-ridden fund. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s lawyer is also present in court to hold a watching brief.

440,Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Costco Wholesale Corp.’s first outlet in China opened on Tuesday and was soon overrun with customers willing to fight over discounted products and wait hours to pay for their purchases. The American retail giant had to suspend operations in its Shanghai store in the afternoon citing “heavy traffic and customer flows”, according to a text message sent by the company to consumers holding its membership card. The message was shared on Weibo, China’s micro-blogging website. The frenzy at Costco’s store comes at a time when the U.S. and China are locked in a tit-for-tat tariff war that shows no signs of abating and is making American firms wary of investing in the largest Asian economy. Costco is also entering a market where many of its global rivals have struggled and given up. Carrefour SA sold 80% stake in its China unit at a discount in June while German wholesaler Metro AG is looking to sell its operations. “There’s no other word to describe Shanghai’s Costco but crazy,” a Weibo user said, who gave up on the shopping plan after seeing two-hour queues at the checkout counters. Other Weibo users shared that they had to wait three hours to enter the parking lot while some decided to walk to the store to avoid the traffic jam. Other pictures showed customers grabbing packets of roast chicken and elbowing out other shoppers at the store. Local news reports said the retailer offered discounts as deep as 60% on some products and annual membership for just 199 yuan ($28). The sale also includes the nation’s coveted fiery liquor drink from Kweichow Moutai Co. and Wuliangye Yibin Co.

441,Lisa Abend / Copenhagen,"It was five o’clock on a recent Monday afternoon, and at one of the busiest connectors between the city’s center and its surrounding neighborhoods, rush hour was in full swing. Hundreds of vehicles flowed across Dronning Louise’s bridge every minute, but this being Copenhagen, the vast majority of them–some 48,000 by day’s end– were bicycles, not cars. Among the surging tide of cargo bikes, fixies, and plain, old-fashioned two-wheelers, two tourists stood upright on e-scooters, their uncertain weaving prompting a few angry chimes from passing bike bells. From the sidewalk, Marie Djernes, a 24-year-old student who was standing next to her own bike as she waited for a friend, watched the scene with bemusement. “Yeah, they’re a bit annoying,” she said. “They don’t really seem to know what they’re doing.”  Bird, Lime, Circ, Tier, Dott, Voi, Volo, Scoot, Trotti, Poppi: since making their first appearance in California in 2017, electric scooters with names that sound like modern-day versions of Snow White’s dwarves have popped up in over 100 cities worldwide, the progeny of companies aiming to become the next Uber of alternative transport (that includes Uber itself, which, despite having recently posted $5.2 billion in losses, has its own line of e-scooters, Jump). Yet for all its success, this new form of “micromobility,” as its promoters love to call it, has also brought a slew of problems, from safety risks to impassable sidewalks. The solution, say many scooter advocates in the U.S. and Europe, lies in creating the kind of infrastructure—wide bike lanes, ample parking— found in cycling-friendly cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But as those cities are themselves learning, e-scooters and bikes don’t necessarily play well together either.  It’s not hard to understand the appeal of electric scooters. For a commuter arriving by train from the suburbs, already late and facing a half mile slog on foot to the office, or a tourist with only a day in a city and a lot of ground to cover, the devices present an easy solution: download the app, add credit card information, unlock one of the seeming gazillions of scooters parked nearby, and off you go. Because they are dockless, the devices can be left anywhere, and because they run on electric batteries instead of fossil fuels, they allow users to feel good about making a climate-friendly choice. And most of all, as their heavy use among the young suggests, zipping through a city on an e-scooter is just plain fun. But safety is a growing concern. Collisions with both cars and pedestrians have sent thousands of e-scooter users and their unwitting victims to hospitals; one study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control for the city of Austin, Texas found roughly 20 injuries per 100,000 rides, with half of those considered serious. Scooters have also been implicated in deaths in Paris, London, San Diego, Singapore, and Barcelona, among other cities. On August 9, following four fatalities within three months, Atlanta banned their use at night. A few days later, a French organization representing 60 or so citizens injured in e-scooter collisions announced plans to sue the Paris authorities for negligence in protecting pedestrians. With an estimated 20,000 trotinettes on its streets–many of them ridden on sidewalks, abandoned in heaps in city squares, or tossed into the Seine–it’s no wonder that Paris’s situation was described as “anarchy” earlier this summer by its once e-scooter friendly mayor Anne Hidalgo. But with regulations varying from country to country, and even city to city, and with an ever growing number of companies placing as many devices as they can in as many cities as possible (Madrid alone has authorized 18 different operators) in an attempt to achieve market dominance, the chaos–and the risks–seem to be growing.  At least one solution to this Wild West situation is better infrastructure, say advocates. In a safety report it released in April, the California-based e-scooter company Bird, with a presence in over 100 cities from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv, noted that it sends helmets to users who request them, but called on the cities themselves to “design for safety.” Bike lanes and similar infrastructure investments, the report stated, “effectively reduce crash risk for all road users.” Maxim Romain, the CEO and co-founder of the Amsterdam-based e-scooter company Dott, agrees. “We work closely with the municipality to invest in infrastructure,” he says of the Dutch company, which currently operates in Belgium, France, and Italy, but hopes to expand to its home country as well. “Like everybody else, at first we put ours on the sidewalk because that’s where we could [station them]. But now, we only deploy them in the parking spaces that each municipality advises. And we’re helping to open 2500 more parking spaces for shared e-scooters.” In places like San Francisco and London, pro-e-scooter groups have found common cause with cyclists. In July, a television presenter died when the electric scooter she owned collided with a truck at the same south London roundabout where a cyclist was killed in 2018. Although the vehicles are currently banned in London, the city is reviewing their status, and recently met with representatives from Bird and Lime. Rachel White, head of policy for Sustrans, a U.K. cycling advocacy group recently told The Guardian,“Generally, another group of organizations lobbying for improved cycleways can only be a good thing.” And the popularity of the devices–as well as their risks–can alter infrastructure in a way that bikes never have: on Sunday, Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms promised in an editorial for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the city would put temporary barriers and painted lanes in place to separate e-scooters and bikes from automobile traffic.  Yet some cities with that kind of infrastructure already in place are discovering that a strong cycling culture isn’t necessarily compatible with shared e-scooters either. In Copenhagen, for example, where half of all trips to work or school are made by bike, the reception has been decidedly mixed. “Egypt had 10 plagues. Copenhagen has only one,” complained Berlingske newspaper’s culture editor Anne Sophie Hermansen, in reference to e-scooters which, she wrote “tyrannize traffic” and “look ridiculous.” On Twitter, the hashtag #løbehjulsgate–or ‘e-scootergate,’ has been popping up all summer to refer to the controversy the devices have generated.",Cyclists and E-Scooters Are Clashing in the Battle for Europe's Streets,"August 27, 2019"
442,Stepan Kravchenko and Henry Meyer / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — President Vladimir Putin showed off Russia’s latest stealth warplane to his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who’s been barred from buying a new U.S. fighter jet in a dispute with Donald Trump over the purchase of a Russian missile system. Flanked by the Russian and Turkish defense ministers, Putin and Erdogan inspected the cockpit of the fifth-generation Su-57 fighter on Tuesday at opening of the MAKS-2019 international air show outside Moscow. They also toured the Su-35 fighter, helicopter displays and an amphibious aircraft. Welcoming his “good friend” Erdogan to the air display, Putin pitched the “technical capabilities of the latest generation of the Russian Air Forces,” which he said “will open up new opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation,” according to a Kremlin transcript. When Erdogan inquired during the tour whether the Su-57 is already available to buy, a smiling Putin replied “You can buy,” the Interfax news service reported. Erdogan’s visit follows the U.S. decision last month to suspend Turkey’s ability to buy and help build the advanced F-35 stealth warplane in retaliation for defying Trump and taking delivery of a Russian S-400 air-defense system. The U.S. says the S-400 purchase is incompatible with Turkey’s role in NATO and the F-35 program because it may allow Russia to glean information about the fighter’s advanced technology. Turkey had planned to buy about 100 F-35s and will have to seek alternatives if the U.S. maintains the ban. After a crisis in relations when Turkish jets shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian border in 2015, Putin and Erdogan have strengthened economic and military ties in recent years as relations between Turkey and its NATO ally have strained. The two leaders are holding their latest talks to try to resolve disagreements over a Kremlin-backed offensive by the Syrian army against rebels in the northwestern Idlib region that risks sparking a fresh exodus of refugees to Turkey. “Turkey is our very close partner, it’s our ally,” Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Monday of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member. While he declined to say whether Putin and Erdogan would discuss new arms sales, he noted that “everything is really concentrated right there” at MAKS.",Russia Is Trying to Sell Turkey Its Own Stealthy New Fighter After U.S. Revoked Access to F-35,"August 27, 2019"
443,Jasmine Aguilera,"Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro, who initially was to reject $20 million in immediate aid funding pledged by world leaders at the G7 summit to fight fires in the Amazon rainforest, now says he’ll consider accepting aid if French President Emmanuel Macron apologizes, according to the Associated Press. According to G1, a Brazilian news site, Bolsonaro and the Brazilian government announced Monday it would reject the pledge. In a series of tweets and media interviews, Bolsonaro and a Brazilian official accused French president Emmanuel Macron of colonialism and imperialism. Bolsonaro said that the G7 leaders were trying to save the Amazon “as if we were a colony or no man’s land.” Though Bolsonaro’s chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni told reporters Monday that Bolsonaro would reject the pledge, Bolsonaro said on Tuesday that Macron would have to apologize before he’d accept the aid. When Lorenzoni said on Monday that Brazil would reject the pledge, according to G1, he added the money should be used to repair Europe instead. “Brazil is a democratic, free nation, and has never had colonialist and imperialist practices as perhaps the objective of the French Macron,” Lorenzoni told G1. Macron made subduing the Amazon fires, which have burned at a record rate in August according to Brazil’s National Space Research Institute, a leading agenda item during the G7 summit over the weekend in Biarritz, France. Tensions were already increasing between Macron and Bolsonaro before the summit, after Macron shared his thoughts on the Amazon fires on Twitter, which Bolsonaro took as criticism. Macron and Chilean president Sebastián Piñera, announced the pledge on Monday — which also included an additional $12 million from Britain and $11 million from Canada, and a reforestation plan to be outlined in September — and minutes later Bolsonaro took to Twitter to criticize the G7 leaders.

444,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"It has been 79 days since an estimated one million people took to the streets of Hong Kong to join a protest that kicked off a summer of upheaval, and the movement shows little sign of abating. The protests that gripped this semiautonomous region of China beginning on June 9 have become its longest period of unrest since the former British colony was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The current series of protests have now outlasted the Umbrella Movement of 2014, when pro-democracy demonstrators occupied part of the city’s busy financial district, camping out in colorful tents until public support petered out and police cleared the sites. The earlier movement, which demanded free elections of the city’s leader, ended without concessions and was viewed by many as a failure. But five years later, protesters say they are putting hard-learned lessons into practice toward a more sustainable approach to their activism. Indeed, the current protests have proven difficult for the government to control. What began as a march against an unpopular extradition bill, now suspended, soon snowballed into a broader movement demanding greater democratic freedoms. Instead of occupying a finite space at the city’s central core, protesters have adopted a strategy based on the concept “be water,” borrowed from martial artist and Cantonese movie legend Bruce Lee. The protests are marked by their fluidity, taking form as “pop-up” events all over the city without lingering too long in a single location. They’re largely unpredictable, often planned in real-time via encrypted social media apps. And this time around, the movement has no clear leadership, making it impossible for authorities to identify and arrest its would-be masterminds. “It’s hard to break down our movement,” says Natalie Lee, a 24-year-old protestor. “You can target an organization, but you can’t target mass citizens.” Read more: ‘We Are at the Point of No Return.’ How a Series of Protests Escalated Into an All-Out Battle for the Soul of Hong Kong Strategy isn’t the only difference between then and now. Both authorities and protesters have become much more willing to escalate their tactics, resulting in scenes of violence that seemed unimaginable five years ago. While the demonstrations have by-and-large been peaceful, confrontations between police and protesters have further inflamed tensions; one of the movement’s key demands is an independent inquiry into allegations of excessive force used by officers. Tear gas and rubber bullets, which were rarely used before, are now a normal part of the news cycle. A small faction of the protesters have taken more radical action such as attacking police, hurling bricks and homemade smoke bombs toward them and vandalizing government property. Sunday marked a major escalation, as an officer discharged a live round as a warning shot after being assaulted by protesters. Protestors say they are more desperate now after their battle five years ago achieved little. Jackie S., 23, tells TIME he has been on the frontlines during a number of stand-offs with police. “Back in 2014, I never imagined that I’d be like this,” he says, “learning how to remove metal barricades from the streets, how to put out tear gas right after it’s fired.” As Jason Buhi, a China expert who teaches law at Barry University in Orlando, Fla., observed, the protesters are “willing to get their hands dirty” this time around. “They’re willing to do what it takes in a way that wasn’t on their minds in 2014,” he says. Beijing continues to push the narrative that foreign governments are behind the unrest. Chinese state media has branded the movement as a “color revolution,” a reference to anti-authoritiarian protests that swept former Soviet states in the early 200s. And as tensions escalate, fears mount that Beijing could intervene; paramilitary police have reportedly amassed in the neighboring city of Shenzhen in recent weeks, while the People’s Liberation Army maintains a permanent troop presence in Hong Kong. As dramatic as the events of 2014 were, the possibility of Chinese armed intervention has never seemed as real as it does now.

445,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Following a weekend of escalating violence between pro-democracy demonstrators and police, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Tuesday insisted her administration has not “lost control.” While repeating much of her rhetoric from earlier press conferences, a defiant Lam said the semi-autonomous city can handle the spiraling unrest without Beijing’s forces intervening. “The [Hong Kong] SAR government still has confidence that we can ourselves handle the conflict that has occurred in society in the past two months,” the embattled Chief Executive said in response to a question about the plausibility of the People’s Liberation Army descending on the city. Her remarks come after Chinese state-run media stoked fears that Beijing’s forces could directly step in to quell the 12-week protest movement. A pointed commentary Sunday said the central government has the authority and responsibility to intervene if riots occur. Such a move would be unprecedented. Lam admitted that the use of force was “intensifying” and that the protests are “reaching a state of lawlessness.” She criticized protesters for throwing petrol bombs at police and destroying neighborhood businesses, while firmly defending policing practices, which have elicited criticism from rights groups. According to police, 21 officers were injured and 86 people, including a 12-year-old child, were arrested over the weekend. Marches held in at least three districts devolved into scenes of pitched battles by nightfall, with one officer firing a gun into the air as a warning shot. The demonstrations, which began as a backlash to an unpopular extradition bill, have since morphed into a broader movement challenging China’s sovereignty and calling for full democracy. In recent weeks, demonstrators have shut down the city’s subway trains and the international airport. When asked about why the government continues refusing to respond to the protesters’ demands, Lam made it clear that she has no intentions of capitulating, including to calls for her resignation.",Hong Kong Leader Says No Need for Beijing to Intervene in Protests Amid Escalating Violence,"August 27, 2019"

It’s an inspired choice of ink for the Chinese artist who has earned both the fury of the Chinese Communist Party and excited comparisons to Banksy. Images of the individual known to history as Tank Man flashed around the world on June 5, 1989, when the anonymous Beijing resident, clutching a shopping bag, faced down a column of advancing tanks. The night before, troops had rolled into Tiananmen Square and brutally suppressed a weeks-long, peaceful occupation by students and workers calling for political reform. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, are thought to have died. “I wanted [the Tank Man tattoo] on my right arm, the arm that I use to draw,” Badiucao (pronounced ba-doo-chow) tells TIME. “It’s a personal reminder to keep having courage with my arm, with my hand, and with my pen.” Born in China in 1986, Badiucao grew up in a society where all mention of the Tiananmen massacre is fanatically censored. He was in university in 2007, studying law, when he gathered with friends in his dormitory to watch what they thought was a Taiwanese rom com. In turned out that their copy had been doctored by activists intent on spreading awareness of the events of 1989—a few minutes into the film, the movie suddenly cut to a documentary about the massacre. “It shocked me deeply,” he says. For Badiucao, it was the moment that started his politicization. He tried to find out information about Tiananmen, but was quickly stymied. “If I can’t see the truth about the country, how can I have hope for the country?” Read More: The Tiananmen Massacre Is One of China’s Most Censored Topics.

Badiucao comes from a family of artists — his grandfather and his great uncle were filmmakers in China during the 1930s and 1940s. As the political situation deteriorated in China in the 1950s, they both considered moving to Hong Kong or Taiwan, but ultimately decided to stay in their homeland. It’s a decision they paid for with their lives; both were persecuted and killed in an anti-intellectual crackdown, leaving Badiucao’s father orphaned as a young child.","'This Is a Fight.'

447,Justin Worland,"For years, leaders in the fight against climate change have sought to use international trade as a weapon, pushing world leaders to penalize countries that aren’t stemming warming emissions by restricting trade with them on the global market. But for the most part, the measures have gained little traction. Last week, that changed. As tens of thousands of fires engulfed the Amazon, the European Union threatened to block a landmark trade deal with Brazil and ban imports of Brazilian beef if the country’s right-wing leader, Jair Bolsonaro, didn’t act. Within days of the threat, and as G-7 leaders prepared to discuss the matter in France, Bolsonaro buckled, abandoning his passive approach to the crisis and sending more than 40,000 troops to fight the fires. The trade fight over the Amazon represents a little noticed, but important development in the fight against climate change. As countries diverge in their efforts to combat climate change, with some expending significant resources and others ignoring the issue, policymakers are increasingly looking to use trade rules to push others to act and to promote their own low-carbon products. And in an ironic and unexpected turn of events, it appears that despite taking the U.S out of the international effort to combat climate change, President Trump’s destruction of trade norms may have cleared the way for a powerful new weapon in the fight as countries increasingly crack down on rogue climate counterparts. “Previously politicians didn’t want to reach for those kinds of weapons, but we’re in the Wild West now,” says Aaron Cosbey, a researcher at the International Institute for Sustainable Development who studies the link between climate change and trade. “Trade has powerful potential.” The new trade threats stem from fires in the Amazon rainforest set by farmers looking to increase the land available for agriculture. Brazil’s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has identified more than 70,000 fires this year and says the number of fires so far this represents a nearly 80% increase over the same period in 2018. The destruction of the Amazon not only threatens to destroy biodiversity and affect the lives of indigenous people but also to rapidly accelerate climate change. The Amazon absorbs carbon dioxide that would otherwise trap heat in the atmosphere. Burning trees releases the heat-trapping gas.

448,"Jennifer Jacobs, Josh Wingrove and Jonathan Levin / Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump said he doesn’t expect to make money if the U.S. hosts next year’s Group of Seven summit at his Trump Doral golf resort, even as he delivered an extended sales pitch to hold the meeting at his Miami property. “Each country can have their own villa, or their own bungalow” if the meeting is at Doral, Trump said Monday at the end of the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France. The U.S. is next in the rotation to host the annual meeting of world leaders, which will occur in the middle of the 2020 presidential campaign. “I don’t want to make any money,” said Trump. Earlier in the day, Trump ticked off advantages of holding a global summit in the Sunshine State of Florida. “It’s very big,” and it’s Miami, “so it’s a great area.” He told German Chancellor Angela Merkel, sitting next to him, that she’d have just a three-minute helicopter ride from the airport to the site. “People are really liking it,” Trump said. The president already has run afoul of ethics experts and faced multiple lawsuits over his continued involvement with some of his private business holdings, such as the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Locating a global summit on one of his properties would open him up to a slew of new allegations that he’s mixing his private financial gain with his public position as commander-in-chief. The Trump Organization has donated profit from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury, part of a bid to counter criticism that Trump may be violating the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clauses by accepting payments from foreign governments. Still, Doral would benefit in other ways from hosting a summit of world leaders. The resort would get free publicity that could boost future profit. The president placed his business holdings in a revocable trust that lets him continue to profit from his company’s activities. His sons Eric and Donald Jr. run the Trump Organization. Democrats and watchdog groups have repeatedly criticized Trump for maintaining his business while in public office.",'Each Country Can Have Their Own Villa.'

449,Zoe Sullivan,"On the afternoon of Aug. 19, the sky over São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, went dark. A cold front combined with ash from forest fires in the Amazon rainforest and formed ominous clouds that blocked out the sun. Photos of the blackened sky began to pop on Twitter, and soon the world was paying attention to the blazes rampaging across the forest called “the lungs of the world.” Many blame President Jair Bolsonaro’s rhetoric as the central factor in the crisis. Less obvious are the ways the conflagration stems from years of slashing government budgets for the environment and dismantling support for indigenous and traditional subsistence communities. For example, Bolsonaro’s predecessor, Michel Temer, reorganized the government and wielded his budget scissors liberally. Temer downgraded a ministry focused on supporting sustainable family farms and chopped funds for environmental protections and science. In 2017, Temer cut the federal science budget by 44% and took nearly the same amount from the discretionary budget of IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental agency. In April 2019, Bolsonaro continued the trend, cutting IBAMA’s budget by 24%. Those cuts left the agency unable to cover its fixed costs and left it without resources for patrolling and enforcement. A spokesperson for IBAMA says that its budget has been reinstated to what it was prior to the April cuts. Nonetheless, thus far in 2019, IBAMA has issued only one third of the fines it did over the same period last year, according to Folha de São Paulo, one of Brazil’s largest newspapers. The drop is likely a result of both a lack of funding and political will. Earlier this year, Bolsonaro had IBAMA fire an agent, who happened to have fined Bolsonaro years ago for illegal fishing. In a similar vein, after the Brazilian space agency, called INPE, released new satellite data showing a 278% increase in deforestation in July compared to the same period last year, Bolsonaro fired the agency’s head, suggesting that the data were trumped up in order to tarnish the country’s image. Brazil’s strong agriculture sector has ratcheted up pressure on forests. Agriculture has been the strongest performing sector of Brazil’s economy in recent years, and the US-China trade war has positioned Brazil well to replace the US as the global leader in soybean exports. The demand for soybeans has created pressure to rapidly clear forests and plant. Jair Bolsonaro’s oldest son, Flávio Bolsonaro, a senator, has introduced a bill that would eliminate a requirement that rural properties in the Amazon maintain 80% of their native vegetation. Meanwhile, the president has regularly challenged criticism about his government’s environmental policies in a way some see as condoning deforestation. “The Amazon is ours,” Bolsonaro told journalists in mid-July. “We preserve more [rainforest] than anyone. No country in the world has the moral right to talk about the Amazon. You destroyed your own ecosystems.” Fabiano Lopez da Silva, head of Fundação Vitoria Amazonica, an environmental non-governmental organization based in Manaús, says such rhetoric stimulates illegal deforestation. “[Farmers and illegal loggers] can go forward with illegal fires. There won’t be any sort of [fiscal enforcement] or monitoring or fines for this kind of activity,” says Lopez da Silva. There are indications that these latest fires may have at least in part been the result of political acts. According to the Folha do Progresso, a publication from the southern part of the Amazonian state of Pará, farmers and ranchers in the region organized what they called “a day of fire” for Aug. 10, where they would set forests aflame to clear land for pasture and planting. Their goal, according to the outlet, was to show Bolsonaro they wanted to work, and burning down trees was the way to do that. In the following 48 hours, forest fires spread rapidly in the region. The New York Times reports that farmers set the bulk of these fires, but that they targeted land already cleared for agriculture, not old-growth forest.",The Real Reason the Amazon Is On Fire,"August 26, 2019"

The giant sheet of rock — around 58 square miles — is the result of an underwater volcanic eruption near the Pacific archipelago of Tonga two weeks ago, Australia’s ABC News reports. “We’re going to have millions of individual corals and lots of other organisms all coming in together with the potential of finding new homes along our coastline,” Queensland University of Technology geologist Associate Professor Scott Bryan said. Barnacles, corals, crabs and snails are among the organisms Bryan said will hitch a ride on the pumice “raft” when it washes up along Australia’s coastline in less than a year. “[The raft] is a natural mechanism for species to colonize, restock and grow in a new environment,” he added. The world’s largest coral reef, home to a variety of marine life, has come under the threat as a result of climate change in recent years. Warming temperatures have created a coral bleaching effect that causes the marine invertebrates to lose their color and eventually die. According to a study published in April, baby coral in the 1,400-mile-long reef have declined by 89% due to mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017. Given the likelihood of more bleaching events as sea temperatures continue to increase, scientists are skeptical of recovery. Coral reefs play a key role in marine ecosystems, providing a habitat for fish and serving as protection against storms and extreme weather events. The “raft” phenomenon is not new. A giant floating island of pumice was similarly created in 2006 when an underwater eruption, also in Tonga, led to upwards of 80 different species of marine life finding a home on the drifting rock, and again in 2012 when a previously dormant volcano in the Pacific erupted over two days.

451,Hillary Leung,"Banksy’s mural depicting a worker chipping away at a star on the flag of the European Union has disappeared from the side of a building in a coastal English town, CNN reports. The artwork, symbolizing the U.K.’s impending exit from the E.U., had become a tourist landmark in the southeastern port city of Dover, which connects the U.K. with mainland Europe. The mural was painted in May 2017, a month before a general election at which Brexit-related discussions took center stage. According to a resident, a scaffolding platform was pitched next to the building Saturday and the mural was gone the next day. “Just glad I captured this original @banksy artwork before it was painted over — think it’s unfair that someone decides to ruin another’s piece of art,” wrote one Instagram user, posting a dated picture of the mural. “Why??? I can’t understand why they’ve whitewashed this masterpiece, it’s an absolutely tragedy,” another user on Facebook wrote. The mural has been confirmed, as per the secretive artist’s Instagram page, to be his genuine work. Known for his politically charged art, the elusive graffitist has left his mark at hundreds of locations around the world, his creative satire touching on issues including the European migrant crisis and Israel-Palestine relations. The family that owned the property on which the mural was painted said shortly after the work was erected that they were looking at options to sell the artwork to a London gallery, with proceeds to go to charity.

452,Arys Aditya and Tassia Sipahutar / Bloomberg,"Indonesia will build a new capital city on the island of Borneo, home to some of the world’s biggest coal reserves and and orangutan habitats, as President Joko Widodo seeks to ease pressure on congested and sinking Jakarta. The new administrative headquarters will be built between North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara in East Kalimantan, Jokowi, as the president is commonly known, told reporters in Jakarta on Monday. The relocation of the capital, some 1,400 kilometers away from Jakarta, will help spread economic activity outside the nation’s most-populous island of Java, the president has said. Jokowi has displayed an urgency not shown by his predecessors in pressing on with the capital relocation plan, which has been periodically discussed for decades. With the greater Jakarta area, home to about 30 million people, nearing a gridlock and pollution levels reaching unhealthy levels, efforts to decongest the city have made little progress with tens of thousands of cars getting added to the roads every year. With more than 15,000 people per square kilometer in Jakarta– twice the density of Singapore — there’s little space to build more without rehousing thousands of families. To make matters worse, two-fifths of the city is below sea level and parts of it are sinking at 20 centimeters a year. Jakarta’s miserable traffic is a result of the city’s overwhelming importance in the nation’s economy. The metropolitan area generates almost a fifth of Indonesia’s annual gross domestic product. Gridlocks and public transport woes cost the city about 100 trillion rupiah ($7 billion) a year in economic losses, according to official estimates. The cost of moving the capital is estimated at 466 trillion rupiah if it involved development of 40,000 hectares of land for an estimated 1.5 million residents, according to Planning Ministry estimates. The cost could be whittled down to 323 trillion rupiah if only part of the state apparatus was shifted to an area of 30,000 hectares, it said in April. Jokowi has argued shifting the capital will help address income disparity in the archipelago of more than 17,000 islands. While Java accounts for almost 60% of Indonesia’s population and contributes about 58% of its gross domestic product, Kalimantan accounts for 5.8% of the population and contributes 8.2% of GDP. With Jokowi pitching the new capital as a symbol of Indonesian identity and progress, the project will be a significant part of his legacy. Authorities have talked about building a modern, smart and green city which can serve as the capital for a century.",Indonesia Plans to Move Its Capital to the Island of Borneo,"August 26, 2019"
453,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"In the wake of violent clashes in Hong Kong on Sunday, during which a live gunshot was fired for the first time since protests began in early June, Chinese state media used its harshest rhetoric yet to condemn the unrest and warned that Beijing could soon intervene. The 12th straight weekend of protests in the semiautonomous enclave took a dangerous turn when police deployed water cannons and one officer fired a gun into the air to disperse protesters, who hurled bricks and petrol bombs at officers in the New Territories district of Tsuen Wan. The Hong Kong government confirmed that six police officers drew their pistols to fend off protesters attacking them, with one of the officers firing a warning shot into the air. At a press conference on Monday, the police force justified the warning shot, saying their “officers’ lives were in great danger” and that their use of force was “necessary and reasonable.” The use of live ammunition is extremely rare in Hong Kong. Following the clashes, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency published a commentary asserting that Beijing has the authority and the responsibility to step in and quell the unrest. “If riots happen, the central government has to intervene,” Xinhua said, drawing on historic comments from China’s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. The commentary also called the protests a “color revolution” aimed at overturning the government. Chinese government officials have in previous weeks said that the protests have the characteristics of a “color revolution,” a reference to pro-democratic uprisings in former Soviet states and the Balkans throughout the early 2000s. This weekend’s return to violence followed a peaceful march the previous Sunday which organizers say 1.7 million people attended. On Friday, protesters formed a human chain across the city in a nod to a 1989 protest in the Baltic states against Soviet Union rule.

454,Joseph Hincks,"President Donald Trump’s tweeted claim on Aug. 20 that American Jews who vote for Democrats show “great disloyalty” provoked disgust and dismay among many Jewish commenters in the U.S. and Israel, who accused him of invoking a centuries old anti-Semitic trope. Trump’s tweet came just days after he urged Israel to prevent Democratic Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar from visiting the country, claiming the progressive lawmakers hate Israel and “all Jewish people.” On Aug. 21 he doubled down on his assertion that voting for Democrats was disloyal to “Jewish people and … very disloyal to Israel,” in a speech to reporters that also made reference to a right-wing conspiracy theorist’s description of Trump’s being beloved to Israelis “like he’s the King of Israel” or the “second coming of God.” Questions of loyalty have a long history as an anti-Semitic trope, having for hundreds of years dogged Jewish diaspora communities and foregrounded political persecution in Europe. In the U.S., similar claims of dual loyalty provided a pretext for dismissal of Jewish-American leaders’ calls for earlier intervention in the Second World War, which some isolationists saw as principally a “Jewish cause.” And as recently as March this year, senior Democrats rebuked Omar over comments many saw as an invocation of the dual-loyalty trope. In his book, We Stand Divided: The Rift Between American Jews and Israel, on sale Sept. 10, American-born Israeli writer Daniel Gordis explores the roots of the complex relationship between the state of Israel and American Jews. In a conversation with TIME—edited for length and clarity—in the wake of Trump’s remarks, Gordis discussed how the President has further complicated that already fraught relationship and why his use of Israel as an election wedge is so dangerous. TIME: Let’s start with President Trump’s use of the word “disloyal” in reference to American Jews who vote Democrat. Why is that term so loaded? GORDIS: Since early modernity, Jews have faced the challenge of seemingly being accepted in the societies in which they live, but at the same time being suspected of being not entirely of those societies. The greatest example of that is of course Germany at the beginning of the 20th century, where Jews were doing very well; they were welcomed into some of the professions and making their way in academia. But underneath the surface there was always this question of, ‘Are the Jews really German? Can you really be a German, or a Frenchman, or what have you, if you’re a Jew?’ And of course, in Europe, that exploded in the early 20th century, and then with the Third Reich went beyond anything anybody had imagined. So for Jews this notion of dual loyalty has always been a red flag. How different were the circumstances faced by Jewish people who emigrated to the U.S. in the early 20th century, in terms of this notion of dual loyalty? It seemed that America was going to be the exception to the longstanding issue. But it was never quite that simple. Woodrow Wilson said—not just to Jews but to millions of immigrants making their way to America—that you can’t have any other nationalist loyalties and still be really American. On the surface, of course, there’s nothing problematic about that: here’s a President welcoming immigrants. But he’s saying if you want to be in, we want you all in. [Then] comes the Balfour declaration [of British support for a Jewish state], and that puts American Jews in an exceedingly difficult position. The way American Jews chose to manage the tricky road, between the declaration of a Jewish State on the one hand and their loyalty to America on the other, was a kind of soft-pedal Zionism. They gave money and made other contributions but they were not the enthusiastic embracers of Zionism many Jews in Eastern Europe became. It appeared that this worked. It seemed for a long time that Jews in America were really an exceptional diaspora community, in the sense that their situation was an exception to the hundreds-of-years-old pattern.","How Trump Fits Into the Long, Fraught History of the Relationship Between Israel and American Jews","August 24, 2019"
455,Sanya Mansoor,"With tensions over trade with China escalating, President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is “ordering” the U.S. postal service and express shipping companies to “SEARCH FOR & REFUSE all deliveries of fentanyl,” a deadly synthetic opioid. American officials have long blamed China for the influx of fentanyl and related drugs reaching U.S. borders — sent directly and trafficked via other countries — while federal efforts to limit (if not stop outright) their import have long been underway. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin, and proving increasingly popular with American drug users. While the rate of overdose deaths from heroin has plateaued in recent years, the rate of overdose deaths related to synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, has been increasing — by 45 percent between 2016 and 2017 (from 6.2 to 9 deaths per 100,000 people). About 28,400 people died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As part of a wide-ranging deal between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping last December, China had reportedly pledged to designate fentanyl and similar drugs as controlled substances, subjecting those who sell them to harsh punishments and potentially slowing their flow into the U.S. Trump said Jinping had told him that China did not have a drug problem, because it could (and does) use the death penalty to punish drug dealers. Trump has since argued that China has not held up its end of the bargain. On Friday, China’s narcotics regulator said the U.S. is politicizing the issue of Chinese fentanyl exports and “up-ending the facts for their own political necessities,” Bloomberg reported. Congress and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the main federal agency dealing with preventing contraband from entering the country, have been working to crack down on drug trafficking through the mail for years. But it hasn’t been easy. A nearly yearlong bipartisan Congressional investigation, as detailed in a January 2018 report from Sens. Tom Carper (D-DE) and Rob Portman (R-OH), found that Chinese fentanyl sellers “operate openly on the Internet.” These sellers’ “preferred method of shipping is the U.S. Postal Service because the risk of seizure by Customs & Border Protection (CPB) is small and delivery is basically guaranteed.” The investigation discovered hundreds of online drug transactions and linked online sellers in China to seven synthetic opioid-related deaths in the U.S. Part of the STOP (Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention) Act, legislation passed in 2018 to help combat the opioid crisis in the United States, mandates that the USPS collects information on all mail sent from China, including details on the sender and the package’s contents. A USPS spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the agency is “aggressively working” towards keeping dangerous drugs from entering the U.S. from China and other countries.

456,Julia Webster,"The latest attempt by the British government to tackle a rise in knife attacks among young people has been widely criticized as ineffective and racially-insensitive. The U.K. Home Office — the government department responsible for security and law enforcement — launched a campaign earlier this month that saw takeout boxes distributed to fried chicken fast food restaurants branded with “#KnifeFree” slogans in an effort to dissuade young people from carrying weapons. The effort has been viewed by many, however, as perpetuating negative stereotypes of minority British and immigrant communities: that they are disproportionately caught up in violence, and that they primarily eat junk food.  “We are rolling out our #KnifeFree chicken boxes in over 210 chicken shops in England and Wales,” the Home Office tweeted on Aug. 14: “They use real life stories to show people how they can go #KnifeFree.” Kit Malthouse, a top government official in charge of crime, said: “These chicken boxes will bring home to thousands of young people the tragic consequences of carrying a knife and challenge the idea that it makes you safer.” According to British newspaper the Guardian, the government spent more than £57,000 ($69,000) on distributing the 321,000 chicken boxes. The managing director of Morley’s, one of the chicken shop chains involved in the rollout, told the BBC he was “proud” of the initiative. But the reaction from many other Brits much less positive, with words like “offensive”, “racist” and “stupid” used to describe the campaign. “Is this some kind of joke?!” David Lammy, a Labour Member of Parliament from London, said in a tweet. “Why have you chosen chicken shops? What’s next, #KnifeFree watermelons?” He later told the Guardian: “Boris Johnson has already called black people ‘piccaninnies with watermelon smiles’. Now his government is pushing the stereotype that black people love fried chicken. This ridiculous stunt is either explicitly racist or, at best, unfathomably stupid.” Diane Abbott, the Labour party’s top advocate on security and the country’s first black woman to become a Member of Parliament, also criticized the “crude, offensive” campaign, tweeting that Johnson’s government “would do better to invest in our communities [than] demonize them.”","'Racist, or, at Best, Unfathomably Stupid.'

457,Joshua Gallu / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump said he’s raising tariffs further on Chinese imports in response to Beijing’s retaliation earlier in the day, deepening the impasse over the two nations’ trade policies. Duties on $250 billion of imports already in effect will rise to 30% from 25% on Oct. 1, Trump said in a series of tweets Friday after U.S. markets closed. He also said that the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports will be taxed at 15% instead of 10% starting Sept. 1. Friday’s events marked a dramatic escalation in tensions between the U.S. and China after months of failed talks to resolve their trade dispute. It’s unclear whether negotiators will follow through with a plan to meet in Washington next month as relations have continued to sour. “China should not have put new Tariffs on 75 BILLION DOLLARS of United States product (politically motivated!),” Trump said on Twitter.   Trump’s announcement came after China earlier Friday threatened to impose additional tariffs on $75 billion in American goods, including soybeans, cars and oil. The president followed that move with a series of angry tweets in which he said he “hereby ordered” American companies to start looking for alternatives to making products in China, although it’s not clear what authority the president has to issue such an order. The news from Beijing rekindled concerns about the world’s two largest economies and a global growth outlook that’s already looking shaky. After Trump’s tweets, U.S. stocks dropped — the S&P 500 Index closed 2.6% down on the day. China’s newest tariffs came earlier Friday in retaliation for Trump’s latest planned levies on Chinese imports, which have pushed U.S. stocks and commodities lower. The move takes aim at the heart of Trump’s political support — factories and farms across the Midwest and South at a time when the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing.","'In the Spirit of Achieving Fair Trade,' Trump Raises Tariffs on Hundreds of Billions of Chinese Imports","August 23, 2019"
458,Tara Law,"On Friday, an unusual kind of vessel set sail from the Arctic city of Murmansk, Russia, for a destination in the country’s far east––a floating nuclear power plant equipped with two reactors. The vessel, dubbed the Akademik Lomonosov, is set to travel about 2,900 miles to the Arctic port town of Pevek, which has a population of about 4,000 people, where it will be loaded with nuclear fuel and put in place to provide power to the region, according to Russia’s state nuclear corporation, ROSATOM. Russia’s far east may just be the beginning. ROSATOM has said that it’s in talks with potential customers for the floating power unit, and sees “significant market potential” in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa. The vessel’s reactors can generate 70 megawatts of electric power and 50 gigacalories an hour of heat energy, according to ROSATOM––enough to support a city of up to 100,00 people. However, the vessel has sparked concerns about safety as a result of Russia’s tarnished nuclear record. Just this summer, there were two deadly accidents involving Russian nuclear power. On July 1, 14 sailors were killed in a fire on the secretive Losharik nuclear submarine; then on Aug. 8, five scientists were killed when a missile test on Russia’s White Sea failed. The Kursk nuclear submarine sank on the Barents Sea on Aug. 12, 2000, killing 118 people on board, and scientists have recent found that an nuclear sub that sank in the Barents Sea, the Komsomolets––which was lost in 1989––is emitting high levels of radiation. Then there’s Chernobyl, the 1986 nuclear power station meltdown in the former Soviet Union that is perhaps the biggest and most famous civil nuclear disaster in history. It exposed potentially hundreds of thousands of people to radiation. A high-profile HBO series, Chernobyl, has renewed attention on the devastating consequences of a nuclear accident––and the potential of political machinations that can get in the way of public safety. Environmental activist group Greenpeace has publicly raised concerns about the Russian nuclear power vessel. In an April blog post titled, “The next Chernobyl may happen in the Arctic,” Konstantin Fomin of Greenpeace called for the program to be brought to a halt.","After a String of Nuclear Incidents, Russia Just Launched a Floating Nuclear Power Plant.

459,Mahita Gajanan,"The Amazon rain forest is burning — news that prompted shock and fear across the world as Brazil’s space research agency reported this week that a record number of fires have broken out in the forest this year. Online, hashtags urged people to pray for the Amazon and to spread awareness of the fires. By Thursday, French president Emmanuel Macron had called discussions of the “international crisis” to be at the top of the agenda at the upcoming G7 Summit in France. The Amazon is a significant carbon reserve that affects the way heat is dispersed around the world, Deborah Lawrence, an environmental sciences professor at the University of Virginia, tells TIME. In Brazil, the country that is home to the majority of the rain forest, president Jail Bolsonaro campaigned on a platform of opening up access to the country’s protected lands for commercial use, and has — controversially — followed through during his time in office. Efforts to fight for the forest’s preservation can have bloody consequences; one 2018 report found that the country was the deadliest in the world for environmental conservationists. Images of smoke filling skies in Brazil and reports that the fires are spreading in particularly vulnerable areas of the Amazon have led to a sense of helplessness for many of those watching. Perhaps compounding those feelings is the knowledge that the destruction of the Amazon, and the issues of deforestation and fires in the rain forest, are not new. The Amazon has burned before, and yet the problem endures. The burning Amazon was featured on the cover of TIME in 1989, with an accompanying piece detailing the impact of fires that were set by farmers and cattle ranchers as part of an annual ritual to clear land for crops and livestock. The fires in the forest now are also man-made, and deforestation can bring on other factors that can lead to them spreading faster, according to Lawrence. “When you put a fire near a forest, the edges get some of that heat,” she says. “They experience the fire to a modest degree, which makes them susceptible to future fires.” TIME warned back then of the risks to the Amazon’s indigenous inhabitants, as well as various plant and animal species, if the Amazon were lost or significantly damaged: Today, those risks remain unchanged — but the climate change that TIME in the 1980s warned might be possible has already come to pass, and the damage it causes is starkly plain. July 2019 was the hottest month ever recorded on Earth, amid a trend of skyrocketing temperatures and heatwaves across the globe that are directly linked to climate change. The Arctic has seen a surge in wildfires, including in Alaska, Greenland and Siberia.",Environmentalists Have Been Warning About Amazon Fires for Decades.

460,Shahnaz Bashir,"As I write this piece for TIME, I’m standing furtively amid a clump of tall, itchy weeds behind an office in the outskirts of Jammu, a city in northern India. Dozens of mosquitoes are landing on my arms, neck and feet to enjoy an evening meal of blood. I can occasionally squirm my body and scratch here and there, but cannot afford to lose touch with my phone.  In the last three weeks, this is the only place I have been able to access a broadband connection and connect to the world outside.  A day earlier, I drove nearly 200 miles to get here from my home in Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan territory. I needed to call my worried relatives and friends outside Kashmir and tell them that I am OK, for now. Just as I reached Jammu I had the exact feeling of a prisoner being released from jail, but only for a limited time. As I entered the 6-mile Chenani-Nashri tunnel, inaugurated two years ago by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, my phone buzzed with a torrent of messages and emails. I paused outside the tunnel exit to call family and friends; they all picked up instantly, concerned and surprised, wondering how I had managed to reach them. Seeing a Kashmiri phone number appear on a screen outside had become something of a miracle. In early August, a scanned copy of the government order asking tourists and pilgrims to leave Kashmir went viral on social media; immediately petrol pumps and grocery stores were hollowed out. Some initially mocked the hordes of people lining up outside ATMS and shops in Srinagar, the summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. But as night fell on Aug. 4, they realized they had been foolish. Phone lines and Internet connections were snapped off in the middle of the night and the next morning the sun-beaten streets of Srinagar became deserted. The only thing people inside their homes were left with was a few news channels broadcasting a live motion of the parliament session in India in which, despite some bickering from the opposition, the ruling BJP government unilaterally scrapped Article 370, which had granted Kashmiris the constitutional rights to some autonomy for the past decades. At around 11 a.m on Aug. 5, boys at the shrine of saint Taj-u-Din Wali in Natipora began to block the main road with iron poles, stones and burning tires. The battle-geared police officer stationed with his men at the Natipora crossway beckoned at the boys, asking to speak to them. The stone-pelting stopped and the police urged the masked boys to stop throwing stones at them and instead suggested they organize peaceful protests. A long line of laborers from the east Indian state of Bihar passed by the boys, carrying worn-out, heavy backpacks and large duffel bags. Some angry young kids shouted at them to leave, and an elderly man from the neighborhood, a local grocer, stepped between the boys and the Biharis and scolded the kids for shouting at them.  By the evening of Aug. 5, reports confirming the repeal of Article 370 flashed on the TV screens. From there, Kashmir became a kind of jail. From 20 pages, the local newspapers came down to four pages with, now, two complete pages filled with announcements of canceled wedding functions. Cellphones idled away with no service available. The city grew spooky with whiskered soldiers and glinting razor-wire. The worst was, and continues to be, the blackout of communications. People whose relatives had gone for the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia were listless and worried.  Srinagar Airport was the only place to book emergency flights. Deserted counters of various airlines could only give you the cost of tickets and flight schedules but you could not book them. You had to be there with your baggage, on schedule, and then see if the flight had enough passengers to confirm your journey too. At 4 p.m. on Aug. 10, through a hole in the glass wall of an airline counter, a father was trying to ask a busy officer if he had any information about a 2 p.m. flight that his son was meant to arrive on; he hadn’t made it home and neither the father nor the airline knew why. A local news channel began to run messages of people disconnected from their relatives. A husband from Pulwama, admitted to a hospital in Chandigarh, a city elsewhere in northern India, for kidney failure, had a message for his wife stranded in Kashmir. He wanted to tell her that he had booked an early-morning flight for her. Through recorded audio-visual messages, some students studying outside of Kashmir, conveyed that they didn’t want their relatives in the valley to worry about them. They wanted to desperately inform them that they had somehow managed to borrow money from somebody and paid their college fees.","The Indian Government Insists All Is Well in Kashmir.

461,Julia Webster,"The last day of the 45th annual Group of 7 Summit, or G7 for short, featured France trying to de-escalate tensions between the United States and Iran, discussions of the U.S.-China trade war, and a new initiative to fight fires in the Amazon. For three days, U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders from the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Italy, Germany and Japan, as well as top European Union officials, have been meeting in the French seaside town of Biarritz to discuss global challenges involving foreign policy, the economy and the environment. The aim of the annual meeting between top world economies is to shape their responses to urgent global challenges. On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron called on the United States and Iran to begin talks for a new nuclear agreement. President Trump also called for Russia to re-join the G7, and said in a press conference that “it would be better to have Russia inside the tent than outside the tent.” Russia was removed from the group, then called the G8, following its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Trump also floated the idea of holding the next G7, which U.S. is set to host, at the Trump National Doral Miami Golf Resort in Florida. Here’s what else you need to know about the G7, which brought together leaders from some of the most powerful economies in the world. Prior to the summit, there were signs that President Trump’s attendance at the summit could be fraught. At last year’s summit in Quebec, Donald Trump clashed with other world leaders, highlighting differences between the U.S. and the rest of G7 members. Trump created even more tension last year by leaving early ahead of climate change talks and refusing to sign the final communiqué, an agreement statement signed by the heads of state. To avoid another dispute, French President Emmanuel Macron said this year’s meeting would end without a communiqué, abandoning a tradition held since the G7 meetings began in 1975. This year, there were also doubts that he would attend at all after he failed to confirm his attendance in a meeting with French President Macron in June.",G7 Ends With Whispers of a U.S.-Iran Meeting.

462,Evan Mawarire,"Imagine coming home and finding your entire house ransacked, your valuables stolen and your children tied to poles, their backs bleeding from being whipped with a sjambok. The sight rips your soul out and makes you want to find whoever did this to your loved ones and ensure they face justice.  You go and report the matter to the police and the greatest horror greets you. The ones manning the police station are putting on your stolen clothes and sipping tea out of your prized china. Rage fills you as you realize that it was they who violated you and your loved ones. Immediately you launch into a demand for your property, you call out their injustice and demand compensation. Then it happens without warning or shame. The whip cuts across your face and as you cover it in pain, the black boot of the senior cop smashes into your gut. You fall to the ground helpless, unable to scream out in pain or for help. The reality is that you have been robbed by those charged with protecting you — and now they will rob you of your voice too.  It’s August 2019, and there is no doubt about the unbearable magnitude of the economic hardships that ordinary Zimbabweans are facing: no electricity for 19 hours a day, crippling fuel shortages, the rising cost of living and runaway inflation. Basic commodity goods and services such as bread, water and public transport are no longer affordable to ordinary people. These endless struggles put even more pressure on Zimbabweans whose money was lifted directly from their bank accounts by the authorities and replaced with electronic money, which has now lost most of its value.  The attempt to protest against these painful hardships by ordinary people, who have suffered from years of political and economic misrule, has invited yet another season of police brutality. There are countless beatings of civilians, mass arbitrary detentions and more human rights violations.  The main opposition MDC Alliance recently called on all Zimbabweans to march peacefully and petition the government on the deteriorating economic situation. The first of those marches, slated for Aug. 16, was banned by the police — in clear violation of our constitution which guarantees us the right to protest peacefully and petition our government for whatever grievances we might have.  Despite the ban, Zimbabweans decided to exercise their constitutional right regardless – and were met with a display of disproportionate and excessive force by the police. The internet and newswires were awash with pictures and videos of citizens sitting on the ground being bludgeoned with batons and whipped by police officers. Women and the elderly were hit with blows to every part of the body from riot police.  Days before these scenes of brutality, civic society leaders were abducted, interrogated and tortured. Dumped and left for dead, the oozing welts all over their bodies, chemical burns and broken legs told a story of a ruthless regime determined to silence any criticism. This week, one of our best-known comedians, Samantha Kureya, went into hiding after being abducted from her home, beaten, stripped and made to drink sewage. We have called for peaceful protests in the so-called “new dispensation” of President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration, and without fail they have all ended up in bloodshed, brutalized bodies, mass incarcerations and threats of death. There is no political will whatsoever in this government to allow Zimbabweans to exercise their basic freedoms, such as freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Every avenue of protest has effectively been criminalised and once again just as Robert Mugabe did, there is an attempt to abduct, torture and criminalize dissenters.",Violence in Zimbabwe Is Escalating.

463,Ian Bremmer,"Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned this week, bringing an end to the country’s 66th government since 1945. Italy is the Eurozone’s third-largest economy, and the two-trillion-dollar economy is fragile. No country in Europe is more indebted than Italy aside from Greece, but unlike Greece, the Italian economy is far too big to bailout should it come to that. (It makes up 11.2 percent of the E.U.’s total economy, and would be more if and when the U.K. gets on with Brexit.) If Italy goes under, it could prompt another major financial crisis on the European continent, one situated at the heart of Europe. That could trigger global economic chaos, just as the world economy already shows signs of slowing down. For the last 14 months, Italy has been being governed by an uneasy populist coalition between the far-right Lega party headed by Matteo Salvini and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) led by Luigi di Maio, both of whom have shown more interest in furthering their parties’ (often contradictory) policy priorities than working together to put the country on a path towards fiscal health. For Lega, that has meant pushing tax cuts and leading a culture war against the influx of migrants into the country; for M5S, it’s more welfare spending to help the country’s poorest and reforming an Italian political system that is (admittedly) in desperate need of reform. They were united by little beyond a common hatred of establishment Italian politicians and bureaucrats in Brussels. That uneasy partnership was strained further by the fact that M5S—the senior partner in the coalition—saw its popularity plummet over the last year while the firebrand Salvini waged a perpetual campaign and pushed Lega’s popularity to almost 40 percent, according to opinion polls, making him the de facto driver of the coalition despite having scores fewer members of parliament. A couple of weeks ago, Salvini saw an opportunity to collapse the government by calling for a no confidence vote; the idea was to drive the country to elections, where he could then cement his grip on power. That hasn’t played out exactly as he expected, but on Tuesday Conte—the prime minister both parties agreed to lead their coalition—resigned in frustration over Salvini’s continuous efforts to play politics rather than actually govern. Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, has already begun meeting with all the parties to see whether the current parliamentary arithmetic will allow for a new government to be formed without elections; he has given a deadline till next Tuesday. Aside from the fact that elections are inherently chaotic and costly, the timing here is critical—Italy needs to submit a draft of its 2020 budget to the E.U. in the next few months, and calling snap elections would complicate that. If no budget proposal is submitted (and then accepted by the E.U.), the country faces harsh VAT hikes that will automatically kick in by January to bring Italy in line with E.U. fiscal rules. Given how far ahead Lega is polling, remaining parties in parliament have an incentive to work together to avoid an election which will likely see them lose seats. That makes a coalition government with a backbone comprised of M5S and the center-left Partito Democratico (PD) as the most likely of all scenarios at present, and the two have already begun discussions toward that end. It won’t be easy—PD and M5S have long-hated each other, and there’s plenty of disagreement between the two parties on policy and who would take up which ministries. A tie-up between the two is also risky, as an unpopular alliance between them could strengthen Salvini in the long-run, allowing him to play the role of opposition leader that was locked out of government. Given the complexity of putting aside old feuds for the sake of current political realities, the current drama still has ways to go. Should no working majority be found, Mattarella’s last resort option to avoid elections would be installing a technocratic government to finalize the budget (avoiding the VAT hikes) and getting the country to 2020 elections. The next few days will be critical. “Letting citizens vote is the essence of democracy, but making them vote every year is irresponsible.” Conte in his resignation speech, summing up postwar Italy.",Italy’s Government Has Collapsed.

464,Julia Webster,"Heads of state are meeting on Saturday for a two-day summit in the southern French city of Biarritz. President Emmanuel Macron is this year’s host and wants the meeting to focus on fighting inequality and protecting biodiversity and climate. Here’s everything you need to know about the conference of world leaders. G7 stands for “Group of Seven” industrialized nations. It used to be known as the G8 (Group of Eight) until 2014 when Russia was excluded because of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. The G7 was created more than four decades ago as an annual gathering of political leaders to discuss and exchange ideas on a broad range of issues, including global economy, security and energy. France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany formed the Group of Six in 1975 so that the noncommunist powers could come together to discuss economic concerns, which at the time included inflation and recession following an OPEC oil embargo. Canada joined the following year. Russia eventually joined in 1998 — and its inclusion was meant as a signal of cooperation between East and West after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. The G7 is an informal bloc and takes no mandatory decisions, so the leaders’ declarations at the end of the summit are not binding. The group includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, France and Italy. Together, the G7 countries represent 40% of global GDP and 10% of the world’s population. The European Union has been involved in G7 work since 1977, and is represented at the summit by the President of the European Commission (the E.U.’s executive branch) Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. The E.U. has gradually been included in all political discussions on the agenda despite not having official member status.",What Does the G7 Stand For?,"August 23, 2019"
465,Billy Perrigo,"Britain’s new Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make his debut on the international stage this weekend, at the G7 summit of world leaders in Biarritz, France. There, Johnson will have his first chance as Prime Minister to win over – or alienate – presidents and other prime ministers who have the power to shape his time in office, and Britain’s future. President Trump, a self-declared friend of Johnson, is somebody who he will have to keep on-side during potentially divisive negotiations about a post-Brexit trade deal. And then there’s the European Union delegation, made up of Emmanuel Macron of France, Angela Merkel of Germany, and the outgoing top official Donald Tusk. So far, they have refused Johnson’s Brexit demands, and could clash over them in public at the summit. For Johnson’s domestic agenda, too, the stakes will be high: there is talk in Westminster of a potential fall general election to shore up his tiny parliamentary majority — and with U.K. politics so finely-balanced, slip-ups on the global stage could have dramatic electoral effects. Here’s what to expect of Britain’s new Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the G7. Trump and Johnson have met before, including at the U.N. general assembly in New York in 2017 when Johnson was British foreign secretary. Trump has repeatedly spoken in favor of Brexit and Johnson himself, so you would think their first meeting both as world leaders would go off without a hitch.",What to Expect of Britain's New Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the G7 Summit,"August 23, 2019"

A spokesperson for the Canadian mission confirmed the new measure in an email to TIME, but did not elaborate on its reasons or the scope of travel restrictions.  “At present, locally-engaged staff will not undertake official business travel outside of Hong Kong,” the spokesperson said. China’s foreign ministry confirmed Wednesday that an employee of the U.K. Consulate, Simon Cheng, had been detained in Shenzhen, a city bordering Hong Kong.

Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory of China, has been wracked by almost three months of antigovernment protests sparked by a proposal to allow the extradition of fugitives to the mainland.

469,Ian Bremmer,"The economic warning signs are flashing yellow. In Germany, the U.K., Italy, Brazil and Mexico, growth has stalled. In Japan, business confidence has turned negative for the first time since 2013. China’s industrial output is growing at its slowest pace in 17 years. An inverted yield curve has U.S. economists on recession watch. But the real uncertainty is coming from the biggest surge in decades of the kind of political volatility that is relevant to markets. Politically motivated trade fights are under way between countries that make up half the global economy–from the U.S. and China, to the U.S. and Europe, to South Korea and Japan. The most worrisome of these economically damaging political fights is the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing, which shows no signs of easing. President Trump wants to avoid any appearance of a climbdown in this fight. So does China’s Xi Jinping, who must also signal strength in the growing confrontation with pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. There are other sources of politically induced economic trouble. The IMF noted in July that “the projected recovery in growth between 2019 and 2020 in emerging market and developing economies relies on improved growth outcomes in stressed economies such as Argentina, Turkey, Iran, and Venezuela, and therefore is subject to significant uncertainty.” At the moment, there’s little sign of recovery in any of these four countries. In Argentina, voters have turned on President Mauricio Macri ahead of October elections. His likely successor, Alberto Fernández, may not prove as economically reckless as his choice of former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner as running mate might suggest, but he’s hardly reassuring to investors. In Ankara, embattled President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continues trying to manipulate Turkey’s economy to protect his political popularity. Iran, facing renewed U.S. sanctions, is lashing out at Europe for not helping ease its economic pain. And Venezuela’s slow-motion catastrophe continues with little hope for a breakthrough to spare its people further pain. In Asia, a bitter dispute over Japan’s colonization of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 has triggered a fight with dangerous consequences for both countries. The result is an escalating conflict between Asia’s second and fourth largest economies–at a time when the U.S.-China trade war is already weighing on both. In Europe, the political stakes rose once again on Aug. 20 as Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte abruptly announced his resignation. Market jitters continue, and expectations grow that far-right leader Matteo Salvini will lead the country’s next government. Salvini has been much more confrontational with the E.U. over questions of Italy’s budget, and even if the top job forces him to moderate his tough talk, the fear of market-moving political turmoil–inside Italy and between Italy and the E.U.–will intensify. Finally, new Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists Britain will leave the European Union by an Oct. 31 deadline with or without a deal on the future U.K.-E.U. relationship. His demands that the E.U. renegotiate the Brexit deal continue to meet strong resistance in Brussels, and indications that he might answer a no-confidence move against his government with a call for national elections after Oct. 31 have set teeth (and markets) on edge.

470,Ciara Nugent,"A fight is brewing over the lungs of the planet. Since taking office in January, Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has overseen a surge in logging in the vast Amazon rain forest–and on Aug. 15, Norway suspended a $33 million donation to a Brazilian sustainability fund because Bolsonaro had interfered in it; Germany froze its payment five days earlier. Bolsonaro responded with mockery, telling the Europeans to go “reforest Germany” instead, but what may lie ahead is no laughing matter. Under Siege Bolsonaro has delivered on campaign promises to weaken protections for the environment and indigenous communities, freeing up more land for cattle. Over 870 sq. mi. of the Amazon was cleared in July–a 278% increase from July 2018–according to satellite monitoring by Brazil’s space-research agency. Scientists say the rain forest, which helps slow climate change by absorbing massive amounts of carbon dioxide, is nearing a “tipping point” after which its ecosystems cannot recover. Green Intentions The governors of Brazilian states that contain the rain forest have vowed to bypass Bolsonaro and negotiate directly with European embassies to save the Amazon funding. But the rapid deforestation is also fueling European opposition to a long-awaited trade deal between the E.U. and a South American trade bloc of which Brazil is the largest member. The deal would need to be ratified by the E.U.’s member states and Parliament, where green parties won a significant 69 seats in May. Climate Divide Europe’s environmentalists hope their leaders will use “climate diplomacy” to force Bolsonaro to protect the Amazon. But it’s unclear if he’d listen.

471,Gina Martinez,"An Australian appeals court on Wednesday upheld the conviction of Cardinal George Pell, who was found guilty earlier this year of molesting two 13-year-old choir boys in the 1990s. And yet, Pell still retains his title in the Catholic Church. The Vatican said it is waiting for Pell to make his final appeal to the High Court, Australia’s supreme court, before launching its own investigation. It noted that Pell has always maintained his innocence. One abuse survivors’ group says the decision to hold off on discipline is “cowardly” and shows the Church hasn’t made it nearly far enough on responding to sexual abuse. Pell, Pope Francis’ former finance minister, is the highest-ranking church official to ever be convicted of child sexual abuse. He has been imprisoned since an Australian court sentenced the 78-year-old to six years in prison in March. Tim Lennon, the president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), says the church should have been decisive following Pell’s conviction and immediately defrocked him. “I don’t know what other proof any organization needs other than a conviction. Them saying ‘Well, let’s wait for the appeal,’ that’s sort of a cowardly way to approach someone who was convicted of sexual abuse and rape,” Lennon tells TIME. According to the Associated Press, Pell is no longer a member of the pope’s Council of Cardinals or a Vatican official. Massimo Faggioli, a professor of historical theology at Villanova University, a private Catholic institution, says that he believes the Vatican’s handling of the Pell case shows it made a strategic decision to allow Pell to face secular justice – –and that shows progress. Faggioli contends that Pell’s conviction has caused a divide between the conservative and liberal sides in the Church, and by not interfering the Vatican is remaining neutral. He recalls the Church’s controversial handling of Boston’s Cardinal Bernard Francis Law, who was accused of covering up child sex abuse. Law was allowed to resign in 2002 and move to Rome, where Faggioli says he was “given a safe haven in the Vatican and shielded from the American justice system.”",Catholic Priest Abuse Survivors' Group Says It's 'Cowardly' That Convicted Cardinal Has Not Been Defrocked,"August 21, 2019"
472,Mahita Gajanan,"The Amazon rainforest has seen a record number of forest fires this year, according to Brazil’s Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, a space research center. The INPE detects and tracks fires through satellites — in other words, the current blazes are large enough that, collectively, they are visible from space. The INPE said Tuesday that it has so far detected an 83% increase from the same time period in 2018, Reuters reports. It’s the highest number of fires recorded since 2013, when record-keeping began. The space research agency said satellite images have spotted 9,507 new fires since Thursday in the Amazon basin. As of Wednesday morning, 74,155 fires have been detected in Brazil, according to the INPE’s burn data, which provides daily updates of the number of fire outbreaks detected. Images show Roraima, Brazil’s northernmost state located in the Amazon, covered in smoke, Reuters reports. Neighboring Brazilian state Amazonas has declared an emergency in its southern part, while the state Acre, which borders Peru, was put on environmental alert on Aug. 16 because of the fires. Some fires have been burning for more than two weeks. The surge in fires comes amid growing concerns over Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro’s rollback of environmental protections. The INPE reports the new record just weeks after Bolsonaro fired the agency’s director over conflict regarding its data on deforestation. The BBC reports smoke from the fires caused a blackout Monday in São Paulo. The fires in the Amazon come at a time when parts of the world long considered essential in the fight against climate change are also going up in flame. Wildfires have broken out across the Arctic, including in Siberia, Greenland and Alaska, where millions of acres have been burned. Under Bolsonaro’s administration, Brazil has aimed to roll back some of its longtime policies protecting the Amazon — a massive carbon reserve essential to fighting the effects of global warming — by pulling back on efforts that combat illegal logging, ranching and mining in the rainforest, the New York Times reports. Part of Bolsonaro’s presidential campaign platform included promising to open access to Brazil’s protected lands for commercial use. Less than a year into his term, the Amazon in Brazil has lost over 1,330 square miles of forest cover, marking a 39% increase from the same time period in 2018.

473,TIME Staff,"Protesters gathered outside the British consulate in Hong Kong Wednesday evening to voice shock and dismay at the detention of a consulate staff member by mainland Chinese authorities. Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said earlier Wednesday that Simon Cheng, a 28-year-old Hong Kong citizen, was being held in the neighboring Chinese city of Shenzhen for a legal violation. Hong Kong’s government-funded broadcaster, RTHK, quoted Geng as saying “The person you mentioned has been placed in administrative detention for 15 days as a punishment” for breaking a public security law. Cheng, a trade and investment officer at the consulate, was reported missing after he failed to return from a business trip to the neighboring Chinese city of Shenzhen on Aug. 8. His girlfriend told local media that he had messaged her shortly before attempting to pass through a border control point, saying “pray for me.” On Wednesday evening, two friends of Cheng’s presented a petition to the consul-general demanding that the U.K. government “mobilize all efforts to save Simon” and “issue immediate travel warnings on Hong Kong.” One of the friends, Max Cheung, called on U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson to “act now or never” and said the U.K. had “fallen short” in its duty to protect Cheng. Cheung claims that his friend was detained while at a rail terminus on Hong Kong soil but in a part of the station that comes under mainland Chinese jurisdiction. The so-called Mainland Port Area of the West Kowloon rail terminus has aroused enormous controversy in Hong Kong, with many calling the arrangement a violation of the enclave’s autonomy. If Cheng was detained in the port area, the worst fears of many in Hong Kong about Chinese encroachment on their freedoms will be realized.

474,John Walcott,"On his way to an Aug. 1 campaign event in Ohio, President Donald Trump was asked about America’s position on the months-long pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. “That’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China,” Trump said. But as tensions mounted in the self-governing enclave in the following weeks, Trump’s aides and allies took different positions, with his State Department, National Security Advisor, and supporters in the Senate backing the protesters and warning Beijing against intervention. The mixed messages left U.S. and foreign officials struggling with basic questions about American policy, such as to what extent the U.S. considers Hong Kong autonomous and how Washington might respond to the use of force to quell the demonstrations. More broadly, the confusion captures an enduring challenge of the Trump presidency: it’s almost impossible to discern America’s approach to key foreign issues, from trade to humanitarian crises to military deployments, because the process for setting and enforcing policy is ignored or irrelevant. In interviews with TIME, more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials in the White House, the State and Defense Departments, and the intelligence community said the lack of clarity on Hong Kong reflects a muddled approach not just to that crisis but to policy­making across the national-security bureaucracy. And while some have found Trump’s unpredictability refreshing, it has left America’s closest allies wondering whether the U.S. will honor treaties, re-evaluating their relations with adversaries like Russia and China, and planning for what a second Trump term might bring. The President’s penchant for ad hoc policy­making has spread across government, these officials say. National Security Advisor John Bolton has dispensed with most of the inter­agency meetings that have allowed top officials in previous Republican and Democratic Administrations to present and debate the risks and benefits of different policy options, according to four current and former National Security Council officials. As a result, said two of the officials, there is less—and sometimes no—coordination among Cabinet departments. Some policies are decided without input from diplomatic, political or military experts. Bolton’s top aides have called counterparts to ask if they know what was discussed or decided in certain meetings, only to be told, “We don’t know either,” according to one Administration official. A National Security Council official declined to comment on the record. The top-down pattern also has been adopted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, State Department officials say. Pompeo meets with some top political appointees only every other week, according to two current and one former Department officials. When Colin Powell was Secretary of State during President George W. Bush’s first term, he met with his under and assistant secretaries every morning, those officials said. In a July 25 closed-door meeting with the Business Council for International Understanding, according to two people in attendance, Under Secretary of State for Management Brian Bulatao, a West Point classmate of Pompeo’s, said that because Pompeo was away from the building 80% of the time, he was streamlining the management of the department by slashing the number of officials who report to him. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, Bulatao said, was taking responsibility for finance; public diplomacy and public affairs; and civilian security, democracy and human rights. “That means only about half the department has regular access to the secretary,” said one of the attendees, a former department official. That has left some officials in the dark about what issues are at the top of Pompeo’s agenda at any given time and what other parts of the department are doing. The lack of orderly policy processes across government is what has led to the confusion on Hong Kong, insiders say. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Aug. 14 that the dispute “is an internal matter.” The same day, Pompeo’s State Department said it was “deeply concerned” by reports that China’s People’s Armed Police were mobilizing in nearby Shenzhen. “We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint, but remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong,” the statement said.",Trump's Muddled Message on Hong Kong Captures the Real Problem With His Foreign Policy,"August 20, 2019"
475,Billy Perrigo,"Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced his plan to resign on Tuesday, causing the collapse of the Italian government. Conte’s move is a high-stakes political maneuver intended to stop his right-wing deputy, Matteo Salvini, from gaining even more power.  Earlier this month Salvini moved to bring down the government, and Conte accused him of doing it for his own political gain. “[Salvini] has shown that he is following his own interests and those of his party,” Conte said in a speech announcing his intention to resign. “His decisions pose serious risks for this country.” It’s the latest political drama in a country that struggled to form a government after the 2018 elections and has had six prime ministers in the last 10 years. Salvini, who is also the leader of the populist League party and the current interior minister. His party received the third-most votes in Italian elections in 2018, but formed a coalition government with the first-place 5 Star Movement. His popularity has surged since, however––at least partially off the back of his tough anti-migrant stance. Recent opinion polls gave his party approximately 38% of the electorate, nearly enough to control the government without a coalition partner––if he can translate the popularity to election success. But Salvini’s opponents are hoping to delay elections, which could dampen his chances of becoming prime minister. Here’s what to know about the Italian political crisis. Conte’s resignation was the culmination of a long waiting game. Salvini had hoped to force elections to occur in October, just before the Italian budget season, betting that he could win the election and have the power to immediately enact his agenda as prime minister. That would mean he would avoid another fraught budget negotiation with his coalition partners in the 5 Star Movement, an anti-establishment party, which resulted in a compromise last time around. “Everything was about getting Salvini into the driver’s seat before the budget,” says Erik Jones, an Italy expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.",Why the Italian Prime Minister's Resignation Could Dampen Matteo Salvini's Ambitions,"Updated: August 20, 2019 6:05 PM ET"
476,Sheryl Tian Tong Lee / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — The U.K. said it was “extremely concerned” by reports that a Hong Kong consulate worker was detained during a recent trip to mainland China, a case that threatens to add to strains between Beijing and London. The statement came after news site HK01 reported that the U.K. consular employee, Simon Cheng, 28, was reported missing after failing to return from an Aug. 8 meeting in the adjacent city of Shenzhen. The U.K. Foreign & Commonwealth Office said it was providing the man’s family with support and seeking information from authorities in Hong Kong and Guangdong province. “We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen,” the office said. Cheng is being held on the mainland, the Telegraph newspaper reported, citing the British Embassy in Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing Tuesday in Beijing that he wasn’t familiar with the reports on Cheng’s disappearance. The Hong Kong police didn’t respond to requests for comment. The incident comes at a sensitive time for the U.K. and China, which has accused the British government of meddling in its former colony by defending the rights of demonstrators. U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab spoke with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Aug. 9 to discuss “concerns about the situation in the city and the protests there,” the foreign office said in a statement that made no mention of Cheng’s case. Concerns about the safety of foreign diplomatic staff operating in China have increased since Michael Kovrig, a global security analyst on leave from the Canadian foreign service, was detained in December and later accused of espionage. The move came amid a spat between Beijing and Ottawa over the arrest of a Chinese executive accused of sanctions violation in the U.S. Text messages published by HK01 suggest that Cheng and his Taiwanese girlfriend were concerned about his safety as he prepared to pass through immigration on his return home. “Passing through. Pray for me,” he told his girlfriend, identified only by her surname Lee. China has stepped up border controls near Hong Kong as authorities seek to prevent the financial hub’s unrest from spreading.

477,Jillian Keenan,"This story was a collaboration between TIME, The Fuller Project for International Reporting, and Kenya’s The Daily Nation.  Hours before dawn at Soko ya Nadhif market in Garissa, Kenya, middle-aged women in neon hijabs shout orders at men. They glide smoothly, like ghosts, through the darkness, groaning under the weight of heavy bags of fresh, long-stemmed leaves, each emblazoned with a woman’s name. They work quickly: just one day earlier, on July 4, 2019, a rumored threat from al-Shabaab, the Somali terrorist group just across the border, had sent everyone at the market scurrying to safety and cost them a day of work. Now the pressure to make up time is palpable – and so is the sense of looming violence.  “The safety of this place is not something we can take for granted anymore,” a woman yells, urging the men who work for her to get the leaves off the trucks as quickly as possible. The other women match her urgency, and by the time the sun rises, the leaves have been re-packaged into neat parcels, tied with banana leaves. The sales take place quickly, and before long the leaves and twigs have transformed into piles of cash.  “We are big time,” Khadija Dabar, 52, says with a wry grin as she counts her profits. “This is a good business because it’s always there. Whether it is drought or it is raining, miraa never lets us down.”  Khat, also known as miraa, is an amphetamine-like plant native to the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula. Banned in the United States and most of Europe, khat is one of the most popular — and lucrative — drugs in the region, bringing in an estimated $400,000 a day in Kenya alone. The industry is so central to the regional economy that when Somalia briefly banned khat imports for a single week in 2016, Kenyan farmers lost millions of dollars. Khat is most popular with men: in Somalia, an estimated 75 percent of men chew the leaf for its mild stimulant effect.  In Kenya, they say khat makes men stoned, docile, and impotent. But it makes women rich.  In Garissa, a group of seven women, known as the Al-Amin Women’s Group, run the show. Dabar, who has been chairwoman since 2009, says it has become one of the most successful khat distributors in Garissa. After only a few years in the business, the Al-Amin Women’s Group — mostly made up of single mothers — has already made enough money to invest in its own fleet of six land cruisers to transport the drug between farms in Meru, in Kenya’s picturesque central highlands, and buyers around the region. Today, Dabar is her husband’s boss: he works for the women’s group as a driver. But Dabar is an exception. Most of the women who run the khat business are unmarried: widows, divorcees, and single mothers. One vendor joked that selling khat is “like speed dating,” since all of her customers are men. The association between khat and single women is so strong that one driver, upon seeing a foreigner in the market, shouts: “Is the white lady making a list of women without husbands?” The question provokes a laugh, and a comeback: “Miraa is my husband,” one woman replies. “It provides for my children.”",'I Need the Money But I Feel Guilt.'

478,Kamakshi Ayyar,"Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government unrest since early June. The protests began as peaceful marches against a now suspended bill that would have allowed the extradition of fugitives to mainland China. But they gradually morphed into a push for greater democracy and a rebellion against what is seen as Beijing’s increasing encroachment on Hong Kong’s freedoms, leading to violent clashes between demonstrators and police. The ongoing unrest has taken various forms: millions-strong marches, a blockade of the police headquarters, the storming of Hong Kong’s legislative council building, and a tense occupation of Hong Kong’s international airport that led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights. As the protests continue into their twelfth week, there’s no telling what happens next. TIME’s senior editor Feliz Solomon has covered the situation from day one.

479,TIME Staff,"Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled top official, held out an olive branch to anti-government protesters Tuesday, promising “a platform for dialogue with people from all walks of life.” She added: “This is something that we want to do in a very sincere and humble manner.” Speaking at a media briefing before the weekly meeting of her cabinet, Lam also pledged to launch “an important fact-finding study in addition to a very robust system to investigate and look at the complaints against police over this prolonged period of confrontation and violence.” Lam did not give specifics but said she would “reach out to the community as soon as possible.” She also did not say if she would formally withdraw, instead of merely suspend, a bill that has been the focus of intense opposition. Her remarks came as the head of the independent body charged with investigating complaints against police described as “eminently reasonable” the withdrawal of the bill, which would have allowed, for the first time, the extradition of fugitives to mainland China from the former British colony. Anthony Neoh also called for “real talking from the heart” and suggested that there might be ways of granting greater freedoms to Hong Kong’s young people, who have been in the forefront of the disturbances. “Let’s have it out and see what could be done on this. I think it’s time to put things on the table and see what could be done,” he told local media. The extradition bill has provoked a storm of opposition in Hong Kong, with detractors arguing that Beijing would use it to round up dissidents and critics of the communist regime.

The agency said in a press release that one person died in Santa Bárbara de Heredia, and another in Santa Cruz de Guanacaste. The health ministry said that since at least June, 19 men and six women between the ages of 32 and 72 have died from suspected alcohol poisoning in several cities. Of the 25 deaths, seven were poisoned in the capital city of San José, one in Alajuela, two in Heredia, five in Cartago, three in Guanacaste, one in Puntarenas, four in Limón and two additional deaths that are currently under investigation. Overall, 59 people have been hospitalized for methanol poisonings, per data from the Health Surveillance Unit of the Ministry of Health. As a result of the poisonings, the ministry said they have closed 10 establishments in San José and Alajuela and have seized over 55,000 containers of alcohol they believe were contaminated with methanol, which the U.S. National Library of Medicine describes as “a light, volatile, colourless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol.” Costa Rica’s Ministry of Health previously said symptoms of methanol poisoning include acute abdominal pain, acute headache, and ataxia — the lack of coordination of body movements. The ministry also advised against the consumption, sale or purchase of liquor including Guaro Chonete, Guaro Cuerazo, Guaro Sacheto, Guaro Gran Apache, Red Star Brandy, Guaro Montano, Brandy Red Barnacle, Brandy Timbuka or Brandy Molotov.

481,Julia Webster,"Buckingham Palace has issued a statement on behalf of Prince Andrew regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, saying the Prince is “appalled” by Epstein’s alleged crimes. The statement comes shortly after the Daily Mail published footage that claims to show the Duke of York inside Epstein’s Manhattan home in 2010 — two years after the financier’s controversial 2008 plea deal. “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes. His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent,” according to the statement released on Sunday. Prince Andrew had been photographed with Epstein on several occasions, but recently distanced himself from the disgraced financier. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution and served 13 months of his 18-month sentence. The plea deal angered many who claim it was much too light for the financier, who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls at his Palm Beach estate. Furor over the deal eventually led to the resignation of Labor Secretary Alex Acosta in July, who was U.S. Attorney in South Florida at the time of the deal. Before resigning, Acosta had defended his role in the case, saying he acted to ensure Epstein did not “walk free.” Last month, Epstein was arrested for alleged sex trafficking on a new federal indictment. He was found dead in his jail cell on Aug. 10. Autopsy results showed he died of suicide by hanging. Prince Andrew has been linked to Epstein, and legal documents unsealed by a U.S. judge just one day before Epstein’s death included allegations about the royal. Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s alleged victims, testified in a deposition that she was coerced into sexual encounters with several men, including the prince. Buckingham Palace previously told TIME in a statement: “It is emphatically denied that The Duke of York [Prince Andrew] had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts [Giuffre]. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.” Court documents from a defamation case involving Ghislaine Maxwell — a British socialite and close friend of Epstein — also include an allegation by a woman named Johanna Sjoberg, who claims that Prince Andrew touched her breast at Epstein’s home in Manhattan in 2001. In the statement provided last week, Buckingham Palace said: “Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.”",Prince Andrew Says He Is 'Appalled' by Jeffrey Epstein's Alleged Crimes,"August 19, 2019"
482,Ciara Nugent,"Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has dismissed President Donald Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. could buy Greenland from Denmark, calling it “an absurd discussion” in an interview with a local newspaper Sunday. Trump confirmed Sunday that he would be “interested” in purchasing the island for the U.S., after the Wall Street Journal reported that he has repeatedly brought up the idea with advisers. “We are good allies with Denmark, we protect Denmark like we protect large portions of the world, and the concept came up,” the President told reporters in New Jersey. “Strategically it’s interesting, and we would be interested, but we will talk with them a little bit. It’s not number one on the burner.” Greenland, the world’s largest island, is an autonomous Danish territory with its own leader and own parliament. During a visit to Greenland to meet Premier Kim Kielsen, Frederiksen told the Sermitsiaq newspaper she hopes Trump’s suggestion was not “seriously meant.” “Greenland is not for sale. Greenland is not Danish. Greenland belongs to Greenland,” she said. “Kim Kielsen has of course made it clear that Greenland is not for sale. That’s where the conversation ends.” About two thirds of Greenland, which is more than three times the size of Texas, lies inside the Arctic Circle. More than 80% of the island is covered by a vast and thick ice-sheet — which is melting at an increasingly rapid pace as a result of global warming. While no oil has been found in Greenland, the retreating ice could uncover minerals and other resources that could be exploited. Frederiksen said she recognized that the Arctic “is becoming increasingly important to the entire world.”",'An Absurd Discussion.'

483,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong’s eleventh straight weekend of anti-government protests culminated in a large rally Sunday at the city’s Victoria Park. Tens of thousands chanted “Free Hong Kong! Democracy Now!” and “Fight for freedom! Stand for Hong Kong!” as a heavy rain fell. Many protesters carried banners decrying alleged police brutality and what they claim is collusion between law enforcement and criminal gangs known as triads. Others carried banners proclaiming “Hong Kong independence.” Vanessa, a 42-year-old protester attending the rally with her banker husband, said “We are here to support the young people. I don’t fully agree with everything they do. I don’t one hundred percent agree with what the teenagers have done, but in the end I’ll support them because I know what they’re doing is for Hong Kong.” Yesterday, thousands of teachers marched in support of a student strike called for Monday, and small groups of radical protesters engaged in a tense standoff with police in the densely populated Kowloon peninsula. A large pro-government rally was also held in the Admiralty district, the site of many previous clashes. But there were no major street battles or arrests, to the considerable relief of many in the restive enclave, where residents of districts hit hard by the protests have become grimly accustomed to barricaded streets, transport chaos, and palls of choking tear gas hanging over the streets. By the middle of Sunday afternoon, large numbers of protesters defied a police order and began streaming from Victoria Park towards the central business district. The sheer number of marchers overwhelmed major roads and brought parts of downtown Hong Kong to a virtual standstill. As night fell, the protest remained peaceful, in contrast with previous marches, which have typically ended in violent confrontations between police and radicals.

484,Tara Law,"It reads like something out of a conspiracy theory. On Tuesday, Russia sent a surveillance plane over the Midwest, and the U.S. military didn’t do anything to stop it. Keen observers spotted the plane, a Tupolev Tu-154M, on commercial flight trackers as it entered U.S. airspace on Aug. 11 and flew past Dayton, Ohio and then west over Chicago and Minneapolis. The story was all picked up by local news outlets, which published spooky headlines like, “Russian spy plane spotted flying over Chicago.” In fact, the flight was part of the Open Skies Treaty––a 17-year-old program that permits many countries, including Russia and the U.S., to send surveillance flights over each other’s territories each year. Experts say that’s actually a sign of good will that Russia flies surveillance planes over U.S. territory. And, it might actually make you a bit safer by deescalating tensions between the two nations. Open Skies flights aren’t a secret. Under the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, both countries are aware of the flights in advance, and there’s a quota for the number of flights permitted. The country being flown over must sign off on the equipment the planes carry. And the country sending the plane must notify the other country at least 72 hours ahead of the observational flight. The information that the flights are collecting also isn’t a secret. The countries must provide all the images they collect to all of the other nations on request.","A Russian 'Spy Plane' Was Spotted Over the Midwest.

485,Nick Wadhams and Tony Capaccio / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) –– The Trump administration has informally told Congress that it supports a potential sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a move that will likely anger China at a key moment in trade talks with the U.S. The State Department has informally told key House and Senate committees that it supports the $8 billion sale of 66 F-16s, according to two congressional aides with knowledge of the decision. Even with Congressional support, it will be years before any of the Lockheed Martin Corp. jets are delivered, assuming Taiwan signs an actual contract. It’s unclear whether the administration’s support for the sale will be used as a bargaining chip in the still-fluid trade talks with Beijing or whether it represents additional support for a government long seen as a bulwark against Chinese expansion in the Asia-Pacific region. China has long protested U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, which it views as part of its territory. The U.S., wary of antagonizing China, hasn’t sold advanced fighter jets since then-President George H.W. Bush announced the sale of 150 F-16s to Taiwan in 1992. The Obama administration rejected a similar Taiwanese request for new jets, agreeing in 2011 to upgrade the island’s existing fleet. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he planned to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping “soon.” The U.S. has a new round of tariffs scheduled to go into effect on Chinese imports Sept. 1, a move authorities in Beijing has warned will spark a retaliatory response. Normally, the informal 30-day notification process to Congress that started Thursday night would be followed by a formal, publicly released notification to congressional committees that lawmakers have another 30 days to approve or disapprove. A U.S. official said the formal notification is likely to occur sooner, however. After that it could take months or years before Taiwan and the U.S. actually ink a contact and possibly years after that before deliveries begin. The “Block 70” F-16s offered for sale are common to those sold to other U.S. allies. The Taiwan F-16s, however, would be equipped with top-line fire control radar made by Northrop Grumman Corp. that would allow precision-guided munitions to be fired at greater distances, said an official familiar with the details.",The Trump Administration Just Backed the Sale of F-16 Fighters to Taiwan.

486,Andrew R. Chow,"The current political turmoil in Hong Kong has extended to an unlikely battleground: Disney’s live-action remake of Mulan. On Thursday, an online protest emerged against the film after its star, Liu Yifei, expressed support for the Hong Kong police on social media. Here’s what to know about the developing controversy. Pro-democracy protests have roiled Hong Kong for almost three months following Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s introduction of a bill that would allow for criminal extraditions to mainland China. Lam is backed by the mainland government, and pro-democracy advocates fear the bill would allow Beijing to punish dissidents more easily and forcefully. This week, demonstrators occupied Hong Kong’s airport and clashes erupted with police. Over the past several months, protesters have faced batons, pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets from the police. Several prominent organizations, including the United Nations human rights office and Amnesty International, have condemned the Hong Kong police’s use of force during the protests. The police were also accused of allowing an armed mob to attack protestors last month, resulting in dozens of injuries. On Wednesday, Liu reshared a post from the state-backed newspaper People’s Daily that read: “I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now.” Those words were said on Tuesday night by Fu Guohao, a reporter for another state-run Chinese newspaper, while he was being tied up and attacked by protestors at the Hong Kong airport. The words have become a rallying cry for the Chinese government and its supporters, who seek to portray the protestors as violent radicals. Liu, in her own post, added in Chinese, “I also support the Hong Kong police,” and included heart and strong-arm emojis. Liu has 65 million followers on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. The original post received over 2 million likes and an outpouring of support, and Liu’s post was liked 81,000 times. Liu Yifei, also known as Crystal Liu, was cast as Mulan in 2017 after Disney saw nearly 1,000 candidates for the role, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Her casting was celebrated by an online community angry over a recent wave of whitewashed roles. Liu has been one of China’s most bankable stars over the last decade, appearing in fantasy and action films while also supporting a musical career. Liu, who was born in China and spent part of her childhood living in New York, has spent much of her career in China. But she has also crossed over into English-speaking roles in 2008’s The Forbidden Kingdom, opposite Jackie Chan, and 2014’s Outcast, with Nicolas Cage. Although her sentiment received an outpouring of support, Liu also quickly faced backlash from many across the world who support the protests, with the hashtag #BoycottMulan emerging on Twitter. “She could be a powerful voice for justice but instead, she supports this brutality,” one Tweet said of Liu.",Here's What to Know About the Mulan Boycott,"Updated: August 22, 2019 10:45 AM ET | Originally published: August 16, 2019"
487,Billy Perrigo,"News that President Donald Trump is interested in buying Greenland prompted mockery on Thursday when it was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. But it wouldn’t be the first time a President has sought to buy Arctic land from another country: In 1867, President Andrew Johnson bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million. It wouldn’t even be the first time the U.S. has tried to bag Greenland. Back in 1946, officials offered Denmark $100 million in gold bars for the world’s largest island, a Danish autonomous territory. U.S. officials at the time thought it was a “military necessity.” That 1946 offer was supposed to be a secret. (It was only widely revealed in 1991, when declassified documents were discovered by a Danish newspaper.) But in 1947, TIME caught a whiff of similar plans. “This week, as U.S. strategists studied the azimuthal map of the Arctic,” TIME’s Jan. 27, 1947 issue reads, “Washington military men thought this might be as good a time as any to buy Greenland, if they could.” The article is accompanied by a map titled “Arctic Circles,” which shows concentric circles emanating from both Alaska and Greenland––emphasizing Greenland’s proximity to European capitals including Moscow. There was no word of the classified $100 million offer made by U.S. officials a year earlier, but TIME suggested that “military men” had considered writing off Denmark’s $70 million debt in return for Greenland. The news came at a time of insecure postwar peace. The U.S. had emerged from the Second World War victorious, but the Cold War was already brewing. Tensions with the Soviet Union were out in the open, including over U.S. presence in the Arctic. “So long as U.S. servicemen—even radio beacon operators and weathermen—remain at Greenland outposts, the U.S. is exposed to verbal sniping from Moscow for ‘keeping troops on foreign soil,’” TIME noted.",President Trump Reportedly Wants to Buy Greenland.

488,Ian Bremmer,"Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong rolled into their 11th week, but things took a dramatic turn after protestors decided to occupy Hong Kong’s airport earlier in the week, escalating matters considerably. Why It Matters: To recap, the initial round of Hong Kong protests were kicked off by the April decision of the territory’s Beijing-backed Chief Executive Carrie Lam to introduce a bill that would allow for criminal extraditions to mainland China, which pro-democracy advocates feared would allow Beijing to crackdown on dissidents more forcefully. The legislation was met with massive street protests, forcing Lam to put a hold on the legislation, but she refused to withdraw it completely and also refused to resign (as protestors had demanded). This angered pro-democracy supporters further, as did the accompanying police brutality that the protestors were met with. Since then, the demands of protestors (who have no designated leader, adding to the chaos) have swelled to include amnesty for all arrested protestors, independent inquiries into police violence, and the right to directly vote for Hong Kong’s Chief Executive and the governing Legislative Council, among other concessions. At heart of the matter is the future of Hong Kong’s autonomy and democratic rights within a China that is increasingly clamping down on those freedoms. When Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997, it was with the understanding that the territory would operate under a “one country, two systems” approach until at least 2047. While Beijing would be responsible for the territory’s defense and foreign policy, Hong Kong would be allowed to retain freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, in addition to other liberties that are not afforded to the mainland Chinese population. But as China has grown in both economic power and geopolitical relevance, it has also grown more authoritarian, forcing matters with Hong Kong to a head. What Happens Next: So far, China has been reluctant to take the provocative act of intervening directly by sending in its military, preferring to let Hong Kong police take the lead in suppressing the protests. But as Hong Kong police have escalated the fight—both in terms of the violence and by deploying plainclothes officers to make arrests—the protestors have changed tack, leading to the decision to occupy Hong Kong’s airport early in the week, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and stranding foreign passengers. The purpose of the airport occupation was both to disrupt the day-to-day functioning of one of the world’s most important financial centers, and to raise the visibility of the protests to an international level. Both targets were achieved, but the ensuing violence at the airport—in addition to the scuffles between police and protestors that flooded television and social media, protestors also detained a number of people they suspected of being Beijing informants and denied them medical assistance—has fueled perceptions that these protestors are more extremists than peaceful objectors. This is a narrative that Beijing has leaned into, hoping to paint the protestors as radicals and separate them from the Hong Kong population at large, which had seemed to be tiring of the protests and wants to see life return to normal. Realizing that recent events have tarnished their image, the protestors quickly turned apologetic, framing their actions as proof of their desperation. Beijing will be watching closely to see how big turnout at the next round of protests will be. Typically, Beijing’s approach to previous protests has been either to offer minor concessions, or to let them run out of steam on their own (as the did with the 2014 Umbrella protests). The next few days will be critical.",What Happens Next in the Hong Kong Protests,"August 16, 2019"

Scientists say that as long as the world continues to emit greenhouse gases at the current rates, climate change-related impacts will continue to be felt.  “If you put all of the Julys for the last 20 or 40 or 100 years, there’s a clear trend upward. That’s the concern — that long-term trend. Not a single day or single month in particular,” says Michael Allen, a climate scientist at Old Dominion University.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the figures Thursday, confirming that worldwide, July was 1.71 degrees Fahrenheit (.95 degrees Celsius) warmer than the average of 56.9 degrees Fahrenheit. The record-setting July follows the hottest June on record, rising .71 degrees Fahrenheit (0.95 Celsius) above the average temperature for that month. Regions across the world experienced record-breaking temperatures; the continent of Africa experienced its hottest month on record, and countries across Europe — including France, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, and Luxembourg — experienced the hottest days in their nations’ history. Announcing the figures, Deke Arndt of NOAA said that the land temperature was the second hottest on record, measured at 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average for July, while the ocean was the warmest on record for July, at around 1.5 degree Fahrenheit warmer than the 20th century average. However, climate scientists say that while the high temperatures were troubling, the real problem is that they’re part of a larger pattern. Last month was the 43rd July in a row — and the 415th consecutive month — with temperatures above the 20th century average. According to NOAA, there are three big reasons why the global temperature was so hot.",Record-Breaking Temperatures Around the World Are 'Almost Entirely' Due to Climate Change,"Updated: August 20, 2019 2:53 PM ET | Originally published: August 15, 2019"
492,Melissa Chan,"Conspiracy theories, both powerful and enduring, can wreak havoc on society. In recent years, fringe ideas prompted a gunman to storm a Washington, D.C. pizzeria and may have motivated another to fatally shoot 11 worshippers inside a Pittsburgh synagogue. They are also largely to blame for a worldwide surge in measles cases that has sickened more people in the U.S. in the first half of 2019 than in any full year since 1994. Now, the FBI says conspiracy theories “very likely” inspire domestic terrorists to commit criminal and sometimes violent acts and “very likely will emerge, spread and evolve” on internet platforms, according to an intelligence bulletin obtained by Yahoo News. The May 30 document from the FBI’s Phoenix field office—the first of its kind to examine the threat of conspiracy-driven extremists—also says the 2020 presidential election will likely fuel conspiracy theories, potentially motivating domestic extremists who subscribe to them. “It’s increasingly becoming clear that lots and lots of people believe in them, and they have negative outcomes,” says Viren Swami, a social psychology professor at Anglia Ruskin University in the U.K., who has published several studies on conspiracy theories. Millions of people all over the world—including, by one estimate, half of the U.S. population—believe in conspiracy theories. Today, that figure may be even higher, according to political scientists and psychologists who study the phenomenon. Since researchers have not tracked these trends over time, it’s difficult to determine whether the number of people who believe in conspiracy theories has risen over the years. But experts, and now the FBI, argue an average person’s exposure to them has certainly increased, in large part because conspiracy theories are now more easily disseminated on social media. Among the most prominent peddlers of misinformation on social media, experts say, is President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly promoted falsehoods, using his personal Twitter account more than 100 times to voice doubts about the negative effects of climate change, contradicting an overwhelming consensus among scientists. Trump, who has more than 63 million Twitter followers, also spent years pushing the false narrative that former President Barack Obama was not born in America. More recently, following Jeffrey Epstein’s apparent suicide in federal jail, Trump retweeted an uncorroborated theory that suggested the death of the well-connected financier, who was charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy, was suspicious and somehow linked to former President Bill Clinton. When asked by reporters Tuesday whether he thinks the conspiracy theory he promoted is true, Trump said he has “no idea” but added that Clinton was a “very good friend” of Epstein who has been on Epstein’s private plane and perhaps to Epstein’s private Caribbean island, which locals reportedly dubbed “Pedophile Island.” Clinton spokesman Angel Urena called the claim “ridiculous and of course not true.”   “The chief conspiratorialist of the last 10 years is now the President of the United States,” says Harvard University researcher Joseph Vitriol, who studies political psychology. “Because of that, what we might be seeing is increased influence and pervasiveness of these beliefs.”","Conspiracy Theories Might Sound Crazy, But Here’s Why Experts Say We Can No Longer Ignore Them","August 15, 2019"
493,Ian Bremmer,"Italy has had 67 governments over the past 74 years; in that respect, the impending collapse of the 5 Star–Lega coalition government is hardly surprising. For 14 months, the far-right Lega party helmed by current Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has managed to cooperate with the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement despite little agreement on actual policy beyond a general contempt for the E.U. Lega’s priorities have centered on stemming migration flows into the country and cutting taxes; for 5 Star, the focus has been on expanding the social safety net and radically reforming Italy’s sclerotic political system. Tensions in the coalition have risen in recent months as Lega has been accused of soliciting help from the Kremlin ahead of European elections in May, a charge that Salvini dismisses as the “fantasies of James Bond.” Things came to a head earlier this month when 5 Star voiced opposition to a long-cherished Lega rail project, which Salvini used as a pretext to set the government collapse in motion. Despite Lega’s being the junior coalition partner in the government (5 Star controls 227 seats to Lega’s 124 in Italy’s 630-seat Chamber of Deputies), Salvini has been driving the policy agenda. Much of that has to do with his talent for communication and Lega’s rising poll numbers, which at last count hovered at 38%–more than double the vote share it received in the 2018 general election. Should those poll numbers hold steady or even improve on the back of a political campaign, Salvini is poised to become the country’s next Prime Minister. And if things really break Salvini’s way, he will be able to form a right-wing government with another far-right (but much smaller) party called the Brothers of Italy, while excluding center-right Forza Italia and its leader, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. There remains a chance another constellation of parties will band together to steer the government through difficult budget negotiations with the E.U. at the end of the year. That wasn’t what Salvini was expecting when he called for a no-confidence vote, but Italian politics can be unpredictable. Most people assume an empowered Salvini will be inclined to push Brussels to the brink if and when he secures Italy’s premiership. But we are more likely to see policy continuity from the next Lega-led government, as Salvini has been the one calling the shots for some time now. Salvini is also less likely to purposely pick a major fight with Brussels once firmly in power–both because he no longer has the political shield of being a junior partner in a coalition led by someone else, and because he’s poised to lead the longest-serving Italian government in several generations should he perform as well as expected. As it is, Italy is struggling with its economy and finances; a genuine confrontation with Brussels would put the screws to an Italian economy that Salvini vowed to resuscitate as a pro-business candidate. Factor in the increasing likelihood Europe will tip into recession (the specter of a no-deal Brexit, ongoing turmoil in Turkey and rising U.S.-China tensions all weigh heavily on slowing European growth), and Salvini’s life looks set to get more difficult even if he does win big in elections. Europe shouldn’t be worried Salvini will purposely force a major confrontation with Brussels so much as that he’ll be unable to manage an economic crisis, whether triggered by him unintentionally or by circumstances beyond his control.

494,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to tie a peaceful resolution of the unrest gripping Hong Kong to a trade deal with the Chinese government, the same day the State Department raised concerns about a possible armed intervention in Hong Kong by Beijing. A State Department spokeswoman cited by Reuters said that the U.S. was “deeply concerned” by reports of Chinese paramilitary forces amassing at the Hong Kong border. The department warned that Beijing’s encroachment threatened Hong Kong’s special status with the U.S. accorded by a 1992 law, which affords the enclave preferential treatment in areas like trade. The House Foreign Affairs Committee also spoke out on Wednesday. “We are concerned that China would consider again brutally putting down peaceful protests,” it said in a statement, making apparent reference to the 1989 massacre of students and workers in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. “We urge China to avoid making such a mistake, which would be met with universal condemnation and swift consequences.” In a Twitter thread about the trade war, Trump said that Beijing would need to solve issues in Hong Kong “humanely.” He also invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet him to discuss the matter. “Of course China wants to make a deal! Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!” he said on Twitter. “I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?” Read More: Chinese Military Video Seen as a Thinly Veiled Warning to Hong Kong Trump has largely remained neutral on the situation in Hong Kong, saying earlier that he hoped Beijing and Hong Kong could “work it out.” But senior U.S. lawmakers have called on the president to make it clear to the Chinese government that a crackdown in Hong Kong would have serious consequences, reports Reuters. The State Department has meanwhile issued a travel warning, advising travelers to exercise “increased caution in Hong Kong due to civil unrest.” Hundreds of flights were cancelled Monday and Tuesday as protesters occupied the city’s airport, one of the world’s busiest.",Trump Says Beijing Should Resolve the Hong Kong Crisis 'Humanely' if It Wants a Trade Deal,"August 15, 2019"
495,Feliz Solomon,"How do you stop a city in its tracks? Anti-government protesters decided on Aug. 12 to strike at the epicenter of this ancient trading post, by bringing Hong Kong International Airport, one of the world’s busiest transit hubs, to a standstill. Hundreds of flights were canceled and countless travelers stranded in what appears to have been the largest-ever shutdown of a major airport. The occupation came to a halt the following day in a brief surge of violence, as protesters turned on at least two people ostensibly within their ranks—detaining and injuring a reporter for a Chinese state-controlled newspaper and a man suspected of being an undercover Chinese officer disguised as an activist. Riot police stepped in to break up the fracas, this time without the tear gas and rubber bullets used freely in other skirmishes. One officer was caught on a cell-phone video drawing a handgun in the middle of a chaotic tussle, but did not fire. The tension in that scene defines the battle for Hong Kong midway through its third month. The city’s embattled leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, warned earlier that the protests risk pushing Hong Kong further “into an abyss,” as fears began to spread that Chinese law enforcement might intervene. Joining the hum of paranoia rippling across social media, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had received intelligence that troops were massing at the border. Before sharing undated footage of what appeared to be Chinese military vehicles in transit, the President tweeted: “Everyone should be calm and safe!” There is no longer any doubt that Hong Kong is on a collision course with the Chinese government, which has ruled the former British colony since 1997. What began as an uprising against a single piece of legislation has spiraled into all-out rebellion against Beijing’s encroaching authoritarianism, and a demand for more democracy. Peaceful processions have morphed into pitched battles on the dense residential streets. Lam and her largely pro-Beijing government have all but vanished, hiding behind columns of anonymous riot police and making occasional, highly scripted remarks to the press. The increasingly radical nature of the protests has not, as authorities expected, diminished their popular support. But the demonstrators are nonetheless bracing for a lethal blow as the government’s patience wears thin. Long before the city streets became a battleground, China had already begun waging a war for Hong Kong’s soul. Under President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party has quietly used its levers of social control on the freest courts, schools, media and economy on Chinese soil. “Just as he’s cracked down on any signs of dissidence in mainland China,” says Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, there has been a “whittling away of free speech, the autonomy of universities, an undermining of the rule of law, and that’s increased people’s anxieties.” Hong Kong’s populace recognizes that the city’s unique character and freedoms are ebbing away—and many are willing to make sacrifices to defend them. With arrests on the rise, they risk their liberty attending marches that authorities have started to label “unlawful.” They risk the city’s status as a financial portal, as the unrest begins to take a toll on the economy. The fear now is that some may even sacrifice their lives as China decides how to bring this summer of demonstrations to an end. “I don’t really see a way out,” says political analyst Sonny Lo. “We’re just hoping the situation won’t deteriorate.” The anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to Chinese sovereignty, July 1, marked a turning point in the crisis, when anger shifted directly to symbols of Beijing’s rule. Brian Leung Kai-ping doesn’t regret what he did that night, but he knows it will cost him. The 25-year-old student was among the scrum of demonstrators who forced their way into the city’s legislature, known as LegCo. Having shattered glass walls with a battering ram, they climbed up an idle escalator; felt their way through unlit corridors; and pried open doors before spilling onto the chamber floor in their uniform of black T-shirts, dust masks, hard hats and goggles. “That moment was so powerful,” says Leung. “The root cause of our problem was right there in that chamber.” A scene of anarchy ensued as protesters ransacked government offices, defaced portraits of the city’s leaders, and spray-painted slogans on walls and furniture like “Hong Kong is not China, not yet.” Not knowing what to do next, confused-looking kids milled around in what by then resembled a disaster zone. “At that moment, I chose to step up and take off my mask,” Leung says. He crawled on top of a lawmaker’s desk, tore off his respirator and shouted, “We are at the point of no return!”",'We Are at the Point of No Return': How a Series of Protests Escalated Into an All-Out Battle for the Soul of Hong Kong,"Updated: August 15, 2019 2:28 PM ET"
496,Sanya Mansoor,"A Swedish court convicted A$AP Rocky of assault on Wednesday and the judge who convicted him says the guilty verdict does not bar the New York-born rapper from returning to Sweden. “The court has not decided on any repercussions of that nature,” Per Lennerbrant, the senior judge in the case, tells TIME. A$AP Rocky will not face any prison time as a result of the verdict but said in an Instagram post that he is still “disappointed by today’s verdict.” With the conviction, Sweden’s judiciary appears to have successfully resisted pressure from a flood of American politicians and celebrities, including President Donald Trump and Kim Kardashian, who advocated on the rapper’s behalf. “It’s clear that the Swedish justice system… they were not affected by all the political pressure.” says Dennis Martinsson, a senior law lecturer at Stockholm University. Martinsson says the court laid out a transparent and reasonable ruling in the case. He adds that the mostly muted American response to the verdict could be telling. “Even though there was some political involvement up to the trial, I think that side has cooled off a bit,” Martinsson says. “That’s a sign of, ‘OK we acknowledge this is in the hands of the court.’ Although A$AP Rocky should be able to return to Sweden, whether he would want to return is a different matter.","A$AP Rocky's Guilty Verdict Doesn't Bar Him From Returning to Sweden, Says Judge Who Convicted Him","August 14, 2019"
497,Theophilos Argitis / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau broke the nation’s conflict of interest law by pressuring his former attorney general to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. settle corruption charges out of court, Canada’s ethics watchdog ruled. Since the Montreal-based engineering firm would have benefited financially from Trudeau’s efforts, the prime minister’s actions contravened the act, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion said in a report released Wednesday in Ottawa. Trudeau is scheduled to speak to reporters at 2 p.m. The watchdog’s reprimand is a blow to Trudeau, just 10 weeks ahead of an October election, and will bring renewed focus to what has been the most damaging scandal of his Liberal Party administration. The prime minister has seen his popularity sink this year amid accusations of judicial interference, though his poll numbers had been lately recovering, as the controversy settled over the summer. Dion concludes Trudeau and his staff pressured the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to intervene in the legal case involving SNC. The Canadian leader has claimed he did nothing wrong and was only attempting to protect jobs, but the scandal cost him two high-profile cabinet ministers, including Wilson-Raybould, and his top aide. The report doesn’t outline any sanctions related to the decision. “It is up to the Prime Minister to implement any further action,” it said. Dion called Trudeau’s actions “troubling,” and said the evidence showed on at least four separate occasions that political interests were put before Wilson-Raybould, directly or indirectly. “The authority of the Prime Minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms. Wilson‑Raybould as the Crown’s chief law officer,” the commissioner said in the report. It’s not the first time Trudeau has violated the act.

498,Julia Webster,"After the death of Jeffrey Epstein in a New York jail, focus has shifted to the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a close friend of the financier who has been accused in lawsuits––including one filed Wednesday––of helping him recruit and groom girls for sexual abuse. Maxwell has repeatedly denied allegations that she helped build a sex trafficking network run by Epstein. Epstein died in an apparent suicide in his jail cell Aug. 10. Statements from authorities suggest the multi-millionaire’s death will turn the criminal investigations toward potential co-conspirators. “Let me assure you that case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein,” U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Monday. “Any co-conspirators should not rest easy.” Maxwell, 57, is the ninth and youngest daughter of British publishing and media mogul Robert Maxwell.  She is a well-connected socialite who has been photographed in parties with several prominent politicians, princes and entrepreneurs, including Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. According to Tom Bower, one of Robert Maxwell’s biographers, Ghislaine Maxwell was born in Paris, grew up in England and studied at Balliol College, Oxford.  In 1991, her father was found dead in the Atlantic ocean near the Canary Islands, where he had been sailing his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine––named after his daughter. Shortly after his death, it was reported that he had committed a massive fraud by plundering his employees’ pensions to keep his companies afloat. The nature of Maxwell’s relationship with Epstein is not clear. While it was apparently romantic initially, Maxwell later became more of a close friend to Epstein, but has also been alleged to be his “procurer” and “madam” by Epstein’s accusers.","What to Know About Ghislaine Maxwell, the U.K. Socialite Who Became Jeffrey Epstein's Confidante","August 14, 2019"
499,Simon Shuster / Berlin,"News of the nuclear explosion at a military base in the far north of Russia trickled out slowly. First came the bulletins on state media of at least two people killed in a mysterious accident. Then came news of a spike in radiation in the area, and footage reportedly showing doctors in hazmat suits treating the victims. Finally, on Aug. 13 – five days after the blast – the Kremlin appeared to come clean, confirming that five nuclear scientists and at least two others had died while testing one of the newest weapons in President Vladimir Putin’s arsenal. “Accidents, unfortunately, happen,” Putin’s spokesman told reporters on a conference call that morning. Indeed, for nuclear experts and negotiators, there was a sense that this particular accident had been waiting to happen. Putin had promised the world a new type of nuclear missile during his state of the nation address last year, a pledge he illustrated with an animation of a rocket landing with a bang in Florida. But the types of weapons he was bragging about—from nuclear-armed cruise missiles to underwater drones packed with radioactive materials — are notoriously difficult and dangerous to build. “The systems that Putin has been talking about publicly are rather exotic and not as far along, or anywhere close to being ready for deployment,” says Lynn Rusten, a nuclear expert who oversaw arms control issues at the National Security Council under the Obama Administration. “That is why the U.S. hasn’t pursued them.” At least not yet. But one lesson from last week’s explosion may be that any country, be it Russia, the U.S. or China, can pursue such weapons without violating any rules. That’s because, over the past few years, the system of treaties that supports the world’s security architecture has been unraveling along with the diplomatic ties between Russia and the West. On August 2, after accusing Russia of deploying banned weapons for years, the U.S. formally withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which was signed in 1987 to contain both countries’ arsenals. An even more ambitious nuclear disarmament deal between the U.S. and Russia, known as New START, is due to expire in 2021, and there isn’t much hope of it being renewed. Putin said in June that he would be willing to extend the treaty for another five years. But John Bolton, the National Security Adviser to President Trump, has said the U.S. is “unlikely” to go along. The result is a world with less constraints on nuclear weapons, and more countries with the ability to build them. “There’s a qualitative arms race going on,” says Gary Samore, who helped negotiate New START. “There’s a whole new class of strategic weapons that the U.S., Russia and China are working on that are not subject to any arms control treaties,” Samore tells TIME.",What a Deadly Nuclear Explosion In Russia Tells Us About the World's New Arms Race,"August 14, 2019"
500,John Ainger and Greg Ritchie / Bloomberg,"The stream of investors seeking refuge in the safest parts of the market has triggered yet another recession warning, with yield curves inverting from the U.S. to the U.K. The gap between two- and 10-year yields dropped below zero on both sides of the Atlantic after a wave of soft economic data globally. Weaker-than-forecast Chinese retail sales and industrial output set the mood for the markets, with data later in the day showing Germany’s economy contracted, adding to the gloom. “The bond market is saying central banks are behind the curve,” said Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services in London. “It’s all doom and gloom on the global economy.” Investors have been driving into areas of the bond market that still offer a positive yield, typically longer-dated assets that offer better returns, in order to protect their funds from a global slowdown in growth. It’s an ominous development because it suggests the prizing of safety over return: the curve is typically upward-sloping, as an investment over 10 years is expected to pay more to compensate for the longer-term risk. U.S. 10-year yields dropped eight basis points to 1.62%, while those on two-year Treasuries fell three basis points to 1.63%. Thirty-year yields fell to a record low. In the U.K., 10-year yields dropped two basis points to 0.475%, while those on two-year bonds rose one basis point to 0.478% even as inflation jumped above the Bank of England’s 2% target. This move has been a long time coming, and reflects a significant escalation of growth concerns. The two-to-10-year curve has been on a gradual flattening trend for more than two years on rising doubts about the health of the global economy and weak inflation. Another widely watched recession indicator, the yield difference between three-month and 10-year Treasuries, inverted in March and has been negative much of the time since. “Where the U.S. leads, the U.K. follows,” said Adam Dent, U.K. rates strategist at Banco Santander SA. “The market has previously been very reluctant to abandon the idea that rates will eventually normalize.” The curve isn’t the only thing flashing high alert.

501,Bryan Walsh,"Last week saw the latest in a series of increasingly dire reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This past July was the hottest month on record, punctuated by intense heat waves throughout Europe and the Arctic, leading to a record-breaking 12.5 billion tons of ice melting on Greenland on Aug. 1. Yet despite the bad news rising with the mercury, on the whole the world is doing little to slow the pace of climate change, with carbon dioxide emissions reaching an all-time high in 2018. We know—at least those of us not in the grips of outright climate denial—how bad it is. But we can’t seem to act to save the future. There are many reasons why this is, ranging from political polarization to the disinformation campaigns of major energy companies to the sheer technical difficulty of replacing carbon-based fossil fuels. But the biggest reason is found within our own minds. When you think about yourself while inside the narrow metal tube of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine, a certain part of your brain, called the medial prefrontal cortex, or MPFC, will light up like Times Square on New Year’s Eve. If you think about a family member, the MPFC will still light up, though less robustly. And if you think about other people whom you feel no connection to—like, say, the inhabitants of the South Asian island nation of the Maldives, which will likely one day be erased by climate-change-driven sea level rise—the MPFC will light up even less. You don’t need a $3 million MRI machine to know that human beings are self-centered creatures. But as Jane McGonigal, the research director of the Institute for the Future, noted in a 2017 article for Slate, if you think about your own self, but in the future, you’ll see less activation in the MPFC than when you imagine your present self. The further out in time you imagine that self, the weaker that activation. As McGonigal writes: “Your brain acts as if your future self is someone you don’t know very well and, frankly, someone you don’t care about.” And if we view our own selves in the future as virtual strangers, how much less do we care about the lives of generations yet to be born? Economists have a figure for this: the “social discount rate,” which quantifies how much value declines as we look into the future. It’s essentially the inverse of an interest rate, which calculates how much an investment will grow in the future. An array of factors go into determining the social discount rate, like how much interest banks charge on loans and the expected rate of return from investments, but it also represents an ethical choice about how much we care about the future compared to the present. The higher the discount rate, the less we value the future economically. The climate-change denying Trump administration, for instance, uses an annual discount rate of 7 percent for its analysis of the social cost of CO2 emissions—how much economic damage each ton of carbon dioxide is estimated to cause—which is significantly higher than what was employed by the Obama administration. Discounting makes sense over relatively short time horizons, like when a business is deciding whether or not to take out a loan. But when we begin to look into the further future—future on the scale of climate change, many decades and even centuries from now—discounting can spit back results that seem confounding. The Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit wrote that “at a discount rate of five percent, one death next year counts for more than a billion deaths in 500 years.” To put that in monetary terms, with a 5 percent discount rate, it would only be worth spending about $2,200 today in order to prevent $87 trillion in damages—the size of the total world economy now—in 500 years. Make it 700 years and it would only be worth spending 13 cents today. That’s how much we discount the far future, and it’s one reason why we’ve been so reluctant to take serious action on climate change. How we choose to value future generations will help decide what we should do now about existential risks. This is especially true for climate change, which demands action in the present to avert devastation that will largely be felt in the future, perhaps after many of us now alive are dead. The problem is that, as the Yale futurist and sociologist Wendell Bell has written, “a present sacrifice for the welfare of the future appears to be a one-way street.” We experience the sacrifice in the here and now, and people we will never meet enjoy the benefit. So instead the present is essentially “colonizing the future,” in the words of the social philosopher Roman Krznaric, treating it “as a distant colonial outpost where we dump ecological degradation, nuclear waste, public debt and technological risk.” Because they don’t exist yet, these people of the future have no voice, no way to lobby for their needs. The United Nations exists in part to represent everyone living on Earth now, no matter where they are, but as the New York University ethicist Samuel Scheffler told me, “There is no trans-temporal United Nations. The only way we’re going to work for the future is if we are motivated to act on their behalf.”",Why Your Brain Can’t Process Climate Change,"August 14, 2019"
502,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"Flights at Hong Kong International Airport mostly resumed on Wednesday morning, after violent clashes broke out between demonstrators and police on Tuesday night. “We are trying to clear the backlog of passengers through flight rescheduling,” an Airport Authority representative told TIME. Around 50 flights remain cancelled according to the airport’s web site. The partial resumption of operations follows several days of anti-government protests that culminated in the cancellation of hundreds of inbound and outbound flights at one of the world’s busiest aviation hubs. A court order has been made ordering protesters to restrict future actions to designated areas, local media reports say. It is not yet clear if protesters plan to reassemble at the airport, but the Airport Authority announced measures on Wednesday that would make future large-scale protests more difficult. Only ticketed passengers will be allowed into the terminal buildings starting on Wednesday afternoon, according to a statement issued by the Airport Authority. Trains to the airport will also run at less frequent intervals than normal, and some car parks near the airport will be closed starting on Thursday. Hundreds of flights were grounded on Monday after thousands of protesters invaded the airport terminal, blocking access to check-in desks and security and immigration checkpoints. Check-in services were suspended again late on Tuesday afternoon after protesters returned to the building. The city’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, said that it had cancelled 272 flights on Monday and Tuesday, affecting more than 55,000 passengers, according to the South China Morning Post. By Tuesday night, the demonstration took an ugly turn when protesters detained a man they believed to be an undercover Chinese police officer and another man who is reportedly a journalist for the Beijing-backed newspaper Global Times. Violent clashes with police broke out when officers arrived to assist the men, who were held for several hours. In one video circulated online, protesters could be seen taking a baton from a police officer and using it to beat him. News video showed the officer drawing his weapon but no shots were fired. Protesters “detained, harassed and assaulted a visitor and a journalist, inflicting physical and mental harm on them,” the police said in a statement.",Flights Resume at Hong Kong Airport After a Violent Night of Protests,"Updated: August 14, 2019 5:12 AM ET"
503,Simon Shuster/London,"Last summer, it looked like things were finally about to change for Ashland, Ky. For two decades, the jobs that once supported this Appalachian outpost of 20,000 people on a bend in the Ohio River have been disappearing: 100 laid off from the freight-rail maintenance shop; dozens pink-slipped at the oil refinery; 1,100 axed at the steel mill that looms over the landscape. Then, on June 1, 2018, standing on a stage flanked by the state’s governor and business leaders, Craig Bouchard, the CEO of Braidy Industries, pointed across a vast green field and described a vision as though he could already see it. In the little-used park just off I-64, Braidy would build the largest aluminum mill constructed in the U.S. in nearly four decades. The $1.7 billion plant would take aluminum slab and roll it into the material used in everything from cars and planes to soda cans. It would employ 600 full-time workers earning twice the average salary in the region, Bouchard said, and create 18,000 other jobs across the state. Gesturing at the empty space around him, the CEO described an employee health center, a technical lab, a day care and hundreds of employees walking around “carrying iPads.” More than just making aluminum, the plant would help “rebuild northeast Kentucky, and in fact all of Appalachia,” Bouchard told the crowd. There was just one problem: Bouchard still needed a major investor to make the vision a reality. After months of searching, the only option was problematic. Rusal, the Russian aluminum giant, was tailor-made to join forces on the project. But it was under sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department. Its billionaire owner, Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s, was being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for his potential involvement in the effort to swing the 2016 presidential election. The Treasury sanctions—punishment for the Kremlin’s “malign activities” around the world, including “attempting to subvert Western democracies”—made it illegal for Americans to do business with Rusal or its boss. So Bouchard faced a dilemma. Keeping his promise to bring good new jobs—a project that had already been touted by the White House—would mean partnering with a firm that had deep ties to the Kremlin. Which mattered more, the economic needs of a depressed region, or the national-security concerns raised by the Mueller investigation? Hundreds of miles from the congressional hearings and think-tank debates over Russian influence in Washington, Braidy Industries and the surrounding community had to weigh whether Russia’s 2016 plot had caused enough damage to American security, or American pride, to spurn a chance at an economic miracle. Bouchard concluded they had no choice. He knew it could be controversial, if not outright illegal, to work on a deal with Rusal while it was still fighting to free itself from U.S. sanctions, he told TIME in an interview. But after a long talk with his lawyers about the risks of even discussing such a partnership, he traveled to Zurich in January 2019 for what he calls a “meet and greet” with a Rusal sales executive. Over dinner at La Rôtisserie, a restaurant with a view of the city’s 12th century cathedral, the executive told Bouchard that the company was ready to do business. “They said, ‘If we get the sanctions off, let’s meet again,’” he recalls. “And I said, ‘Wow, that’s interesting.’” By mid-April, an exuberant Bouchard was standing at the New York Stock Exchange, announcing that the Russian company had purchased a 40% stake in the Ashland plant for $200 million. Back in Kentucky, the news was met with celebration and relief. “People who were skeptical are seeing that it’s big time,” says Chris Jackson, a 42-year-old former steel-mill worker. When he enrolled in a training program for the Braidy plant, Jackson recalls, many in the community doubted the jobs would ever materialize. “The Rusal agreement just showed everybody this is legit.” But to some observers, the story of how a Kremlin-linked aluminum giant offered an economic lifeline to Appalachia is an object lesson of the exact opposite. Critics of the deal, both Democrat and Republican, say it gives Moscow political influence that could undermine national security. Pointing to Moscow’s use of economic leverage to sway European politics, they warn the deal is a stalking horse for a new kind of Russian meddling in America, one that exploits the U.S. free-market system instead of its elections. “That’s just what the Russians do,” says veteran diplomat Daniel Fried, who shaped U.S. policy on Eastern Europe at the State Department from the late 1980s until 2017. “They insert themselves into a foreign economy and then start to influence its politics from the inside.” What worries national-security experts is not that Rusal, Braidy or Deripaska broke any laws in the deal. It’s that they didn’t. A TIME investigation found that Rusal used a broad array of political and economic tools to fight the sanctions, establishing a foothold in U.S. politics in the process. “You cannot go against them in a policy decision, even though it’s in our national interest, when they have infiltrated you economically,” says Heather Conley, who served as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under President George W. Bush. “They use our laws, our rules, our banks, our lawyers, our lobbyists—it’s a strategy from within.”",A Kremlin-Linked Firm Invested Millions in Kentucky.

504,Madeline Roache,"Mass demonstrations have pushed the Chinese-ruled territory of Hong Kong into its most serious crisis in decades. The international airport has been at a standstill since Monday, while an increasing number of shops have been shuttered and thoroughfares blockaded. In 1997, Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule under a “one country, two systems” mode of governance, guaranteeing the city a high degree of autonomy, an independent judiciary and freedoms not allowed in mainland China. The fifty-year agreement is due to expire in 2047. Nearly two million people have taken to the Hong Kong streets since June to protest a proposed extradition bill, which would have allowed suspected criminals to be sent to mainland China for trial. Critics have said it would threaten Hong Kong’s legal freedoms, and could be used to silence political dissidents. Hong Kong’s last British governor says protestors are up standing up for their freedoms, which have been “whittled” away under the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Chris Patten, a former Conservative Party minister who governed Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997, helped push through constitutional reforms in the final years of U.K. rule that were later dismantled by the Chinese government. Now retired from politics, he is Chancellor of Oxford University.  Patten spoke with TIME by phone on Aug. 7 about what’s at stake for Hong Kong and China as the unrest continues. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Most residents in Hong Kong are ethnically Chinese but have a strong sense of citizenship. That’s not surprising because it’s been a great international trading city, it has the rule of law, some fine universities, it did have a completely free press. It had all the freedoms associated with a plural and open society except the ability to elect its own government. That is what people regard as defining who they are. While they don’t deny their Chineseness, they do say that they’re Hong Kong Chinese.  For the first ten years after 1997, I think Hong Kong did pretty well. China by and large kept its side of the bargain on the “one country, two systems” agreement. Things have changed since Xi Jinping came became President in 2013. I think that just as he’s cracked down on any sign of dissidence in mainland China, he’s been keen to exert greater control through the joint liaison office in Hong Kong and through United Front activists in Hong Kong. There’s been whittling away of free speech and the autonomy of universities, and an undermining of the rule of law.",Hong Kong's Last British Governor Says China Sending in Troops Would Be 'Appalling Error',"August 13, 2019"
505,TIME Staff,"Demonstrators invaded the terminal building at Hong Kong International Airport for a second day Tuesday, forcing the cancellation of all flights out of the restive territory from the late afternoon. Scuffles broke out earlier in the day as black-clad protesters physically blocked and pushed back against travelers attempting to pass from the departure level through to security and immigration check points. “We’re supposed to be home right now,” said Sehem, a 23-year-old medical student trying to return to Europe. “We’ve been in the airport for more than 24 hours, we’re super tired, we just want to go see our families—and we have exams in ten days. We need to get home and study.” Many passengers vented their anger at airline staff. One man screamed “I want to go home!” at an airline representative. When protesters complained about being unable to reach the departure gates, protesters chanted “Blame the government!” The latest cancellations come a day after protesters brought one of the world’s busiest airports to a standstill, forcing the grounding of all arrivals and departures from mid-afternoon Monday and leaving hundreds of travelers stranded. Hong Kong’s political crisis began in June as a series of peaceful marches against a now-suspended bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China from the semi-autonomous enclave for the first time. But the movement has since snowballed into a push for greater political freedom and self-determination for the former British colony. Protesters also seek the ouster of Hong Kong’s unpopular top official, the exoneration of all those arrested during demonstrations, and an independent inquiry into how the police handle protests, which are frequently marred by violent clashes. A three-day airport sit-in was scheduled to end on Sunday, but police actions at protests in downtown Hong Kong that evening caused widespread anger and prompted thousands to head back out to the airport on Monday and renew their occupation of the terminal building in protest. Videos circulated online showed police on Sunday apparently firing crowd-control weapons at protesters at close range in enclosed spaces, like subway stations.

506,Charlotte McDonald-Gibson / The Hague,"When Walid Khalil Murad drifts off to sleep, he can feel the warmth of his three small children in bed beside him. They are there in his dreams too, playing happily together. There is three-year-old Nishtiman, with eyes like her father’s and the same stubborn spirit, and his sons, Nashwan, 5, and Nashat, 6, all battling for a place on Murad’s lap. He can touch them, talk to them, and he is as happy as he has ever been. Then Murad wakes up, and they are gone. Sometimes he cries. Sometimes he drinks. Sometimes he thinks about the life jacket that kept him afloat as he drifted away from the sinking boat just a few kilometers from the Greek coast, and how he wishes he had slipped it off and sunk to the bottom of the Aegean Sea along with everything he loved.  He tried to tug his life jacket off that cold, dark morning in December 2015, when he realized that the smuggler’s boat had gone beneath the waves with his family still trapped in the cabin. A friend shouted over the waves at him to stop — maybe the Greek coastguard would come soon, maybe his family would be saved, maybe they would have a happy life in Europe. But none of those maybes came true. Murad has never seen Nishtiman, Nashwan, Nashat or his wife Jinar again. “I am lost,” says Murad, 34, who owned two shops in the Iraqi city of Sinjar before Islamic State fighters forced him to take his family and flee. He casts his sunken eyes to the ceiling and struggles to continue through the tears.  “Sometimes I talk to myself — I literally talk to myself — and say ‘maybe, just maybe, they are still alive’, then I say to myself immediately after that, ‘but the sea was very difficult, they did not have a chance.’” There are many obstacles standing between Murad and the truth about what happened to his wife and children: chaotic record-keeping in countries where bodies wash up on beaches; an apathetic public; far-right governments with no interest in the plight of refugees. Now there is also some hope, not just for Murad but for the relatives of all the 21,000 people who have died or gone missing trying to cross the Mediterranean since 2011. After years of lobbying, an international organization has persuaded some countries to start work on identifying the dead using DNA technology – and finally giving their families some form of closure.  But behind this outwardly simple effort are layers of institutional and political complexities, which are threatening the future of the project before it has even properly started. In the meantime, Murad waits for news of his family, caught in limbo between hope and grief.  “I think it would have been better if I was with them,” says Murad, who eventually was resettled in Germany. “I find it very difficult to live this life.”",DNA Tests Could Help a Father Find Out What Happened to His Wife and Kids.

All departures from Hong Kong International Airport were canceled on Monday evening, and arrivals faced delays — though officials said inbound flights already on their way would be allowed to land. By Tuesday, some flights were able to depart the airport, though others were cancelled and still more were delayed. On Tuesday afternoon, authorities were forced to suspend check-ins for the second day in a row. Protesters occupied the airport — one of the world’s busiest and a major regional hub — in defiance of police who they accuse of brutality. On Sunday, police fired tear gas at crowds inside a subway station, and charged at protesters on an escalator. One woman had been hit in the eye with a tear gas canister. There were also reports of undercover police dressing as protesters in order to make arrests. The demonstrations in Hong Kong are now into their tenth week. They began as opposition to a controversial extradition law, but have morphed into wider resistance against encroaching control from Beijing, which many Hong Kong residents see as an authoritarian threat to their comparatively open society. Here’s what to know if you’re scheduled to travel to or from Hong Kong today. On Tuesday evening, Hong Kong airport’s website showed many flights canceled, but some managing to depart. Passengers traveling later should keep checking the airport’s departures page and contact their specific airline for advice.

509,Jake Rudnitsky and Stepan Kravchenko / Bloomberg,"The failed missile test that ended in an explosion killing five scientists last week on Russia’s White Sea involved a small nuclear reactor, according to a top official at the institute where they worked. The institute is working on small-scale power sources that use “radioactive materials, including fissile and radioisotope materials” for the Defense Ministry and civilian uses, Vyacheslav Soloviev, scientific director of the institute, said in a video shown by local TV. The men, who will be buried Monday, were national heroes and the “elite of the Russian Federal Nuclear Center,” institute Director Valentin Kostyukov said in the video, which was also posted on an official website in Sarov, a high-security city devoted to nuclear research less than 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Moscow. The blast occurred Aug. 8 during a test of a missile that used “isotope power sources” on an offshore platform in the Arkhangelsk region, close to the Arctic Circle, Russia’s state nuclear company Rosatom said over the weekend. The Defense Ministry initially reported two were killed in the accident, which it said involved testing of a liquid-fueled missile engine. The ministry didn’t mention the nuclear element. It caused a brief spike in radiation in the nearby port city of Severodvinsk, according to a statement on the local administration’s website that was later removed. The Russian military said radiation levels were normal but disclosed few details about the incident. News of the explosion set off in nearby cities and towns a run on iodine, which is believed to help prevent the thyroid gland from absorbing radiation. Norway said it had stepped up radiation monitoring after the incident but hadn’t detected anything abnormal. Southerly winds and the large distance between the border and the explosion make it unlikely that Finland will detect any radiation, Pia Vesterbacka, director at Finland’s Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, said by phone Monday. The authority hasn’t checked its air filters since the incident but expects to have results this week, she added.

510,TIME Staff,"Outbound travel was suspended at Hong Kong’s international airport Monday afternoon as thousands of black-clad protesters flooded the terminal, mobilized by anger over a night of police violence that left the inside of several subway stations clouded with tear gas and multiple demonstrators seriously injured. Sunday night marked a shocking escalation as anti-government protests entered their tenth consecutive week, when a young woman believed to be a volunteer medic was reportedly blinded in one eye after being hit with a projectile. Elsewhere in the city, police were captured on video apparently firing crowd control weapons toward protesters at point-blank range in enclosed spaces. Officers were also seen chasing people down moving escalators while swinging batons. Volleys of tear gas were fired inside at least two mass transit stations, exposing both protesters and bystanders to the noxious gas. As demonstrations popped up in several neighborhoods, police were accused of disguising themselves as protesters and making arrests. One viral video appeared to show a plainclothes man kneeling on the neck of a young protester, bleeding profusely onto the sidewalk as he pleaded for the man to stop. “Yesterday’s police operation was ridiculous,” said Nicekayla, a 27-year-old retail worker who, like many of the protesters, declined to use her real name for fear of arrest. “I was supposed to work today, but I took leave.

511,Ciara Nugent,"In theory, the winner of Guatemala’s Aug. 11 elections will have the power to tackle the serious problems that make the Central American country the primary source of the thousands of migrants showing up at the U.S. southern border each week.  Many voters in Guatemala are looking for solutions to the lack of jobs, high rates of violence and food scarcity that drove so many of their fellow citizens to leave the country in 2018. (Some 116,000 Guatemalans were apprehended last year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol—a quarter of total apprehensions.) Another major voter concern, according to a July Gallup poll, is the endemic corruption that cripples the state’s ability to channel resources toward fixing those problems. An extremely popular U.N.-backed anti-corruption commission is due to close down in September after the current president, former comedian Jimmy Morales, abruptly kicked its leaders out of the country and refused to renew its mandate. The commission had been investigating Morales and his family. But it’s unclear if these elections will do much to divert Guatemala from its current troubled course, analysts say. The two leading candidates are offering mostly vague proposals on those issues, the party system is weak, and controversy over exclusions from the ballot has sucked air-time away from policy discussions during the campaign. Here’s what to know about Guatemala’s elections – and what they reveal about the country’s intractable challenges.  Sandra Torres, a former first lady of Guatemala, won the first round of voting in June for the National Unity of Hope party (UNE), with 26%. A center-left populist, Torres helped run social programs during the 2008-2011 presidency of her ex-husband Álvaro Colom. “Many of them have been shut down or reformed, so a lot of her campaign has focused on bringing them back,” says Adriana Beltrán, a Guatemala expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. Torres’ support is strongest in Guatemala’s poorer rural and highland areas. As well as developing free health care and education, Torres promises to restore programs combating food insecurity. Guatemala has long suffered one of the worst rates of malnutrition rates in Latin America, with almost 1 million children under five suffering chronic malnutrition or stunted growth. More recently, hunger crises have afflicted regions like the Western Highlands as a result of of unemployment, falling agricultural yields, droughts and other trends that have been linked to climate change. The U.N. says these factors are a possible explanation for the growing number of migrants from the so-called Northern Triangle — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — migrating to the U.S. Guatemalan prosecutors have accused Torres of corruption over illicit campaign funding allegedly received by UNE while she was general secretary in 2015.

Ortagus did not name the diplomat or elaborate on what details were allegedly leaked. According to the Ta Kung Pao‘s account, Julie Eadeh, a political counselor at the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong, met with pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong and Nathan Law in the lobby of a hotel in the city. The article attempted to use the encounter to illustrate Beijing’s narrative that “foreign forces,” particularly U.S. politicians, are stoking the protest movement, which has proved a formidable challenge to the central government’s authority. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs already said it had summoned an officer at the U.S. Consulate over the meeting. In a statement, it said it had lodged lodged “stern representations.” “I’m taking issue with the Chinese saying they issued a formal protest when in fact they harassed an American diplomat,” Ortagus said at the press conference.

515,Abigail Abrams,"By dramatically changing the food we eat as well as the way it is grown and produced, humans can help stop the devastating impacts of climate change according to the latest report by the United Nations body on climate science. More than 100 scientists from 52 countries put together the report, which was published by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It takes a look at how land-use practices have impacted the planet and finds that deforestation, agriculture and other human activities threaten the world’s ability to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees celsius, the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.  However, the report is not all bad news and finds that if more of the world’s population shifts toward plant-based diets and reduces their meat consumption, it could significantly boost the planet’s ability to fight climate change.  “Some dietary choices require more land and water, and cause more emissions of heat-trapping gases than others,” Debra Roberts, co-chair of IPCC Working Group II, said in a statement on Thursday. The IPCC report says that if people eat more plant-based foods and sustainably produced foods from animals, that will “present major opportunities for adaptation and mitigation while generating significant co-benefits in terms of human health.” Much of the world already eats very little meat, notes Timothy Searchinger, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. Only about 25% of the world, mostly wealthy countries such as the United States, eat lots of meat, he says. But as countries with historically low meat consumption get wealthier, they will eat more meat and put even more strain on the environment — unless something changes.  “The big beef eaters need to eat less,” Searchinger says.  Meat such as beef and lamb is particularly inefficient to produce, because livestock need lots of space to graze, and that land is often space that used to be covered with forests. Lowering the amount of meat people eat would also decrease emissions from livestock and the amount of fertilizer raising them requires.",How Eating Less Meat Could Help Protect the Planet From Climate Change,"August 8, 2019"
516,Kimberly Dozier/Washington,"The U.S. and the Taliban both say they are close to calling it peace after 18 years of war and multiple rounds of tense but cordial negotiations between dark-suited diplomats and turbaned fighters over cups of tea in plush hotels in Doha, Qatar. On one side of the re-purposed ballroom tables, U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is working relentlessly to close the hardest deal of his life: a peace agreement that would allow U.S. forces to withdraw fast enough to meet President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign timetable but buy the Afghan government enough time to negotiate a separate peace with the Taliban. On the other side sit Taliban commanders who drove the last Soviet forces out of Afghanistan 30 years ago, have fought the U.S.-led coalition to a bloody stalemate, and are still battling Afghan forces while the negotiations continue. An August 7 Taliban suicide attack on a police station in Kabul, the Afghan capital, killed 14 and wounded 145.  Both Khalilzad and Taliban chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar are now privately telling allies that they’ve reached a deal that would require most conventional U.S. forces to withdraw before the end of November 2020, shortly after the U.S. presidential election, multiple U.S., Afghan and Pakistani officials briefed on the talks tell TIME.  A major hurdle remains, however: the Taliban continue to refuse Khalilzad’s demand that a U.S. counterterrorism force would stay as long as a terrorist threat remains. The U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army Gen. Austin “Scott” Miller, has told international officials that if his mission is confined to hunting al-Qaeda and ISIS-Khorasan fighters, he can do that with elite special operations units and close air support, according to Afghan and European officials.  The Taliban’s Pakistan-based Quetta Shura leadership, however, had given Baradar a deadline of one year for all U.S. forces, including counterterrorism and intelligence assets, to withdraw, a Taliban source briefed on a meeting of high-ranking Taliban officials tells TIME. There are other hurdles to overcome. If a withdrawal began next month, a late November 2020 deadline would give the U.S. 14 months, not the 12 the Taliban has demanded, to complete it. Further, while the Taliban has agreed to guarantee that there will be no foreign fighters in the areas they control, they have not said they will repudiate al-Qaeda, as Khalilzad has demanded. And they have agreed to a ceasefire only with U.S. forces as they withdraw, not Afghan government troops.  Khalilzad’s efforts have angered Afghan officials and infuriated U.S. diplomats and intelligence and military officials, who say the timetable he’s negotiating is not long enough to ensure that Afghanistan does not return to harsh Islamic rule; preserve the gains made in women’s rights, rule of law, and other issues; or guarantee that Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists.","The U.S. Is Close to a Peace Deal With the Taliban, Officials Say","August 8, 2019"

Prince George turned six years old on July 22, so his dental situation is par for the course.

518,Kamakshi Ayyar,"The revocation of Kashmir’s autonomy was an “historic decision” that will benefit both the region and the rest of India, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday in a national address. In the speech, which came after India stripped Indian-controlled Kashmir of its autonomy on Monday and imposed a statewide communications blackout, Modi said he was confident that the Islamist insurgency there would soon be brought to an end and the Kashmiri economy would experience economic growth and even a boom in tourism. He did not promise that prominent Kashmiri politicians would be released from detention, nor an end to the curfew that has left most Kashmiris confined to their homes since the early hours of Monday. However he said he hoped Kashmiris would be able to celebrate the Islamic holiday of Eid (which begins on Sunday) without disruption. Read more: I Was in Kashmir When India Seized Control. This Is What I Saw Modi said that economic development had been stalled by Article 370, the constitutional provision that guaranteed the state’s autonomy, and that infrastructure projects would now be completed more quickly. He listed government schemes and benefits that he said Article 370 held up. And he praised security forces, including the army, paramilitary and state police for “protect[ing] the people” of the valley. As part of the changes imposed on Monday, the Modi government redrew the political map of Kashmir, splitting the largely autonomous state into two Union Territories, imposing direct rule from Delhi. Modi said in his speech on Thursday that while one of these new territories, Ladakh, would remain under Delhi’s control, he could foresee the more populous Jammu and Kashmir becoming a state again in the future. Since Sunday, the region has been on lockdown with curfews, soldiers on the streets, and no Internet or phone access. Reports from the area shared with TIME describe an unprecedented crackdown that has left 7 million people stranded without any way to contact family and friends. “I assure the people of Kashmir that slowly, conditions will return to normal,” Modi said. On Monday, Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) withdrew Article 370 and Article 35A of the Indian constitution, which allowed the state of Jammu and Kashmir to make its own laws in most areas, barring defense, communications and foreign affairs, and prevented anybody except “state subjects” of Jammu and Kashmir from purchasing land.",'We Have Taken an Historic Decision.'

519,Anchalee Worrachate / Bloomberg,"President Donald Trump’s intensifying battle with China and other major trading partners is morphing into a global currency war. It will be hard for him to win both. Escalating trade tensions have supported the dollar this year. They’re now fueling a mammoth bond rally as investors seek out the safest assets, demanding the greenback to buy Treasuries. Foreign ownership of American government notes has swelled to record highs, pushing yields to the lowest since 2016 on 10-year notes, a benchmark for global borrowing. Trump has repeatedly nagged the Federal Reserve to cut borrowing costs while complaining that the dollar is too strong. Should the Fed cut interest rates again, the monetary easing may actually shore up the U.S. economy, supporting the greenback. That may only add to Trump’s frustration. Options traders boosted wagers on a weaker yuan versus the dollar. “Whether President Trump can win the trade war and the ‘FX war’ seems rather doubtful,” said Kit Juckes, a global strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. “If he wants a weaker dollar, he should want a stronger yuan and euro. Unfortunately for him, this trade rhetoric has had the opposite effect.” The dollar has strengthened about 2.3% against the euro and 2.4% versus the onshore yuan this year and is holding near its 2019 high on a trade-weighted basis. Trump’s latest threat of more tariffs on Chinese goods helped push the yuan past a psychological threshold of 7, the level defended by the authorities in the past. The yuan steadied on Thursday after the central bank set the daily fixing stronger than analysts expected, providing some reassurance to traders rattled by a tumultuous week in markets. Options traders this week paid more to bet on the yuan falling over the next three months, according to currency-options prices. The question now is whether Beijing will allow that to happen, and what the Republican president may do in response.",President Trump Wants a Weaker Dollar. But He Keeps Accidentally Pumping Up the Value,"August 8, 2019"
520,Ian Bremmer,"The U.S.-China trade conflict continues to escalate. When the most recent round of talks produced no apparent progress, President Trump upped the ante by announcing new tariffs on the $300 billion in Chinese imports the U.S. hadn’t already taxed. Beijing first responded by warning that it would stop importing all U.S. agricultural products. (China is one of the world’s largest importers of these products.) Then, on Aug. 5, China raised the stakes again by allowing traders to push the value of its currency below the psychological barrier of 7 yuan to 1 U.S. dollar. That move is designed to hurt the U.S. economy by making U.S. products more expensive for Chinese consumers and companies to buy, and to help Chinese producers by making Chinese products more affordable in the U.S. In that sense, it weakens the impact of the Trump tariffs. The U.S. side then hit back by officially branding China a “currency manipulator.” These moves don’t mean the U.S.-China conflict is spiraling out of control. Chinese policymakers know that currency is a dangerous weapon. By raising prices for Chinese consumers, a weaker Chinese renminbi may further weaken an already slowing Chinese economy. It increases the debt for Chinese companies that have borrowed money in U.S. dollars and other currencies, and it makes it more expensive to buy oil, which is generally priced in dollars. It also encourages other governments to dump renminbi that may be losing their value, creating more financial-market headaches for China, and could encourage them to lower the value of their own currencies in self-defense. The U.S. move to brand China a currency manipulator is largely symbolic. The 1988 Trade Act, which created this designation, calls on the Treasury Department to negotiate with the governments it has accused, but it doesn’t automatically impose tough penalties on them. In announcing its decision, the department said simply that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin “will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions.” There are no specific threats of further action to boost his negotiating leverage. By Aug. 6, the Chinese currency had moved back beyond the 7-1 barrier, signaling that China felt it had made its point and didn’t intend to push further for now. Still, the ongoing escalation should worry us. The two sides continue to put weapons on the table they don’t yet intend to use. Both recognize that firing any of them could prove self-defeating and do a lot of collateral damage, but they don’t seem closer to resolving their broader differences. Meantime, the weapons are now visible for all to see, and until one side or the other finds a mutually satisfying path toward peace, it becomes harder not to use them. As election year approaches in the U.S., Beijing will target its actions at U.S. voters that Trump needs. It may also feel it can wait until after the election to see whether there might be a new U.S. President, and if Chinese action targeted at U.S. farmers helps with that process, so much the better for Beijing. In response, Trump has signaled that policy won’t work: “our great American Farmers know that China will not be able to hurt them in that their President has stood with them and done what no other president would do,” Trump tweeted on Aug. 6. He has incentives to prove he’s tough on China and to avoid any action that might look like retreat. They say in politics, timing is everything.

521,Naina Bajekal,"On the sunny, cloudless morning when Imaad Tariq was born in Kashmir, most of his family had no idea. “Nobody knows that my wife delivered a baby boy,” says Tariq Ahmad Sheikh, at the hospital on Aug. 6, a day later. “We couldn’t inform family, nor is anyone able to reach here.” In the early hours of Aug. 5, the Indian government shut down the Internet as well as landline and cell networks in Kashmir, as part of an unprecedented bid for greater control of the disputed Himalayan territory, which both Pakistan and India claim and over which they have gone to war three times. Some 7 million people in the region were left with no way to contact the outside world, as the government closed schools, banned public meetings and barricaded neighborhoods. Officials arrested more than 100 people, including political leaders, activists and former chief ministers of the state. Local reports quote police saying at least one protester died. But few Kashmiris will know any of that. Many may not even be aware that hours after the blackout began, India’s Home Minister Amit Shah announced the state of Jammu and Kashmir would be stripped of the special status it had held since shortly after the Partition of British India in 1947. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government said it would revoke two crucial articles of India’s constitution that have guaranteed Kashmiris the right to their own flag, constitution and near autonomy for seven decades. Overnight, India brought in radical changes to its only Muslim-majority state, while its population was left in the dark. To some, India’s move was a rebuke to President Trump’s suggestion in July that Modi had asked him to mediate in Kashmir, which New Delhi angrily denied. Others see it as an attempt to shift the region’s demographics; the legal maneuver paves the way for (largely Hindu) outsiders to buy property there for the first time, sparking comparisons to Israeli settlers in the West Bank. “Kashmir was always seen as real estate, not a place with people,” says Nitasha Kaul, a Kashmiri writer based in London. Scrapping Kashmir’s autonomy has long been a goal of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which returned to power for a second term in May with an even bigger mandate. “A decision has been taken about Kashmir in which no Kashmiri has been a stakeholder,” says Indian journalist Rana Ayyub. “This is an attack on Indian democracy.” And while Modi’s government stokes tensions between Hindus and Muslims elsewhere, unrest in Kashmir has been steadily growing. A U.N. report in July cited local data showing 160 Kashmiri civilians were killed in 2019 alone, thought to be the highest figure in over a decade. In February, a suicide bombing by Pakistani-backed militants killed 40 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir; in response, India sent fighter jets into Pakistani airspace and dropped bombs near the town of Balakot in Pakistan. (There were no confirmed casualties.) India’s latest move has further widened the rift with its neighbor, risking a return to hostilities between the nuclear-armed states. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan warned Parliament on Aug. 6 that India’s actions would likely spark militant violence, leading to tit-for-tat strikes. “If we fight a war until we shed the last drop of our blood, no one will win,” he said. “It will have grievous consequences for the entire world.” Pakistan has since downgraded diplomatic ties and suspended bilateral trade with New Delhi. But the risk to Islamabad of engineering a violent backlash via militant groups would be “very great,” says Farzana Shaikh, an associate fellow at the London think tank Chatham House, especially as Washington has declined to intervene. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told TIME the Trump Administration so far is taking no action to prevent an escalation of the conflict between the two countries. And with Pakistan’s economy suffering, a fresh conflict with India could derail its attempts to repair relations with the West. “India in many ways has played its cards just right,” Shaikh says. Beyond the geopolitics, though, it’s hard to see how India will win the hearts and minds of ordinary Kashmiris, who woke up on Aug. 5 to find their Internet cut off–and not for the first time. “There’s essentially no other place on earth that has had as many Internet shutdowns as Kashmir,” says Ravi Agrawal, the author of India Connected. Without any means of communication, it’s hard for locals to organize protests that could turn violent, just as it is for militants to plan an attack.","India Has Taken Kashmir, But Winning the Hearts and Minds of Kashmiris Will be Harder","August 8, 2019"
522,Amy Gunia,"An American human rights volunteer is reportedly in critical condition after he was shot four times in the Philippines. Brandon Lee, 37, was attacked outside his home in Ifugao province in the northern Philippines on Tuesday after he was called an “enemy of the state” on social media, reports the Guardian. Lee suffered cardiac arrest during a surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his jaw. Lee is a volunteer for Ifugao Peasant Movement (IPM), a farmers’ group that actively opposes a hydropower project and the military presence in the Cordillera region, according to the Guardian. In 2008, an IPM staff member was killed in a similar attack. Lee and other IPM staff had were labeled “enemy of the state” in posters that were put up around the province. Another rights group, the Cordillera Human Rights Alliance, where Lee also volunteers, blamed authorities for the attack. “We hold accountable the state security forces that the Duterte administration has let loose in the Cordillera region,” the group said in a statement, according to the Guardian.

523,Amy Gunia,"The U.S. raised its travel warning for Hong Kong on Wednesday, advising visitors to exercise increased caution if they plan to visit due to “civil unrest.” The State Department raised its advisory to a level two on a four-point scale, reports Reuters. “Most [of the protests] have been peaceful, but some have turned confrontational or resulted in violent clashes,” the advisory said. Protests have gripped the Asian financial hub since June. While the movement began in opposition to a now-suspended extradition bill, it has since expanded to include broader aims, like calling for greater democracy and challenging Beijing’s control over the semiautonomous city. Marches, rallies and sit-ins have become a near-daily occurrence, and action has increasingly become aimed at disrupting city life. A number of demonstrations have ended in violent clashes with police, who have used tear gas and rubber bullets to dispel crowds. On Wednesday, one of the seniormost Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong called the unrest this summer the worst crisis the territory has experienced since returning from British rule in 1997. Australia and New Zealand also raised their travel warnings for Hong Kong this week. Canberra cited the unpredictable nature of protests, violent clashes with police and the involvement of “criminally-linked individuals,” while Wellington urged citizens to avoid all city protests since, “even those intended to be peaceful have the potential to turn violent with little or no warning.” Protests have spilled over into residential areas and tourist hotspots.

524,"Fahad Shah / Srinagar, Kashmir","Fahad Shah is a Kashmiri journalist and the founder and editor of The Kashmir Walla, a weekly newspaper. He filed the piece below during the ongoing communications blackout in the Kashmir Valley. He can be found on Twitter: @pzfahad Delivered on a bright Monday morning, Imaad Tariq was one of the first babies born into Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Naya Kashmir or new Kashmir. But most of his family has no idea he has been born. “Nobody knows that my wife delivered a baby boy,” says Tariq Ahmad Sheikh, 40, walking in the hospital courtyard the day after his son was born. “We couldn’t inform family nor is anyone able to reach here.”  Since Sunday, Delhi has entirely shut down the Internet, landline and mobile networks in the India-controlled part of the Himalayan region of Kashmir — leaving some 7 million people stranded without any way to contact family and friends. In an unprecedented bid to clamp down on its part of the disputed territory, the Indian government has closed schools, banned public meetings, and barricaded roads and neighborhoods in Srinagar, the region’s largest city that lies in the Kashmir Valley.  With the help of over 38,000 additional troops dispatched to Kashmir over the past week, authorities have arrested more than 100 people, including political leaders and activists considered a threat to peace in the Valley. Meanwhile, police confirmed Wednesday that a young protester died after jumping into a river while being chased by police during a curfew in Srinagar. But few Kashmiris will know about that. Many of them will not even know that on Monday morning, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah announced to Parliament that the Indian government would strip their state of the special status that it held under the Indian Constitution for the last 70 years.  Revoking Article 370, which gave near-autonomy to the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir, had long been a campaign pledge of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won a second term in a landslide victory in May. Shah also introduced a plan to break up the current state into two separate Union Territories, giving the Delhi government far more control over both. (A part of the Kashmir region remains with Pakistan, which claims the whole, and which has fought three wars with India over it since 1947.) “My son was born a few minutes after I heard Article 370 was revoked,” says Sheikh, 40, who drives an auto-rickshaw in Srinagar. He and his wife came to the hospital earlier, hearing rumors of an impending curfew. Like many Kashmiris, they were surprised to see the administration preparing for a war-like situation, with various emergency orders, including calling all tourists and non-natives to “leave as soon as possible.” Just hours before the rollback of Kashmir’s autonomy was announced to the world, we Kashmiris woke up to find our Internet cut off for the 53rd time this year, as well as the suspension of all cellular services and landline telephones. People remain cut off from their families, and journalists have no channels of communication to report through. The online homepage of Kashmir’s largest local paper is blank and the website of our own magazine has been offline since Monday. Many journalists like me have had to send out work on thumb drives with passengers flying out of the area by airplane.

525,Madeleine Carlisle,"The body of a woman believed to be a missing British scientist was discovered on the Greek island of Ikaria on Wednesday, just a month after an American scientist was murdered on another Greek island and left in a bunker built by Nazis during World War II. Although authorities would not confirm any names, local media has identified the missing woman as 34-year-old British astrophysicist Natalie Christopher, who lived in Cyprus. Volunteers found a woman’s body a little over half a mile from the house where she and her partner had been vacationing, says Theodore Chronopoulos, a press spokesman for the Hellenistic Police. The Associated Press reported that Christopher was reported missing a few hours after she never returned from a morning run. Her partner told police that he spoke with her over the phone around 10 a.m., and later reported her absence around noon when she still was not back, Chronopoulos tells TIME. The U.K. Foreign Office issued a statement confirming it is currently “assisting the family of a British woman reported missing in Ikaria, and are in contact with the Greek authorities who are conducting the search for her.” The investigation is ongoing. “The crucial element is that we wait for the coroner’s report in order to find the cause of death,” Chronopoulos says. He estimates a report will take two to three days. Christopher’s disappearance comes only a month after 57-year-old American molecular biologist Suzanne Eaton was discovered on July 9, having died from asphyxiation in a case.

526,Sanna Wani,"On Monday, the Indian government announced that Kashmir’s constitutionally-mandated autonomy would be revoked and political rule imposed from Delhi. This northern territory, claimed by both India and Pakistan and ruled in part by each, had been largely autonomous since it agreed to join India in 1947 as its only Muslim-majority state.  Now the government has revoked that autonomy, bypassing the Kashmiri legislature, arresting local politicians, and redrawing the political map. The previous day, the government cut Internet and phone connections to the valley, meaning the rest of the world has been largely blind to what is happening on the ground. Sanna Wani, who managed to catch a flight out on Monday, told TIME about what she saw.  On Monday evening I left Kashmir, my home. I was one of the lucky ones, able to catch a flight out of the valley with my family just after the security services began enforcing the curfew. The Internet and phone networks are down; very little information can get in or out. But I can tell you what I saw. First, something about me. I was born and raised in Canada. My parents left Kashmir during the 1990s because it wasn’t safe then. But now we try to come back every year. As soon as I arrived in July this year, I knew something was different. My father pulled me and my siblings aside, and told us about the rumors. Article 35A of the Indian constitution would be repealed, people were saying. That’s the article which prevents non-Kashmiris from owning land in Kashmir. People didn’t really think the government would touch Article 370, which guarantees Kashmir’s autonomy. We didn’t imagine the government would impose political rule from Delhi. We didn’t imagine Kashmiri politicians would be arrested. The government went so much further than we feared. In the beginning, people weren’t expecting curfews. They were mainly just preparing for the Islamic holiday of Eid. But on Friday, news spread that the Amarnath Yatra, a big pilgrimage to a Hindu shrine in Kashmir which was supposed to last until Aug. 15, was cut short. That scared us. That’s when a feeling of panic began to set in. That day I was in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. I had spent the day at my grandmother’s house, and everything was fine. But driving through the city on our way back home, the rumours were flying. Srinagar was full of people. People were buying as much food as they could. In every park we passed, people were selling livestock. There must have been tens of thousands of people gathering resources. Buses leaving for nearby villages were bursting full. People were sitting on the roofs. Everyone was evacuating or preparing in some way. At that point, nobody official had said anything. The governor of Kashmir had told everyone to calm down, that this was just rumor-mongering. But we noticed the extra troops arriving. Everyone was really worried, saying they didn’t understand why there were so many soldiers coming in if nothing was happening. They were everywhere in these giant green military trucks.",I Was in Kashmir When India Seized Control. This Is What I Saw,"August 7, 2019"
527,Amy Gunia,"Australia elevated its travel warning for Hong Kong overnight Tuesday, citing the increasingly unpredictable nature of protests in the Chinese enclave. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade amended its travel advice on the recommendation of consulate staff in Hong Kong who were concerned about the situation unfolding in the city, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. “Protests have become more unpredictable and are expected to continue,” the department’s SmartTraveller website said. Protests have gripped Hong Kong since early June, and have since become a near daily occurrence. What started as resistance against an extradition bill has snowballed into a wider anti-government movement. While several rallies and marches have progressed peacefully, a number of demonstrations across the city have devolved into violent clashes with police. On Monday, a citywide strike snarled air, plane and road traffic while several of the more than half dozen rallies around the territory ended in battles between protesters and police. Police fired tear gas in a residential neighborhood to disperse protesters Tuesday, after the arrest of a student activist sparked more protests. On Wednesday, thousands of legal professionals staged a march across the city. “Tourist areas have been affected. There is a risk of violent confrontation between protesters and police, or criminally-linked individuals, particularly at unauthorized protests,” the statement says. It added that the risk of violence is greater at night and on weekends. The demonstrations have at times centered around tourist hotspots. Workers at Disneyland participated in Monday’s strike, and in late July, thousands of protesters staged a sit-in at the arrivals hall of Hong Kong’s international airport to spread their message to tourists entering the city, and warn visitors about police and gang violence.",Australia Raises Travel Warning for Hong Kong Amid Protests,"August 7, 2019"
528,Charlie Campbell / Beijing,"Leaders and elder statesmen of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gathered at the balmy seaside resort of Beidaihe just east of Beijing Saturday to kick off their annual summer retreat. It’s a famously clandestine affair, with roads closed, checkpoints erected and burly security officers prowling every corner of the town. Still, it’s no secret what subject will dominate this year’s conclave after a startling escalation in the Asian superpower’s trade war with the U.S. Markets plunged this week after President Donald Trump vowed to slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports—including consumer goods like smartphones, toys and children’s clothes—from Sept. 1. This comes on top of the $250 billion he has already hit with 25% import taxes. The escalation shocked Chinese officials who, not for the first time, believed negotiations were bearing fruit, especially since Trump had agreed a truce in late June. But rather than be cowed, China hit back Monday by slashing purchases of American soybeans to their lowest levels since 2004 and depreciating the national Renminbi currency by 1.4%, thereby lessening the blow of Trump’s tariffs by making exports cheaper. In response, the U.S. officially labeled China a currency manipulator and asked the IMF to “eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions.” Trump added his own salvo via Twitter: “This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!” In truth, everyone suffers. The tit-for-tat has roiled bourses in the U.S., Asia and Europe, across which growth forecasts have already been slashed. The American Chamber of Commerce in China released a statement saying, “tariffs are paid by consumers and harm business.” In a research note issued Aug. 5, Morgan Stanley economists warned that the higher U.S. tariffs and China’s retaliation could mean the global economy heading for recession in just nine months. Unless sober heads prevail, the world may plunge into a crisis from which there will be no easy retreat. Yet it’s difficult to see an end to the stalemate. For three years now, Washington has repeatedly pushed for China to reform its state-dominated economy, which Trump claims flouts WTO rules and provides an unfair advantage on the global marketplace. But that designation is unclear; WTO rules only covers export subsidies, which China—officially, at least—no longer uses. China does provide preferential loans and subsidies to domestic firms, but all countries do that. Just look at the $3 billion in tax cuts and other incentives Amazon was offered to relocate to New York City. China also has high barriers for foreign firms to access strategic industries. But the U.S. does too, for example blocking Ant Financial’s prospective purchase of MoneyGram among other sensitive acquisitions. There’s zero sign that Trump is offering to match China in reforming the way each nation runs its economy. “Trump is not really negotiating, he’s just bullying, because negotiating usually means you have something to offer yourself on the table,” says James H. Nolt, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute.",The U.S.-China Trade War Is Steering the World Toward Crisis and There Is No Easy Retreat,"August 7, 2019"
529,Sanya Mansoor,"After the Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945, “a city died, and 70,000 of its inhabitants.” The B-29 bomber stayed airborne, hovering above a terrifying mushroom cloud. This “dreadful instant,” as TIME once put it, helped speed the end of World War II, launched the atomic age and began an ethical debate over the decision to use nuclear weapons that has continued for more than 70 years — and that has extended to questions about the plane itself. The Enola Gay is a B-29 Superfortress, which pilot Paul Tibbets named after his mother, and which had been stripped of everything but the necessities, so as to be thousands of pounds lighter than an ordinary plane of that make. In 1945, it was given an important task. “It was just like any other mission: some people are reading books, some are taking naps. When the bomb left the airplane, the plane jumped because you released 10,000 lbs.,” Theodore Van Kirk, the plane’s navigator, later recalled. “Immediately [Tibbets] took the airplane to a 180° turn. We lost 2,000 ft. on the turn and ran away as fast as we could. Then it exploded. All we saw in the airplane was a bright flash. Shortly after that, the first shock wave hit us, and the plane snapped all over.” The plane returned to Tinian Island, from which it had come. A few days later, on Aug. 9, the U.S. dropped another atomic bomb, this time on Nagasaki. While it did not drop the bomb on Nagasaki, the Enola Gay did take flight to get data on the weather in the lead-up to the second strike on Japan. After the war, the airplane took flight a few more times. In the aftermath of World War II, the Army Air Forces flew the Enola Gay during an atomic test program in the Pacific; it was then delivered to be stored in an airfield in Arizona before being flown to Illinois and transferred to the Smithsonian in July 1949. But even under the custody of the museum, the Enola Gay remained at an air force base in Texas. It took its last flight in 1953, arriving on Dec. 2 at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. As the Smithsonian recounts, it stayed there until August of 1960, until preservationists grew worried that the decay of the historic artifact would reach a point of no return if it stayed outside much longer. Smithsonian staffers took the plane apart into smaller pieces and moved it inside. By the time the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Japan approached, the Smithsonian had already spent nearly a decade restoring the plane for exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum. But when the nearly 600-page proposal for the exhibit was seen by Air Force veterans, the anniversary started a new round of controversy over the plane, as TIME explained in 1994: Eventually, the criticism from veterans, Congress and others resulted in major changes to the exhibition. “[The show] will no longer include a long section on the postwar nuclear race that veterans groups and members of Congress had criticized. The critics said that the discussion did not belong in the exhibit and was part of a politically loaded message that the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan began a dark chapter in human history,” the New York Times reported. That version of the exhibition opened in 1995, displaying more than half of the plane, the restoration of which was still unfinished.",What Happened to the Enola Gay After It Dropped the Atomic Bomb,"Updated: August 6, 2019 9:43 AM ET"

The change in policy comes amid increasing tensions with North Korea over nuclear arms. Tourists from 38 countries are permitted free entry into the U.S. for up to 90 days without a visa. But North Korea is now on a list of eight countries including Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, that restrict travel to the U.S. by tourists who have visited those countries since March 1, 2011. They must now apply and pay for a visa to enter the U.S. The change in policy is expected to have detrimental effects on North Korea’s tourism industry — tourist travel to North Korea is permitted through guided tours, but in 2017 the U.S. State Department announced a travel ban for Americans after the death of Otto Warmbier, an American who was detained in North Korea and died shortly after his release. On Tuesday, North Korea tested ballistic missiles by firing them into the sea, the fourth such test in less than two weeks, according to the Associated Press. Also on Tuesday, a North Korean diplomat Ju Yong Chol accused the U.S. and South Korea of “inciting military tension” by holding a joint military exercise, according to Reuters. On Friday, President Donald Trump said the missile testing did not violate the U.S. and North Korea Singapore agreement in a series of tweets that praised the work done by Kim Jung Un. “Chariman Kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country, and only the United States, with me as President, can make that vision come true,” Trump wrote.

531,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"The Chinese government issued its harshest rebuke of Hong Kong’s protests to date Tuesday, condemning recent actions as a threat to the city’s rule of law and warning that the “handful of brazen and violent” demonstrators will be punished. “The protests taking place in Hong Kong have gone way beyond the scope of freedom of assembly and demonstration,” says Yang Guang, spokesperson for China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO). “They have morphed into extreme acts of violence.” The comments seem to indicate Beijing will adopt an even harder line against the protest movement that has rocked the semiautonomous Chinese enclave for nine weeks, posing an enormous challenge to the central government. Speaking in a noticeably harsher tone than last week’s press conference, China’s top policy official in Hong Kong reiterated Beijing’s support for the local government and police force. “Any attempt to play with fire will only backfire,” he says. His remarks follow three consecutive days of protest that ended Monday with a general strike that brought Asia’s financial center to a standstill. After transport disruptions halted half the subway lines and forced the cancellation of more than 200 flights, protestors fanned across the city staging rallies. In several locations, clashes erupted with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police reportedly arrested 148 people Monday in the largest single-day crackdown yet. In his address, Yang attacked the “small number of radical protestors” who have thrown bricks at police, ignited smoke bombs and set fires at demonstration sites, calling such behavior a serious danger to the public. Referring to an incident over the weekend when some demonstrators removed the Chinese national flag and threw it into the harbor, Yang said “they will have to face justice some day in the future” for their “shameless acts.” Hong Kong’s protests initially kicked off over a proposed extradition bill that would have allow the transfer of fugitives to mainland China. But the proposal has since been suspended, and the movement has broadened to encompass other political demands including greater democracy, and more autonomy from Beijing.",'Any Attempt to Play With Fire Will Only Backfire.'

532,Billy Perrigo,"The Indian government on Monday announced plans to divide up the contested Himalayan region of Kashmir and change the constitutional settlement guaranteeing its semi-autonomous status, provoking uproar in Parliament and fears of an imminent clash with Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir, which includes the Kashmir Valley, is India’s only Muslim-majority state and the subject of a long-running territorial dispute with Pakistan, which currently administers territory lying west of the Indian-administered state. The nuclear-armed powers have gone to war over Kashmir twice, and there’s a long-running insurgency on the Indian side between separatists and the army that has left at least 40,000 people dead since 1989. India’s home minister Amit Shah made Monday’s announcement without consulting Kashmir’s state legislature. It came after days of rising tensions. On Saturday, Pakistan accused India of firing banned cluster munitions across the de-facto border dividing the Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, killing two Pakistani civilians. In recent days, India has sent 10,000 extra troops to Kashmir, cut phone and Internet access, placed prominent Kashmiris (including leading politicians) under arrest, and told pilgrims visiting from other parts of India to leave. Later on Monday, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan denounced India’s plans to divide Kashmir into two federal territories and change its constitutional status as “irresponsible, unilateral and irrational.” “Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps,” the country’s Foreign Ministry added in a statement. India’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which returned to power after elections in May with an increased majority, has long called for the revocation of Article 370 of India’s constitution, which guarantees Kashmiri autonomy. Now, the party seems to be trying to make this long-held ambition become reality. Here’s what to know about the situation in Kashmir and what it means for the world. Kashmir’s status as a semi-autonomous state is complex. It has its roots in the partition of British India in 1947, when Kashmir’s Hindu ruler decided to join India rather than Pakistan on the condition that it was granted a level of autonomy. Over the years, that autonomy was worn down by the central state, writes Professor Sumantra Bose in his book Secular States, Religious Politics. But opposition to Kashmir’s “special status” has only increased since, in tandem with the rise of Hindu nationalism. The two most significant concessions given to Kashmir in the Indian constitution of 1950 were Article 370 and Article 35A. Article 370 gave Indian-administered Kashmir autonomy in all areas except defense, communication and foreign policy. Article 35A gave only “permanent residents” of Kashmir the right to own property. Since the 1950s, Hindu nationalists have rallied against these exceptions, arguing that Hindu-majority India must not bend its constitution for Muslim-majority Kashmir. During the 2019 election campaign, the BJP promised to revoke Kashmir’s “special status,” tapping into many Hindu voters’ hostility toward Muslims and mistrust of Pakistan.",The Indian Government Is Revoking Kashmir's Special Status. Here's What That Means,"August 5, 2019"
533,Joseph Hincks,"Grassroots women’s rights campaigns in Saudi Arabia helped advance sweeping reforms to the so-called guardianship system, regional experts say, even as prominent activists who have campaigned for greater gender equality remain in jail or on trial.  On Thursday, Saudi Arabia’s Council of Ministers announced their approval of a royal decree to reform the Kingdom’s wilayah, or guardianship, system, a jumble of regulations that Human Rights Watch has said constitute “the most significant impediment to realizing women’s rights in the country.” The new laws, at least some of which are expected to go into effect at the end of August, indicate that women over the age of 21 will be able to obtain passports and travel abroad without requiring a close male relative’s permission. Reforms will also improve Saudi women’s protection against employment discrimination and grant a greater degree of autonomy over family matters, enabling them to register births, marriages or divorces — previously the purview of male relatives. Published late Thursday, the new laws amount to “perhaps the boldest decisions implemented so far under the current leadership regarding the situation of women in the Kingdom,” says Eman Alhussein, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). On Twitter, Saudi Arabia’s newly appointed ambassador to the U.S. Princess Reema bint Bandar called the reforms “history in the making” and wrote that along with the easing of other restrictions on women, they proved the Saudi leadership’s “unequivocal commitment to gender equality.” While human rights advocates have welcomed the “long overdue” move to begin dismantling the guardianship system, they note the reforms do not do away with it entirely: women will still require the permission of a male relative to marry or to leave prison or women’s shelters. Rights groups have also called for the release of imprisoned women’s rights activists who remain on trial or in detention in retaliation for campaigning to change that same system. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, often known as MBS, has overseen a gradual relaxation of laws restricting women’s freedoms and says he hopes to increase women’s participation in the workforce from 22% to 30% by 2030. Recent measures include an internationally promoted move to lift the ban on women driving, and a gradual blunting of the powers of the religious police. But the Crown Prince’s attempts to cast himself as a modernizing reformer have been undermined by his simultaneous crackdowns on dissident voices, and mounting criticism of Saudi Arabia’s role in the disastrous war in Yemen. A recent United Nations report said there is “credible evidence” linking MBS with the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last year. On the eve of Saudi issuing driving licenses to women for the first time in June 2018, the Kingdom jailed prominent women’s rights activists including Loujain al-Hathloul, who according to her brother has been tortured and threatended with rape in prison. In spite of such crackdowns, experts say dissident voices have played a crucial role in expediting the latest changes to women’s legal status. A long running campaign called I Am My Own Guardian helped push the passage of a law in 2017 that ended the requirement for women to obtain male approval before accessing government services, according to writer Nora Doaiji. But outcry following the recent flight of several Saudi women from the country — including teenager Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, who fled to Thailand in January — has raised international awareness of the issue. Rahaf’s skillful use of Twitter — broadcasting her plight while barricaded in an airport hotel room — led to U.N. intervention on her behalf and to her eventual asylum in Canada. It also inspired a viral social media campaign in which women in Saudi Arabia and abroad rallied around an Arabic-language hashtag that roughly translates as “remove the guardianship system or we’ll all migrate.” Even speaking out online has been risky, however. Amnesty International told TIME in January it had previously documented instances of individuals being charged and, in some cases, handed down harsh sentences for simply expressing their opinion on social media. Still, Kristin Smith Diwan, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington (AGIW) says activist campaigns like the one that trended after Rahaf’s flight contributed to both “shifting opinion about women’s role in society and, importantly, made this social change and these demands apparent to the Saudi leadership.”",Saudi Arabia Is Introducing Landmark Reforms for Women.

In the series of Snapchat videos posted to Twitter on Saturday, family members take turns paying their respects to the young girl’s dearly departed lizard. Apparently, the lizard’s time with the family was brief, but nevertheless, everyone had a blast participating in the celebration of its life. “So my neice’s [sic] lizard that she found outside died today… she had the house throw a whole funeral for it… mind you this kid went all tf out for her lizard and didn’t come to play with decor or food or the burial site, this is a thread on how it went y’all LMFAAOOOOOO,” her aunt, Briana Smith, captioned the original post. “It was put together by my niece because she wanted her BFF to go away in a nice way,” Smith, who is featured in the video thread, told TIME. Saying goodbye to a pet lost too soon is nothing to laugh at, but this particular ceremony has been spreading a lot of joy. In fact, the smiles on this family’s faces have charmed the internet far and wide to the tune of 2 million views on the Twitter post. The humor comes thanks to a variety of key moments at this funeral, chief among them when the grandmother of the squad notes mid-eulogy that she has to head out because “John Wick is on…and he’s waiting for me.” “She was the bravest, fastest, funniest lizard I’ve ever seen,” another woman says through fake tears.",Everyone's Obsessed With the Hilarious Family in This Elaborate Funeral for a Pet Lizard,"Updated: August 5, 2019 2:11 PM ET"
535,TIME Staff,"For the third consecutive day, police unleashed rounds of tear gas on Hong Kong demonstrators, shrouding Monday’s general strike in all too familiar clouds of stinging smoke. At the day’s outset, the citywide strike crippled public transportation during the morning commute and forced the cancellation of more than 200 flights out of the city’s airport. Instead of heading to work, lawyers, bankers, teachers and other professionals filed into public parks and squares, joining half a dozen rallies crisscrossing Hong Kong. In Admiralty district, home to the government’s harbor front headquarters and luxury shopping malls, the boutiques and jewelry stores were mostly shuttered, while outside protesters sought respite from the 91°F heat in any available shade. The subway station and nearby park filled with a sea of black-shirted protesters, who once again blockaded Harcourt Road, a central thoroughfare that has frequently been seized by demonstrators. As protesters began congregating around the legislative complex, people handed out bright yellow ribbons and chanted “reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our time!” “Why are you guys not at work today?” a spokesperson from the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions said from the park’s stage. “We’re on strike!” protestors responded. Monday’s strike comes as the city enters its ninth consecutive week of protests. As the political crisis engulfing the Chinese enclave deepens and the government still refuses to accede to protesters’ demands—which include the resignation of the city leader—tactics have shifted from marches and sit-ins to actions that disrupt daily life. By paralyzing public transportation and bringing businesses to a standstill, protesters aimed at the heart of the city’s reputation as Asia’s buzzing financial center. “I hope that if enough people come out to strike today, and it looks like there is, that it will be enough to make the government respond to our demands,” said a striking NGO staffer who asked to be identified only as Ms Lee. Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam warned during a press conference Monday that attempts to immobilize the city were instigating a “very dangerous situation.” She also accused protesters of “trying to ruin Hong Kong and completely destroy the livelihood of seven million citizens.”",Hong Kongers Go on Strike to Support the 'Revolution of Our Time',"Updated: August 5, 2019 8:19 AM ET"
536,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"Hong Kong commuters faced major disruptions Monday morning, with the city’s trains brought to a standstill and more than 200 flights canceled as protesters staged a general strike. Although demonstrations have rocked the city for two months, Monday’s strike was one of the most disruptive to daily life to date. Businesses across the Asian financial hub shut as workers struggled to make it to the office. “This is the first time that serious efforts to organize a strike have been taken in recent memory, so it’s a big deal,” Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Center for China Studies, tells TIME. Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) website showed seven lines out of service during the morning rush hour, including the Island Line, which cuts through the city’s government and financial districts. Shops in several MTR stations had metal gates pulled down over them and remained closed during the morning commute. At several stations, protesters in black shirts and face masks blocked carriage doors to delay the trains from leaving. In one station, a man laid down across the carriage entrance to keep the doors from shutting. Traffic was blocked on several major thoroughfares. A South China Morning Post reporter posted a video on Twitter of protesters blocking the Cross-Harbor Tunnel, a key tunnel between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. The Airport Express — the train linking the city’s business district to the airport — was also out of service. Hong Kong’s flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, advised passengers to postpone non-essential travel to another day. Hong Kong Airport’s website showed more than 120 departing flights and at 100 arrival flights cancelled.

537,TIME Staff,"Addressing the public for the first time in weeks, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Monday lashed out at protesters for hurting the city as they moved to immobilize Asia’s financial center with a general strike. A visibly irritated Lam said the recent wave of demonstrations seeking to disrupt daily life has pushed the city to the “verge of a very dangerous situation.” Her hastily called press conference comes as the semiautonomous Chinese enclave begins its ninth consecutive week of protests with a citywide strike that aims to increase pressure on the administration. On Monday morning, commuters struggled to get to work as several public transportation lines were forced to suspend service and traffic snarled as protesters dragged roadblocks across major thoroughfares. More than 100 flights out of the city’s airport were cancelled. “As a result of these widespread disruptions and violence, the great majority of Hong Kong people are now in a state of great anxiety. Some of them don’t know whether they could still take some forms of public transport, while others are right now being blocked on the way to work,” she said. The strike follows a weekend of clashes between brick-throwing demonstrators and tear gas and rubber bullet-firing police. Protesters also tore down a Chinese national flag from a pole and threw it into the harbor in a symbolic gesture jettisoning Beijing’s authority over the city. Lam condemned the protesters’ behavior and said it is now time to “set aside differences and support the restoration of law and order as soon as possible.” She called on the city’s residents to “rally together.” But the protests show no sign of abating. What began as a backlash to an unpopular extradition bill has now swelled into a broader movement calling for full democracy and self-determination. Many of the black-clad protesters see themselves as foot soldiers in a rebellion against China’s sovereignty over the territory. “The nature of these violent protests has changed,” said Lam. She accused the protesters of operating with “ulterior motives” that will “destroy Hong Kong.” The ongoing unrest, she said, jeopardizes the city’s “continued safety, security, and of course, prosperity.”",Hong Kong's Embattled Leader Urges Protesters to 'Restore Order' Amid a Citywide Strike,"Updated: August 5, 2019 12:18 AM ET"
538,Amy Stillman / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — At Mexico’s state-run oil company, skinnier waists mean bigger bonuses. Under Petroleos Mexicanos’s new collective bargaining contract with its union, workers who meet certain body weight standards will receive a “health incentive” of 5,545.40 pesos ($287) a year. To qualify, they must have a body mass index, or BMI, of not more than 25 — or a maximum waist circumference of 90 centimeters (35 inches) for men and 80 centimeters (31 inches) for women. The so-called health bonus is a 4.6% increase from the last union contract. The policy runs counter to recommendations by health experts, who warn that BMI and other bio-metric markers are influenced by genetics and environmental factors, and aren’t easy to control. “Employers mandating differential treatment of individuals based on BMI serve to institutionalize the already pervasive stigmatization of obese people,” according to one report from The Obesity Society in Maryland. Pemex and its union did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “This is an uninformed policy,” said Dr. Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness in Washington. “It’s inconsistent with the science of what we know about body weight regulation and it’s tone deaf to progress being made in societal perceptions around obesity. On top of all of that, we have very strong scientific data now that weight shaming causes more weight gain.” Pemex workers who are overweight or obese and decrease their weight by 10% annually will also get the bonus, and there are metrics for blood glucose levels, blood pressure and cholesterol, according to the contract seen by Bloomberg. Details of the contract, including a bonus for “productivity” equivalent to 30.85% of workers’ salaries, were first reported in national newspaper Reforma. A more productive method of encouraging wellness among employees is to incentivize healthy behaviors, said Kahan. These can include giving workers’ insurance rebates for trips to the gym, or encouraging participation in lectures on healthy eating and living. Also, companies can reduce sweets and provide healthier snacks in the office, or give employees’ more time during their lunch break to buy wholesome food or exercise. “There are a lot of companies big and small that are moving forward on this in much better and much more productive ways,” said Kahan.","At Mexican Oil Company, Workers Offered 'Health Incentive' Bonus For Weight Loss, Trim Waistlines","August 2, 2019"
539,Jasmine Aguilera,"Many of the globe’s far northern regions have been experiencing extreme weather events over the past two months. Plumes of smoke have been picked up by satellites from wildfires across Alaska and Siberia and Greenland has experienced rapid ice loss as usually frigid regions have experienced heatwaves and record temperatures. As the Arctic faces extreme weather events caused by climate change, the events could have ripple effects that accelerate temperature increases across the world, according to scientists and experts. “The basic chemistry and the basic physics of how the atmosphere absorbs heat — there’s no path where you can imagine that the Arctic is going to start to cool off again,” says Brian Brettschneider, a climatologist and post doctoral fellow at the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “Cold air has to come from somewhere, cold air doesn’t just magically appear, and that somewhere has to be accounted for in the entire energy balance of the Earth. Right now the whole Earth has just warmed up,” Brettschneider tells TIME. “It would take a dramatic reversal of the chemical composition of the atmosphere.” In Alaska, 2.4 million acres of wildfire have burned through July. In the northern Russian province of Siberia, more than 7 million acres have burned. Greenland has also seen several wildfires in July, but the largest threat to Greenland is a heatwave that spread from Europe to the Arctic country, causing 197 billion tons of ice melt in July alone. Meteorologist Eric Holthaus says the Arctic is nearing a point of no return, as the global temperature increases closer to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial era levels, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns would have destructive consequences, creating more frequent and extreme weather events and causing high sea level rise. “We haven’t crossed any major irreversible tipping points yet, but for each tenth of a degree that we get closer to 1.5 [degrees Celsius], it’s sort of like time’s running out,” Holthaus tells TIME. “We’re already there in some places where the ice just doesn’t exist in the times and places that it used to. That’s a permanent change effectively to those parts of the Arctic.” June 2019 was the hottest June on record globally which was the result of climate change, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

540,Madeleine Joung,"During his two and a half years in the Trump Administration, Mike Pompeo has mostly managed to stay on President Donald Trump’s good side, even as other senior officials have come and gone. But the Secretary of State’s relationship with the President is now being tested after an apparent split over whether or not to further punish Turkey for buying an advanced Russian missile system. Turkey, a NATO ally since 1952, is now receiving parts for Russia’s S-400, an advanced mobile surface-to-air weapon system designed to detect and shoot down aircraft and missiles up to 155 miles away. Pompeo has publicly stated that Turkey’s purchase ran afoul of a 2017 law meant to punish Russia for election meddling and the Crimea annexation. “The law requires that there be sanctions,” Pompeo said on July 14. “And I’m confident that we will comply with the law, and President Trump will comply with the law.” That assertion was supported by the top Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, as well as the House Foreign Affairs Committee. But Trump appears increasingly reluctant to punish Turkey––at a time that ties between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and western allies are increasingly under strain. Despite Pompeo’s apparent promise to impose sanctions, a senior Trump Administration official told TIME last Friday, “The United States does not preview sanctions decisions.” (Asked by TIME that same day whether Pompeo still believed that the law requires sanctioning Turkey, a State Department official echoed that the United States would not preview decisions in advance.) The President has also undercut Pompeo by opening up an alternative channel of communication –– directing Sen. Lindsey Graham to work with Pompeo’s Turkish counterpart to resolve the issue. Trump “told me to call Turkey,” Graham told Defense One. “I’m in the camp of, if they don’t activate the [Russian] S-400, the sanctions don’t have to be applied,” Graham said, adding that he relayed this by phone to Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu (who, prosecutors alleged, directed a six-figure deal with Mike Flynn’s firm during the 2016 campaign.) But not activating the system may not be a viable option for Turkey, which just purchased the $2.5 billion technology from Russia. Later that day, Pompeo was asked on Bloomberg TV whether Graham’s position was shared by the Administration. “I’m not going to talk about internal deliberations,” Pompeo replied. “We’re all working, everyone’s working together to do our best…there could be more sanctions to follow, but frankly what we’d really like is for the S-400 not to become operational, that’s our objective.” (Graham, a former Trump adversary who has over the past three years increasingly morphed into a defender of the President, was also reportedly asked to work on developing a new Iran deal.)",How President Trump Is Undercutting Pompeo in a Dispute Over Turkey's Purchase of a Russian Missile System,"August 2, 2019"

The New York-born rapper was allowed to leave the country for the first time since his July 3 arrest while he awaits the decision if the judge in the case. A verdict is scheduled to come on Aug. 14, Karin Rosander, spokeswoman for Swedish Prosecution Authority tells TIME. A photo taken after the trial shows A$AP Rocky smiling as he gets into a vehicle. He thanked his fans and supporters in an Instagram statement posted Friday, saying “I can’t begin to describe how grateful I am for all of you.” The scuffle escalated into an international incident over the last month, with President Donald Trump telling Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Löfven that he was “very disappointed” he refused his personal request to secure bail and help free the musician. However, Sweden does not have a bail system and the country’s constitution forbids the prime minister from trying to intervene in a legal case. After the court announced the rapper’s release, Trump tweeted, “It was a Rocky Week, get home ASAP A$AP!” Prosecutors have asked that the Grammy-nominated artist receive a sentence of at least six months in prison. The maximum sentence for assault in Sweden is two years. Anne Ramberg, the secretary-general of the Swedish Bar Association, tells TIME she would be “shocked” if A$AP Rocky would still have to serve time in a Swedish prison. “If the court released him today that means either he will not be convicted or he will be convicted but he will not be sent to prison for more time than he has already been detained,” Ramberg says.

The U.K.’s new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has pledged to take the country out of the bloc “come what may” by the current deadline of October 31. He has refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit unless E.U. leaders allow him to overhaul the agreement they had negotiated with his predecessor Theresa May – something the E.U. says is impossible.  The leaked document, obtained by British broadcaster Sky News, was prepared before Johnson took office and paints a chaotic picture of life in the U.K. in the weeks following a no-deal Brexit. In the first two weeks, it warns, the U.K. would face “potential consumer panic and food shortages, even in areas which are not directly affected at the border” and “possible friction at sea between U.K./E.U. fishing vessels.” The document also cites security risks, including the “possible increased risk of serious organized crime” and “operational gaps” in security as extra policing becomes “unsustainable”. Northern Ireland, a region of the U.K. that has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, is singled out as being particularly at risk, with “small businesses [facing] distress and potential law and order challenges” in the first month after leaving without a deal. The document also warns of increased volatility in the British economy and further devaluation of the British pound, which lost 4% of its value against the dollar in July alone. On Thursday, British finance minister Sajid Javid, appointed by Johnson last week, announced $2.6 billion in extra funding to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, bringing the total amount allocated by the government up to $7.6 billion.

543,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong’s civil servants symbolically turned against the city’s government Friday evening, joining forces with the protest movement that has rocked Asia’s financial center this summer. The staid two-hour gathering at a garden in the heart of the financial district reflects just how far the sustained demonstrations have reverberated across Hong Kong. Beyond prompting teenage protesters to take to the streets, discontent over the city’s governance has flared even among usually apolitical sectors of society, and further polarized establishment and pro-democracy camps. On Friday evening, it was clear that many within the administration are unimpressed by their bosses’ handling of the snowballing political crisis. To chants of “add oil”—the protesters’ mantra of encouragement—bureaucrats and civil servants ended the work week by shuffling into Chater Garden, which was the site of a flash mob by financial workers the previous night. “I’ve seen a lot of unfairness over the past two months, I’m very unsatisfied with how the government and police have handled things,” says an official from Hong Kong’s Food and Environmental Hygiene Department who gave her name as Kat. The gathering under spitting evening skies risked blowback from the city’s embattled leaders, who have already warned of possible retribution against wayward administrators. Before the civil servants assembled, the government sought to dampen turnout by calling on “the principle of political neutrality.” “Civil servants should be dedicated; be committed to the rule of law, objectivity and impartiality; and at all times ensure that their behaviour would not impede their performance of official duties in a fair and professional manner,” the Hong Kong government said in a statement Thursday.

Mattias Berglund and Cathrine Hellberg, both in their 20s, chat easily—even giddily—with the four others in their seemingly 1970’s-era compartment, replete with faded velour seats and decidedly unairconditioned temperatures.

Or perhaps it springs from a shared sense of mission. “We’re very concerned about the environment, and I felt guilty when we flew to Barcelona for our last holiday,” says Hellberg, a student, to nods all around. “I feel a little proud now to be taking the train.” This is the season of flygskam, or “flight shame.” You don’t have to be Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist who recently announced plans to sail to New York in August, to recognize that a growing number of Europeans eager to reduce their carbon footprint are opting to limit air travel in favor of more environmentally-friendly means of transportation. Significant enough that even airlines are taking note, flygskam–and its counterpart tagskryt, or train-bragging—is encouraging both European governments and private rail companies to consider investing in the return of long-distance night trains. But the revival of a form of transport that has long seemed consigned to the pages of Agatha Christie novels poses significant obstacles of its own. Leave it to northern Europeans to come up with a neologism to describe a complicated emotional state. As a concept, flygskam originated in Sweden, and refers both to the guilt that individuals may feel when using a means of transportation estimated to contribute between 2 and 3% of total atmospheric carbon and to the shaming they may face should they persist in flying. It was articulated by opera singer Malena Ernmann, who gave up flying in 2016 (and who just happens to be Thunberg’s mother), drawing the attention of other celebrities and the broader public to the cause. The summer of 2018, which brought record high temperatures to Sweden, and with them, devastating wildfires, drove the point home. “It had not been like this ever before,” says Marco Andersson, head of sales for Snålltåget, the Swedish rail company that runs the Malmo-Berlin line. “I think a lot of people started thinking, ‘Oh, I need to change my behavior, maybe I shouldn’t go on vacation to Thailand anymore.’”  Two grassroots initiatives, both launched that year, helped spread the word: Flygfritt, which convinced 14,500 Swedes to renounce air travel in 2019 (it’s shooting for 100,000 in 2020) and Tagsemester, a Facebook group with nearly 100,000 members, that offers information on how to travel by train. Throw in some selfies posted from the sleeping berth of the train Thunberg took to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, as well as European and national elections in which climate concerns played a decisive factor, and Sweden’s anti-plane, pro-rail movement has taken off.  For Snålltåget, which acquired the Malmo-Berlin line in 2011, the impact has been striking. “From 2012 to 2017 we didn’t make a profit,” says Andersson. “Every year, we were asking, why are we still in this business? But all that changed last summer.” During the first six months of 2019, the company, which also runs night trains between Malmo and Stockholm, and, in winter, to the ski town Åre, has seen a 20% increase in ticket sales. Meanwhile, flights between Malmo and Stockholm have declined 10% in the past year, and across Sweden, domestic flights on the whole have fallen 4.5% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the previous year, according to SJ, the national rail company. Yet Sweden isn’t the only place feeling the effects of flygskam (in fact, the Dutch, Germans, and Finns have their own words for it). Flygfritt now has chapters in the UK, France, and Germany and according to Eurail and Interrail General Manager Carlo Boselli, flygskam is influencing the decision to purchase the rail passes (which allow for cross-border travel anywhere on the continent) as well. “According to an internal survey we did,” Boselli says, “the low carbon footprint of rail travel was relevant in the decision about holiday transportation for 71% of Interrailers in 2019–nearly 20% more than in 2017.” The popularity of sites like the U.K.-based Seat61, which offers information on train travel in Europe, or the recent expansion of Omio, a Berlin-based booking platform that links train, bus, and air tickets, only underline this growing interest.  Europe’s largest international passenger rail company, the Austrian ÖBB, has seen a 10% growth this spring and summer over 2018 on some of its lines, including the ones that run from Vienna to Zurich, and Rome to Munich. Spokesman Bernhard Rieder cautions that, in high season, they could do much more. “During summer, there’s no room for us to increase ridership,” he says, “ because we’re already nearly fully booked. On a Saturday in July in Italy, we could be running three trains a night instead of one.” It’s enough to make an airline executive nervous. Speaking before 150 of them at the annual meeting of the International Aviation Transport Association held in Seoul in May, director general Alexandre de Juniac warned of flygskam: “Unchallenged, this sentiment will grow and spread.”","In Europe, the Movement to Give Up Air Travel Is Taking Off.

Visitors to the wave pool at Yulong Shuiyun Water Amusement Park in Longjing got more than they bargained for Monday when a technical malfunction caused a tsunami-like wave to disrupt the previously tranquil waters, videos posted on social media show. The wave appeared to quickly pick up height and speed and carried bathers in inner tubes across the pool, causing them to crash into other visitors. it even flooded into surrounding areas, knocking over bystanders. Forty-four people were injured in the accident, the South China Morning Post reports, and at least five people were hospitalized for injuries including fractured ribs. Despite rumors and jokes on social media that the wave pool operator was responsible for the mishap, local government attributed it to “a power cut that damaged electronic equipment in the tsunami pool control room, which led to the waves in the tsunami pool becoming too big and injuring people,” the Morning Post reports. The park reportedly closed down the wave pool to investigate the incident. The U.S. experiences its fair share of water-park injuries as well, the Associated Press reported in 2016. Though no federal figures exist, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated that 4,200 people in the U.S. annually visited emergency rooms for water-slide-related injuries including scrapes, broken bones and concussions, according to AP.

The list — updated monthly by the One Free Press Coalition, which was created by a dozen news organizations, including TIME, with the goal of defending journalists under attack — identifies the 10 most urgent cases threatening press freedom around the world. In December, TIME named The Guardians the 2018 Person of the Year, recognizing four journalists and one news organization for their work in the face of a “war on truth.” One of those journalists, Jamal Khashoggi, remains atop the latest 10 Most Urgent list, on the heels of a United Nations special report that found “credible evidence” warranting a deeper investigation into the role of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Khashoggi’s killing on Oct. 2, 2018. The report described Khashoggi’s death as a “deliberate, premeditated execution.” The Trump Administration continues to face criticism for maintaining a close relationship with Saudi Arabia despite conclusions by U.S. intelligence officials that bin Salman ordered Khashoggi’s death. Last week, President Donald Trump vetoed bipartisan resolutions that would have blocked billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Read about the 10 journalists on the August list here: Months after his brazen killing, and despite findings from the UN and the CIA that point to the Saudi crown prince’s involvement, there has been no independent criminal investigation. Calls for the White House to release intelligence reports have gone unheeded, along with a deadline to reply to Congress as required under the U.S. Global Magnitsky Act. Azory Gwanda, a freelance journalist investigating mysterious killings in rural Tanzania, has been missing since November 21, 2017, and the government has failed to conduct an investigation or disclose what it knows. On July 10, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Palamagamba Kabudi said in an interview that Gwanda had “disappeared and died,” but backtracked amid requests for clarification.

549,Amy Gunia,"Indonesia is deploying thousands of security personnel to fight fires after a state of emergency was declared in six provinces, an official from the disaster management agency said Wednesday. Nearly 6,000 military, police and disaster mitigation officers will be dispatched, while aircraft will also try to douse the fires, Agus Wibowo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said, according to Reuters. Fires are an annual occurrence during Indonesia’s dry season, which normally runs from about June to October. The blazes — largely caused by illegal slash-and-burn farming methods by palm oil and pulpwood companies — cause serious haze problems in Indonesia and neighboring countries. This year, nearly 50 million of Indonesians are facing drought conditions in 28 of the country’s 34 provinces, Dody Usodo Hargo Suseno, an official of the coordinating ministry for human development, told Reuters. An El Niño weather pattern is exacerbating the dry weather. Wibowo said the number of hot spots detected by satellites has been increasing across Indonesia. The fires raging in provinces on the island of Sumatra and in Kalimantan on Borneo were severe enough to declare an emergency. Fires in 2015, when El Niño caused droughts in a majority of the country’s provinces, were some of the worst in Indonesia’s history.

550,ADELA LIN / BLOOMBERG,"(Bloomberg) — A Chinese warship collided with a Taiwanese freighter Wednesday evening, damaging the bulk carrier, Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration said. The collision occurred around 20 nautical southeast of Taiwan-controlled Kinmen island off China’s southeast coast, according to a statement from the coast guard. No injuries were reported. The statement identified the Chinese vessel as a People’s Liberation Army warship. The coast guard said they managed to make contact with the Chinese ship suspected of being involved in the crash but the captain declined to assist in an investigation into the incident. The incident occurred on an established shipping lane after dark, Chen Chien-wen, a spokesman for the Kinmen Coast Guard, said by phone Thursday. Investigators are looking into how the collision occurred. The collision comes as China increases pressure on Taiwan ahead of the democratic island’s presidential elections in January. Beijing on Wednesday issued a surprise ban on individual tourists from 47 Chinese cities traveling to Taiwan. The U.S. has increased its number of transits by its warships through the Taiwan Strait this year, signaling its support for the island in the face of Chinese threats to reclaim Taiwan by force.

551,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"China’s military has released a video showing troops carrying out drills and cracking down on protestors in what appears to be a warning aimed at Hong Kong as the city approaches its ninth straight week of demonstrations. The video was posted Wednesday by the People’s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo. In the captions, the military declares support for the city’s Beijing-backed government, and emphasizes the army’s role in protecting Hong Kong’s stability. The three-minute clip features troops unleashing rounds of gunfire, blowing up cars, unrolling barbed-wire barricades and launching missiles. In a shot eerily reminiscent of clashes at recent weekend protests, officers armed with body-length shields march forward and fire at fleeing protestors. The advancing officials hold up a red warning sign nearly identical to the one used by Hong Kong police that says “Stop Charging Or We Use Force.” At the end of the drill, arrested protesters are ushered toward detention sites. The video increases fears that the Chinese military could send forces to quash the sustained protests in the semi-autonomous territory. Its release come amid escalating rhetoric from Beijing. Just last week, a spokesperson for the Chinese defense ministry said Beijing could stage an unprecedented intervention if the Hong Kong government sought its assistance. The video was shown at a reception in Hong Kong to celebrate the 92nd anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), according to Agence France-Presse. During a speech, Major-General Chen Daoxiang, the commander of the Hong Kong garrison, reportedly condemned the protesters for incidents that have “seriously threatened the life and safety of Hong Kong citizens.” On Monday, the top Chinese government department responsible for handling Hong Kong affairs also denounced the ongoing unrest.

552,Amy Gunia,"A Chinese metals tycoon has been indicted in the U.S. over allegations that he avoided paying $1.8 billion in tariffs on aluminum imports, Agence France-Presse reported Thursday. Liu Zhongtian is accused of disguising aluminum as other products to smuggle the material into the U.S. from 2008 onwards. His company, China Zhongwang Holdings, as well as several other individuals and shell companies were named in the indictment, which was filed at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles. “This indictment outlines the unscrupulous and anti-competitive practices of a corrupt businessman who defrauded the United States out of US$1.8 billion in tariffs due on Chinese imports,” prosecutor Nick Hanna said, according to AFP. The smuggling scheme allegedly involved welding aluminum imports together to resemble pallets, which are not subject to tariffs. Once the metal was in the U.S., it was melted and resold in other forms, AFP reports. Liu and his conspirators have been charged with nine counts of wire fraud, seven counts of passing false and fraudulent papers through customs and conspiracy. AFP reports that Liu could not be reached for comment. According to the Wall Street Journal, an arrest warrant has been drawn up for Liu, who is believed to be in China.

553,Angelina Jolie,"We Americans have been confronted by devastating images from our southern border and increasingly polarized views on how to address this untenable situation.  At times I wonder if we are retreating from the ideal of America as a country founded by and for brave, bold, freedom-seeking rebels, and becoming instead inward-looking and fearful.  I suspect many of us will refuse to retreat. We grew up in this beautiful, free country, in all its diversity. We know nothing good ever came of fear, and that our own history — including the shameful mistreatment of Native Americans — should incline us to humility and respect when considering the question of migration. I’m not a lawyer, an asylum seeker, or one of the people working every day to protect our borders and run our immigration system. But I work with the UN Refugee Agency, which operates in 134 countries to protect and support many of the over 70 million people displaced by conflict and persecution.  We in America are starting to experience on our borders some of the pressures other nations have faced for years: countries like Turkey, Uganda and Sudan, which host 6 million refugees between them. Or Lebanon, where every sixth person is a refugee. Or Colombia, which is hosting over 1 million Venezuelans in a country slightly less than twice the size of Texas. There are lessons — and warnings — we can derive from the global refugee situation.  The first is that this is about more than just one border. Unless we address the factors forcing people to move, from war to economic desperation to climate change, we will face ever-growing human displacement. If you don’t address these problems at their source, you will always have people at your borders. People fleeing out of desperation will brave any obstacle in front of them. Second, countries producing the migration or refugee flow have the greatest responsibility to take measures to protect their citizens and address the insecurity, corruption and violence causing people to flee. But assisting them with that task is in our interest. Former senior military figures urge the restoration of U.S. aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, arguing that helping to build the rule of law, respect for human rights and stability is the only way to create alternatives to migration. The UN Refugee Agency is calling for an urgent summit of governments in the Americas to address the displacement crisis. These seem logical, overdue steps. Our development assistance to other countries is not a bargaining chip, it is an investment in our long-term security. Showing leadership and working with other countries is a measure of strength, not a sign of weakness. Third, we have a vital interest in upholding international laws and standards on asylum and protection. It is troubling to see our country backing away from these, while expecting other countries, who are hosting millions of refugees and asylum seekers, to adhere to a stricter code. If we go down this path, we risk a race to the bottom and far greater chaos. An international rules-based system brings order. Breaking international standards only encourages more rule-breaking.",Angelina Jolie: The Crisis We Face at the Border Does Not Require Us to Choose Between Security and Humanity,"July 31, 2019"
554,Ian Bremmer,"Over last weekend, the decision by Russian electoral authorities to bar independent and opposition candidates from running in Moscow City Council elections prompted protests that turned violent as Moscow police cracked down hard on those that turned out, leading to the arrests of nearly 1,400. Meanwhile, the opposition figure and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny—who had urged people to turn up at the protests and had been jailed for 30 days in the run-up to them as a result—mysteriously developed an “allergic” reaction while in police custody. He has since been treated at a hospital and returned to his jail cell. Why It Matters: Protests are not new to Moscow. But the intensity with which these protests were met by Moscow police caught many political observers off guard. Why? A couple of reasons. The first is that the stakes were low, as Moscow City Council elections have little impact on national, let alone international, politics. And yet the police responded as if these protests directly threatened the Russian state—this was the most arrests at a Russian protest in more than a decade. Secondly, the Kremlin had seemed more responsive in recent months to public outcry—see the decisions to release an investigative journalist who was arrested on suspicious charges, or to pause plans to build a church on park grounds in Yekaterinburg. The Kremlin under Putin is not known for backing down, so the recent moves seemed to be an acknowledgement that a struggling economy, falling salaries, an unpopular pension reform plan, higher taxes, continued corruption and declining living standards hit Russians hard; some have gone so far as to hope a degree of political liberalization was forthcoming. The response to the protests this weekend—as well as that mysterious “allergy” that opposition-leader Navalny developed while in custody—put an end to any such optimism. What Happens Next: The intensity with which the protesters were put down is a troubling sign that rather than allowing some space for liberalizations, the Kremlin has decided to go full-bore on repression, signaling its approach ahead of the 2021 national elections. In the more immediate term, Moscow is looking at a City Council packed with Kremlin loyalists—they’re in too deep to do anything else at this point. More interesting is what happens between now and those Duma elections in 2021, especially as a Russian economy propped up by energy exports faces serious headwinds. Putin and his United Russia party will win those elections—it’s possible that the Kremlin will introduce electoral changes to make sure its preferred candidates win. But it’s getting harder for them to use the same tools to stay in power that they used to. Moscow understands the daily lives of citizens are becoming harder, which makes increased social spending to satisfy the public more likely, but that just causes bigger economic problems down the line.

555,Charlie Campbell,"Huang Shunjie might just have the best job in the world. The 24-year-old spends each day caring for 18 panda cubs at the Giant Panda Protection and Research Center outside China’s central city of Chengdu. He prepares their meals of bamboo and milk formula, checks on their growth and health, and carries these two-tone fluff-balls between their sleeping pens and the cooing of their public enclosure. “The best part is that I can get very close to the baby pandas, which makes many people jealous,” he says. “I get to hug them all the time.” Among the brood are two record-breaking recent additions. He-He and Mei-Mei — a brother and sister whose names translate as “harmony” and “happiness” respectively — celebrated their first birthdays on July 25 as the only twin pandas born from a wild father and captive mother. It’s a vital breakthrough that broadens the genetic pool and thus longterm sustainability for the bears, which were among the world’s most threatened animals until recently. “Mei-Mei is very cute and clingy,” says Huang, a native of Sichuan province who graduated in construction engineering before finding work as a panda photographer and then zookeeper. “But her brother is very naughty. He is one of the wild kids and loves making trouble.” There are, of course, downsides to any job. In Huang’s case, it’s the regular bites and scratches he receives from 45-55 pound bears still exploring their own strength — as well as the lingering pong of panda poo. But it’s a small price to pay to dote daily on these epitomes of roly-poly cuteness up close. Every shift is a succession of tumbling off toys, balancing on heads, or generally lolloping around like furry toddlers. “I’m a full-time daddy for these fluffy baby pandas,” says Huang. “If I take some days off to go home, I feel empty inside. If I can’t hear them bleating, if I can’t see them, it feels like life is not real.” For many years, giant pandas, which are native to China, were one of the world’s most endangered creatures as unbridled development decimated their natural habitats in bamboo forests. These famous vegetarians must eat 30 to 85 pounds of bamboo every day. But population numbers have recovered in recent years thanks to intensive breeding programs using artificial insemination. In 2016, pandas were downgraded by the International Union for Conservation of Nature from “endangered” to the less acute “vulnerable” category. Today, there are 1,864 pandas in the wild up from only 1,114 in the 1970s, according to China’s State Forestry and Grassland Administration, two-thirds of which live across 67 dedicated nature reserves.",'I Get to Hug Them All the Time.'

The scheme had been in place since 2011 under the more China-friendly administration of former President Ma Ying-jeou. The ministry’s statement didn’t provide any further details as to the reason for the ban. The unexpected move comes as China attempts to isolate Taiwan and Tsai Ing-wen, it’s independence-leaning president.

560,Madeline Fitzgerald,"A spot of brightness recently emerged amid the the gray desert sand and the dark steel fencing laid across the border of Sunland Park, New Mexico, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico: flamingo pink see-saws that cut through the border wall were installed over the weekend, allowing American and Mexican children an opportunity to play together — with the very wall that separates them serving as part of the playscape.  The three see-saws, which were in use for about a half hour of play-time on Sunday, were intended to bring togetherness and unity to people on either side of the border. The duo responsible, Ronald Rael, an architecture professor at UC Berkeley, and Virginia San Fratello, an interior design professor at San Jose State University, first conceived of the project ten years ago. (Rael and San Fratello are also the co-founders of the 3D printing company Emerging Objects.) In a caption accompanying a video and pictures of the see-saws in use, Rael wrote that that the project was “One of the most incredible experiences of my and [San Fratello’s] career, bringing to life the conceptual drawings of the Teetertotter Wall from 2009 in an event filled with joy, excitement, and togetherness at the border wall.”    The installation was put to use by the children on both sides of the fence. Rael and San Fratello both posted images on social media showing kids — and some adults — playing together on the seesaws. According to San Fratello, the children lived close to the border fencing in both countries, and were already outside when the see-saws were installed. “As soon as someone comes up to the border wall, they come up and will engage you,” she tells TIME. “When we showed up with the teetertotters, they were there and ready to play.”   Rael and San Fratello began conceiving the project while doing architectural work near the border following the passage of the Secure Fence Act of 2006. “We had been traveling in that region and saw the increased border security and the construction of the wall over the years,” San Fratello says. “We started to develop these counter proposals and commentary as a way of rethinking what the border is.” While the border is quite literally a dividing line between the United States and Mexico, San Fratello says that is “also a place where people come together. We wanted to create scenarios that would celebrate togetherness. And also highlight the ridiculousness of the border wall.”","'Joy, Excitement, and Togetherness at the Border.'

Prosecutors say the rapper and two other suspects “deliberately, together and in agreement” attacked 19-year-old Mustafa Jafari, who is now asking for 139,700 Swedish kroner ($14,700) in damages for his injuries, lost income and damage to his appearance, according to the Associated Press. A$AP Rocky’s lawyer has said the rapper and his companions were acting in self-defense. A lawyer for Jafari, Magnus Stromberg, told the Associated Press that the beating started when one of A$AP Rocky’s bodyguards “grabbed [Jafari] by the neck and dragged him away.” Court documents show photos of Jafari with “cuts, bruises and blood-stained clothes.” Slobodan Jovicic, a defense lawyer for A$AP Rocky, denied the accusation that a bottle was used in the attack on Jafari. “I’m pretty sure that when we are done, we’re going to show that no bottle has been used or not in the way that the prosecutor is claiming anyway,” Jovicic said.",A$AP Rocky Testifies That He Acted in Self Defense at Assault Trial in Sweden,"July 30, 2019"
562,Prachi Vidwans,"Tuesday is the U.N.’s World Day Against Trafficking in Persons. After nearly two decades of international commitment to end modern slavery, one thing is clear: States are simply not doing enough. It is estimated that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery, including sex trafficking and forced marriage. Eighty percent are victims of forced labor — a problem that is poorly understood by the general public. Twenty-five percent of trafficking victims worldwide are children. Human trafficking is an epidemic in and of itself. But it’s also a symptom of other deeply-rooted, international challenges — the refugee crisis, civil conflict, poverty, and more. This is a generally accepted truth. But there’s another root cause that is rarely, if ever, discussed: authoritarianism. Each year, the U.S. State Department releases a trafficking report that categorizes countries according to the strength of their anti-trafficking efforts. There are four categories: Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 2 Watchlist, and Tier 3. For a country to be categorized as Tier 1, its government should have gone above and beyond in prosecuting traffickers, protecting victims, preventing new trafficking cases, and partnering with civil society to come up with new solutions. In this year’s report, published in June, 94% of Tier 1 countries have democratic governments. Meanwhile, just 6% of ranked authoritarian states make it into that category. Tier 3’s list is 90% authoritarian and 10% democratic. The correlation is clear, and, as the Human Rights Foundation notes, persists from year to year. Yet few anti-trafficking experts and advocates discuss the relationship between weak anti-trafficking policies and authoritarianism. This year’s trafficking report urges governments to “look inward” to address trafficking within their own borders making it distinct from past reports. Doing so requires transparency, accountability, the rule of law, and free and public discourse — rare resources under authoritarian regimes. Yet the words “democracy” and “authoritarianism” are never even mentioned in the State Department’s report. And this oversight is not new: Year after year, the report fails to discuss how authoritarianism contributes to human trafficking.  Take Thailand, for example. This year’s trafficking report ranks Thailand in Tier 2, among authoritarian states like Zimbabwe and Tajikistan, as well as democracies like Germany and Denmark. But even as Thailand has “increased efforts” in anti-trafficking, its military junta has increased repression as well, shutting down opposition media outlets, expanding censorship, and prosecuting hundreds of dissidents. In a climate where advocates are ruthlessly silenced, anti-trafficking reforms have been implemented top down, without consultation from the community. As the rule of law weakens, the country has convicted fewer traffickers and launched a paltry number of investigations. And with recent mass arrests of protesters and ongoing criminal trials against activists, it’s unlikely that victims or their advocates feel able to push for the full implementation of reforms. The international community has been able to pressure Thailand to address trafficking. For example, after the Guardian’s damning 2014 investigation about slavery in the fishing industry, the Thai government increased its efforts to combat labor trafficking, even creating a new court dedicated to addressing human trafficking. But without deeper, institutional change, the effects were short-lived.  Lasting change would require upending the Thai court system entirely to re-establish rule of law; engaging civil society and victims of trafficking directly to learn from their experiences; and reforming the electoral system so government representatives are truly accountable to voters. In the absence of this systemic reform, slavery continues to be rampant in the Thai fishing industry, and recent government-run investigations into trafficking are no more than a “theatrical exercise for international consumption,” according to Human Rights Watch.",Human Trafficking Has a Hidden Cause — and It's on the Rise Worldwide,"July 30, 2019"

And it has a lot to do with the state of the environment. In a lengthy and wide-ranging interview between Prince Harry and famous primatologist and environmental activist Jane Goodall, the two discussed being a steward of the environment even before having kids. Goodall suggested having “not too many!” The Duke’s response: “Two, maximum!” Harry went on: “But I’ve always thought: this place is borrowed. And, surely, being as intelligent as we all are, or as evolved as we all are supposed to be, we should be able to leave something better behind for the next generation.” Goodall concurred: “But, in fact, we’ve stolen their future. Not all of it. But we’ve got to try and pay a little of it back. And get together to try and heal some of the harm, and at least slow down climate change.” Prince Harry has been a longtime supporter of environmental causes, while Goodall’s most recent efforts have focused on getting young people involved in community development, conservation and leadership. It’s been a good week already for fans of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their famous friends, as Meghan Markle shared the news of her role as guest editor for British Vogue. Since then, the magazine has been distributing tidbits from the upcoming September issue, including this exchange between Harry and Goodall and a conversation between Markle and former First Lady Michelle Obama.

Movie World in Queensland, Australia, recently got a bit more thrill than she bargained for when a large bird flew into her face mid-ride. A video captured by the amusement park that was shared on Facebook by Nicole Ormiston shows the shocking moment that a rogue ibis, an Australian wading bird, smashed into Paige Ormiston while she was riding in the front seat of the rollercoaster. “Paige just got hit by an ibis while riding front seat on the DC Rival Hypercoaster with Uncle Mitch,” the post read. “She had feathers on her and a beak scratch on her right shoulder. She’s completely shocked, a little bruised but ok not sure about the bird? How can you not buy that video.” Paige later told 9News that the look of extreme terror on her face was a a result of the fact that she didn’t know what hit her. “I was very scared.

565,Irina Gordienko,"One year ago, on July 30, 2018, three Russian journalists were shot to death and their bodies left on the side of a road near a conflict zone in central Africa. Their names were Orkhan Dzhemal, a renowned conflict reporter; Alexander Rastorguev, an award-winning filmmaker; and their cameraman, Kirill Radchenko. The purpose of their trip to the Central African Republic was to film a documentary about the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company which has been active in several African countries in recent years, and which is believed to have ties with the Russian military and the state. Authorities in Moscow say the reporters were killed in a random act of violence. It was a robbery gone wrong, goes the official line. But the colleagues of the victims have investigated the murders independently over the past year, and have come to a different conclusion — that known associates of the Wagner Group were involved in these murders. The victims’ friends and families have meanwhile pled with the authorities in Russia to consider this evidence. Among the most vocal has been Dzhemal’s ex-wife, Irina Gordienko, who is also one of Russia’s most famous reporters. Ahead of the one-year anniversary of the murders, Gordienko described her experience not as a journalist but as a person bereaved and looking for justice.  A version of her account was first published in Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s last independent newspapers, where Gordienko is a correspondent. With her permission, TIME is publishing an edited translation of the piece as part of its Guardians series on the escalating war against the freedom of the press worldwide.  Most of my 17 years as a journalist have been spent reporting on the tougher parts of Russia, around the region known as the Caucasus, which has seen too much of war. I have seen dead bodies there, and the signs of inhuman torture that the heroes of my articles endured. I have written a lot about prisons, some of which still haunt me in my dreams. I’ve had to deal with just about every sort of police officer, investigator and prosecutor. But nothing quite prepared me for that day one year ago when Russian authorities summoned me in relation to the murder of my former husband, the journalist Orkhan Dzhemal. Under the rules of Russian criminal procedure, they had classified me as a victim in the case. I wasn’t the only one. Kirill and Alexander both left behind grieving parents. Orkhan and I have a son. In some ways my work had prepared me for victimhood; I have written about hundreds of criminal cases in which the interests of regular people are barely taken into account. But I never realized what it really means to be a victim, or as the cops like to call me, a terpila, their heartless slang for someone who is made to endure. Look the word “terpila” up in the Russian dictionary, and you will find several definitions — including “a weakling incapable of self-defense.” Indeed, that pretty much describes how I feel after dealing with Russian investigators in the year since Orkhan was murdered. I should clarify something before going further: As an official victim in this case, I have signed an agreement with the Russian authorities “on the non-disclosure of information on the preliminary investigation.” It prohibits me from sharing what I know of the police work behind this case. But I’m not too worried about violating that agreement, because I haven’t seen much police work going on.",My Son's Father Was Killed While Reporting on a Private Russian Militia.

566,Billy Perrigo,"By the time the fire at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was extinguished in April, the entire roof had vanished. Made from hundreds of tons of lead, it had melted in the high heat, dispersing toxic particles across nearby streets and buildings and into the cathedral itself. Now, an environmental group has accused Paris authorities of doing too little to mitigate the risks of lead poisoning after the fire, alleging that both city authorities and the diocese had allowed residents, visitors and workers to be exposed to a “toxic fallout.” After the Notre Dame fire, officials said there was no danger to people living and working in the surrounding area. But the lawsuit, filed by the group Robin des Bois, alleges the city knowingly put people in danger by doing too little to tackle the fallout. TIME exclusive: Inside the Fight Over How Notre Dame Should Rise From the Ashes Lead poisoning, caused by ingesting too much of the substance through the air or through food and drink, can be especially dangerous to pregnant women, leading to developmental problems in unborn babies or miscarriage. But it can also affect children and other adults. Symptoms can include high blood pressure, memory loss and hearing loss. An investigation by the French news site Mediapart revealed that French authorities did not carry out lead tests at kindergartens and schools near Notre Dame until a month after the fire. When the tests were finally carried out, according to Mediapart, one found levels of lead that were 10 times higher than the lowest level considered to be dangerous to human health. Now, several schools are being “deep cleaned” to remove lead, according to the Guardian. Cleanup at the cathedral was paused earlier this month over concerns that precautions to avoid lead poisoning were not stringent enough, according to Sky News. When TIME visited the Notre Dame site in July, we were obliged to wear disposable overalls and advised to launder all clothing afterward to disperse dangerous lead particles.",Notre Dame Fire: Environmental Group Files Lead Poisoning Lawsuit,"July 30, 2019"
567,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"An official from China’s northwestern Xinjiang region called the country’s practice of detaining Muslim minorities a “pioneering” approach to combating terrorism, and claimed that most people interned in controversial facilities have been released. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing Tuesday, Shohrat Zakir, Xinjiang’s Uighur governor, said that most of the detainees who were held in the euphemistically dubbed “re-education centers” have left after signing “work contracts” with area companies, the Associated Press reports. Zakir declined to provide the number of people still arbitrarily detained, according to AP, but the U.S. State Department estimates up to 2 million Turkic Muslims are being held in the internment camps. Beijing has drawn international condemnation for the practice. After initially denying the existence of a mass incarceration program, the Chinese government defended the detentions as a form of “re-education” and “vocational training,” comparing the centers to “boarding schools.” “Most of the graduates from the vocational training centers have been reintegrated into society,” Zakir said. “More than 90% of the graduates have found satisfactory jobs with good incomes.” Detainees who have been released from the camps however have reported being subjected to political indoctrination that seeks to instill loyalty to the Communist Party and to prevent the observance of Islam. Another official, Xinjiang Vice Chairman Alken Tuniaz, defended the camps and said that detainees were allowed to “request time off” and “regularly go home.” Although people in camps were not allowed to practice religion during their “period of study” they are permitted to practice their faith at home, he said according to AP. Activists rebuked both officials’ claims. “Shohrat Zakir’s remarks completely distort the reality of the systematic persecution that Uighurs are suffering in China,” said Dilxat Raxit, a spokesperson for the World Uyghur Congress.",Chinese Officials Defend Xinjiang Camps as a 'Pioneering' Approach for Fighting Terrorism,"July 30, 2019"
568,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"Hundreds of protesters disrupted subway stations across Hong Kong during the busy morning commute Tuesday, blocking carriage doors and preventing the trains from leaving. Harried passengers faced transportation chaos as groups of demonstrators flooded the platforms and forced service delays or partial suspensions. Protests have rocked Asia’s financial capital for eight consecutive weeks in a movement that has pitted demonstrators against the city’s Beijing-back administration. Increasingly, the protests have pursued tactics that interrupt daily life in the city. Tuesday morning’s train disruptions, the second in a week, followed a sit-in at the city’s international airport on Friday, as well as rallies that ended in violent clashes and police firing tear gas in residential areas on Saturday and Sunday. While the protests were sparked in June by an extradition bill that has since been suspended, the movement has morphed into a broader revolt against the Chinese government’s control over the semi-autonomous enclave. Beijing has maintained its support for the police and the city’s embattled leader. The train disruptions also come the day after a spokesperson for China’s top policy office in Hong Kong called an unprecedented press conference to denounce the protesters. Videos on social media showed protesters obstructing train doors at the Tiu Keng Leng station before 8 a.m. Tuesday. For several minutes the train was unable to shut the doors and leave. The tactic was repeated across several other stations, and Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) reported backlogs and interruptions due to a number of incidents “involving train door obstruction.” The MTR said free shuttle buses would be provided at the impeded stops.

569,Amy Gunia,"Across the world calls to protect the planet are growing louder, yet standing up against the deleterious effects of mining, logging and agribusiness continues to be fatal, U.K.-based watchdog Global Witness said in a new report Tuesday. By sheer number, the Philippines was found to be the deadliest country for environmental defenders in 2018, with 30 environmentalists murdered. But around the globe, more than three defenders were killed each week of last year, the group’s latest report Enemies of the State? says. “These are ordinary people trying to protect their homes and livelihoods, and standing up for the health of our planet,” Global Witness said in a release. While the total last year, 164 deaths, represents a drop from the 2017 peak of 201, the group notes that non-lethal means of quashing dissent are also rampant. “Countless more people were threatened, arrested or thrown in jail for daring to oppose the governments or companies seeking to profit from their land,” it said. It is common for businesses and authorities to “use courts and legal systems to silence those who threaten their interests,” the report notes. The report calls renewed international attention to the bloodshed that has occurred under President Rodrigo Duterte’s watch. Soon after coming to power in 2016, Duterte declared a deadly crackdown on drugs and his administration has been mired in accusations of human rights abuses and violence. In 2017, Global Witness said 48 environmental defenders were killed on the archipelagic nation, the highest ever recorded in an Asian country. In both 2017 and 2018, a large number of those deaths were linked to agribusiness. Globally, mining was responsible for the largest number of killings—43 deaths—while conflicts over water projects surged at 17 deaths. Across sectors, demand for consumer products—from food to jewelry to mobile phones—drives the persecution, the report says.","164 Environmental Activists Were Killed While Protecting Their Homes Last Year, Watchdog Says","July 30, 2019"
570,Melissa Locker,"Archaeologists working on a dig outside of Bloomberg’s new London headquarters have made a new discovery—dad jokes have been around for nearly 2,000 years. According to The Guardian, a team discovered an iron stylus—a pen—complete with an inscribed joke, that apparently dates back to around 70 A.D. The inscription on the pen reads: “I have come from the City. I bring you a welcome gift with a sharp point that you may remember me. I ask, if fortune allowed, that I might be able (to give) as generously as the way is long (and) as my purse is empty.” In other words: Some 2,000 years ago, a Roman made the long journey to London and all they brought their friends was a pen with a joke about being broke. “‘The City’ referred to is very likely Rome,” the Museum of London Archeology, which oversaw the dig, said in a blog post, adding that “the stylus suggests a direct link between Roman Italy and the province of Britannia.” According to the museum, London, or Londinium as it was known at the time, was far from the center of the Roman Empire, “had grown into an important centre for commerce and governance, interconnected with the wider Roman world.” As the Roman Empire spread across Europe, travelers needed ways to keep in touch with friends and family and business acquaintances back home using iron styluses to write on wax-filled wooden writing tablets. “The stylus and its inscription highlights the crucial role that writing and literacy played in allowing traders, soldiers and officials to keep in contact with peers, friends and family, some of whom lived over a thousand miles away,” the museum wrote. While dad jokes are not rare, inscribed styluses are “exceptionally” so. According to the museum, “archaeologists have found only a handful of examples from across the whole Roman Empire to date, and the Bloomberg inscription is the finest, unparalleled in the length, poetry and humour of its inscription.” The joke pen wasn’t the only artifact that was unearthed during the excavation that place at the new Bloomberg headquarters in London between 2010 and 2014. In fact, more than 14,000 artifacts were uncovered from their resting place under the streets of London, including the first written reference to the name of the city, and more than 600 are on display at London Mithraeum Bloomberg SPACE.  Archaeology is central to Bloomberg’s Stirling Prize-winning building. The building’s design includes a public pedestrian arcade that re-establishes an ancient Roman road and a museum displaying the Roman temple of Mithras in its original location.

The 16-year-old started a strike from school in her hometown of Stockholm in August 2018 to protest government inaction on the climate crisis. Since she started striking, the movement has gone global, with an estimated 1.6 million students worldwide participating in demonstrations in March. Thunberg is now taking a sabbatical year from school, and is hoping to meet with people on the front line of the climate change movement during her trip to North America, which will include visits to Canada, Mexico and Chile. Departing from the U.K. in mid-August, she will join large-scale climate demonstrations timed to Climate Week in New York City starting September 20, and will speak at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on September 23. Thunberg hinted at such a journey in April, when TIME traveled with her by train from London to Stockholm. The teenager avoids air travel because of the high levels of carbon emissions caused by airplanes and has so far traveled by train around Europe for speaking engagements, where her frank speeches directed towards world leaders have garnered international attention. For her Americas trip, Thunberg will be sailing on board a zero-carbon racing boat called Malizia II, fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate electricity on board the vessel. The journey from the U.K. to New York will take approximately two weeks. “We still have a window of time when things are in our own hands. But that window is closing fast. That is why I have decided to make this trip now,” Thunberg said in a statement. “During the past year, millions of young people have raised their voice to make world leaders wake up to the climate and ecological emergency. Over the next months, the events in New York and Santiago de Chile will show if they have listened. Together with many other young people across the Americas and the world, I will be there, even if the journey will be long and challenging. We will make our voices heard.

573,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"The top Chinese government department responsible for handling Hong Kong affairs denounced the ongoing unrest Monday, after another weekend of violent clashes between antigovernment demonstrators and police. Speaking during a press conference in the afternoon, Yang Guang of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) said “We hope that the people of Hong Kong, from all walks of life, can oppose this riotous behavior.” He attacked the “small number of radical protestors” who “have seriously damaged Hong Kong’s reputation and challenged Hong Kong’s rule of law” and stressed that the Hong Kong government and police force had Beijing’s full backing. “We are confident that with the full support of the central government and the mainland … our Hong Kong compatriots will be able to govern, develop and manage Hong Kong well, and Hong Kong will overcome the difficulties and challenges going forward,” he said.  It is the first time that the office has held a press conference since the former British colony was retroceded to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, indicating the seriousness with which Beijing views the territory’s political crisis. The remarks came just hours after communist mouthpiece the People’s Daily warned that Hong Kong’s “bright future” lay in its “being backed by the motherland.” The weeks of continued protests were originally sparked by a now suspended Hong Kong government bill that would have allowed the extradition of fugitives to mainland China for the first time. Critics fear such a provision would be used to apprehend dissidents and political opponents. The demonstrations have since evolved into a push for greater democracy and a rebellion against Chinese sovereignty itself.

574,TIME Staff,"Police fired round after round of tear gas to disperse tens of thousands of demonstrators who defied an official ban and flooded Hong Kong’s residential town of Yuen Long Saturday, bringing their months-long pro-democracy protests to the doorstep of a divided suburb that was the site of bloody mob violence against activists early this week. The ordinarily quiet cluster of villages near the China border became a flashpoint in the city’s spiraling crisis last Sunday after a mob of suspected gangsters attacked demonstrators, journalists and passersby at a mass transit station in the most barbaric episode of protest-related violence since the unrest began in early June. Police were accused of turning a blind eye as they ran amok, a charge officials denied.  Dressed mainly in black shirts, yellow hard hats and face masks, the de facto  uniform of the city’s protest movement, a massive crowd turned out to vent their anger over perceived police inaction during the assault, carried out in two waves of violence over the course of two hours. Organizers of Saturday’s march resorted to satire to evade the official ban; flyers advertised “full gear” activities such as shopping and playing Pokémon GO to justify the large assembly. “We aren’t calling today a protest,” said Joanne, a 23-year-old professional event organizer who, like many of the protesters, declined to use her given name for fear of legal action. “Some people are here for good food, for sightseeing or for shopping,” she added. “We just all happen to be gathered, and we happen to be angry at the police, but we can’t call it a protest.” Authorities began trying to clear the roads shortly after 5 p.m., following warnings to leave the area. Residents watched from their rooftops as protesters lobbed what appeared to be smoke bombs in chaotic exchanges with police. Local reports said a round of tear gas was shot in the direction of a home for the elderly, further angering protesters including lawmaker Roy Kwong, a key figure in the movement that has been widely described as “leaderless.” Crowds began leaving en masse just after 7 p.m., shouting “retreat!” Police in riot gear had been positioned early along the route in anticipation of clashes. The protesters’ anger was palpable, assembling wherever they saw police lines, yelling, calling them names and showing them the middle finger. Some were seen spray-painting graffiti on the side of a besieged police van. A “Yuen Long Manifesto” of unknown origin circulated online, accusing police of colluding with the attackers, labeling them “a band of notorious ruffians” and demanding a public apology. In the chaos that ensued Sunday, dozens of men wearing white shirts and armed mostly with sticks appeared to target protesters returning from a march in the city center, injuring at least 45 people including a lawmaker and several local reporters. The assailants are believed to be associated with “triads,” organized criminal gangs that have long been accused of acting as paid, extra-legal enforcers of social order. At least 12 men have reportedly been arrested, some with connections to triad groups. “We are quite angry about what happened on 7/21, it was a riot, they hit and beat any person including children, women and even press,” says Lau, a 50-year-old engineer from Hong Kong’s northern New Territories. He believes the Chinese Communist Party was linked to the attack. “But the underlying problem is the interference from the Chinese government,” he said, “they invited these village gangsters in.”",Hong Kong Protesters Clash With Police at March Against Mob Violence,"Updated: July 27, 2019 7:24 AM ET"
575,Sanya Mansoor,"Airstrikes in Syria over the last 10 days have killed more than 100 civilians, according to the U.N., which has criticized the “apparent international indifference” in response to the escalating violence. The death toll includes at least 26 children. The Syrian government, backed by the Russian air force, said the increases in attacks on Idlib and areas in northwest Syria, the last remaining major anti-government stronghold, was due to violations of a truce by jihadists with links to al-Qaeda, the BBC reports. The latest offensive against the rebel enclave began at the end of April, since then the U.N. has documented the deaths of at least 450 civilians, including those recently killed. The U.N High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet condemned the Syrian government, under President Bashar al-Assad, and its allies for the “latest relentless campaign of airstrikes” in a forceful statement, saying they have “continued to hit medical facilities, schools and other civilian infrastructure such as markets and bakeries.” “Intentional attacks against civilians are war crimes, and those who have ordered them or carried them out are criminally responsible for their actions,” Bachelet said. Eight of the airstrikes hit Idlib and two struck rural Aleppo, according to the statement. Idlib is home to more than three million civilians, half of whom have been displaced at least once, Sara Kayyali, a researcher with Human Rights Watch who specializes in Syrian issues, tells TIME. They are “trapped between a rock and a hard place,” Kayyali says, explaining that they are victims of extensive bombings by the Syrian-Russian military alliance and can’t escape into bordering Turkey to flee the violence. Those who try are putting their lives in danger. “Turkish border guards will shoot at them and if they don’t kill them, they immediately return them to Idlib,” Kayyali says.",U.N.

576,Ian Bremmer,"Boris Johnson became the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister this week. The former London mayor and foreign secretary assumed the U.K.’s premiership with a mandate to lead the U.K. out of the E.U. He has promised to secure a better Brexit deal with Brussels than his predecessor, Theresa May. He has also promised to pull the U.K. out of the E.U. by the October 31 deadline, deal or no.  Why It Matters: Because the UK is heading into the biggest peacetime political crisis in generations, and the person leading his country into the great unknown must corral a British public and political class that has never fundamentally agreed on what form Brexit should take—Hard Brexit, Soft Brexit, No-Deal Brexit or anything in between. In Boris Johnson, that task has now fallen to someone who can charitably be described as Britain’s most divisive politician. Johnson himself has taken a hardline stance on Brexit, which he needed to do in order to win over the Conservative party membership and become Prime Minister. It was a strategy that worked, as 66 percent of Tory members selected him over his more-centrist rival. There are those who still harbor hope that Boris’ hardline approach to Brexit and Brussels is more bluster than anything else; Boris has a well-deserved reputation for political opportunism. But even if that’s the case, renegotiating a deal with EU leaders is an uphill battle—the EU is adamant that it is done negotiating, and the deadline is less than 3 months away. Complicating matters even further, Johnson has spent decades taking swipes at EU leaders and Brussels… the same kind of EU leaders who he now needs to play ball with. What Happens Next: Within 48 hours of assuming the premiership, Johnson had dismissed a significant portion of Theresa May’s cabinet, replacing most of them with hardline Brexiteers. But while his cabinet might be filled with folks pushing for a no-deal Brexit should it come to that, the same cannot be said for the whole of his party—there are a number of members who find the very idea of a no-deal Brexit (and the chaos that will inevitably follow) abhorrent, and multiple Tory members of parliament have indicated they will do what it takes to stop that from happening, even while Johnson tries to use the threat of no-deal Brexit as leverage in negotiations. Brussels, for its part, has refused to renegotiate the substance of the Brexit deal that it struck with Theresa May—because of the logistical difficulties involved, and because the political optics of backing down to the UK (and one led by Boris Johnson no less) make that extremely unappealing. Which means the likeliest scenario we’re looking at is UK general elections in the fall, potentially triggered by Tory party members who would rather see their own Conservative government fall than see a no-deal Brexit come to pass. The Key Statistic That Explains It: According to a YouGov survey done back in April, just 25 percent of people in the U.K. would consider a no-deal Brexit a “good outcome”; another 13 percent would find it “an acceptable outcome”. 50 percent were flat out against it, and another 12 percent weren’t sure. In other words, a winning strategy for the Tory party leadership race is quite different from winning a general election race. Boris won the battle, but the war still lays ahead.",What Boris Johnson's Premiership Means for Brexit and the U.K.,"July 26, 2019"
577,Billy Perrigo,"By the time night fell on Boris Johnson’s first day as British Prime Minister, he had got rid of more than half of his cabinet of senior ministers. Most of them had been fired; some resigned before they were pushed. By Wednesday evening, each of the four so-called “great offices of state”—prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary and foreign secretary—had a new occupant. Johnson also elevated a controversial political strategist to become his most senior advisor. It was a sign he intends to run the country very differently to his predecessor Theresa May. She had precariously balanced her cabinet between the “remain” and “leave” sides of the Brexit divide in her ruling Conservative Party. But she was eventually forced to resign after failing to pass her Brexit deal (which both sides had strongly criticized) into law. Johnson’s new top team, by contrast, is made up of lawmakers from the right of the party – many of whom worked with him on the “Vote Leave” campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum. It has more people from ethnic minority backgrounds than ever before in British history, but fewer women than May’s cabinet. Here’s a guide to Boris Johnson’s senior circle: The son of a Pakistan-born bus driver, Javid was the first person from an ethnic minority to hold his previous post of Home Secretary (or interior minister) and now holds the same distinction as Chancellor (effectively, finance minister). Javid is a former high-flying banker who keeps a portrait of Margaret Thatcher, the free-marketeer ex-Prime Minister, in his office. He supported the “remain” side in the 2016 referendum, although he claims to have always been a euroskeptic. He ran for the Conservative Party leadership against Johnson but lent him his support after being knocked out. In his new job, Javid will have responsibility for setting the government’s spending priorities, which means paying for Johnson’s policy pledges – which already include an extra 20,000 police officers on the streets – at a time when Brexit threatens to tighten the national purse-strings.",Who's Who in Boris Johnson's Top Team?

578,Madeline Roache,"For the last 10 days, thousands of Russians have flooded social media with new hashtags to challenge sexual harassment and violence against women. On July 16, Twitter users started posting their experiences of sexism and sexual harassment using the #мне_нужна_гласность (I Need Openness, or I Need Public Attention). A few days later, Instagram users began posting images of themselves with the hashtag #янехотелаумирать (I Didn’t Want to Die).  The campaigns come nearly two years after the #MeToo movement soared to prominence in the U.S., a rallying cry for survivors of sexual violence and harassment. The phenomenon has since reverberated globally. From Marrakesh to Manila, Tokyo to Toronto, women have been speaking up. According to the New York Times, more than 200 high profile people have lost their jobs, like Charlie Rose from CBS and Roy Price, Head of Amazon Studio. In France, #MeToo galvanized support for passing comprehensive legislation to tackle violence against women. In Morocco, the movement helped pave the way for bans on forced marriage and sexual violence. Thanks to campaigning by #MeToo activists in China, the government announced proposed legislation that would ban sexual harassment and require that employers “take reasonable measures” to prevent it. While there have been several attempts in Russia to raise awareness of #MeToo and other issues affecting women, none have gained significant traction or had the backing of politicians. But Russian women haven’t given up.  The situation for women in Russia is getting worse, activists say. At least 40,000 women are affected by domestic violence each year, and at least 12,000 women are dying at the hands of their abusers annually, according to Russian government statistics, cited by the U.K. government.That’s about 33 women per day, 20 times the U.S. fatality rate. Russian family lawyer Mari Davtyan says these estimates are conservative, since much of the abuse goes unreported.  That’s why human rights activists Alexandra Mitroshina and Alena Popova started the “I Didn’t Want to Die” hashtag. They want the government to introduce laws punishing perpetrators of domestic violence, and legislation to better protect victims. Mitroshina posted an image of herself wearing makeup to depict cuts and bruises on Instagram on July 20, hoping to raise awareness about domestic violence.  By July 25, the post on Instagram had more than 430,000 likes and led 7,000 other users to post similar images using the hashtag. “As it stands, there’s no protection for victims. We need as much public outcry as possible,” says Mitroshina. In January 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a law decriminalizing domestic violence that does not cause serious injury with “serious” defined as an injury that requires hospital treatment. Since it was adopted in February 2017, beatings that leave bruises, scratches, or bleeding, but that do not cause broken bones or a concussion, are no longer a criminal offense. Yulia Gorbunova, Russia researcher at Human Rights Watch says it’s a “a huge step backwards for Russia, where victims of domestic violence already face enormous obstacles to getting help or justice.” Family lawyer Davtyan says the measure has made it “much harder” to protect abuse victims.  Although the Russian government has laws in place against sexual violence, rape is rarely reported to the authorities, says Davtyan. She says there are no reliable statistics showing what percentage of rape incidents are reported to the police, but only half of those accused result in a court case.",Russia's Version of #MeToo Has Struggled to Take Off — Until Now,"Updated: August 2, 2019 2:28 PM ET | Originally published: July 26, 2019"
579,Katy Steinmetz,"It was just after lunchtime on the day Amin Dzhabrailov was taken. A woman who was about to get married had come to the salon in the Chechen capital of Grozny where he worked, and the two were happily chatting as he colored her hair. Then, he recalls, three men in uniform barged in, asking for him by name. Soon, Dzhabrailov was being hauled outside, handcuffed and thrust into the back of a car. It was hot. He felt like he couldn’t breathe. As the car took off, “my heart stopped,” he says. Though the three men didn’t explain why they had come, it soon became clear, as they took Dzhabrailov’s phone, demanded his password and started scouring the device for messages and photos that would prove he was guilty of something considered deeply shameful in the conservative, predominantly Muslim republic: being gay. Dzhabrailov doesn’t recall how long the car ride lasted, but he does recall his overriding fear. “The door is going to open,” the 27-year-old tells TIME, “and I’m going to die.” Dzhabrailov is one of at least dozens of men who were detained and tortured in an anti-gay “purge” that took place in Chechnya in 2017, according to news reports, human rights organizations and European agencies. He is also one of the first to go on the record about his experience and reveal his identity in the media, though he fears retaliation against himself and his family.  Despite international attention and outcry that followed the 2017 purge — including calls for Russian officials to investigate reported lawlessness and misbehavior among Chechen law enforcement — human rights organizations say another anti-gay sweep took place in late 2018 and early 2019. Dzhabrailov, who fled to Canada from Russia after his detainment, is going public now because he wants to draw attention to the ongoing persecution of gay people in his homeland. “Each person matters. His rights matter,” Dzhabrailov says.  It’s dangerous to tell his story. But two years in North America, including participation in New York City’s annual pride march this year, have helped him summon the courage to speak out. “It’s also dangerous not telling,” he says, “because this is going to continue.”  Human rights groups and experts who have been keeping an eye on the Chechen situation express similar fears, and some say that what’s happening there is part of a broader trend. The rise of nationalism in many countries has dovetailed with the targeting of vulnerable minorities, even in countries like the United States that have seen civil rights for LGBTQ people shored up by lawmakers and courts: There has been an uptick in hate crimes against that demographic in the U.S. in recent years, with the majority targeting gay men.  “What’s been reported in Chechnya is a crime against humanity,” says Lisa Davis, co-director of the Human Rights and Gender Justice Clinic at the CUNY School of Law. “And we see this as a pattern of practice, a wave of violence that’s been happening across the globe.” When events like those in Chechnya fail to lead to consequences such as international condemnation, even amid widespread publicity, she says, “it sends the message that such persecution is tolerated.”  Chechen officials have denied such crackdowns occurred. One government spokesperson said it wasn’t possible because gay people “don’t exist” in that part of Russia and if they did, their own relatives would be so ashamed that they “would have sent them to where they could never return.” The first individual to publicly challenge that stance was forced to recant and apologize on state TV in late 2017, after he came out in TIME and the state went after him and his relatives.",A Victim of the Anti-Gay Purge in Chechnya Speaks Out: 'The Truth Exists',"July 26, 2019"
580,Billy Perrigo,"Four teenagers have been charged with hate crimes for an attack on a lesbian couple on a London bus in May that left the women bloodied and needing hospital treatment. Melania Geymonat and her girlfriend Chris (who did not give media her last name) said their attackers had demanded they kiss, and assaulted them after they refused. A photograph of the two women went viral online after the suspected homophobic attack. Geymonat needed surgery to reset bones in her nose, and Chris needed hospital treatment for a fractured jaw. They also had their belongings stolen, they said. The pair had asked a witness on their night bus to take the photograph after the attackers fled, and they posted it online days later. “We must have kissed or something because these guys came after us,” Geymonat said in a Facebook post. “They started behaving like hooligans, demanding that we kissed so they could enjoy watching, calling us ‘lesbians’ and describing sexual positions.” Geymonat later told media: “We decided to tell the story because this situation needs to change, and maybe this helps a little. For me, it was a moral obligation. This needs to stop. This was a terrible episode, and maybe [if] we say something, we can contribute to something bigger.” One 15 year-old, two 16 year-olds and one 17 year-old, all from London, were charged by London’s Metropolitan police on Thursday for hate crimes and handling stolen goods.

581,Hillary Leung,"Standing at the top of a staircase, a young man addresses a couple of thousand anti-government demonstrators. “Our protest today is peaceful and elegant, right?” he asks. His voice reverberates across the park where the protesters are gathered and prompts a resounding chorus of agreement: “We are the most elegant protestors in the world!” The street protests that have rocked Hong Kong in recent weeks have been mostly leaderless. Protestors don masks and use online aliases to conceal their identities. They organize themselves via the encrypted messaging app Telegram and exchange information via mass Airdrops. But Ventus Lau is slowly rising from the sea of black-shirted anonymity. The 25-year-old is quick to disavow any sort of leadership role — “I just see myself as a coordinator,” he tells TIME. He emphasizes that he is no different to other protesters, who are united by their youth and opposition to what they see as China’s encroachment on the former British colony’s political freedoms. But he has organized two major rallies and thanks to television, he’s becoming a recognizable face. Lau was born in Hong Kong to working class parents and raised in a public housing project. The furthest he traveled during his childhood was by train to the southern Chinese city of Guilin, a little over 500 kilometers away; he didn’t set foot on a plane until he turned 18. Culturally, he was raised on a diet of movies and pop music in Cantonese — the language spoken in Hong Kong, which is mutually incomprehensible with the Mandarin spoken in mainland China. In short, his youth was typical of Hongkongers of his age and background.

Proponents of the link argued that it was beneficial to the local economy to put Beijing within nine hours of Hong Kong via bullet train. Detractors, on the other hand, saw the project as tying semi-autonomous Hong Kong too closely to China and argued that the $10.8 billion spent building the link would have been better spent locally. “I discovered then that the Hong Kong political system is an unjust system,” he says. “There are representatives [of the elite in the legislature] who oppose all the good suggestions from the public.

582,Charlie Campbell / Shanghai,"Clutching binoculars and clad in a periwinkle suit, North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un watched the launch of two new missiles into the Sea of Japan Thursday, the latest display of military might that threatens to derail the Trump Administration’s much-vaunted rapprochement with the secretive state. Described by Pyongyang as a “solemn warning” against “South Korean warmongers,” the short-range missiles appear to have been launched from mobile platforms off North Korea’s eastern coastal city of Wonsan, and come just days after Kim was seen inspecting a new submarine that experts say could represent a significant advancement of the rogue regime’s military clout. Kim said Seoul should “not make a mistake of ignoring the warning” of the missile tests, which appear to be prompted by the resumption of—albeit scaled back—joint military drills between the U.S. and South Korea next month. One of the missiles traveled 428 miles (690 km), according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The launches were the first since Kim and President Donald Trump met for the third time, on June 30, at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the Korean peninsula’s communist North from its democratic South. The State Department urged Pyongyang to refrain from further provocations. But the tests highlight the lack of meaningful progress on reining in North Korea’s nuclear and missile program despite the bromance that’s blossomed between Trump and Kim since their first meeting in Singapore in June 2018. Despite a flurry of obsequious letters and platitudes from both sides—Trump even bragged that the two leaders “fell in love”—the “underlying positions are in some ways exactly the same as they were back in 2017,” says Scott Snyder, a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. Although the latest tests do not breach North Korea’ self-declared moratorium on testing nuclear weapons or intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)—a red line the Trump administration says would derail negations—they do demonstrate the regime’s upward trajectory regarding technological advancement and building stockpiles. Kim said the latest test involved a new tactical guided weapons system. Its “low-altitude gliding and leaping flight” made it “hard to intercept.” Trump has yet to comment on the latest test, though said earlier launches in May were not “anything major,” despite the same mobile launch technology easing the regime’s ability to hide such rockets, which could carry a nuclear payload, in secret tunnels and armories away from weapons inspectors. New satellite imagery also indicates continued uranium enrichment at the Yongbyon nuclear plant.","North Korea’s Latest Missile Tests Underscore the Need for Focused Negotiations, Not Photo-Ops","July 26, 2019"
583,Angus Whitley and Jason Scott / Bloomberg,"Google and Facebook Inc. are facing a regulatory crackdown in Australia after an inquiry highlighted concerns about their market power and impact on the media industry, adding to a barrage of global action against the technology giants. A final report from Australia’s competition watchdog released on Friday called for greater anti-trust scrutiny of the dominant U.S. tech companies, recommending penalties and deterrents be imposed for inappropriate storage and use of personal data and breaches of consumer and competition laws. “The world has never before seen so much commercially sensitive and personal data collected and aggregated in just two companies,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters in Sydney. The government will announce what recommendations in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report that it will support through new regulation by the end of the year, he said. The recommendations continue years-long attempts by regulators worldwide to loosen the companies’ grip on everything from advertising and search engines, to news, data and elections. The European Union has fined Google 8.2 billion euros ($9.1 billion) over the past two years for antitrust violations, while on Wednesday Facebook agreed to a $5 billion settlement in the U.S. over privacy concerns. Facebook faces a slew of regulatory investigations and potential antitrust scrutiny in its home country, and on Thursday the Federal Trade Commission said it’s investigating whether the company violated antitrust laws through social media, digital advertising and mobile applications. The ACCC’s report released Friday lays bare the control that Alphabet Inc.-owned Google and Facebook, the country’s most-visited websites, exert over Australia’s 25 million-strong population. The 23 recommendations delivered in the ACCC’s final report include making unfair contract terms illegal, updating merger laws to recognize the importance of data and creating code-of-conduct laws for media companies. “Our legislative and regulatory framework could not and did not anticipate such a new paradigm,” Frydenberg said, adding that the government accepts the report’s conclusion on the need of industry reform and will hold a 12-week consultation process before announcing its response.",Google and Facebook Are Facing a Crackdown in Australia After a Sweeping Probe,"July 26, 2019"
584,Sanya Mansoor,"Swedish authorities formally charged A$AP Rocky with assault on Thursday, meaning the American rapper now awaits trial for a crime that could land him in prison for up to two years. The charge comes despite efforts by President Donald Trump to “#FreeRocky,” which included calling Sweden’s Prime Minister to intervene on the musician’s behalf. Trump quickly signaled his disappointment in a tweet Thursday, saying that “Sweden has let our African American Community down in the United States.” The U.S. State Department said Thursday that it was “following the case closely.” The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was first detained about three weeks ago, and was charged alongside two other individuals after a fight broke out in Stockholm. The two other people were described as part of his entourage, the Associated Press reported. The Grammy-nominated artist was in Sweden to perform at a music festival. An alleged victim in the case was also charged initially, but an investigation into him has since been dropped. Prosecutors had originally listed two individuals as victims, but later said they only had sufficient evidence to pursue charges for one victim. Snippets of the incident were captured on camera and posted online. A video clip published by a Swedish newspaper appears to show the rapper violently throwing a man to the ground. Another video posted on celebrity news site TMZ shows A$AP Rocky and others punching a man on the floor. A defense attorney representing A$AP Rocky has said the incident was an act of self-defense, the Associated Press reported. The rapper also posted a video on his Instagram that appears to show two men trailing him and one of them hitting his security person with his headphones. A$AP Rocky had told the two men in the video: “We don’t want to fight you all, we’re not trying to go to jail.” He later addressed the camera, saying, “We don’t want no problems with these boys.

585,Julia Webster,"Temperature records are being shattered across Europe this week as the continent swelters in its second heat wave this summer. “We are observing weather since 1833 and we never experienced these kind of temperatures,” David Dehenauw, chief forecaster at the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium, told the BBC. The Netherlands experienced record high temperatures of 39.4ºC (102.9ºF) on Thursday. Germany’s weather service said temperatures there had also risen to a new record high on Thursday, with the mercury hitting 41.5ºC (106.7ºF) in the northern town of Lingen, breaching the previous high set earlier in the day. Belgium, too, recorded its highest-ever temperature this week, hitting 40.2ºC (104.4ºF) close to the city of Liege on Wednesday. Paris also broke its all-time record temperatures on Thursday, when national meteorological service Meteo France recorded 41ºC (105.8ºF) at 1:42 p.m. local time. Other French cities, including Lille, Rouen, and Dijon, were also expected to break their temperature records on Thursday. France recorded its all-time highest temperature — 45.9ºC (114.6ºF) — in June in Gallargues-le-Montueux, a town in the southeastern part of the country. Thursday was the hottest July day on record in the United Kingdom, where temperatures reached 38.1ºC (100.5ºF) in Cambridge at 3:37 p.m. local time, according to the Met Office, the United Kingdom’s national weather service. That was just short of the U.K.’s all-time high temperature of 38.5ºC (101.3ºF). Similarly high temperatures were also recorded in west London, where the thermometer reached 37.9ºC (100.2ºF). More record temperatures were expected to be hit later in the day in cities across Europe. It’s difficult to scientifically link any specific weather event to climate change, experts say. But meteorologists and others generally agree that climate change is causing more extreme weather events of all kinds across the world. “High pressure over Europe has brought a lot of sunny weather which, combined with hot air coming up from North Africa, has led to the heat wave across Europe,” Alex Burkill, a meteorologist at the Met Office, tells TIME about Europe’s latest heat wave.",These Cities Broke Temperature Records in Europe's Heat Wave,"July 25, 2019"
586,Alana Semuels,"On a recent Tuesday, Neal Fachan walked down a dock in Seattle’s Lake Union and boarded a blue and yellow Harbour Air seaplane, alongside six other tech executives. He was bound for Vancouver to check on the Canadian office of Qumulo, the Seattle-based cloud storage company he co-founded in 2012. With no security lines, it was an easy 50-minute flight past snow-capped peaks. Later that day, Fachan caught a return flight back to Seattle. Fachan began making his monthly Instagram-worthy commute when Qumulo opened its Vancouver office in January. Other passengers on the seaplanes go back and forth multiple times a week. Fachan says his company expanded across the border because Canada’s immigration policies have made it far easier to hire skilled foreign workers there compared to the United States. “We require a very specific subset of skills, and it’s hard to find the people with the right skills,” Fachan says as he gets off the plane. “Having access to a global employment market is useful.” In the fractious battle over immigration policy, most of the attention has been directed at apprehending migrants at the southern border. Some tech executives and economists, however, believe that growing delays and backlogs for permits for skilled workers at America’s other borders pose a more significant challenge to the U.S.’s standing as a wealth-creating start-up mecca. The risk of losing out on the fruits of innovation to Canada and other countries that are more welcoming to immigrants might be a bigger problem for our economic future than a flood of refugees. Half of America’s annual GDP growth is attributed to rising innovation. “Increasingly, talented international professionals choose destinations other than the United States to avoid the uncertain working environment that has resulted directly from the agency’s processing delays and inconsistent adjudications,” testified Marketa Lindt, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, at a House hearing last week about processing delays at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Lindt’s organization finds that USCIS processing time for some work permits has doubled since 2014, a fact cited in a May letter signed by 38 U.S. Senators on both sides of the aisle asking USCIS to explain the processing delays. The backlogs in processing have particularly benefited our neighbor to the north. Canada has adopted an open-armed embrace of skilled programmers, engineers and entrepreneurs at the same time the U.S. is tightening its stance. Research shows that high-skilled foreign workers are highly productive and innovative, and tend to create more new businesses, generating jobs for locals. So each one who winds up in Canada instead of America is a win for the former, and a loss for the latter. “Really smart people can drive economic growth,” says Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank in Washington, D.C. funded in part by cable, pharmaceutical, television, and tech companies. “There are not that many people in the world with an IQ of 130, and to the extent that we’re attracting those people rather than the Canadians doing so, we’re better off.” With the unemployment rate hovering below at or below four percent for the past 18 months, tech companies are long used to battling for talent by offering $100,000-plus starting salaries and perks like onsite gyms and all the kombucha you can drink. Recruiting foreign talent is one way for them to find new hires. There are a number of ways companies can hire skilled workers from India, China, and other countries, including applying for L-1 and H-1B visas, which allow foreigners to temporarily work in the United States. Demand for these visas, which are awarded by lottery, is intense. Since 2004, 65,000 H-1B visas are issued annually: this year’s ceiling was hit in only four days. (The government allows 20,000 additional visas for workers who have a master’s degree or PhD from a U.S. university.) Amid the wider crackdown on immigration under the Trump Administration, the application process for employment-based visas appears to have gotten even tougher. The government denied 24% of all initial H-1B applications in 2018, up from six percent in 2015, according to an analysis of data from the National Foundation for American Policy, a pro-immigration think tank. It’s not just H-1B applicants who are experiencing delays. Applicants for all employment-based green cards now have to appear in person at a field office, a new policy that has created long delays, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which says immigration officials under Trump are focusing more on enforcement than on processing legal applications for benefits. And despite a backlog of 5.7 million cases in 2018, USCIS has been providing surge resources to Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices across the country, diverting more staff away from processing visa applications. Canada’s policies, in contrast, offer an alluring alternative. Canada permits companies with offices in the country to hire skilled foreign workers in positions such as computer engineers, software designers, and mathematicians, and have their visas processed within two weeks. These workers can soon after apply to be permanent residents and, within three years, become full-fledged citizens. (The path to permanent residency for foreign workers in the U.S., by contrast, can take decades.) Officials at the Canadian consulate in Seattle work with two to three companies a week trying to set up offices in Canada.",Tech Companies Say it's Too Hard to Hire High-Skilled Immigrants in the U.S. — So They're Growing in Canada Instead,"July 25, 2019"
587,Suyin Haynes,"As Sarah Ewart watched from her home in Belfast while U.K. lawmakers voted for a final time to decriminalize abortion in Northern Ireland, she broke down. The news came after a long, difficult struggle for Ewart, and for Northern Ireland where abortion was illegal for over 150 years. Although Northern Ireland is part of the U.K., where abortion is widely available, it has had its own laws on abortion. The Republic of Ireland legalized abortion last year but women north of the border have still been forced to travel in order to access the procedure. Six years ago when Ewart was 23, she and her partner were told that her pregnancy had a fatal fetal diagnosis, and that her baby would not survive outside the womb. “Once I realized what [the diagnosis] meant, I couldn’t face continuing with the pregnancy knowing that I wouldn’t hold my daughter at the end of it,” Ewart says via email.  Deciding to terminate the pregnancy, she says she was shocked to discover that she would not be able to have the procedure in her own hospital because of Northern Ireland’s laws on abortion, which are some of the most restrictive in the world. Abortion in virtually all circumstances, as well as the purchase of abortion pills and performing an abortion, are criminal offenses and carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. (An ongoing high-profile case involves a mother facing a criminal trial for buying abortion pills online for her 15-year-old daughter.) Like Ewart, who currently has a case before Belfast High Court, many Northern Irish women and pregnant people seeking abortions are forced to travel abroad or to other parts of the U.K. for the procedure; government statistics showed 1,053 women travelled in 2018. The latest statistics from 2017/2018 show that over the same time period, only 12 abortions were carried out in Northern Ireland. “I had no option but to board a plane and travel to London,” Ewart says. That changed this week. On July 24, a bill was signed into law in the U.K. parliament on maintaining public services in Northern Ireland, as it currently does not have a functioning government. Two amendments were tabled to the bill by Labour M.P.s Conor McGinn and Stella Creasy, one to legalize same-sex marriage and the other to liberalize abortion laws. In the weeks leading up to the bill’s passage, M.P.s argued that it was Westminster’s responsibility to intervene to protect the rights of women and pregnant people in Northern Ireland given the absence of a functioning power-staring government in the region. Northern Ireland has not had a functioning government for more than two years, because of a bitter division between the region’s two elected parties. Just last year the U.K. supreme court and the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women ruled that Northern Ireland’s abortion laws contravened the rights of women. Parliament signed the bill into law containing the amendments, in a victory for campaigners, although what that means in terms of how women in Northern Ireland will be able to access abortions is not yet clear. “It’s hugely significant and it hopefully will be a message of hope for other countries where there are similarly restrictive abortion bans, particularly in the U.S. where we are seeing a very concerning and rapid rollback on abortion rights,” Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland campaigns manager, says. “In many ways, it’s something ridiculous that in 2019, we are still having to fight for. Finally now we are getting to a place where we will have laws that respect women’s choices and give them the space and the privacy to make their own decisions about their own bodies.” There are still elements of the law that will need to be ironed out. Abortion will be decriminalized starting October 22, putting an end to prosecutions and cases currently facing trial. But a consultative period will take place until the end of March as authorities establish specific regulations around abortion access and services in Northern Ireland.  For abortion rights campaigners, it’s a significant win that the consultation will focus on “how” services will operate, as opposed to “whether,” given the previous near total ban on abortion. “The fact is that a huge impediment to healthcare has been removed,” says Cara Sanquest, an organizer of the London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign. “The threat of criminalization is no longer there; the stigma, the silence, the shame, the fear. It will take a while, but it’s a huge barrier that’s been removed.”",After 158 Years U.K. Lawmakers Have Voted to Decriminalize Abortion in Northern Ireland. The Fight's Not Over Yet,"July 25, 2019"
588,Julia Webster,"Two sex assault cases have prompted demonstrations in Spain about the treatment of rape in the country’s judicial system. In the town of Manresa, in north-west of Barcelona, last week four men between the ages of 18 and 25 were arrested in connection with the suspected rape of a 17 year-old girl. It came just two weeks after six men accused of gang raping a 14-year old in the same town in 2016 went on trial in Barcelona. These cases have reignited a debate and review of the nation’s laws on sexual violence which activists have said are antiquated and misogynistic. They follow the notorious “Wolf Pack” case that first sparked public outrage in 2017, where five men were eventually found guilty of raping an 18 year-old woman during the 2016 Running of the Bulls festival in Pamplona.  In Spain, the legal distinction between sexual abuse and rape comes down to wether an attack was violent or included intimidation. This is problematic because it often requires the victim to fight back in order to be recognized as rape. “If you resist they kill you, if you don’t resist you consent. What to do?” read one sign at a protest. Though some lawyers have been campaigning to change the law for decades, it didn’t became a national debate until the #MeToo movement took off. The “Wolf Pack” case was at the centre of feminist protests in the past few years, and the six men on trial in Barcelona are now being called the “La Manada de Manresa”, or “the Wolf Pack of Manresa”. They are accused of taking turns to assault the teenager while she was drunk, and since she did not fight back, prosecutors have argued they should face the lesser charge of sexual abuse instead of rape. This sparked protests against what many see as “patriarchal justice”. On the first day of the trial, July 2, the six men walked out of the courthouse covering their faces from a crowd of demonstrators chanting “it’s not abuse, it’s rape” – words that have echoed across the country and have come to define Spain’s #MeToo movement. The original court decision of the “Wolf Pack” case in 2017 triggered huge feminist protests all over the country when judges found the men guilty of sexual abuse but not of rape. However, three years later, on June 21, campaigners celebrated a huge victory when the Supreme Court overturned the ruling. ‘Victims should not be required to show “heroic behavior” to show lack of consent,’ the Supreme court judges declared after they recognized the attack as rape and increased the attackers’ sentences from nine years to 15. The move was seen as decisive victory by women’s rights campaigners.   According to the UN, 154 countries worldwide have laws on sexual harassment. But even when laws exist, they are not always compliant with international standards. According to the Spanish online newspaper eldiario.es, the UN’s Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law has recently called on Spain to explain measures it is taking to fight against discrimination in its justice system. In a letter sent on June 20 it expressed “concern” that cases like the Wolf Pack case “show that the legislation is interpreted by discriminatory justice system based on prejudices and gender stereotypes”. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has until August 19 to respond. When Pedro Sanchez’s socialist government came into power in June 2018, a reform of the criminal code was proposed almost immediately to adopt the “only yes means yes” rule. It came after feminist lawyers in Spain had been campaigning for years for the treatment of sexual crimes to be aligned with the Convention of Istanbul, a treaty signed by most European countries that requires rape to be based on lack of consent rather than evidence. Still, only 10 countries in Europe (Iceland, UK, Ireland, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus) define rape as “sex without consent”. Despite the current government’s willingness to improve women’s rights, the political climate has perhaps never been more complicated. The rise of the far-right party Vox, which won 10.3% of the vote in the last election, threatens to undo the work feminists have been doing for decades. The party is openly misogynistic, and has campaigned to scrap tough laws against gender violence which it argues “criminalizes” men.",Another 'Wolf Pack' Rape Case Is Reigniting Debate Over Spain's Controversial Sexual Assault Laws,"July 25, 2019"
589,William Wilkes and Megan Durisin / Bloomberg,"Europe’s latest summer heatwave broke heat records just weeks after the continent recorded its hottest ever June, fueling concern that a shifting climate is making extreme weather events more frequent. Germany saw its all-time heat record broken on Wednesday, with a new high expected later Thursday, according to the DWD federal weather service. Residents in Paris, London and Brussels fought to stay cool as temperatures soared 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) above July averages, making those cities hotter than Singapore and Cairo. Forecasters said the U.K. could get its warmest day on record Thursday. The heat is drying up some of Europe’s busiest rivers, making stretches of the Danube impassable to cargo and cruise ships and prompting at least eight nuclear reactors in France to scale back output. In London, engineers on the Underground railway network warned passengers to expect delays if tracks buckle. “The likelihood of two record-braking heatwaves have almost certainly gone up due to climate change,” said James Screen, climatologist at the University of Exeter in southern England. “More hot extremes is one of its simplest and well-understood effects.” Temperature records may shatter in the U.K., as southeast England is forecast to reach 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, according to the Met Office. France is also getting sweltering weather, with Paris seen peaking at 42 degrees Celsius (nearly 108 degrees Fahrenheit), Meteo France says. Cooler weather is due from Friday. On Wednesday, temperatures in the Netherlands reached a new all-time high of 39.1 degrees at a military airbase just north of the Belgian border, breaking a record that stood for 75 years, according to the country’s meteorological office. Belgium posted a new highest temperature of 39.9 degrees for the first time ever, according to the country’s meteorological institute. In Germany, officials at the DWD federal weather service issued heatwave and wildfire warnings after all-time highs on Wednesday. The temperature soared to 40.5 degrees in Geilenkirchen near the Belgian border. “It’s highly likely the all time record will fall again on Thursday,” said Andreas Friedrich, noting that weather stations dotted across the country were reporting potentially record-breaking heat conditions.",Paris Could Hit 108 Degrees Thursday as Record-Breaking Heat Wave Scorches Europe,"Updated: July 25, 2019 8:56 AM ET"
590,Vivienne Walt / Paris,"Stumbling through choking smoke, Antoine-Marie Préaut was on a divine mission. The conservator of the 4,000 or so historic monuments in the Paris region made his way through the burning Notre Dame cathedral on April 15 to rescue from a locked chest the Crown of Thorns that Jesus is said to have worn to his Crucifixion. The minutes were ticking by, and there was no certainty Préaut and the firefighters accompanying him would succeed in recovering the priceless relic. “I barely had any consciousness about what was happening,” he says. Then he heard a roar from the huge crowd that had gathered on the square outside the medieval masterpiece in the heart of Paris, and his heart sank. “We heard the cries of all Parisians outside,” he says. “We said to ourselves, ‘The spire must have fallen.’” The cause of the blaze is still unknown, yet what it exposed is clear — the fragility of our most cherished buildings and the wistful attachment we hold to the spaces within their walls. The cathedral’s spire snapped off like a twig just before the sun set, crashing 314 ft. into the nave, through the ceiling that carpenters had painstakingly carved by hand in the Middle Ages, using 5,000 oak trees. Within France itself, the Notre Dame fire laid bare another, more complicated fragility: a tension rippling through the country, pitting the urge to preserve the past, and traditions of an exceedingly proud nation, against the need to overhaul its hidebound ways and modernize its system. In early spring, the fractures in France were playing out in the most violent street demonstrations in decades, with the so-called Yellow Vest movement protesting President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to remake the country’s economic model. Enraged by an elite class — epitomized in their minds by ­Macron ­— that appeared to have no understanding of their financial pain, demonstrators marched, while agitators repeatedly trashed and burned stores and banks across the country. Then came the Notre Dame fire. Amid the boarded-up and smashed storefronts across the city, the sight of smoke billowing from one of its most treasured icons seemed to deepen a sense of a country under strain. “There was a spirit of destruction which really collided with the spirit of maintenance and protecting our culture from the past,” says Nicole Bacharan, a French political analyst and author. “It was a moment people truly shared, that said something important about what it meant to be French. It was not a terrorist attack. It was not a natural disaster. It was a sudden violent destruction of something people hold very dear.” The destruction of the cathedral seemed to many like a turning point. It was “the drop of water that made the vase overflow,” says Thierry Paul Valette, one of the Yellow Vest leaders in Paris. With the embers still smoldering inside Notre Dame and the French in collective grief over the fire, Macron went on television the next day to appeal for national unity and vowed to have Notre Dame rebuilt within five years. “I believe very deeply that we can transform this catastrophe into an occasion to come together,” he said. “Politics will take over again, but it is not the moment now.” The appeal to unity seems to have worked, at least for now. The weekly protests have abated, with demonstrators exhausted from eight months of battle. But the place of worship that 14 million tourists a year once visited remains a shuttered wreck on Paris’ Île de la Cité, and now the old divisions are beginning to gather around what comes next for the beloved building. The fraught discussion cuts to France’s most sensitive matters of history and culture, class and political ideology, with questions that will likely take months to resolve. How quickly can it be rebuilt, and what will it look like when it is? What will it cost, and who will pay? And there is another question that has bubbled quietly ever since the fire ignited atop the roof: Did official penny pinching, and the labyrinthine structure of the French state, unwittingly lead to disaster? In the meantime, the Gothic jewel remains behind police barricades, a magnet for crowds of gawkers who gather to watch the salvage work, like rubberneckers at a road accident. “As Notre Dame burns, so falls France,” the French writer Sébastien Lapaque mused in Le Point magazine in June. The cathedral sits at the zero point of all the country’s map readings, Lapaque tells us, and is a fitting representation of the country’s troubled state at the moment. “It has a double symbol, both politically and spiritually,” he says. Stepping inside Notre Dame today is like entering a mausoleum. In sharp contrast to the cathedral’s typically crowded nave, where tourists and worshippers jostle for space, the huge interior is eerily empty and silent, the only movement coming from remote-­controlled construction vehicles; it is still deemed too risky to have humans disturb the fire-damaged space. The robot earthmovers, dwarfed by the towering vault, edge slowly in and out of the nave, extracting the fallen stonework and burnt wood, piece by piece — including bits of the shattered spire — that crashed through the roof during the fire and now sit in a pile of debris. Each piece is meticulously cataloged, then placed in a tent in Notre Dame’s front yard, in readiness for restoration.",Inside the Fight Over How Notre Dame Should Rise From the Ashes,"July 25, 2019"
591,Ian Bremmer,"In an era of dark-horse politics, when outsiders or new parties have won power in the United States, France, Italy, Mexico, Brazil, and elsewhere over the past three years, it’s hard to be surprised when voters choose change. But the political transformation in Ukraine is something different. It’s a response to the hyper-aggressive foreign policy of the country’s giant neighbor to the east. It’s a reflection of Russia’s failure to steer events inside a country that has served for centuries as its junior partner. It’s also an opportunity for Ukrainians to make a fresh start. First came Volodymyr Zelensky. It’s not just that a man best known as the comedian who plays Ukraine’s president on TV was able to beat the actual incumbent president and a former prime minister to win a national election. It’s that he did it with 73 percent of the vote, the highest percentage yet recorded in post-Soviet Ukraine’s brief history with presidential elections. Then, aware that he could accomplish little without sweeping change in the Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, Zelensky called early elections. Next came last weekend’s parliamentary election victory for Servant of the People, the political party that Zelensky created and named for his television show. Defying expert predictions, the party managed to win a majority of Rada seats. No party had done that before. There will also be lawmakers outside his party that will support Zelenskiy’s agenda, if only to bask in the new president’s reflected glow. But Zelensky won’t have to depend on them as he takes what are sure to be a series of tough decisions intended to reform Ukraine’s broken economy and dirty politics. Russian officials are watching closely…and might be feeling a little powerless. Five years after Ukrainian protesters forced former president Viktor Yanukovych, Moscow’s then-man in Kiev, to flee to Russia, the Kremlin has had little success in regaining a foothold in Ukraine’s politics. Crimea remains in Russian hands, but Vladimir Putin has lost the popularity boost he got by invading it. Russia continues to back separatists in the Ukrainian provinces along the Ukrainian-Russian border, but the insurrections there have not forced big concessions from Kiev or prevented a deepening of Ukraine’s political and economic ties with Europe. The popularity of Zelensky and his party made it impossible for Russia to exercise any real influence on the outcome of Ukraine’s elections. The past five years have made clear to many Ukrainians that Russia can’t simply be defied if Ukraine is ever to become secure and prosperous. But the intervening years haven’t brought Ukraine back into the Russian orbit either, and Zelensky has already proven he’s willing to trade insults with the Russian government when he believes his country is being insulted. Ukraine’s president must now get down to the business of managing delicate relations with Russia, continuing to court Western governments and lenders, looking for a way to end the war with the separatists, and crushing the corruption that has long poisoned his country’s politics and undermined its economy. He’ll have to do all this with a parliament in which more than 70 percent of members have never served in government. Zelensky arrived in power with a credible promise of change. He’ll now have to show exactly what that means. Contact us at editors@time.com.",Sweeping Political Change in Ukraine Heralds Hope for the Future,"July 25, 2019"
592,Ciara Nugent,"Many cultures have native words for unique experiences. In Spain, families and friends sitting around after finishing a meal are having a sobremesa. Germans enjoying the solitude of being alone in the woods experience Waldeinsamkeit. In Iceland one such word is isbiltur, which describes a road trip to get ice cream, a hallowed family tradition on the island nation. So when Icelandic Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir visited London recently, she was persuaded to join TIME for a quick isbiltur–a short drive from her country’s modernist embassy in upmarket Knightsbridge to an Icelandic ice cream shop on the west side of town. “You know, I think ice cream walks may be more common today than drives,” she says as the town car crawls through London traffic, noting that her family prefers to go on foot to sample one of the many ice cream parlors in the capital, Reykjavik. “We are very conscious of being green.” The progressive update is true to form for Jakobsdottir, at 43 one of the youngest women to lead a European country. Iceland may be small, with just 350,000 people, but it’s home to big ideas that are turning the heads of international policymakers. Iceland is already ranked the best country in which to be a woman by the World Economic Forum, and Jakobsdottir’s government is rolling out the world’s toughest equal-pay legislation. One of the only government heads from an environmentalist party, Jakobsdottir wants to make the country a leader in climate action too, with an ambitious plan to make Iceland carbon neutral by 2040, 10 years before the target set for Iceland’s neighbors in the E.U. “It can be an advantage to be small,” she says. “You can do things bigger and faster. You can actually change everything in a very short time.” It’s a tough time to be a politician in Iceland. Traditional parties have seen their vote share tumble since the banking crisis of 2008, and the three men who served as Prime Minister in the four years before Jakobsdottir were each driven from office early by poor performance or scandals. As leader of the small, liberal Left-Green Party since 2013, Jakobsdottir manages to be an exception. “People see her as an honest broker, someone who just says what she means,” says Stefania Oskarsdottir, a professor of politics at the University of Iceland. The likability factor is on show as Jakobsdottir arrives at Bears, a family-run ice cream parlor. She chats in Icelandic to the owners’ young daughter and pores excitedly over their stash of chocolate-covered licorice, a national staple that she demands TIME try. Voted Iceland’s most trusted politician in 2016, Jakobsdottir was perhaps the natural choice to lead the coalition government the Left-Greens formed with two center-right rivals in 2017. But she is in a fragile position. Her government has a majority of just three seats, and the economic fallout of the collapse in March of Iceland’s budget airline WOW Air could make it hard to hold the coalition together. But Jakobsdottir is not afraid of a challenge. “My problem in my life–and also my fortune–is to always say yes,” she says between bites of Icelandic ice cream. “When people ask me to do interesting things I tend to do them.” In 1996, at 20, she appeared in a music video for an Icelandic indie band, running through the streets of Reykjavik. Following her “15 seconds of fame,” Jakobsdottir studied literature and entered politics after getting involved in activism. She recalls lying in the street outside the Prime Minister’s office to protest Icelandic support for the Iraq War in 2003.",Iceland's Prime Minister Talks Climate Change and Gender Equality Over Ice Cream,"July 25, 2019"
593,Amy Gunia,"More than six weeks after they began, protests in Hong Kong show no sign of easing up. Sparked by a proposed extradition bill that would allow suspected criminals to be sent to face trial under China’s opaque legal system, the protests took a darker turn on July 19, when police seized a cache of explosives and weapons at a warehouse and arrested three men allegedly linked to the protest movement. Two days later, a group of masked men attacked civilians at a train station, injuring dozens. The city has become increasingly polarized, as protesters say Beijing is eroding the autonomy Hong Kong maintains under the “one country, two systems” model. Hong Kong’s Beijing-appointed leader, Carrie Lam, has declared the extradition bill “dead” but has not officially withdrawn it. On July 21, protesters clashed with police, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets at them. Some surrounded the Chinese government’s office, hurling eggs and spray-painting obscenities on its walls. That same night, police were nowhere to be seen when men armed with wooden sticks stormed a train station near the Chinese border and terrorized commuters. Believed to be members of Hong Kong’s “triad” gangs, they indiscriminately attacked pro-democracy protesters, journalists and bystanders in the most brutal protest-related incident to date. Over a two-hour period, at least 45 people were injured. Authorities were accused of doing little to stop the attack but have since arrested several men, some with links to triad gangs. The path out of the standoff remains unclear. Lam expressed “regret” over the July 21 attacks but did not offer concessions that might calm an outraged public. More protests are planned in the days and weeks to come. If violence becomes more common, Beijing may be more likely to step in to quell the protests, which have turned into a revolt against its hold over the region. But for now, it looks set to be a long summer of rebellion in Hong Kong.   Write to Amy Gunia at amy.gunia@time.com.

594,Hillary Leung,"Sri Lanka is demanding the U.K. take back more than a hundred containers of waste, joining the growing list of Asian countries pushing back against developed nations that export trash as recycling. The 111 containers consisting of plastics, syringes and suspected human remains are believed to have been sent from the U.K. in 2017, the BBC reports, but were only inspected last week after port officials complained of a putrid smell. Authorities said Tuesday they had taken “immediate action to order the re-export” of the waste. “Some of the materials have been liquidized and deteriorated to the point that we cannot even examine them,” Customs Department spokesman Suni Jayaratne told the local Daily Mirror newspaper, according to the BBC. Protestors held a demonstration Wednesday outside the British High Commission in the capital Colombo and handed over a letter urging the U.K. to take back the waste. “Sri Lanka is not your dump yard,” read one protest sign. “This is a third-world country, we are struggling with so many issues, and how can we be responsible for somebody else’s garbage?” One protestor said. The global trash trade reached a turning point early last year when China, once the world’s biggest receiver of plastic waste, banned its import. Since then, Southeast Asia has seen a huge spike in waste shipments — much of it contaminated plastic that is unrecyclable — from developed countries. But several nations have begun sending the trash back to where it came from. Earlier this week, Cambodia announced it would ship 1,600 tonnes of waste back to the U.S. and Canada. In May, the Philippines sent 69 container-loads of garbage to Canada, and the month before, Malaysia returned five containers to Spain.",Sri Lankans Ask the U.K. to Take Back Rotten Waste,"July 25, 2019"
595,Nadia Suleman,"With a new feature, Tinder says it wants to make the swiping experience safer for its LGBTQ users traveling and living in certain countries. On Wednesday, the dating app introduced a new safety update dubbed “Traveler Alert” that will warn users who have identified themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or queer when they enter a country that could criminalize them for being out. The app plans to use the locations from users’ devices to determine if there is a threat to the user’s safety, where users can opt to have their profile hidden during their stay or make their profile public again. The caveat being that if a user decides to have their profile public, their sexual preference or gender identity will no longer be disclosed on the app until they return to a location where the user is deemed safer to disclose their identity. In the statement, Tinder says they developed the feature so that users “can take extra caution and do not unknowingly place themselves in danger for simply being themselves.” Tinder partnered with the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), an LGBTQ advocacy organization, to determine which countries’ users are at the most risk of being in danger. They determined that 69 countries, including 11 countries where consensual same-sex acts could be punishable by the death penalty, would be used for the feature. ILGA Executive Director André du Plessis says in a statement that the organization supports the strides that Tinder is making to protect members of the LGBTQ community. “We hope that this development will raise awareness amongst all Tinder users, and help protect people of diverse sexual orientations in the 69 countries around the world that currently still criminalise same-sex love,” Plessis says. “We work hard to change practices, laws and attitudes that put LGBTQ people at risk – including the use of dating apps to target us – but in the meantime, the safety of our communities also depends on supporting their digital safety.” OutRight International Deputy Director Maria Sjödin tells TIME that all dating apps need to recognize that LGBTQ people are actively using their platforms.",Tinder's Newest Feature Aims to Keep LGBTQ People Safer Across the World,"July 24, 2019"
596,Madeline Roache,"The Cold War wasn’t just fought in the White House and the Kremlin. In American and Soviet homes, the capitalism-communism divide was a topic of conversation at many a kitchen table — and, most famously, in one model kitchen. On July 24, 1959 — 60 years ago Wednesday — U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev brought the Cold War home. In what’s since been famously dubbed “the kitchen debate,” the world leaders debated the merits of American-style capitalist consumerism and Soviet-style communism against the backdrop of an American exhibition in Moscow’s Sokolniki Park. Cold War historian Brian Dooley says it was a “monumental moment in the battle of ideas in the Cold War, exposing the publics on either side of the Iron Curtain to a discussion based on ideology rather than military strength.” One of the key areas in which they competed was the promise of their respective systems to design a kitchen and produce labor-saving appliances that could liberate women. But, in allowing the two sides to face off over technology, the debate also exposed the issues facing both American and Soviet women. Both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S., following a bilateral Cultural Agreement adopted in 1958, organized exhibits showcasing the industrial achievements of their respective systems: one in Moscow and one in New York City. The aim was to develop better mutual understanding and friendlier relations between people in the East and West. The American National Exhibition, which displayed cars, television sets, fashion styles and, most importantly, the Whirlpool Miracle Kitchen, attracted an estimated 2.7 million Soviet citizens over the course of six weeks. But the event was about more than just showing off shiny new goods. Susan Reid, Professor of Slavonic Studies at Sheffield University, wrote in Cold War Kitchen: Americanization, Technology, and European Users that the family home and kitchen were “in the vanguard” of America’s Cold War effort to “discredit the communist project in the eyes of Soviet citizens” by raising demand for products that the Soviet economy of shortage couldn’t deliver. “The effect on the consciousness of ordinary Soviet citizens — whether it stimulated an appetite for consumerism — preoccupied the American authorities,” says David Crowley, a professor at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin. It was already clear that the U.S. was winning the Cold War in terms of consumer production: although the Soviet Union was ahead of the U.S. in rocket technology at the time, the U.S. was in the lead for commodities. So Khrushchev decided to “enter into a competition” with the U.S. on that side of things too. The quality of citizen’s homes became central to his goal of “catch up and overtake America,” which he had declared in May 1957. After the exhibition, the Soviet output of products like fridges and vacuums increased, and the number of households with fridges grew rapidly, rising from 4% in 1960 to 11% in 1965 and 65% by 1975. But, much as he wanted to out-produce his rival, Khrushchev was not sold on the ideology behind the American home. As the politicians toured the American model kitchen, Nixon pointed at a dishwasher and said, “In America, we like to make life easier for women.” Khrushchev retorted, “Your capitalistic attitude toward women does not occur under Communism.”",Is Capitalism or Communism Better for Women?

597,Billy Perrigo,"A week to the day before Boris Johnson became U.K. Prime Minister, he was on stage waving a smoked fish above his head. “I want you to consider this kipper,” Johnson told his crowd, punctuating each word with a shake. Traditionally eaten by Brits at breakfast time, the fish was now being used by Johnson to make a point about Brexit. British kipper manufacturers, Johnson said, were having their costs unfairly pushed up by E.U. regulations. When Britain finally leaves the political and economic bloc, Johnson told his crowd, such regulatory nonsense would be a thing of the past. “We will,” he concluded, “get our mojo back.” It was classic “Boris,” as he is universally known — soaring rhetoric on gently nationalistic themes, delivered with an attention-grabbing stunt. The fact that the rules governing kipper shipments are in fact set by the U.K., not the E.U., was also characteristic of the man now headed to 10 Downing Street, who has a long history of putting compelling narratives ahead of facts. Having for years cultivated an aura of buffoonery, Johnson’s campaign for leader of the Conservative Party was by contrast a slick operation. He and his team developed an optimistic refrain — yes, his story went, Britain had been betrayed by Theresa May’s inability to pull the U.K. out of the E.U. as promised. But if the country just believed in itself a little more, and rallied behind a strong new Prime Minister, things didn’t have to be that way. “This is a great country,” Johnson said at one leadership debate. “We can do it.” He sealed victory comfortably, beating rival Jeremy Hunt with 66.4% of party members’ votes. On Wednesday, he travels to Buckingham Palace to be formally appointed as the new Prime Minister by Queen Elizabeth. The first and most pressing item on his checklist, naturally, is Brexit. The U.K. is still scheduled to leave the E.U. on Oct. 31, a date which Johnson pledged on the campaign trail to stick to, “do or die.” By default, the country is on track to crash out of the bloc on Hallowe’en unless a deal can be negotiated. Theresa May’s Brexit deal, which was roundly rejected by lawmakers, took two years. Johnson has just three months. The new Prime Minister helped swing the 2016 referendum as its foremost cheerleader. Now, installed in Britain’s highest office by way of internal party machinations, he is responsible for delivering what he promised. His premiership rests on him succeeding. Johnson is what Brits might call a “Marmite” politician — someone people either love or hate. He is extremely well liked by Conservative Party members, but less so by the rest of the country: 58% of Brits have a negative view of him, according to YouGov polling released Tuesday.","Boris Johnson Led the Charge for Brexit.

598,Bloomberg,"China said the U.S. should remove its “black hand” from Hong Kong’s protests, in some of its most pointed criticism yet against what it says is American interference in the city’s affairs. There are “signs of foreign forces behind the protests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters Tuesday in Beijing. “I wonder if these U.S. officials can truthfully answer to the world the role the U.S. has played in recent events in Hong Kong.” Her comments came after the U.S. State Department on Monday said attacks on protesters and other bystanders by criminal gangs was “particularly disturbing,” according to a Voice of America report. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had blamed the “black hand” of Western forces for stirring up trouble in Hong Kong last month, without singling out the U.S. “This is a ridiculous statement,” Harvey Sernovitz, a spokesman for the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong, said Wednesday. “The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong reflect the sentiment of the people of Hong Kong and their broad concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy.” Beijing has long attributed unrest in Hong Kong and other regions under its control to unspecified foreign forces, with the U.S. and the U.K. as the most obvious targets. Those complaints have increased in recent weeks as American and European governments issue statements urging China to respect the rights of Hong Kong protesters critical of the government in the former British colony. China has leveled increasingly blunt criticism against U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo — with the foreign ministry accusing him of “lies and fallacies” last month — but so far spared President Donald Trump. Hua offered a more measured response Tuesday in response to a question about Trump’s comment Monday that President Xi Jinping has “acted responsibly” in Hong Kong protests and that China could stop the protests “if they wanted.” “Please trust that China’s central government and the Hong Kong government will work for the benefits of our people and we’re always doing the right thing,” Hua said. A rally of more than 100,000 people in Hong Kong devolved into a night of violence on Sunday, with police firing tear gas after protesters gathered in front of China’s liaison office in the city and defaced the national emblem.

599,Julia Webster,"A libel trial against Maria Ressa, the editor of the Philippines-based news site Rappler, began Tuesday, the latest step in what is widely seen as an attempt from the Philippine government to intimidate journalists. Ressa, the editor of influential news site Rappler, was arrested for cyber libel in February but later released on bail. She faces years in prison if convicted. Rappler has been critical of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s government, and in particular of what Amnesty International has called its “murderous war on drugs” that possibly amount to crimes against humanity. Ressa was among four journalists and one news organization named TIME 2018 Person of the Year for their “pursuit of greater truths” in the face of threats. She was also included on TIME’s 2019 list of the 100 most influential people. “My only crime is to be a journalist, to speak truth to power,” she said in her speech at the TIME 100 gala this year. Ressa has already been indicted multiple times on libel and tax evasion by the government in what critics have called a targeted attempt to silence independent media. “The government hopes to intimidate us by syphoning both my personal time, our resources,” Ressa, who did not attend the hearing, told AFP. “I won’t be intimidated. We continue to do our jobs. The mission of journalism has never been as important as it is today in the Philippines,” she added. “It is clear that the government is manipulating the law to muzzle and intimidate one of its most credible media critics,” the Committee to Protect Journalists told CNN after her arrest in March. The trial centers on a Rappler story published in 2012 about a businessman’s alleged links to illegal drugs and human trafficking.","Libel Trial Opens Of Maria Ressa, Philippine Journalist Critical of President Duterte","July 23, 2019"
600,Mark Niquette and Mark Gurman / Bloomberg,"Apple has asked the Trump administration to exclude components that make up the forthcoming Mac Pro high-end desktop computer from import tariffs, weeks after planning to re-locate production of the line to China from Texas. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is seeking relief from duties of 25% on key Mac Pro parts and accessories that go with it, ranging from the stainless steel and aluminum frame, power supplies, internal cables and circuit boards, and its optional wheels, according to filings posted by the Office of U.S. Trade Representative. The documents don’t specifically mention the Mac Pro, but the features and dimensions listed by Apple in the filing closely resemble the planned computer. The exclusion requests from the iPhone maker were posted July 18 and are now subject to a public comment period before they’re reviewed. Some Apple products have been spared from tariffs in the past, including the Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple declined to comment on the filing. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised relief if companies can show that parts or products can only be obtained in China, aren’t “strategically important” to Chinese industrial programs, or that the duties would cause “severe economic harm.” Trump has tweeted that companies won’t face a tariff if they make their goods “at home in the USA.” The new Mac Pro will be manufactured in China, a person familiar with the company’s plans said last month, shifting production of what had been Apple’s only major device assembled in the U.S. The previous design had been built in Texas since 2013. The new model was announced in June and will go on sale later this year, starting at $5999. Apple said last month that “final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process.” Apple is also seeking duty exclusions on its Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad, complementary devices for operating the computer, as well as an accompanying USB cable for charging external mobile devices. Trump slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods last year in response to a trade deficit and allegations of intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices as the world’s two largest economies seek to negotiate a sweeping trade deal. Trump had threatened tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports in May in response to what he said was Beijing’s reneging on agreed provisions. But he put them on hold after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June in Japan to restart negotiations.",Apple Moved Mac Pro Production to China.

601,Suyin Haynes,"The Strait of Hormuz is only 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, but it’s once again the biggest waterway in the news headlines, after Iran seized a British oil tanker in what is widely regarded as the world’s most strategically important passage for international trade. Twenty percent of the global oil supply flows through the Strait, which links the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. And though it is technically regulated by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 (UNCLOS), Iran has signed but not ratified that convention and has historically acted to protect its interests in the passage. The Strait’s geopolitical significance means it has long been a focal point of international tensions between Tehran and the West, which have increased in recent months. In the latest escalation on July 19, Iranian authorities seized the British-flagged Stena Impero oil tanker, claiming that it was “violating international maritime rules.” Former Iranian Prime Minister Hoveida once called the Strait of Hormuz “our jugular vein,” and in April 1959, Iran attempted to alter the legal status of the Strait by expanding the country’s territorial sea and declaring that only “innocent passage” was permitted through the area. In July 1972, Oman did the same thing, meaning that the Strait was “closed” and was essentially a self-declared combination of Iran’s and Oman’s territorial waters. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, both Iran and Oman made several declarations and claims over the Strait that were inconsistent with international maritime law, despite both countries having signed UNCLOS (only Oman has ratified the convention). Here’s more on the dramatic recent history of the world’s most crucial oil choke point. For most of the 1980s, Iran and Iraq were embroiled in conflict, as Iraq sought to become the dominant power in the Gulf following the 1979 Iranian Revolution. As TIME reported in a cover story about the Persian Gulf conflict in October 1980, the war wasn’t just pitting Iraq against Iran, but also the U.S. against the former Soviet Union. President Jimmy Carter had in 1980 committed to keeping the Strait open for transport, and the Soviet Union was prepared for the American military to step in to enforce that position — but officials in Washington feared the USSR would have an advantage if that happened, given that it shared a border with Iran and supplied arms to Iraq. In 1984, the conflict between the two countries moved to the Strait, in what was dubbed the Tanker War. Under the leadership of Saddam Hussein, Iraq started targeting Iran’s oil tankers. As TIME reported in April that year, Iran at the time was exporting 2.6 billion barrels of oil per day through the waterway. By targeting the tankers, Iraq hoped to cripple Iran economically and force the closure of the choke point. The danger of the Strait closing had reached such a level in 1987 that a U.S.-led naval intervention began, to protect the tankers. As historian Martin S. Navias has written, that U.S. intervention “ensured freedom of movement for international shipping in the Gulf and eventually also increased pressure on Tehran to seek peace with its neighbor,” leading to the end of the Iran-Iraq conflict in 1988.",The Strait of Hormuz Is at the Center of Iran Tensions Again.

602,"Kimberly Dozier / Aspen, Colo.","At the Aspen Institute’s annual gathering of national security and foreign policy leaders in July, the former acting CIA director, John McLaughlin, choked up as he recalled how British intelligence chiefs had traversed closed air space from London to Washington to literally embrace their American counterparts after the 9/11 attacks.  McLaughlin and Sir John Scarlett, the former head of Britain’s MI6 spy agency sitting beside him, remembered fondly the “special relationship” the U.S. and U.K. had, a relationship that both agreed is troubled at a time when tension with Iran threatens to break into armed conflict. Britain announced Monday that it would form its own European-led patrol of Persian Gulf waters, where Iran seized a British oil tanker Saturday, rather than join an American-led effort.  This follows the unprecedented decision by the Trump administration to withhold detailed information from Britain ahead of a planned U.S. military strike on Iran, later aborted, following the shooting down of an American drone. Four senior administration officials confirm to TIME that they left the Brits out of the planning, conceding that was “unusual” but blaming it on the speed of the response. “It is not that common for us to execute operations unilaterally without them,” one of the officials said. “But in this case, because of the nature of the incident and the proposed response, it wasn’t an essential element.”  And the Trump White House may act unilaterally without briefing the Brits in detail again, depending on the action needed to respond to Iranian aggression toward U.S. troops or interests in the region, they said, speaking anonymously in order to discuss the sensitive matter.  President Donald Trump ultimately canceled the planned action, but the U.S. decision to withhold information sent a tremor through an alliance at least superficially dented by Trump’s Twitter attacks on outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May, and by his savaging of the former British Ambassador to the U.S. Sir Kim Darroch, whose unflattering assessments of Trump’s administration were leaked in the British media and forced him to resign. “Cowards,” one senior U.S. official said, summing up the Trump administration’s frustration with the Brits’ continued support for the Iran nuclear deal, their reluctance to confront Iran more directly and their attempts to help Iran bypass U.S. sanctions together with other European parties who remain in the nuclear deal. Former British Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC that Theresa May had turned down a U.S. offer of help in the Persian Gulf before Iran seized Britain’s oil tanker, apparently demurring because she didn’t want to increase the risk of being drawn into an armed conflict.",The 'Special' U.S.-U.K. Relationship is Bruised After Trump Officials Left U.K. Out of Iran Strike Planning,"Updated: July 23, 2019 6:21 PM ET"

World leaders have been showing their support on Twitter. President Trump was one of the first to congratulate Johnson by declaring: “He will be great!” In comments to the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, Trump also said Johnson was “tough” and “smart” and claimed he is popular in the UK because he’s known as “Britain Trump”. “We have a really good man who’s going to be the prime minister of the U.K. now,” said Trump. “They call him Britain Trump. And people are saying that’s a good thing. They like me over there. That’s what they wanted. That’s what they need.” Thousands protested against Trump in central London when he visited the U.K. in June. Trump dismissed the protests as “fake news” during a press conference with Theresa May. Chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he looked forward to working constructively with Johnson towards the divorce with the E.U. Johnson was a lead figure in the campaign to leave the E.U. in the 2016 referendum, and has repeatedly said he will keep the option of a “no deal” Brexit (leaving the bloc with no arrangements about what the relationship will be like in the future) on the table. The Taoiseach (Irish PM), Leo Varadkar, also congratulated Johnson and said he looked forward to continuing Brexit talks and prevent a hard Irish border, the issue that has come to symbolize the challenges of Brexit.

604,Billy Perrigo/London,"Boris Johnson has won the contest to replace Theresa May as leader of Britain’s Conservative Party and U.K. Prime Minister, party officials announced Tuesday morning. He beat his rival, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, winning 66.4% of votes cast by members of the ruling Conservative Party. “I will work flat out,” Johnson said in his victory speech. “The campaign is over and the work begins.” President Trump congratulated Johnson after the results were announced. “He will be great!” the President tweeted. Johnson will be formally sworn in as Britain’s 77th Prime Minister on Wednesday, after May travels to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen. A former Mayor of London and Foreign Secretary, Johnson was a leading figure in the campaign to leave the E.U. in Britain’s 2016 Brexit referendum. He had been the favorite in the contest to replace May, and takes office just three months before Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union, on Oct. 31. He now faces the immediate task of negotiating a new exit deal, but says Britain will leave on that date, “do or die.” Lawmakers had previously rejected the deal May had struck with the E.U. after two years of negotiations, leading to her resignation in June as head of the Conservative Party. In the campaign to replace her, Johnson repeatedly said he would keep a “no deal” Brexit (leaving the bloc with no arrangements for continued trade and regulatory harmony) on the table. That approach enraged some members of May’s cabinet, including the Chancellor (Britain’s equivalent to a Finance Minister) Philip Hammond, who is widely tipped to resign on Tuesday before he is fired by Johnson. Johnson’s first challenge will be to rally lawmakers behind his leadership.

605,Hillary Leung,"Singapore said Tuesday it confiscated 8.8 tonnes of elephant ivory in a record bust. The city-state, often a stopover in the illegal wildlife trade, caught the haul in a container en route from the DR Congo to Vietnam. Officially, the shipment was supposed to contain timber. The ivory, worth more than $12.9 million, was packed into 132 bags and estimated to have come from nearly 300 African elephants, according to a joint statement by the country’s National Parks Board, Customs and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority. “Singapore has always been inadvertently implicated in the global ivory trade for two reasons: its global connectivity, as well as the presence of a small domestic market where pre-1990s ivory can be legally sold,” Kim Stengert, chief communications officer for WWF Singapore told Reuters. The same shipment also contained a massive haul of pangolin scales, Singapore’s third major bust involving the world’s most trafficked mammals this year. Authorities said they seized 11.9 tonnes of scales, worth $35.7 million and equivalent to around 2,000 pangolins. In April, the country intercepted two separate shipments of pangolin scales in less than week. Demand for the nocturnal, anteater-like creature mostly comes from China, where its scales feature in traditional medicine as a supposed cure for skin diseases, asthma and rheumatism. According to Singapore’s statement, the latest July 21 bust followed a tip-off from China’s customs department. Both elephants and pangolins are protected species under the the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which aims to ensure international trade does not threaten any species’ survival.",Singapore Seizes Record Ivory Haul of 8.8 Tonnes in a Shipment En Route to Vietnam,"July 23, 2019"

But when the passenger train pulled into Yuen Long station on the outskirts of Hong Kong Sunday night, the doors opened onto a blood-splattered platform and a bat-wielding mob. People screamed as assailants in white shirts stormed the carriages, as seen in footage broadcast live and a video shot by a lawmaker. Protesters returning from a pro-democracy march in the city center, as well as journalists and bystanders, were battered with sticks, umbrellas and what appeared to be metal rods. Viral videos showed people being beaten as they scrambled up escalators to escape; others were chased onto an idle train, cornered and assaulted. One young man was seen pleading for peace before an attacker lunged toward him and punched him in the face. By the end of the rampage — which lasted roughly two hours in two waves of violence — 45 people were hospitalized, one in critical condition, according to the city’s Hospital Authority. Throughout much of the ordeal, police were nowhere to be seen. Social media users quickly arrived at the same conclusion: Organized criminal gangs, known as triad societies, were likely behind the attack. On Monday, police seemingly confirmed the link, arresting six men, including suspected members of the triads. “Is Hong Kong now allowing triads to do what they want, beating up people on the street with weapons?” legislator Lam Cheuk-ting told local broadcaster RTHK.

607,Currie Engel,"Iceland is mourning the loss of one of its famous glaciers, Okjökull Glacier, in an official memorial ceremony that will take place on August 18. Following an “Un-glacier tour” led by two Rice University anthropologists, the attendees will install a special plaque with a somber inscription, “a letter to the future,” which will commemorate the sad occasion. The formerly-massive body of ice, commonly referred to simply as “Ok glacier,” lost its glacier status in 2014 after melting down to only 0.386 square miles, or 6.6% of its original 5.8 square miles, The Guardian reported. Scientists cite global warming as the cause of this change in the glacier’s mass. The glacier is now categorized as something glaciologists call “dead ice,” which means that the glacier has stopped moving and has melted down into a different type of terrain called moraine, an accumulation of clay, silt, sand and gravel. A 2018 documentary called Not Ok details the events of the glacier’s demise, and actually prompted the idea for the creation of a memorial. Produced by Rice University anthropologists, Cymene Howe and Dominic Boyer, and narrated by former Reykjavík mayor, Jón Gnarr, the film helps bring the dire effects of climate change to life in the form of a glacier-turned-narrator who talks at what Howe calls “mountain speed”— a slowed-down version of the former mayor’s voice. Howe tells TIME that it is really just “a small story that tells a much bigger story about climate change.” The documentary’s website calls this memorial “the world’s first monument to a glacier-that-was.” Understanding the implications this event has on the Icelandic community, the anthropologists tasked famous Icelandic writer Andri Snaer Magnason with eulogizing this glacier and warning the future of what is to come. The chilling inscription on the plaque reads: “Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years, all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.” The memorial plaque also notes the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is currently 415 parts per million. But Ok isn’t the only glacier that scientists are concerned about. The Thwaites glacier in Antarctica— a glacier about the size of Florida— is another unstable body that is being closely monitored. The melting of this glacier would significantly raise sea levels. Iceland alone is home to over 400 glaciers, all of which could share Ok glacier’s fate by 2200, scientists say. Yet, it’s not alone.",Scientists Unveil Memorial to Iceland's 'First' Dead Glacier Lost to Climate Change,"July 22, 2019"
608,Ciara Nugent,"Iranian forces on Friday seized the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz, a geopolitically vital sea route connecting the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. The move has escalated tensions even further amid already strained relations between Tehran and Western powers, which took a nosedive after the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year. Iranian authorities claimed the Stena Impero was “violating international maritime rules.” But the country’s leaders have also suggested the seizure was retaliation for Britain’s role in detaining an Iranian tanker earlier in July. Outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday called the Stena Impero incident “unacceptable and highly escalatory.” But the U.K. hasn’t yet revealed how it will respond to the tanker’s seizure. Here’s what to know about the Stena Impero and its connection to rising tensions between Iran and Western powers. The Stena Impero, a U.K.-registered oil tanker, was traveling to a port in Saudi Arabia on Friday when Iran’s Revolutionary Guard stopped it in the Strait of Hormuz and took it to the nearby Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. The vessel’s crew of 23, including Indian, Latvian, Filipino and Russian nationals, are believed to be in “good health,” according to a statement from Stena Bulk, the company that owns the Stena Impero. The company said it has made an official request to visit its crew members, but Iran has not yet formally responded. Audio of the incident shared Sunday by a risk consultancy group features what is allegedly an English-speaking member of the Revolutionary Guard telling the Stena Impero crew to alter their course. “If you obey, you will be safe,” they said. The Strait of Hormuz, off Iran’s southern coast, is a crucial waterway for international oil flows, with 17.4 million barrels passing through each day. That’s around a third of all oil transported by sea, and a fifth of the world’s total oil supply.",What to Know About the British-Flagged Oil Tanker Seized by Iran Amid Escalating Tensions,"July 22, 2019"
609,Golnar Motevalli / Bloomberg,"Iran, locked in a worsening political standoff with Western powers, has handed down death sentences to several nationals accused of being part of a CIA-trained spy network uncovered earlier this year, an official said on Monday. Seventeen people were arrested in all, a senior intelligence official told foreign media in Tehran. None of the suspects are dual nationals, according to the official, who declined to be identified and didn’t say how many were sentenced to death. The announcement marks a show of force by Iran at a time of turbulent ties with the U.S. after the Trump administration withdrew from an 2015 nuclear accord with the Islamic Republic and reimposed crippling sanctions on its economy. The friction was made worse by a diplomatic crisis between Iran and the U.K., which seized an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar earlier this month, saying it carried oil bound for Syria in violation of United Nations sanctions. Iran responded by holding a British tanker on Friday near the Strait of Hormuz, a shipping chokepoint through which about 40% of the world’s seaborne oil travels. The Iranian Intelligence Ministry has detected an uptick in U.S. efforts to recruit spies in Iran since the election of President Donald Trump in 2016 and the appointment of Gina Haspel as director of the CIA last year, the official said. Iranian officials have identified the CIA agents who had recruited the suspects as diplomats based in Turkey, Zimbabwe and Finland. A program aired by state television on Monday showed clips of Trump and National Security Adviser John Bolton with Hormuz as the backdrop. The show identified the alleged members of the cell and contained what the network said were confessions by the accused, whose faces were blurred and voices distorted. The alleged spies were trained by the CIA to gather classified information from sensitive locations in Iran including military bases, nuclear facilities and economic centers, the official said. The American spy agency lured recruits by promising residency and jobs in the U.S. and safe passage out of Iran, setting up shell companies as a cover to approach and hire Iranians, he added.",Iran Arrested 17 People Accused of Being CIA-Trained Spies,"July 22, 2019"
610,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam failed Monday to allay public anger over violent attacks in the city overnight, condemning what she called “riotous” protesters who vandalized a Chinese government building before expressing “regret” that a gang of men armed with rods and cudgels attacked demonstrators and others in the early hours of the morning. A day of mostly peaceful protests descended into violence late Sunday as police clashed with demonstrators in a central neighborhood while, across the harbor, an organized mob attacked protesters, journalists and passersby in the most barbaric episode of protest-related violence since the unrest began in early June. The latter incident caused public outrage as authorities were accused of doing little to stop the violence. Outside the Central Police Station, columns of police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of protesters following a tense standoff during which demonstrators hurled projectiles at officers. Some of the demonstrators had earlier been seen defacing the facade and insignia of the Chinese government’s liaison office, seen as a direct affront to Beijing. “The [Hong Kong] government hereby strongly condemns a few radical protesters who viciously surrounded and stormed the Chinese Liaison office, and they defaced the national emblem, openly challenging our country’s sovereignty,” Lam, the city’s chief executive, said at a press conference. Using language more frequently seen in Chinese state mouthpieces, Lam said the protesters “hurt the feelings of the people and angered the entire city.” More troubling to many in Hong Kong was the violence that unfolded in the outlying neighborhood of Yuen Long, where a mob of men wearing white shirts and armed mostly with sticks, believed to be members of “triad” gangs and apparently targeting protesters, indiscriminately attacked passengers at a subway station. At least 45 people were injured in the melee, according to the city’s hospital authority, including a lawmaker and several journalists. Witnesses said police were slow to respond, and when they arrived they were ineffective. Lam, joined by Security Secretary Lee Ka-chiu and Police Commissioner Stephen Lo, described the violence as “shocking” and vowed to pursue and prosecute those accountable. “I hereby offer my strong condemnation. Hong Kong is a city with rule of law, we do not tolerate the occurrence of any violence,” Lam said.

612,"Alex Morales, Alex Longley and Golnar Motevalli / Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) — The U.K. sought to lower tensions after Iran seized a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz on Friday, an incident that increased friction in one of the world’s critical energy chokepoints. The U.K. demanded the immediate release of the Stena Impero and on Saturday summoned Iran’s charge d’affaires, Mohsen Omidzamani, in London. While the government threatened Iran with “serious consequences” and advised U.K. ships to avoid the area, ministers on Sunday sought to dial down the rhetoric. “We need to try and de-escalate this,” Defense Minister Tobias Ellwood said in a Sky News interview. “Our first and most important responsibility is to make sure that we get a solution to the issue to do with the current ship, make sure other British-flagged ships are safe to operate in these waters and then look at the wider picture of actually having a working proper professional relationship with Iran.” Tensions have been flaring in the Strait of Hormuz in recent weeks as Iran lashes out against U.S. sanctions that are crippling its oil exports and after the seizure of one of its tankers near Gibraltar. The Strait accounts for about a third of the world’s seaborne oil flows, and Brent crude rallied as much as 2.4% on Friday’s news. The U.K. plans to take further measures this week, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in a statement without giving details on what action would be taken. The Sunday Telegraph said diplomatic and economic measures, including a freeze on Iranian assets, are being considered and the U.K. may push the European Union and United Nations to reimpose sanctions on Iran. But on Sunday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond sought to downplay that threat. “We’ve already got a wide raft of sanctions against Iran, particularly financial sanctions, so it’s not clear that there are immediate additional things that we can do but we are of course looking at all the options,” Hammond said in a BBC interview. Still, “it was an illegal act and we’re going to pursue every possible diplomatic route to resolve this issue.” Iran doesn’t have any assets that the British government could seize, according to Ali Naghi Seyyed-Khamoushi, head of the Iran-Britain Joint Chamber of Commerce in Tehran. Any sanctions would not affect Iran’s exports and imports to any great extent, he said, according Iran’s Tasnim news agency. With U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May set to leave office on Wednesday, the latest clash with Iran presents a diplomatic headache for her successor.

613,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Protests in Hong Kong against alleged police violence descended into more chaotic clashes Sunday night as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse angry, black-clad demonstrators hurling bricks, umbrellas and glass bottles at officers, while elsewhere in the city a mob apparently targeting protesters attacked dozens of passengers at a subway station. Masked demonstrators, many covered up with plastic cling wrap and other protective gear, yelled chants of “Hong Kong police: You know the law, you broke the law!” as they advanced against retreating police lines around 10 p.m. local time in a downtown neighborhood called Sheung Wan. Hong Kong Police said on Twitter that they advanced to clear the area because the Central Police Station “was under attack,” as protesters threw bricks and “petrol bombs” at officers. Several pro-democratic lawmakers, who support the protests, initially positioned themselves between police and demonstrators to try and de-escalate the situation. Following a tense standoff, police fired several rounds of tear gas toward the crowd and were met with more fury. Local media reported that police fired rubber bullets, though it is unclear how many were injured. Meanwhile in an area called Yuen Long, police were accused of responding too slowly as protesters came under attack by groups of men in white shirts with wooden sticks and other weapons. Lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting and several local journalists were among those injured. Videos shared on social media showed chaotic scenes unfolding in a train station, where members of the mob at one point were seen cornering people on a train and beating them. The violence at Yuen Long marked an unprecedented escalation as the organized mob wreaked indiscriminate havoc in what appears to have been a complete absence of authorities. Organizers say hundreds of thousands withstood sweltering heat to join in the seventh consecutive week of mass demonstrations that have plunged the city into a political crisis and galvanized resistance to Beijing’s growing influence in the China-ruled territory. The demonstrations have been largely peaceful, but have fallen into a pattern of descending into violence after assembly permits expire and protesters stay behind against police warnings. Since early June, organizers say millions have marched in the series of demonstrations against a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. The city’s embattled leader Carrie Lam declared the bill “dead” but has not officially withdrawn it, and the movement has snowballed to demand more democratic freedoms as anger toward her Beijing-backed government spilled out into the open and united large swaths of society. Sunday’s march, organized by the Civil Human Rights Front, demanded that the government fully withdraw the bill, retract its characterization of recent protests as a “riot,” ensure accountability for alleged instances of police violence toward protesters, and grant citizens the right to freely elect the city’s leadership. CHRF estimates 430,000 people attended; the group’s estimates regularly conflict with much lower police figures. “In the whole world, it is only our government that thinks these protesters are rioters,” Jimmy Sham, co-convener of CHRF, said in a speech at the start of the march before crowds erupted in chants of “Democracy now!” and “Free Hong Kong!” Anger at times focused on Lam, the chief executive, with Sham denouncing her as a “pathological liar” and some demonstrators hoisting signs decrying her “tyranny.”",Fresh Hong Kong Protests End in Chaotic Clashes,"Updated: July 21, 2019 9:19 PM ET"
614,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: Europe has a new president! Sort of. Germany’s former defense minister Ursula Von der Leyen became the new president-elect of the European Commission (EC) this week following a close vote in the European Parliament. Why It Matters: Whoever leads the European Commission—the EU’s executive arm—is the most powerful person in the day-to-day affairs of the European Union and oversees 32,000 EU bureaucrats. Traditionally, the role of the European Commission (made up of Commissioners from each one of the 28 member states; 27 once Britain gets on with Brexit) is to propose new legislation and policies that are then voted on by the European Parliament (more on that below) and to implement those policies in areas reserved to the EU (as opposed to national governments); it also speaks for the EU in international negotiations. The President of the EC decides which Commissioners get which policy portfolios, and generally drives the EC’s policy agenda; he/she also represents the EU in major international meetings like the G7 and G20. Von der Leyen, who is a close ally of Angela Merkel’s and a member of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party back in Germany, is the first woman to ever hold the post. But her victory came at a cost. One of the key concessions Von der Leyen made to get reluctant members of European Parliament (MEPs) on board was giving them the “right of the initiative”, i.e. assurances that the Commission would act on whatever resolutions were passed by the European parliament. Up until this week, it was only the Commission that could propose laws and MEPs would have to vote whether to approve of them or not. In a bid to get more MEPs to back her, Von der Leyen also offered to put Europe on a path to carbon neutrality by 2050 and to discuss the introduction of a minimum wage (among other pledges). Why was it necessary for Von der Leyen to offer so many concessions to secure the post? Because her nomination didn’t come from the European Parliament as has been expected by MEPs, but rather as a compromise from the leaders of the major European countries in a backroom deal (the same deal that resulted in Christine Lagarde heading up the European Central Bank). That institutional clash made her election difficult, as did the fractious political landscape of Europe. European politics are much messier than traditional left-right politics (though that plays a big role, too); it’s also about integration vs. Euro-skepticism, Eastern Europe vs. Western Europe, core Europe vs. periphery Europe, pro-climate change action vs. anti, and so on. And while European leaders—notably France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Merkel—were able to strike a deal that secured a majority among MEP members (however slight), the roundabout way that Von der Leyen (a committed Europhile who supports more European integration and reforms, and even a European army) was elected will provide more fodder for anti-EU politicians across the continent railing against unaccountable bureaucrats back in Brussels.

615,Jasmine Aguilera,"More record-breaking heat was reported throughout Europe in a second heatwave to strike the continent so far this summer. Scientists say July will likely be the hottest July on record, following the hottest June on record. These types of heatwaves are expected to become more frequent throughout the world as global warming continues, say scientists. Extreme heat was felt in France, England, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Paris experienced it’s hottest day in history on July 25, where temperatures reached 108.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The previous record was 104.7 degrees more than 70 years ago, according to AccuWeather. At least five people have died as a result of the heat, AccuWeather reports. London’s highest temperature record was also broken on July 15, where Heathrow Airport saw a high of 98.42 degrees Fahrenheit. The previous record was 98.06 degrees. The extreme July temperatures in Europe follow the hottest June on record. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports the average global temperature for June was 1.71 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average of 59.9 degrees. NOAA also reported record-breaking decreases in sea ice coverage in the Arctic and Antarctica. “Our climate is warming,” Ahira Sánchez-Lugo, a climatologist at NOAA, tells TIME. “We have a new normal, we are in a new warmer climate. Just in the 21st century, we’ve set a new global world temperature record five times.” On July 23, Bordeaux, a city in southwestern France, experienced it’s hottest recorded temperature, a high of 41.2 degrees Celsius, or 106.16 degrees Fahrenheit. The Netherlands also experienced it’s hottest temperature on record on July 25 with a high of 40.7 degrees Celsius, or 105.26 degrees Fahrenheit. The previous Netherlands high was 38.6 degrees Celsius, or 101.48 degrees Fahrenheit, back in 1944. Robert Rohde, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, tells TIME that July is also likely to be the hottest July on record, as global temperatures continue to trend towards increasing heat. Regionally, hot June temperatures broke records in Europe, Africa and South America, and it was the hottest first half of the year for Alaska, Madagascar, New Zealand, Mexico, western Canada and eastern Asia.",A Deadly Heat Wave After the Hottest June On Record: How the Climate Crisis Is Creating 'a New Normal',"Updated: August 1, 2019 11:22 AM ET | Originally published: July 19, 2019"
616,Billy Perrigo,"Can Queen Elizabeth stop Brexit? The question has been dismissed as pure fantasy by those on both sides of the Brexit debate in the past. But according to a new report by the BBC’s Newsnight program, rebel lawmakers have drawn up a plan to ask Britain’s constitutional head of state to take the most drastic step of her 67-year reign, wading into U.K. politics for the first time ever in order to stop a so-called “no deal” Brexit. The news comes as Britain prepares itself for a new Prime Minister, expected to be former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Some lawmakers are now concerned that Johnson—who is in favor of a hard break with the European Union—will try to push through a “no deal” Brexit, where the U.K. leaves the political and economic bloc without an agreement for trade and commerce to continue. A majority of lawmakers in Parliament are against a “no deal” Brexit, but Johnson has refused to rule out overruling parliament via prorogation, or effectively locking the chamber’s doors so no vote can take place. To prevent this, the BBC reports, these unnamed lawmakers would invite the Queen to travel to the next E.U. summit in place of Johnson, in defiance of precedent and constitutional norms. There, under the plan, the Queen would ask other E.U. leaders to delay the U.K.’s departure, foiling Johnson’s plan to leave with or without a deal on the current deadline of Oct. 31. But there’s a sizeable hitch: no monarch has so directly involved themselves in the country’s politics since 1707, when Queen Anne refused royal assent to a bill. Like her ancestors, the Queen is bound by convention to be entirely neutral in the running of the country. Although she meets with the Prime Minister regularly, she does not vote and has never publicly intervened or ventured opinions on political matters. So while technically possible it would be nothing short of a constitutional overhaul if this plan were to go ahead — and outside of the realms of plausibility, according to one leading expert. “This idea that the Queen could be asked to go on a mission to some European summit is completely wacky,“ Robert Hazell, a professor of Government and the Constitution at University College London, tells TIME. “E.U. summits are heads of government meetings. They are not meetings of heads of state. The Queen of Denmark is not going to be there. The King of Sweden is not going to be there. The Queen would be a very very odd one out if she attended as a representative of the British government.” But if the next Prime Minister decides to prorogue parliament, the Queen would be involved one way or another. The legislative body can only be prorogued if the Prime Minister asks the Queen to do so and she accepts. Under extreme circumstances, the Queen would be within her constitutionally-mandated limits to say no.",Could Queen Elizabeth Stop a 'No Deal' Brexit?,"July 19, 2019"

Police said the man sprayed sprayed an unidentified liquid accelerant before starting the fire, according to the Associated Press. The violent attack — one of the worst incidences of mass violence in Japan’s history — shocked the country, where violent crime is rare. According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, Japan has one of the world’s lowest murder rates at 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2017 (compared with 5.3 per 100,000 people in the U.S.). But the country has a grisly record of violent rampages, and they appear to be becoming more common. Here’s a short history of mass violence in Japan. In 1995, members of a Japanese religious cult released sarin gas in the Tokyo subway during rush hour. Twelve people died, and more than 6,000 people sought medical attention. The same group killed eight people and harmed more than 200 the previous year, also using sarin gas, which was released into the air in a residential neighborhood near the homes of judges who were working on a court case involving the cult. Aum Shinrikyo, the doomsday cult behind the attacks, was designated a terrorist organization by the State Department in 2010. Recent estimates suggest the group still has around 1,500 followers. Most of its current members live in Japan, but a few hundred can also be found in Russia.","Japan Is Among the World's Safest Countries, Though It Has a Grisly Record of Mass Violence","July 19, 2019"

British budget carrier Jet2 accused passenger Chloe Haines of “a catalogue of aggressive, abusive and dangerous behavior,” including trying to open the aircraft door, during a flight from the U.K. to Turkey. The airline said in a statement Haines was restrained by crew with the help of other passengers as two military fighter jets escorted the aircraft back to London Standsted. Jet2 said the jets caused a sonic boom that was heard for miles. Upon landing back at the airport, police boarded the plane and arrested Haines, who is accused of assault and endangering an aircraft. In addition to the bill, which Jet2 said accounted for costs incurred in diverting the flight, Haines has been banned from the carrier for life. “Miss Haines’ behavior was one of the most serious cases of disruptive passenger behavior that we have experienced,” Jet2.com CEO Steve Heapy said in a statement. “As a family friendly airline, we take an absolutely zero tolerance approach to disruptive behavior, and we hope that this sobering incident, with its very serious consequences, provides a stark warning to others who think that they can behave in this fashion,” he added.

619,Amy Gunia,"A rare New Zealand bird once thought to be extinct is having its most successful breeding season in years. The kākāriki karaka, also known as the orange-fronted parakeet, is having an “epic” breeding season due to a “beech seed bonanza,” Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage said in a statement Wednesday. “This year’s epic breeding provides a much-needed boost to the kākāriki karaka population,” Sage said in the statement. She said that 150 chicks have been born in the wild so far this season, which is a potential doubling of the bird’s current population. Sage said that 31 nests — more than three times the number in recent years — have already been found this year. “It is great news that this year there are more than three times the number of nests compared to previous years,” she said. The bird eats plants and insects, and this years breeding boom can be explained by an abundance of beech seeds. “There has been so much seed on the beech trees the birds just keep on breeding with some parakeet pairs onto their fifth clutch of eggs. When there’s no beech mast they typically have just one or two clutches,” Sage said. The bird is New Zealand’s rarest mainland forest bird, according to the Department of Conservation, with only about 100 to 300 left in the world before this year’s chicks were born.",A 'Beech Bonanza' Boosted the Population of This Critically Endangered New Zealand Bird,"July 19, 2019"
620,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"In a narrow office, just across the bay from mainland China, sits the God of Hong Kong Protests. Roy Kwong, a social worker turned politician, is fielding back-to-back interviews while writing a column about the police response to discontent flaring in the city this summer. He’s due for a live radio call in 15 minutes. The 36-year-old legislator appeared on the front lines soon after the mass marches kicked off in June, when he heard police were conducting random searches at train stations. He rushed to the scene to offer assistance to young protesters and has been a fixture at the demonstrations ever since, always ready to fire off three rules of engagement at the crowd through his megaphone: don’t get injured, don’t spill blood, and don’t get arrested. Kwong has vowed to safeguard the teenagers thronging to the streets in a rebellion against Beijing’s choke hold on the semi-autonomous enclave. No one, he says, should “have to pay the price of their youth.” Whenever police phalanxes ready fresh volleys of tear gas, Kwong puts himself in front of the protesters, trying to buy time for a retreat. When the leaderless movement loses steam, he channels his hero, Abraham Lincoln, and delivers extemporaneous speeches. Before a protester fell to his death from a mall last month, Kwong was there, begging him to come down. Kwong’s dedication—he even passed out from exhaustion in front of a protest bloc—has earned him something the Hong Kong government is direly short on: trust. It’s also made him Hong Kong’s most popular lawmaker. Rarely do politicians inspire spontaneous applause by mere presence, but that’s how young people in Hong Kong respond to him. They’ve nicknamed him “God Kwong.” “Whenever there’s trouble he rushes there regardless of whether he’s sick or tired,” says Kung, a 25-year-old protester. “We call him a god because he seems like he’s mighty.” Before he emerged as the tutelary deity of student protesters, Kwong built a reputation as a prolific romance novelist, producing work with such titles as The Appearance of Regret and There Is a Kind of Happiness Called Forgetting. (He remains an author to this day, with his latest tale We Are Together appearing just this week.) He has brought equal passion to Hong Kong’s legislature, to which he was elected as a Democratic Party lawmaker in 2016. His spirited antics—like standing on his desk to oppose the establishment of mainland Chinese jurisdiction at a train terminus—contrast sharply against a bureaucracy widely perceived as out of touch.","'Whenever There’s Trouble He Rushes There.'

621,Amy Gunia,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called China’s treatment of Uihgurs, a Muslim minority group, the “stain of the century” while speaking at a conference in Washington D.C. Thursday, Reuters reports. The State Department estimates that between 800,000 to 2 million Turkic Muslims, including Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and others, are being held in internment camps that Beijing has called “re-education” centers. Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, make up roughly 40% of the population of the northwestern province of Xinjiang. “China is home to one of the worst human rights crises of our time; it is truly the stain of the century,” Pompeo said, speaking at a U.S.-hosted conference on religious freedom, according to Reuters. Pompeo also said Chinese officials had discouraged countries from attending the conference. “Is that consistent with the guarantee of religious belief that is found directly in the Chinese constitution?” he asked, reports Reuters. U.S. officials have repeatedly denounced China’s detention of Muslim minorities, and Reuters reports that the Trump administration has been considering implementing sanctions over their policies in Xinjiang. Tensions are already running high between the U.S. and China, who are in the midst of a damaging trade war. China has defended the detentions as a means of combatting terrorism, and has tried to pass the camps off as “vocational training” centers similar to “boarding schools.” On Thursday, the country further defended its actions. “In China this situation of so-called religious persecution does not exist,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a press conference in Beijing after the White House ceremony, according to Reuters. “We demand that the United States correctly view China’s religious policies and the status of religious freedom in China, and stop using the issue of religion to interfere in other countries’ affairs.”",Pompeo Calls China's Treatment of Uighurs the 'Stain of the Century',"July 19, 2019"
622,Jasmine Aguilera,"Overfishing, hunting and land development have pushed more species closer to extinction, according to a new report. The Red List report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) found that 27% of the more than 105,000 species the organization has analyzed are at risk of extinction, a total of 28,338 different species. IUCN also found that no species on its list have shown any sign of improvement since it was last updated in December 2018. “Things are not getting better, they are getting worse,” Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN Red List unit, tells TIME. The Red List places the 105,732 species of plants and animals that it analyses into different categories: the number of species that are considered threatened fall into the categories of vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered. However, there are an additional 6,435 species that fall into the near-threatened category. The endangerment of species is not only a critical issue for animal and plant life but can also have a detrimental impact for humans. “The future of humanity — food, fresh water, drinking water, clean air — is all dependent on maintaining the biodiversity around us,” Hilton-Taylor says. “We can’t afford to lose any of these species.” Hilton-Taylor says that while updating the the Red List, scientists usually find species that can be removed from a high risk category because of conservation efforts — but this time around, species have either maintained their status or have moved into a higher risk category. This appears to demonstrate that current conservation efforts are not enough to stem the level of destruction. “The numbers are just horrendous, that’s totally frightening,” Lee Hannah, a climate change biologist at Conservation International, tells TIME. “We’ve had a lot of great progress, we’ve got national parks, community conservancies, a lot of great conservation going on around the world, and these numbers tell us that it’s just not enough.”","'The Numbers Are Just Horrendous.'

625,Jacob Davey,"“We are being replaced,” the Belgian politician Dries van Langenhove repeatedly posted on social media this Spring. Despite his use of words echoing the rhetoric found in two recent terrorist manifestos, his far-right party Vlaams Belang (“Flemish Interest”) made historic gains in Belgium’s 2019 triple election. Popular support for politicians who build their campaigns around anti-migrant and anti-Muslim themes have surged across the Western world. So have hate-speech, hate crimes and terror attacks against minority communities, as data from the US, the UK and Germany show. Just over the last few months, the idea that white populations are being systematically replaced by non-whites has been referenced in major terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand and San Diego, California. Our new research has found that the theory that became known as the “great replacement” has gained significant traction across social media. The so-called ‘Great Replacement’ theory argues that white populations are being replaced at an ethnic and cultural level through migration and the growth of minority communities. Certain ethnic and religious groups – in particular Muslims – are typically singled out as being culturally incompatible with the lives of majority groups in Western countries and thus a particular threat. Conversation around “the great replacement” is steadily increasing, with the number of tweets mentioning the theory nearly tripling in four years from just over 120,000 in 2014 to just over 330,000 in 2018. English-speaking countries now account for 33 percent of related online discussions. How could something that was a fringe idea in France in 2014 morph into a globally propagated concept? Our monitoring of extremist groups across the world suggests that European Identitarian and US alt-right networks have skillfully employed a communications playbook that draws on tried-and-tested tactics including the use of memes and video content to promote the “great replacement” theory across social media platforms. Ideological legitimacy is added to these through pseudo-scientific studies into race and intelligence, as well as the use of official demographic data which is often twisted and misread. To reach selected target audiences, campaigns are tailored to match the grievances of different communities – reaching from anti-LGBT and anti-abortion narratives to white identity and anti-establishment messages. In the US, the “It’s okay to be white” campaign launched by the alt-right in 2017 illustrated how this is sometimes done in an unbranded and anonymous fashion. Such “Trojan horse” campaigns can be especially effective in getting amplification from more mainstream influencers. Ultimately, “It’s okay to be white” propaganda was not just spread by extreme-right activists in the form of campus stickers and Twitter hashtags, but also received a boost from Tucker Carlson on Fox News. Our analysis shows that theories such as the “great replacement” and “white genocide” have effectively made their ways into societal and political discourse. In the past year alone, politicians from across Europe have explicitly mentioned the theory in speeches, interviews and on social media. In a number of other incidents politicians have used fiery rhetoric to discuss migration in a way which closely mirrors the language employed by extremists. President Donald Trump was among the ten most influential figures referenced in English-language Twitter conversations surrounding the “great replacement” theory.","We Analyzed How the ""Great Replacement"" and Far Right Ideas Spread Online.

627,Ian Bremmer,"No leader wants to face voters when times are tough, particularly in this era of wild-card winners, incumbent losers and brand-new political parties in country after country. That’s why Argentina’s President Mauricio Macri is still widely considered an underdog to win re-election in October. Last year he told Argentina’s people that after years of economic crisis and isolation, “the worst is over.” That might be true. Their currency has stabilized, inflation is finally slowing, and the cost of borrowing is down. On the other hand, the improvement is marginal. The economy remains in recession, the unemployment rate is still 10%, and price inflation is above 50%. To meet the demands of the International Monetary Fund–a lender that many Argentines love to hate for the austerity it demanded in return for its cash through years of economic hardship–Macri’s government has cut spending. The opponent he’s likely to face in a second-round runoff doesn’t carry much political baggage. Alberto Fernández presents himself as a moderate of the center-left, a man who pledges to win a better deal from the IMF without destroying the country’s hard-won financial credibility. But his running mate is another matter. Fernandez’s choice for Vice President is former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (no relation), the biggest lightning rod in the country and now Macri’s best chance to beat Fernandez. Cristina, as she’s known to her supporters, governed Argentina from 2007 to 2015. During those eight years, she nearly ran the country into the ground, in part by playing to voter frustration by declaring war on a group of foreign lenders. Her government manipulated economic statistics. Graft in politics and business was widespread. Cristina faces several ongoing corruption cases. If Alberto Fernández chose her as his election partner, it is because of her loyal following among Peronist voters. Macri, the man elected four years ago to right a listing economic ship, can hope the economy continues to improve quickly enough to blunt public demand for change. But he knows it takes time for voters to feel even a strong recovery–and time is slipping away. He has tried to co-opt his opponents’ populism by choosing a moderate Peronist as his running mate. He has focused his campaign at times on noneconomic accomplishments, like better roads and cleaner water on his watch. But in the end, his message will sound something like this: “You are not yet better off than when you first elected me President, but you are far better off than when Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was your President.” He can argue that outside forces beyond his control, like lower prices for Argentina’s exports and expectations for higher interest rates in the U.S., have made things tougher. He can claim that Cristina is to blame for the depth of the hole Argentina is still digging itself out of, and her presence on the opposition ticket will help him make her past rule a warning for the future. That’s still a tough sell for the incumbent Macri, particularly in an era when voters in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, France and Italy have shoved aside establishment politicians. We’ll get an early indication of Argentina’s political temperature on Aug. 11, when voters turn out, or fail to, for party primaries. That will provide a good gauge of whether the dominant mood is demand for change or fear that the future might mean a return to an ugly past.

On July 12, a train carrying 2.5 million liters of water arrived in the city of Chennai. That load will provide relief to residents who have struggled with shortages for the past month, but a “Day Zero”–when piped water sources are expected to run dry–is on the horizon for 20 other cities across the country. In the 2018 monsoon, Chennai, home to more than 8 million people, saw 55% less rainfall than average–the worst drought in 70 years. Located in the state of Tamil Nadu, Chennai was once rich in lakes and wetlands. But rapid urbanization has diminished these sources; millions of city residents now line up daily in sweltering heat to collect small rations of water. Some people have turned to open defecation as a way to reduce water usage, or are reusing dirty water for cooking and cleaning. According to an Indian government think tank, the countrywide drought has left 600 million people dealing with high to extreme water shortages. Chennai joins the long list of cities around the world facing such emergencies, which have been made more likely by the unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change. Cape Town, Mexico City and São Paulo have also faced a Day Zero in recent years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently promised piped water for all Indian homes by 2024.

Engel, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, according to the Times, adding that the Iran emergency was “phony” and conceived “to trample on this body’s constitutional duties.” Many Republicans supported Trump’s enactment of the emergency measures amid what the administration portrayed as heightened tensions with Iran. “The decision to move forward with these arms sales is part of a larger effort to deter Iran,” Michael McCaul, member of the Foreign Affairs committee had previously said, according to the Times. Washington’s relationship with Saudi Arabia has caused a rift between Congress and the President, who has refused to speak out against the kingdom. In April, legislators voted to end U.S. involvement in a Saudi-led war in Yemen which has caused high civilian casualties. More than more than 7,500 children have died or been injured. Trump vetoed the decision, according to the Times. Saudi Arabia’s leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (commonly known as MBS) is also believed to be responsible for the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the Saudi regime. A recent U.N. report found “credible evidence” warranting further investigation of bin Salman for his role in the killing. Khashoggi was one of the journalists named as TIME Person of the Year in 2018, for “taking great risks in pursuit of greater truths, for the imperfect but essential quest for facts that are central to civil discourse, for speaking up and for speaking out.”","Defying Trump, House Votes to Block Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia","July 18, 2019"
632,Amy Gunia,"Cambodia announced that it will send 1,600 tonnes of plastic waste back to the U.S. and Canada, becoming the latest Southeast Asian country join the backlash against taking in the developed world’s trash. The country’s environment minister said 83 shipping containers of garbage were found Tuesday at Cambodia’s main port in Sihanoukville, according to the Guardian. Seventy of the containers came from the U.S. and 13 were shipped from Canada. “Cambodia is not a dustbin where foreign countries can dispose of out-of-date e-waste, and the government also opposes any import of plastic waste and lubricants to be recycled in this country,” Neth Pheaktra, a spokesman for the country’s environment minister, said according to the Guardian. Read More: Southeast Asia Doesn’t Want to Be the World’s Dumping Ground. Here’s How Some Countries Are Pushing Back The spokesman said that the government plans to investigate how and why the containers were sent to the country, and fines might be imposed on companies responsible for shipping the waste, reports the Guardian. Last week, Prime Minister Hun Sen said Cambodia does not allow plastic waste or recyclables to be sent there, according to the Guardian. Southeast Asia saw a huge spike in plastic waste shipments after China, who was the largest importer of scrap plastic, banned the import of plastic waste in at the beginning of 2018 because of severe pollution due to a poorly managed waste process. But several countries have pushed back. In May, Malaysia said it would send waste back to where it came from, and the Philippines sent 69 containers of garbage for the shores of Vancouver in late May.

633,Margaret Talev and David Wainer / Bloomberg,"The U.S. “shot itself in the foot” by pulling out of the nuclear accord with Iran, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said, offering a grim outlook for the chance of opening talks with President Donald Trump. Zarif, in an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg Television, also accused European countries that are part of the agreement of failing to carry out their own commitments under the 2015 deal and after the U.S. withdrawal. He said promises to allow Iran to sell oil and repatriate money have failed to materialize. Addressing U.S. allegations that Iran has never given up its goal of building nuclear weapons, Zarif said Iran has the technical ability to pursue them “very rapidly” but “we’re not going to” because Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made a “religious commitment” that they are forbidden, Zarif said in the interview with Bloomberg Editor in Chief John Micklethwait. “If we wanted to build nuclear weapons, we could have built it a long time ago,” said Zarif, who was in New York to address a United Nations meeting. Nevertheless, Zarif signaled that Iran will continue to pursue what he called the Islamic Republic’s rights under the accord to respond to the U.S. withdrawal and failed European efforts to deliver promised benefits to the Iranian economy. Tensions have soared in the Persian Gulf region since the Trump administration stopped issuing sanctions waivers for buyers of Iranian oil and reimposed crippling economic measures against Tehran. In response, Iran has started gradually breaching parts of the nuclear accord, confirming in July that it had surpassed agreed caps on its stockpiles of enriched uranium and exceeded the allowable level of enrichment. “Yeah, we will continue with the steps, and these steps are legal, in line with the agreement,” Zarif said, when asked about the likelihood of continuing uranium enrichment. The threat of conflict appeared to climb even higher following a spate of attacks on ships in the Persian Gulf region in May and June, the downing of an American drone last month and the recent British seizure of a tanker carrying Iranian crude, which U.K. officials said was violating sanctions by heading toward Syria. Last month Trump said he called off retaliatory strikes on Iran over the drone, which U.S. officials claim was over international waters and Iran says was over their territory.","The U.S. 'Shot Itself in the Foot' by Pulling Out of the Nuclear Deal, Iranian Foreign Minister Says","July 18, 2019"
634,Cady Lang,"Taking over with the Area 51 raid apparently isn’t enough to sate the Internet’s hunger for collective force. Following the rabid success of the “Storm Area 51” Facebook event-turned-potential-meme of the year, there’s been an apparent uptick in “storming” events all around the world. While the original “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us” Facebook event has garnered 1.5 million potential attendees to date, it’s been clear that the event was a moment of collective jest for the Internet, who quickly created out-of-this-world memes and jokes about it. That humor was somewhat lost on the Air Force, who went so far as to make a statement that “any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous.” The playful spirit of “Storm Area 51,” however, is now being reincarnated in new events around the globe. From Australia to New York City, it’s clear that this meme and movement has arrived. Read on for a guide to the other places that the Internet wants to storm. Following in the creators of “Storm Area 51″‘s search for alleged sightings of life unknown, fans of the Loch Ness monster have upped the ante by creating a Facebook event of their own, appropriately titled, “Storm Loch Ness, Nessie Can’t Hide From Us All.” The search for the beloved creature who “lives” in the Loch Ness has garnered 21k people who have committed to the event, with 43k who have expressed interest in it. The volunteer Royal National Lifeboat Institution, who patrol the Loch Ness, has cautioned against people storming the loch, especially since their unit has less resources than the US military at Area 51. “With no US Army involved, Loch Ness looks a little less hazardous than storming Area 51, but here we have our own set of problems,” she said in a statement to the BBC, while noting that the waters of the Loch Ness could be extremely dangerous. “Our Atlantic 85 lifeboat has an impressive survivor-carrying capacity, but even that will be stretched by the ‘attendees’ of this event.” In a now-deleted Facebook event, users were invited to “storm the woodchip pile,” which is exactly what it sounds like: a gigantic pile of woodchips in the Port of Burnie, Tasmania. Australia’s The Advocate reports that the event, which had over 550 interested people, was created by Hellyer College student Alex Harman. “There’s not many places in Australia where there’s just a really big pile of woodchips where if you try to gain access to it you get a $5,000 fine or three years incarceration,” Harman told The Advocate. A spokesperson for TasPorts confirmed that attempting to storm the woodchips would result in a maximum penalty of $5,000 under Commonwealth law.",The Internet Is Also Keen on Storming These Other Places After the Rise of the 'Area 51 Raid',"July 17, 2019"
635,Jamie Ducharme,"The second-worst Ebola outbreak in history has killed more than 1,500 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since it began last August. And on Wednesday, nearly a year after the outbreak began, and in the midst of renewed concerns over its spread, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public-health emergency of international concern. The decision is meant to spur a stronger response from the international community in hopes of ending the outbreak, which has proved difficult to contain due to a humanitarian crisis DRC, attacks on health care workers and rampant misinformation within the country. Concerns of further spread were reignited last month when infected individuals died in neighboring Uganda after traveling from the DRC. The disease’s presence was also recently confirmed in the DRC city of Goma, which is considered a transport hub and is near the Rwandan border. “Now is the time for the international community to stand in solidarity with the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference Wednesday. “I stress this: The government of DRC is doing everything it can. They need the support of the international community.” The declaration came at the recommendation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee, which cited possible increased national and regional risks associated with the outbreak. At three prior meetings on the topic, the WHO declined to declare the outbreak an international public-health emergency. While Ghebreyesus said Wednesday that he hopes countries continue to contribute funding to the response, the emergency declaration is meant as a call for strengthened and streamlined international effort to slow the outbreak, which has thus far infected more than 2,400 people. The IHR recommends that affected countries improve their preparedness for detecting and treating cases of Ebola, enhance screening and public education in key areas, minimize security threats and embrace the use of preventive tools such as vaccines. The IHR does not, however, recommend that countries restrict travel or trade to the DRC, as “such measures are usually implemented out of fear and have no basis in science.” It also said screening at airports and other ports of entry outside the region is unnecessary. Thus far, U.S. involvement in the Ebola outbreak has been fairly minimal, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in June that it would activate an Emergency Operations Center in the DRC to help support outbreak response. The World Bank in May also pledged to release an additional $10 million, making a total of $20 million, from its Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility to help with response, in addition to $80 million from its International Development Association. Countries, including the U.K., have also recently promised financial contributions. Ghebreyesus stressed that public-health funding must address not only existing outbreaks, but also the prevention of future ones.",WHO Declares Ebola in Congo a Public-Health Emergency Nearly a Year After Outbreak,"July 17, 2019"
636,Raisa Bruner,"People organize events on Facebook all the time. But rarely do 1.5 million RSVP to attend. Yet that’s what happened when three pseudonymous users created an event to “storm Area 51,” the secretive military base in southern Nevada that has long been associated in the pop culture imagination with extraterrestrial activity. Now, the Area 51 raid has become a meme, inspired stars like Lil Nas X to jump on the bandwagon and galvanized the Air Force itself to share a response. The instigator of it all, a college student named Matty Roberts, has even recently suggested they might turn the event into a music festival. Here’s how the Area 51 meme all happened and the latest developments. Back on June 27, the public event “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us” appeared on Facebook. It’s hosted by three users: one a meme account, one a “gaming video creator” and one an event planning account. As of July 22, 1.9 million people RSVPed to “attend,” with another 1.4 million responding as “interested.” The plan is simple: on Sept. 20 at 3:00 a.m., the group will arrive. “We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,” the event explains. “If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets see them aliens [sic].” (“Naruto” running is a style of running popularized by the Japanese anime character of the same name, in which the arms are held behind the body while in motion.) Since then, a conversation of tens of thousands of comments has developed, with more intricate maps and planning. The most popular comment with a plan of attack, however, has an important disclaimer: “P.S. Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan,” the commenter wrote. “I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet.” It’s gotten 112,000 likes, so that was a success. Inevitably, the plan became a meme with a (extraterrestrial) life of its own over the following few weeks. The internet began sharing animations and illustrations of all kinds of scenes with added aliens — or plans on how to care for and live with said aliens. These memes picked up speed in the second week of July. Thanks to the widespread popularity of the plan, the Air Force itself went so far as to clarify that any prospective attendees should definitely stay away. “Any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous,” a spokesperson shared in a statement to various news outlets on July 16, noting that Area 51 — also called the Nellis Test and Training Range — is technically just “an area where the Air Force tests and trains combat aircraft.” Most people seem in on the farcical nature of the joke. But at least two small hotels in the area are booked solid for Sept. 20: one alien-themed establishment and the Alamo Inn on Highway 93, as TIME confirmed. At the same time, there’s still plenty of availability in local AirBnBs and other lodgings, like Timbers Lodging, which has been expecting more reservations because of the event but hasn’t yet noticed any difference. On Wednesday, the hotels nearest the Area 51 Alien Center, the official starting point identified on the Facebook event, all told TIME that it’s business as usual for their reservations in September. That said, local officials are preparing for an uptick — because even if a tiny fraction of the event’s attendees actually do show up, it’s still much more than the rural area is used to, as local news is reporting.",How the Area 51 Raid Meme Became the Biggest Joke in the Galaxy,"Updated: July 22, 2019 12:53 PM ET | Originally published: July 17, 2019"
638,Katharine Wilkinson,"Eunice Newton Foote rarely gets the credit she’s due. The American scientist, who was born exactly 200 years ago on Wednesday, was the first woman in climate science. It was back in 1856 that Foote theorized that changes in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could affect the Earth’s temperature. She broke scientific ground that remains more relevant than ever in 2019, but history overlooked her until just a few years ago. Foote arrived at her breakthrough idea through experimentation. With an air pump, two glass cylinders, and four thermometers, she tested the impact of “carbonic acid gas” (the term for carbon dioxide in her day) against “common air.” When placed in the sun, she found that the cylinder with carbon dioxide trapped more heat and stayed hot longer. From a simple experiment, she drew a profound conclusion: “An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature; and if as some suppose, at one period of its history the air had mixed with it a larger proportion than at present, an increased temperature…must have necessarily resulted.” In other words, she connected the dots between carbon dioxide and global warming. Foote’s paper, “Circumstances Affecting the Heat of Sun’s Rays,” was presented in August 1856 at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and then published. (For unknown reasons, likely rules or social norms, it was read by a man from The Smithsonian, rather than Foote herself.) That was three years before Irish physicist John Tyndall published his own, more detailed work on heat-trapping gases — work typically credited as the foundation of climate science. Did Tyndall know about Foote’s paper? It’s unclear — though he did have a paper on color blindness in the same 1856 journal as hers. In any case, I have to wonder if Eunice Newton Foote ever found herself remarking, as so many women have: “I literally just said that, dude.” I also find myself wondering: What might Foote have achieved if she had Tyndall’s access to training and resources? We can only imagine. Perhaps we can understand, if not abide, that Foote was hobbled by the conventions and limitations of her day. Perhaps we can also amend that loss by supporting women in climate today. Look around the world, and you will see women and girls making enormous contributions in this space. Conducting research and advancing climate science, to be sure, but also cultivating solutions, creating campaign strategy, curating art exhibits, crafting policy, composing literary work, charging forth in collective action, and more. Look around, and you will see truly catalytic leadership grounded in courage, creativity, compassion, and collaboration. As someone who has worked in climate for two decades, it’s easy for despair to creep in. This groundswell of leadership gives me courage. To my mind, this is where possibility lives — possibility that we can turn away from the brink and move towards a life-giving future for all. Yet, girls and women leading on climate receive insufficient backing and, even now, too little credit. That’s especially true for women of the Global South, rural women, and women of color. Worse than unfair, it’s ineffective for creating change.

640,Ciara Nugent,"It takes about three and a half minutes to complete what’s perhaps the world’s most controversial race. Each year in the second week of July, six bulls are released every day at 8 a.m. into the narrow streets of Pamplona, a city in Spain’s northern region of Navarre. Several hundred people set off after them, scrambling chaotically for half a mile as crowds watch from balconies and street corners – and millions more on television. The bravest — or the stupidest — try to get out in front for the thrill of grabbing a bull by its horns. (Though this is explicitly forbidden and carries a heavy fine.) The track ends at the city’s bullring, where bullfighters face off with the animals and later slaughter them. The festival has been condemned, by Spaniards and foreigners alike, for its cruelty to animals, its atmosphere of toxic masculinity, and seemingly pointless risk to the participants. Such criticisms were renewed after eight runners, including two Americans, were non-fatally gored by bulls during this year’s eight races ending July 14. One was wounded in the neck and “miraculously” avoided damage to major arteries. But supporters say the running of the bulls is a centuries-old tradition and vital to regional culture. Here’s the history of Pamplona’s bull run – and a look at its contested future. Bull runs evolved from medieval farmers herding their animals through town to show them off at the bullring. It’s unclear exactly when revelers got involved, but the runs in Pamplona became a cultural touchstone some time after 1591, when townspeople moved the annual celebration of their patron saint, San Fermin, from the fall to summer—taking advantage of the weather and coinciding with a big trade fair. Ernest Hemingway brought Pamplona’s bull runs to international audiences, celebrating their drama in his 1927 novel The Sun Also Rises. Today, the week-long festival swells the town’s 200,000 population five-fold and powers its economy, with visitors spending an average of $110 per day. The festival is not universally loved. Animal rights groups have been a fixture for decades; this year, PETA and local activists lay outside the townhall, semi-naked on top of chalk outlines of fallen bulls to protest the “cruel spectacle”.",Pamplona's Bull Runs Have a Controversial Past.

641,Melissa Chan,"Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the notorious drug lord who twice escaped from Mexican prisons, will spend the rest of his life behind bars in the United States. Guzman, 62, was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison plus 30 years without the possibility of parole—the mandatory sentence after he was found guilty in February of all charges stemming from his role in trafficking billions of dollars worth of drugs into the U.S. as a top boss within the Sinaloa cartel. Guzman was also ordered to pay $12.6 billion, forfeiting what the government said were ill-gotten gains. At the sentencing hearing, the drug lord told judge Brian Cogan that he was not given a fair trial “when the whole world was watching,” according to the Associated Press. “When I was extradited to the United States, I expected to have a fair trial, but what happened was exactly the opposite,” he said. He also said that his case was “stained” by juror misconduct and said he was not pleased with the conditions of his imprisonment in New York. During Guzman’s three-month trial in federal court in Brooklyn, stunning testimonies from more than 55 witnesses painted Guzman as a philanderer and revealed widespread government corruption in Mexico. The drama continued even after the trial ended when a Vice News report emerged, alleging that multiple jurors had violated a judge’s orders and then lied about it. It prompted Guzman’s defense lawyers to seek a retrial, but the judge denied the motion on July 3, saying there were no grounds for a new trial. The judge also declined to summon all 12 members of the jury back into the courthouse for a hearing to determine whether the claims in the news report were true and whether the verdict was tainted. Guzman is perhaps most famous for breaking out of two high-security Mexican prisons. In 2001, he first escaped from the Puente Grande prison by hiding in a laundry cart. He was recaptured in 2014 in Mazatlán, Mexico—only to break free from the Altiplano prison, using a sophisticated mile-long tunnel in 2015. Guzman was re-arrested the next year. In 2017, he was extradited to stand trial in the U.S., where prosecutors said he flooded the streets with hundreds of tons of cocaine.","El Chapo, the Notorious Drug Kingpin, Has Been Sentenced to Life in Prison in the U.S.","July 17, 2019"
642,Julia Webster,"More than 60 members of the UK Labour party have taken out a newspaper advert accusing their leader Jeremy Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism. The full page advert, published in the Guardian newspaper on Wednesday, was signed by 67 members of the House of Lords. Addressing Corbyn directly, the advert states he has “failed the test of leadership” over his handling of anti-Semitism. The 67 signatories make up about a third of the members in the House of Lords, and most of them are long standing critics of Corbyn. “The Labour Party welcomes everyone* irrespective of race, creed, age, gender identity, or sexual orientation. (*except, it seems, Jews). This is your legacy Mr Corbyn,” it states. “We are not asking if you are an antisemite. We are saying you are accountable as leader for allowing antisemitism to grow in our party and presiding over the most shaming period in Labour’s history.” “You have failed to defend out party’s anti-racist values. You have therefore failed the test of leadership.” The internal Labour row over anti-Semitism has been going on for almost three years. In February, nine lawmakers quit Labour citing anti-Semitism as part of the reason. Lawmaker Luciana Berger, who left to form The Independent Group, said Labour had become institutionally anti-Semitic and that she had become “embarrassed and ashamed” to stay. The advert appeared a week after former staff members accused Labour of failing to tackle complaints about antisemitism in a BBC documentary, which party leaders have asked to be taken down.

645,Amy Gunia,"A new report which maps out how North Korea obtains luxury goods says that the country obtains the items through sophisticated networks, despite sanctions against the country. The report by Washington D.C.-based non-profit research organization the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS) says that as many as 90 countries serve as a source of luxury goods to Kim Jong Un’s regime, despite a U.N. resolution prohibiting the export of such items to the country. Authors of Lux & Loaded: Exposing North Korea’s Strategic Procurement Networks used publicly available information such as registry filings, trade records, vessel tracking data and customs information to follow the movement of luxury goods into the country. “The Kim regime continues to maintain sophisticated procurement capabilities through U.S.-allied countries despite sanctions,” the report says. North Korea’s leader uses perks like gifts of western luxury goods to keep officials loyal to him, and he is frequently spotted in luxury cars. He raised eyebrows when he arrived to meet Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for a meeting in Pyongyang in a Rolls-Royce Phantom, a car for which the starting retail price is around $450,000. His wife was criticized for sporting a Christian Dior handbag retailing for $1,600 while millions of people starved in her country.

Myanmar’s military began a violent crackdown in late 2017 against the Rohingya, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority, in Myanmar’s westernmost Rakhine State.

So far, over 1,600 people have died from the virus and thousands more have been infected. While this outbreak is not yet at the scale of the last Ebola crisis that claimed more than 11,000 lives, it has the potential to be even deadlier.  With each passing day, the virus keeps spreading. This week, the first case of Ebola was discovered in Goma, a transportation hub on the border of Rwanda. In order to keep pace with the virus, the United States and the international community must start treating this outbreak like the crisis it is.  In 2014, I sat on the National Security Council and helped lead the United States’ Ebola response. At the time, I thought the Ebola outbreak was the most terrifying public health emergency that I would ever witness in my lifetime. It turns out that I was wrong.  The challenges of this outbreak are unprecedented: poor infrastructure, distrust in health workers and lack of access to basic medical care. A big enough barrier on their own, together they make containing this outbreak in the DRC harder and more complex than the last outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. This instability did not come about overnight. The DRC is rich in resources but has been historically plagued by poor governance and violent conflict. For decades, DRC has failed to make adequate investments in basic healthcare and health infrastructure, the first line of defense against disease outbreaks like Ebola. In 2016, the total annual government spending on health care in DRC was just $3 per person.  Years of interethnic violence has created an atmosphere in the DRC where mistrust of authority is rife. In a recent survey, 25 percent of Congolese respondents said that Ebola wasn’t even real. This lack of trust, along with the ongoing turbulence, has led to attacks against health care workers and clinics which has endangered the entire emergency response.

648,Billy Perrigo,"As the final live debate of the Conservative leadership contest came to an end on Monday evening, the two men competing to be Britain’s next Prime Minister turned to one another, smiled, and bantered out of range of the room’s microphones. Officially rivals, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both seemed to recognize that the race to be the U.K.’s next Prime Minister had already been decided, even though the winner would not be announced until July 23. Johnson was the clear favorite among the Conservative Party members who will decide the contest when the starting gun was fired last month, and remains ahead coming out of the race. By the end of Monday evening, the pair were joking with the audience, and one another. “I don’t think [the debate] changed very much from what we already knew,” Johnson told TIME moments after the event. But while the leadership contest appears to be a foregone conclusion, its final weeks have been bruising for Johnson. Newspapers scrutinizing his past as a journalist and author have unearthed examples of past Islamophobic comments. They haven’t had to look far; in 2018, he likened Muslim women who wear the full-face veil to “bank robbers” and “letterboxes,” comments that prompted the Muslim Council of Britain to accuse him of pandering to the far-right. On Monday, the Guardian published excerpts from a 2006 book in which he had written that Islam “inherently inhibits the path to progress and freedom.” And when, on Monday evening, Johnson was quizzed over a column in which he referred to gay men as “tank-topped bumboys,” he dismissed concerns over his past remarks. “If you’re going to excavate and disinter every single quotation from the millions of words I have written, you can of course try to twist things one way or the other,” he said. That explanation might placate the roughly 124,000 Conservative Party members who have a vote in the ongoing leadership contest, but the wider public are yet to be convinced he is the right man for this job. In a May poll by YouGov, just 28% of U.K. adults surveyed said he would make a good Prime Minister, compared to 54% who said he would do badly. That should be a cause for concern even if he does become leader. His ruling Conservative party has a parliamentary majority of just three votes, which could shrink even further if lawmakers abandon ship over his approach to Brexit. If that ends up forcing a general election later this year, Johnson would have to convince the entire electorate to put their trust in him as a leader. So far, the contest to be Britain’s next Prime Minister has been fought on what appeals to Conservative party members, rather than the public as a whole. When Johnson eventually does go to the country, his past comments may come back to haunt him once again.","On the Cusp of Power, Boris Johnson's Inflammatory Language on Islam Returns to Haunt Him","July 16, 2019"
649,Gina Martinez,"Greek police have arrested a suspect in the murder of an American molecular biologist, who they say was run down by a local man during her daily walk, put in the trunk of his car, raped and abandoned in a nearby tunnel. The national police held a press conference on Tuesday afternoon where they confirmed the arrest of a local 27-year-old man and said they have “solved” the case of the death of 59-year-old Suzanne Eaton. They did not release the name of the suspect. Eaton, a molecular biologist working as a research leader at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden, German, was visiting the Greek island of Crete to attend a conference at the Orthodox Academy of Crete when she went missing in early July. After a nearly week-long search by authorities and family, Eaton’s body was discovered 7 miles from her hotel in a man-made cave that was reportedly dug by Nazi troops occupying Crete during World War II. Hellenic Police spokeswoman Eleni Papathanasiou described Eaton’s final moments. According to Papathanasiou, at around noon on July 2, Eaton went for her daily walk, leaving behind her cellphone and other personal items in her hotel room. She said autopsy results found that she died shortly after noon and the official cause of death was suffocation––adding that Eaton’s body also had “many broken ribs, face, bones, and multiple injuries at both hands.” Police said the suspect confessed to seeing Eaton walk toward a local memorial and “motivated by sexual satisfaction, he hit her twice with his car to stop her.” The suspect told police he then took the unconscious Eaton and put her in the trunk of his car and moved her to the ventilation drain of a cave, where he raped and abandoned her.",Greek Police Have Arrested a Suspect in the Killing of an American Researcher on Crete,"July 16, 2019"
650,Ciara Nugent,"Boris Johnson, the U.K. lawmaker expected to become the country’s prime minister, once argued that the practice of Islam had historically put the Muslim world “literally centuries behind” western countries, an article unearthed by a British newspaper reveals. “There must be something about Islam that indeed helps to explain why there was no rise of the bourgeoisie, no liberal capitalism and therefore no spread of democracy in the Muslim world,” Johnson wrote in an essay included in a 2007 version of his historical book The Dream of Rome, The Guardian reports. Johnson suggested that the religion had played a role in inhibiting the Islamic world’s technological and cultural progress. “It is extraordinary to think that under the Roman/Byzantine empire, the city of Constantinople kept the candle of learning alight for a thousand years, and that under Ottoman rule, the first printing press was not seen in Istanbul until the middle of the nineteenth century,” Johnson wrote. “Something caused them to be literally centuries behind.” The lawmaker also claimed that “Muslim art” had never produced anything comparable to Michelangelo’s 16th Century masterpiece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, in part “because it is beyond the technical accomplishment of Islamic art.” Johnson, who championed the successful 2016 campaign for the U.K. to leave the E.U., is the strong favorite to win his Conservative party’s leadership race, ending July 23 – meaning he will likely replace Theresa May as prime minister. He has previously come under fire for inflammatory statements about the Muslim community, including his claim in a 2018 column for rightwing newspaper The Telegraph that women who wear burqas – the full-face veil – look like “letterboxes” and “bank robbers.” In the 2007 essay, titled “And Then Came the Muslims,” Johnson quoted Winston Churchill’s statement that there was “no stronger retrograde force” in the world than Islam, according to The Guardian. “It is time to get deep down and dirty and examine the central charge made by everyone from Winston Churchill to the Pope, namely that the real problem with the Islamic world is Islam,” he wrote. “We must be honest and accept that there is more than a grain of truth in Churchill’s analysis of the economic and social consequences of the religion.” The politician added that he hopes he will not be accused of Islamophobia, because his great-grandfather, Turkish journalist and politician Ali Kemal, had been a Muslim.",U.K.'s Boris Johnson Once Claimed Islam Had Put the Muslim World 'Centuries Behind' the West,"July 16, 2019"

McFarland, who according to the Justice Department, co-founded Red Granite Pictures with Riza Aziz, the stepson of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, said he didn’t know that the gifts may have been purchased with funds diverted from 1MDB. Red Granite last year paid $60 million to settle claims it financed the 2013 film “Wolf of Wall Street”, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, with stolen Malaysian money. According the U.S. forfeiture complaint, Aziz spent at least $5.4 million on collectible movie posters and the walls of his condominium in New York were covered with them. He also gave a number of them to McFarland, DiCaprio and Scorcese, according to the Justice Department.

At least three million people have been displaced in north and Northeast India, reports the BBC, including almost two million people in the northern Indian state of Bihar, and more than 1.7 million people in northeastern Assam state, a region known for its tea production. “Many people have taken shelter on the highways, that will be the state for the next two to three weeks until the water recedes,” Mohamad Farukh, CEO of the disaster relief NGO Rapid Response told TIME about the situation in Assam State. “Bihar has better housing infrastructure, they will continue to stay in their houses or schools will operate as temporary relief shelters.” Flooding also hit Kaziranga National Park. “A lot of animals have died, mostly rhinos,” Farukh said. He says that he expects the situation to “deteriorate over the next two to three days” in India as water flows to the region from Nepal and Bhutan. The BBC reports that the Brahmaputra River, which flows down from the Himalayas into Bangladesh, overflowed its banks on Monday and flooded 1,800 villages in Assam state. Flooding has also hit southern Nepal, where police said 67 people have died and 30 people are missing, according to the BBC. Dibya Poudel, Communications Director of Nepal Red Cross, told TIME he believes at least 300,000 people are affected, but initial damage assessments are still being done. People are “residing in temples and schools” he said. He noted that landslides are also a problem. Storms have also killed at least 29 people in Bangladesh in the last week, including 18 hit by lightning, reports the BBC. Cox’s Bazar, a lowland coastal district where about a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar have been stuck after fleeing violence, has not been spared. It is the “most severe weather since the massive Rohingya refugee influx of 2017,” according to a statement on the International Organization for Migration’s website.

National police spokesman Theodoros Chronopoulos confirmed to TIME that, as of Monday afternoon, investigators were in the process of interrogating a 27-year-old man from the village of Maleme, which is near where Eaton’s body was discovered on July 9. Chronopoulos says that the man has not confessed to killing Eaton, but that “it’s only a matter of time; we are close to solving this case.” He also clarified that despite reports, police have not yet made an arrest, but he expects that the suspect will be officially charged “sometime tomorrow, we hope.” Eaton, a molecular biologist working as a research leader at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden, German, was visiting Crete to attend a conference at the Orthodox Academy of Crete when she went missing.

656,Iain Marlow and Dandan Li / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Former U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice sparred with a senior Chinese diplomat on Twitter in an unusual and heated dispute over race in Washington. In a series of Tweets apparently aimed at making a broader point about diplomatic divisions over the mass detention of Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province, Lijian Zhao, a diplomat posted in Islamabad, said on Sunday that if “you’re in Washington, D.C., you know the white never go” to the southeastern part of the U.S. capital. “You are a racist disgrace. And shockingly ignorant too,” Rice told Zhao on Twitter. Likely assuming that Zhao was posted in China’s mission in Washington, she then addressed her next comment to China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai. “Ambassador Cui, I expect better of you and your team. Please do the right thing and send him home.” Zhao, who is deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Pakistan’s capital, is often vocal on Twitter against critics of China’s infrastructure-building projects in Pakistan and other parts of Asia. Beijing has invested tens of billions of dollars in Pakistan, whose leader Imran Khan has previously dodged questions about the issue. “You are such a disgrace, too. And shockingly ignorant, too. I am based in Islamabad. Truth hurts. I am simply telling the truth,” Zhao fired back at Rice on Monday. “To label someone who speak the truth that you don’t want to hear a racist, is disgraceful & disgusting.” Zhao didn’t immediately respond to phone calls, an email and a direct message on Twitter seeking comment. In a string of messages that appeared aimed at highlighting U.S. hypocrisy on human rights, Zhao referred to everything from income inequality and school shootings in the U.S. to immigration officers separating children from parents. He tweeted a list of mostly-Western nations that condemned China for its actions in Xinjiang as well as a separate list of other countries — including Pakistan, Cuba, Tajikistan and Nigeria — that wrote a joint letter to the United Nations supporting Beijing, which Zhao called “a big slap on the face of U.S. & its western cohorts.”",'You Are a Racist Disgrace.'

657,Amy Gunia,"Chinese authorities detained another Canadian citizen last week in the eastern city of Yantai, further raising diplomatic tensions between the two nations. Canada’s foreign ministry confirmed that the unnamed person is receiving consular services, according to the New York Times. Relations between the countries have been strained since two Canadians were detained in China in December. Their arrest was believed to be a retaliatory move for the arrest of Huawei’s CFO, Meng Wangzhou, in Vancouver at the request of U.S. authorities over alleged Iran sanctions violations. The Canadians, ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, have been charged with espionage. The latest arrest happened around the same time that China detained several foreign students and teachers on drug-related charges in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou. At least four are Britons, according to the Times. It is unclear if last week’s detention is related to the drug case, or was meant to put pressure on Canada. In addition to arresting Canadian citizens, China has also responded with economic pressure. Imports of Canadian beef and canola oil were halted after Meng’s arrest, according to the Times. Canada is not the only nation whose citizens are being targeted by Beijing’s detainee diplomacy. Last month, a Chinese-American executive at Koch Industries was held and questioned for several days. The State Department has issued a warning about China’s “exit bans” against dual-national citizens.

658,Aria Chen / Hong Kong,"With its stylish music videos, slick choreography and versatile melodies, K-pop has amassed a growing number of fans worldwide. Drawing increasing global attention is the country’s hip-hop scene, of which rap group Epik High has been a mainstay for nearly two decades. Opinions vary as to whether the trio of Tablo, DJ and producer Tukutz and rapper Mithra Jin falls under the umbrella of K-pop, but they don’t seem to care much about what people call them. “There are debates online as to whether Epik High is K-pop or not, and we’ve seen certain arguments where fans get really heated up about it,” said Tablo, Epik High’s leader. “We don’t mind what we’re classified as.” The group was formed in 2001, and released their debut album “Map of the Human Soul” in 2003. Their music is known for its lyrical complexity, often containing delicate introspective messages or sharp commentary on social issues. They also don’t shy away from incorporating different genres such as soul and R&B, carving out a distinct niche in the competitive Korean music industry. This March, the band released Sleepless in __________, their first independently-produced EP after leaving YG Entertainment, home to popular K-pop acts including BLACKPINK. With tracks like “Lovedrunk,” featuring hip-hop and R&B singer Crush and Eternal Sunshine, co-produced with BTS’ Suga, the album generated buzz and peaked at No. 6 on Billboard’s World Album chart. After wrapping up parts of their world tour in Europe and North America, Epik High sat down with TIME in Hong Kong. Tablo: We played many more cities, and the venues were bigger. There were cities that we’ve never been to. For example, we went to Raleigh. I don’t think there are many K-pop artists or Korean artists that perform there. So it was just great, being there, seeing different cities, trying different food, meeting new people. And also we did the entire tour by bus and this is something we’ve never done before. We’ve always seen these crazy amazing bands in documentaries do that so it felt like we were like a rock band. It was tough but fun. Tablo: We don’t feel the pressure to keep up with trends or constantly put stuff out to prove ourselves or to stay relevant. I think one of the benefits of being this deep and this far into a career is that you’re no longer in a position where people are rushing you to put stuff out. There’s plenty of music that’s out every day that will keep people occupied. It’s not like it’s essential for Epik High to release a new song every month. Because that pressure is not there, it allows us to sit down and really think about the things that we want to say. Tablo: Honestly I think it’s not just Korean music or K-pop. There’s a lot of Spanish-language music that is exceptionally popular, even in Korea. I think people are no longer building walls because of languages. [In the past], every time we went to do a show in the States one of the questions we would get is “how do you overcome the language barrier?” But in the last five, six years, we don’t get that question any more.

659,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: Mexico’s finance minister Carlos Urzua abruptly quit his post last week, just seven months into the job. The Mexican peso tumbled more than 2 percent in the aftermath of the announcement before rebounding somewhat, but the resignation points to a deeper problem plaguing the Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) administration. And no, it’s not Donald Trump. Why It Matters: While leftist firebrand AMLO remains popular with the Mexican electorate, international markets and the Mexican business community are decidedly less enamored with the populist politician. That’s why the well-credentialed and widely-respected Urzua (who was AMLO’s finance secretary while he served as Mexico City mayor) was appointed as finance minister in the first place—and why his departure is causing such a stir. In a blistering resignation letter, Urzua called out the appointment of unqualified government officials and extremist economic policies that weren’t “based on evidence” as reasons for his departure. Truth be told, AMLO wasn’t elected for his fine grasp of economic policy. Rather, his rise to the Mexican presidency was fueled by the broad perception that corruption in Mexico—both in the public and private spheres—had spiraled out of control in recent years, something which even the Mexican business community readily admits. AMLO ran on a fierce anti-corruption campaign, and even his most ardent critics acknowledge that he isn’t on the take. Moreover, more than any other populist world leader elected to office, AMLO is genuinely committed to addressing the underlying grievances of Mexico’s population—he has ambitious plans to improve education and job training, to increase salaries, to improve roads and bridges to better connect marginalized communities, and to improve Mexico’s rapidly deteriorating security situation. The problem is that all these plans cost real money, and AMLO has neither the experience nor talent to run a modern-day economy. To his credit, AMLO seems genuinely committed to fiscal discipline and general macro stability in the country. But his unorthodox approach to business and economic decisions—like scrapping a new Mexico City airport construction already underway, or refusing to let state oil giant Pemex shore up its woeful finances through privatizations—is straining the country’s economic growth (the Mexican economy contracted 0.2 percent in the first quarter of the year; in January, Pemex’s oil output fell to its lowest level in 40 years), and with it the government finances needed to fund those ambitious social programs he campaigned on. AMLO believes he can find the money to fund his programs through slashing government budgets, but his government austerity push and cuts to salaries and benefits are weakening institutional capacity, forcing out plenty and demoralizing the public workers left behind. He’s also promised not to raise taxes for the first three years of his administration, further limiting his government’s ability to raise any additional revenue. Which gets us to the heart of the matter. In typical administrations, a president relies on advisors to help craft policy in fields they have limited experience in—for example, new Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro is similarly ill-equipped to handle economic policy, but has a strong network of economic advisors he regularly defers to. But AMLO has centralized all political decision-making in his own hands, both as a way of limiting corruption in the broader Mexican government and as a way of ensuring his populist political agenda is adhered to. This has already caused friction with a number of his cabinet officials, culminating in the decision of Urzua to resign rather than continue to implement “extreme” measures he believes will negatively impact the Mexican economy.

660,Brian Bennett,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sat down with TIME correspondents Brian Bennett and Joseph Hincks at his residence in Jerusalem on June 25. The following excerpts from the conversation have been condensed and edited for clarity. TIME: You are on track to surpass Ben-Gurion as the — as Israel’s longest-serving Prime Minister. How does Netanyahu’s Israel look different from Ben-Gurion’s Israel? NETANYAHU: Well, it has some of the same elements and foundations. First of all, Ben-Gurion established the renewed sovereignty of the Jewish people in our ancestral homeland. That’s an historic achievement. He also laid the foundations for the Israeli Army to guarantee that that reality persists. The way I’ve tried to contribute to the country — and I think it’s changed dramatically — is in the development of Israel as a global technological power. The rise of Israel among the community of nations is the rise of Israeli innovation and technology, both in the civilian field and the military and intelligence field. Israel has now become an important power in the world in these two leading respects. TIME: What are the factors that contributed to that shift for Israel? NETANYAHU: The most important one, and one that I’ve fought for and worked hard for, is to open up Israel’s economy, open it up to competition, open it up to the free movement of ideas and goods and people, open it up to success, and open it up to failure. Turning Israel into a free market economy I think was the second critical factor that made Israel the power, the rising power that it is among the countries. The first was the high intensity use of our most gifted men and women in our military for intelligence purposes. TIME: What can be done to help the millions of people who live in the Occupied Territories who haven’t benefited economically or personally from that rise? NETANYAHU: Well, I’d separate Gaza from the West Bank, from Judea Samaria, because there the Palestinian economy is on a much better footing, probably double the per capita income that they have in Gaza. Gaza is basically controlled by Hamas, which is a militant Islamic organization that really doesn’t allow any kind of real development to take place because they take all the money that comes in from international support — and there’s quite a bit of it — and they put it into turning tunnels into a terror machine. Because militarily, we’re in charge of the West Bank, we control the territory militarily. There’s no siphoning off of money for that purpose. And in fact, it’s doing better. I like to see more and more and more investments go to — in the private sector — go to the Palestinian areas for joint Israeli Palestinian efforts. Some of that is taking place any way. And I think what Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt has embarked in Bahrain could be tremendously beneficial to the Palestinians.

661,Julia Webster,"The Trump Administration is threatening the extend its trade war to France as the country prepares to hit big tech companies––many of them American––with a new tax. A 3% levy on tech giants was approved by the French Senate on Thursday, despite it upsetting the U.S., which has announced it has launched an inquiry into the law. “The United States is very concerned that the digital services tax which is expected to pass the French Senate tomorrow unfairly targets American companies,” said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in a statement. “The President has directed that we investigate the effects of this legislation and determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.” Any digital company with revenue over €750 million (about $850 million)––of which €25 million is generated in France––will be subjected to the 3% levy, which will be based on total revenue generated in the country, rather than profits.  France is the first country in Europe to introduce this kind of tax. It would hit about 30 companies, including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. It will also apply to companies from China, Germany, Spain and the U.K. and one French company. Global tech companies have been accused of avoiding tax by shifting profits to countries with very low taxes, where they have headquarters, rather than where they make their sales. “We must act against the perverse effects of a regulatory and fiscal framework that allow digital giants to grow without any limits and without any control,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said when he introduced the bill earlier this year.",Trump Administration Threatens to Extend Trade War to France Over 3% Tax on Big Tech Companies,"July 11, 2019"
662,Dan Stewart,"British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says Saudi Arabia has paid the diplomatic price for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. In a keynote speech at the Global Conference for Media Freedom in London on Wednesday, Hunt said governments acting together can “impose a diplomatic price” on states who kill or imprison journalists. Asked on the sidelines if he thought Saudi Arabia had paid a big enough price for its actions, he told TIME “I think they have. I think they have paid a big reputational price and there have been profound diplomatic consequences.” Hunt, who is currently in a Conservative Party leadership contest to become the next U.K. prime minister, added that Saudi Arabia had more work to do to be fully welcomed back on the world stage, however. “In the end, if things are going to get back to how they were before, there has to be proper accountability for what happened and the world needs to know two things,” he said. “That there has been justice not just for the people who committed that terrible crime but for the person who ordered it, and also that this kind of thing will never happen again.” Khashoggi, a self-exiled critic of the Saudi regime, was murdered in gruesome circumstances in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. In the immediate aftermath, the U.K. revoked the visas of suspects and boycotted a Saudi investment conference. The U.S. was one of several countries to place sanctions on Saudi citizens suspected of involvement in the killings. But nine months later, the Trump Administration is still defying the U.S. Congress and pushing through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the U.K. government is challenging a court-ordered ban on its own arms sales. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom the CIA accuses of ordering the Khashoggi killing, was reportedly greeted warmly by President Donald Trump at the recent G20 meeting in Japan. And next year, Saudi Arabia has been granted the right to host the economic summit. Some believe the Saudis have been let off the hook. Amal Clooney, Hunt’s special envoy for media freedom, said during a session at the conference on Wednesday that world leaders responded to Khashoggi’s killing “with little more than a collective shrug.” Agnes Callamard, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, wrote recently that “there has been little effective international response—legal, political or diplomatic.” She called for G20 member states to boycott the November 2020 meeting in Riyadh. Thomas Friang, head of advocacy at Reporters Without Borders, told TIME the G20 membership proved the Saudis “have not paid a price diplomatically.” The global press freedom organization announced this week that members had travelled to Saudi Arabia earlier in the year to urge the release of 30 journalists still in jail. “That’s the minimum price they should pay to be regarded a normal chair of the G20,” said Friang, also on the sidelines of the conference.",U.K. Foreign Secretary Says Saudi Arabia Has Paid the Price for Khashoggi Killing,"July 11, 2019"
663,Joseph Hincks/Jerusalem,"A key question hanging over Benjamin Netanyahu’s re-election campaign is whether he will fulfil an apparent pledge to annex part of the occupied West Bank. But in TIME’s interview with the Israeli Prime Minister, he would not be drawn on the controversial policy — saying only that it might be possible “in the framework of an agreement with the United States.” Asked directly if he would annex current settlements, Netanyahu said: “It’s something I would like to do in the framework of an agreement with the United States. And it certainly does not do away with the prospect of a political agreement.” Netanyahu had earlier said he would extend Israeli “sovereignty” over parts of the West Bank, a statement widely interpreted as a pledge to annex a portion of the Palestinian territory Israel has controlled for 52 years. Such a move would fulfill the wishes of many in Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party and other hardliners who view the swath of land that extends to the Jordan River as part of biblical Israel. But in his interview with TIME on June 25 Netanyahu attempted to remain ambiguous. “I didn’t actually use the word [annexation], I think,” he said. “I’m not sure if I used that word or the application of Israeli law. There’s a subtle difference between them.” Pressed on whether he intends to legally annex, he said, “we’ll get to that point and I’ll make it clear when we get to that point.”  Almost 3 million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank, whose Ramallah-based leadership has forsworn violence and whose security apparatus cooperates with Israel’s. A further 2-million Palestinians live in Gaza, controlled by the militant group Hamas. Israel and Egypt have enforced an effective 12-year blockade over the strip since Hamas took over in 2007 and the rockets Hamas’ fires at Israel are often intercepted by the U.S.-funded defense system known as the Iron Dome.  But some Israeli security experts say Netanyahu has strategically sustained the militant group while simultaneously de-legitimizing the Palestinian Authority in order to avoid making compromises that would harm him domestically. Flirting with legal annexation, they claim, is another high risk bid for political survival at a time when it is most at risk. Former Mossad director Danny Yatom says Netanyahu can point to the instability and violence on the Gaza strip and say “this is the way Palestinians are behaving once they are independent. Do you want us to see the same phenomenon in the West Bank?” Netanyahu “does not want to talk to [Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas] because he understands that once he will have to sit and negotiate he will have to make concessions,” adds Yatom, who directed Israel’s intelligence and counterterrorism agency between 1996 and 1998. Netanyahu does not see it that way. In an interview with TIME at his Jerusalem residence, the Prime Minister argued that it was Palestinian recalcitrance that had prevented a resolution to the conflict and accused the international community of “pampering” Abbas. “They were offered everything, just about everything in Camp David in 2000, with President Clinton and the then Prime Minister Barak, and they walked away from that,” he said. “They walk away each time. They walked away with [former Prime Minister Ehud] Olmert. They walked away with Obama when President Obama and John Kerry wanted to propose a framework for negotiations.”",Netanyahu Keeps Plans on West Bank Annexation Close to His Chest,"July 11, 2019"
664,Ciara Nugent,"Climate scientists have long warned that the impacts of climate change will hit less developed regions in the global south harder and earlier than wealthier parts of the world. A major consequence of that trend, analysis of the U.N.’s latest population forecasts shows, is that countries experiencing the world’s most rapid population growth over the coming decades will also be on the front lines of climate change. TIME compared data from population forecasts published by the U.N. in June with a ranking of countries who are most vulnerable to climate change compiled by British risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. The Climate Vulnerability Index draws on datasets from bodies like the World Bank and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to assess the physical impacts of climate change on a given country (such as long term changes in weather patterns and precipitation), the sensitivity of the country’s population (based on factors like poverty levels and quality of healthcare and education) and the country’s ability to adapt (based on the strength and stability of its institutions, economy and government). Analyzing those factors, the index ranks 193 countries on their relative risk from climate change. All but one of the 10 most vulnerable countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, a region whose total population is expected to double between now and 2050 and keep on growing long after populations have plateaued or even declined in wealthier parts of the world. Europe, home to 27 of the 36 countries ranked “low risk” on the index, will likely see its population decline by 5% by 2050. The U.S., ranked 161st most at risk out of 193, will see its population grow around 15% over that period. Somalia, Burundi and the DRC will have to deal with their populations more than doubling in three decades, while facing frequent droughts, heavy floods, extreme heat, soil erosion and other physical impacts from climate change. The number of people living in the most at-risk country, the Central African Republic, is set to grow 77% by 2050, compared to average global growth of 32% for that period. The landlocked country is one of the poorest nations in the world. Violent political and inter-ethnic conflicts there have displaced more than 600,000 people there since 2013 and 2.9 million are in need of humanitarian assistance. To feed the population, farmers rely heavily on regular rainy seasons, which are likely to be disrupted in an increasingly unstable climate. The interlocking challenges facing the Central African Republic illustrate just how complex it will be for countries to manage such rapid population growth in a climate-vulnerable context, says John Wilmoth, director of the U.N.’s population division. “People in the north have to recognize that fundamentally, what this comes down to is helping people in poor countries to develop their economies and their societies as quickly as possible,” he says. “It’s particularly urgent that we do that since these countries are not the ones that have created the problem [of climate change].”",The 10 Countries Most Vulnerable to Climate Change Will Experience Population Booms in the Coming Decades,"July 11, 2019"
666,Ian Bremmer,"In Greece, the mainstream has returned to power and the populists are in retreat. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis promised that the country would “proudly raise its head again,” and Greek voters have given him a robust election victory. The new Prime Minister has his work cut out for him. The country’s outlook has improved following an agonizingly prolonged economic depression that destroyed a quarter of Greece’s economy, but more than 30% of its citizens remain trapped in poverty and unemployment remains at 18%. It’s worse for young people. Nearly 40% lack jobs, and the best and brightest continue to leave the country. Lenders have cheered Mitsotakis’ victory and the return of his business-friendly New Democracy party–and the exit of the leftist Syriza government it replaces. Mitsotakis says he will renegotiate Greece’s commitment to keep an annual budget surplus and to speed privatization of many public services in order to lower taxes and “jump-start” economic growth. The election outcome also surely pleases European leaders. New Democracy is much less likely than Syriza to provoke another economic crisis, an emergency the Europeans probably would not handle well now that an immigration crisis has undermined the E.U.’s political consensus and German Chancellor Angela Merkel no longer has the political capital to broker a credible deal. Mitsotakis’ victory gives him a strong political mandate. New Democracy won about 40% of the vote, but Greek election law provides a 50-seat bonus in Parliament for the political party that finishes in first place. That gives the new Prime Minister the outright majority he will need to move his agenda forward. In addition, Mitsotakis, the son of former Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis, is a capable technocrat, a person whose formative experience is as a consultant for McKinsey rather than as a maker of unkeepable promises like his predecessor, outgoing PM Alexis Tsipras. Yet Mitsotakis will have to deliver fairly quickly if he’s to maintain the momentum his victory has given him. Voter turnout was just 57%, one of the lowest rates in decades. It will be many years before Greece can restore genuine normality by fully repaying the $330 billion it has borrowed from the E.U. and the International Monetary Fund. Meanwhile, Syriza, which won more than 30% of the vote, has returned to opposition. Free of responsibility for avoiding economic catastrophe, it can again level unfair criticism on those who’ve now taken up these burdens. Greece may also face a return of the protests that plagued the last New Democracy–led government and inflicted millions of dollars of property damage in Athens. Future governments will probably be more fractious than this one. In 2016, the Syriza government abolished the 50-seat bonus that has given Mitsotakis his current parliamentary majority. (The new law did not apply to this election but will to those that follow.) That adds an element of urgency to Mitsotakis’ bid to bring change. If he fails, even if he wins the next election, he’s more likely to need a coalition partner to form a government, a partner that will make demands that may make it harder to pursue his agenda.",The Greek Election Brings Hope for a Country in Need,"July 11, 2019"
667,"Charlie Campbell/Tianan, Taiwan","If you want to know how focused Terry Gou is on the campaign trail, look at his pants. When the billionaire Foxconn CEO gives televised interviews, senior aides crouch by his feet, just off camera. If he strays off message, they’re primed to steer the presidential contender back on course by giving his pant legs a quick tug. Gou’s cuffs remained unruffled as he spoke to local news stations on June 15 at Kun Shan University in the southern Taiwan city of Tainan before greeting students with running high fives like a WWE wrestler. His platform in the 2020 presidential election in the island territory, he says, is how to profit from a trade war. As the U.S. and China have ramped up tit-for-tat tariffs on a range of imports over the past year, Taiwan is in a prime position to exploit the conflict, Gou tells TIME. “The trade war is also a technology war,” he says. “Taiwan can become the supply-chain in between.” Although the two sides recently brokered a temporary trade cease-fire, the U.S. and China are locked into divergent paths long term. Gou, 68, sees it ending with two rival tech zones: China servicing developing nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America on one side, and the U.S., Europe and allies on the other. “People still talk about the G-20,” he says, “but today there’s really only the G-2.” That represents an opportunity for Taiwan, which has historic links with both of these superpowers, to be a “gatekeeper,” he says. It’s a theory he’s hoping to put into practice as leader of this island of 23 million people, which has ruled itself since effectively splitting from the mainland following China’s civil war in 1949. In June, Gou stepped down as chairman of the company he founded over 40 years ago to dedicate himself full time to the race for leader of the opposition Kuomintang party, from which he could challenge incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen next year. Gou says deteriorating cross-strait relations are what pushed him into the political fray. “Today’s President doesn’t have communication channels with Beijing,” says Gou. “This is a very bad situation.” But is Taiwan’s wealthiest man the right person to fix it? Gou’s parents fled mainland China in 1949, as the communist revolution came to fruition. He was born a year later on the outskirts of Taipei, where his family lived in a single room for the next 11 years. “We would eat dinner, clear away the table and sleep in the same spot,” he recalls. They relied on handouts from U.S. missionaries, he says. “I would go to church, sing some hymns, and they would give us a carton of milk and bag of flour with the Stars and Stripes on it.” After a stint in naval college, Gou became a shipping clerk. In 1974, at 23, he started Foxconn, thanks to a $7,500 loan from his mother, which he used to buy plastic molding machines to make knobs for Western televisions. In the early ’80s, Gou embarked on an 11-month tour of the U.S., making unsolicited sales calls to drum up more business from firms like IBM. “I learned a lot from the American system,” he says. “It’s so open–if you work smart and hard, you will be successful.” Foxconn Technology Group is now the world’s biggest electronics manufacturer, and its founder is reportedly worth $6.8 billion. Most of its factories are on the mainland, and its impact on the average American’s life is immense–while Steve Jobs may have invented the iPhone, it was Gou who figured out how to actually make one. The $41 billion company now produces many of the gadgets found in American homes, from Sony PlayStations to Amazon Kindles, Nintendo Wiis and Dell laptops. Success did not come without controversy. Foxconn’s factories became synonymous for excessive overtime, low wages, child labor and unsafe conditions that, in turn, contributed to riots, strikes, workplace fatalities and more than a dozen suicides, critics say. (The company says labor conditions have since improved.) At its peak, Foxconn was China’s biggest private employer, with a staff of some 1.2 million. But manufacturing has shifted overseas as Taiwan’s economy has grown and overheads became more costly, echoing trends seen in more developed economies worldwide. The shifting fortunes of his company have inspired him to rethink how a new form of globalism might work.

669,Jasmine Aguilera,"Melting ice sheets in the Antarctic, particularly one of the largest and unstable glaciers in the region, could significantly accelerate global sea level rise, according to a new report. The climate scientists who measured likely outcomes of glacial melting at the bottom of the world focused the study on the Thwaites glacier, an area as large as Florida in western Antarctica that is considered the most unstable in the continent. The study found that even if no further climate change happens in the future, more Antarctic ice sheets are likely to become unstable. It also states that as destabilization of glaciers in Antarctica continues, it’s increasingly likely that sea levels will rise more rapidly. “Due to our past changes in climate there is a certain amount of sea level rise that will definitely occur in the future,” Alex Robel, a glaciologist and assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, tells TIME. He and two other scientists from the California Institute of Technology and the University of Washington wrote the report published by the National Academy of Sciences. Earlier this year, a NASA-led study discovered that a giant cavity, two-thirds the area of Manhattan had developed underneath Thwaites, highlighting the unexpected accelerated melting in the region. “It’s definitely distressing on a human level to think or realize the fact that there is a certain amount of not going back in terms of sea level rise that we’ve already committed ourselves to in the future,” Robel added. The amount of ice flowing out of the region has nearly doubled in the last 30 years, losing 35 gigatons of ice per year between 2009-2017 alone. That amounts to 3% of the current rate of sea level rise according to Robert Larter, a Marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey. Marine ice sheets, which are formed when warmer ocean water melts the area between the sea’s ground floor and the ice causing a cavity, are at risk of collapsing. Scientists worry that would cause the remaining ice to melt faster.",A Glacier the Size of Florida Is Becoming Unstable.

670,Ciara Nugent,"British politicians and officials have reacted with outrage to the resignation of their ambassador to the U.S. amid a rift with President Trump over leaked diplomatic cables, with many accusing the President of bullying their government. The leak on July 7 of classified memos written by Kim Darroch to the U.K. government, in which he called the Trump Administration “inept” and “incompetent”, triggered a slew of personal insults from the President. Trump tweeted that Darroch was “a very stupid guy” and “a pompous fool.” He also disinvited him from an official dinner July 8, saying “We will no longer deal with him.” Darroch, who had been due to end his four-year term as ambassador in 2020, announced Tuesday morning he would step down early. “The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like,” he said in a statement. The resignation caused alarm among British politicians, many of whom expressed concern that a U.S. president’s forcing a change of U.K. diplomatic staff represents a threat to U.K. national sovereignty. “If we allow ourselves to be bullied in who we choose to represent us, then frankly what does sovereignty mean?” Tom Tugendhat, a lawmaker from the ruling Conservative party and chairman of the government’s foreign affairs committee told Sky News. “If you can’t even choose who represents you, in what way are you in charge of anything?” Others warned that the resignation reflected Britain’s future place on the world stage after leaving the E.U. “This is a disgraceful example of what “taking back control” truly looks like: pandering to bigoted foreign leaders and letting them dictate the fate of UK ambassadors,” David Lammy, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour party, wrote on Twitter. “It’s hard to describe just how big a blow to our diplomatic standing in the world this resignation represents,” tweeted Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader.

Niagara Parks Police in Ontario, Canada, responded to a man they described as being “in crisis” in the early hours of the morning, only to find him climbing over the retaining wall, a stone barrier that separates the waterfall from its visitors. The man was quickly swept over Horseshoe Falls, but was later found sitting on rocks in the Lower Niagara River at the falls’ base without any life-threatening injuries, according to tweets from the police department. He was taken to the hospital for treatment. The man’s identity has not been released. Reached for a statement, Niagara Parks Police told TIME that they would not be releasing any more information. Horseshoe Falls, which lies between the U.S.-Canada border, is the largest of the three waterfalls that make up Niagara, standing at 167 ft. (or roughly 15.5 stories) high, with upstream rapids that reach 25mph. The whirlpool rapids at the bottom of the fall can reach 30mph. Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati told The Buffalo News he thinks that the record-setting high water levels from the nearby lakes might have helped the man survive his fall. Niagara Falls is responsible for draining Lake Erie, and into Lake Ontario; The Washington Post reports that many areas in the Great Lakes region have experienced 150 to 200% of their yearly precipitation rates this year, causing flooding. The incident occurred on the 59th anniversary of 7-year-old Roger Woodward surviving a fall from Horseshoe Falls with only a lifejacket on. with his sister and a family friend, Woodward was involved in a boating accident just upstream from the falls on July 9, 1960, and he was swept over. His sister was able to be rescued before she went over, but their family friend died. There are only a few other known survivors of Niagara Falls who went over without any protection including an unidentified man in 2012, a Canadian man in 2009, and Kirk Jones in 2003.

Video footage released by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police shows seven of the climbers as they tried to reach Nanda Devi, the second-highest peak in India, in late May. (The eighth climber was filming their trek.) The video clip, recorded at 19,000 feet with a GoPro device, ends before showing what happened next — border police said the screen went blank after a loud noise, according to the New York Times. Border police recovered the footage after a search team of embarked on a mission to recover the bodies of the climbers last month. They were able to find seven bodies; the eighth — of group leader Martin Moran, a member of British Mountain Guides — remains missing. A longtime mountaineer, according to the British Mountain Guides, Moran led several expeditions throughout his life. “Martin has been a member of our association for thirty-four years and within this close-knit group of fewer than two hundred individuals he has worked and climbed alongside nearly all of us,” the organization said in a statement. “Our thoughts go out to his family and friends and to those of his clients at this terrible time.” Border police are using the clip to “analyze what went wrong with their mission,” spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey told the BBC. Pandey said a snow ledge could have given out due to the group’s weight, prompting the avalanche. “The GoPro was proved to be like the black box of an aircraft, giving an insight into the last few moments of the climbers,” border police deputy inspector general A.P.S. Nambadia said during a press conference, the BBC reports. “It was mesmerizing for us to see the footage.” Indian officials said the group included Moran, John McClaren, Rupert Whewell and Richard Payne, from the U.K.; Americans Anthony Sudekum and Ronald Beimel; Australian Ruth McCance; and Indian liaison officer Chetan Pandey.

673,Ciara Nugent,"The escalation of a diplomatic rift between the U.S. and the U.K. over leaked ambassadorial cables has left former British officials worried over their country’s ability to conduct business in Washington — just when the U.K. was hoping to rely more on the two countries’ “special relationship” as it prepares to leave the European Union. A British newspaper published leaked diplomatic cables Sunday in which ambassador Kim Darroch described the Trump Administration as “incompetent” and “insecure”. In response, Trump said Monday he would “no longer deal with” Darroch, who has served as Britain’s ambassador since 2016. On Tuesday, the president lashed out at the U.K. for having “foisted” Darroch on the U.S. and renewed attacks on outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May over her handling of Brexit. Some British lawmakers fear the growing dispute could imperil the close ties the two countries have enjoyed since the Second World War — which many had hoped was bolstered during Trump’s state visit to the U.K. in June — and their chances of agreeing on a trade deal after the U.K. leaves the E.U. “This is such a damaging — potentially damaging — event that I hope the full force of our internal discipline, or even the law, will come down on whoever actually carried out this particular act,” the U.K.’s international trade secretary Liam Fox, the man charged with building up the U.K.’s trading relationships for the post-Brexit era, told the BBC. Fox is currently in the U.S. and said he would apologize for the leak to the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, at a scheduled meeting in Washington Tuesday. “This is going to be a hard period ahead,” says Tom Fletcher, a former British ambassador to Lebanon and former foreign policy adviser to the U.K. government. “It comes at a fragile time in the U.K. — we are vulnerable at the moment, we’re not having the best couple of years.” In the long run, Fletcher says, the “special relationship” – and U.K.-U.S. cooperation on matters such as security — is resilient enough to survive the blip. But Britain’s next ambassador, due to be appointed in 2020 when Darroch ends his four-year term, “will have to work out how he wants to handle that relationship with the White House — whether to push back or have a more behind-the-scenes role.”  Fletcher says he was surprised by Trump’s reaction to the leak. “This kind of thing has happened in the past and everyone understood it was part of the game,” Fletcher says. “But in the past we haven’t had such a thin-skinned person in the White House.

674,Suyin Haynes,"British lawmakers have voted to extend same-sex marriage and access to abortions in Northern Ireland in a move that activists are celebrating after decades of campaigning. On Tuesday, U.K. Members of Parliament backed an amendment requiring the British government to extend same-sex marriage rights to Northern Ireland, by 383 votes in favor and 73 in opposition. Another amendment aiming to extend access to abortion in Northern Ireland was also backed by 332 votes to 99. Both amendments will take effect if there is still no government in Northern Ireland by October 21 of this year, and are subject to a future executive potentially overturning or amending the law. Northern Ireland has not had a functioning devolved executive, which acts as its legislature and administration, since March 2017. Under the Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to the region, Northern Ireland is governed by a power-sharing executive. Under the terms of the agreement, both sides of the political divide — Unionists and Republicans — hold equal positions in power. Same-sex marriage came into effect in England, Wales and Scotland in 2014, but as it is a devolved issue, it has remained illegal in Northern Ireland. Votes to legalize equal marriage have consistently been opposed by the Democratic Unionist Party, which is currently the minority party in a deal that keeps the leading Conservative Party in power. “This is a huge step forward for LGBT equality in the U.K. and a tribute to those who have spent years building momentum and public support for equal marriage in Northern Ireland,” said Paul Twocock, Executive Director of Campaigns and Strategy at U.K. LGBT charity Stonewall, in a statement immediately after the amendment’s announcement. Labour MP Conor McGinn introduced the amendment relating to same-sex marriage, backed by the activist and campaign group Love Equality. The abortion amendment brought forth by another Labour MP, Stella Creasy. It says that the U.K. government should take measures to apply the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). In February 2018, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report saying that the U.K. was “violating the rights of women in Northern Ireland by unduly restricting their access to abortion,” in direct contradiction of CEDAW. Women in Northern Ireland have so far been subject to one of the strictest abortion bans in the world, and terminating a pregnancy can result in life imprisonment. It is the only place in the U.K. where women are denied an abortion in almost every circumstance. According to the U.K.’s Family Planning Associated, In 2016 and 2017, only 13 abortions were performed in Northern Irish hospitals, compared to at least 861 women and girls from Northern Ireland who travelled to England and Wales for an abortion in 2017.

The President claimed he “[doesn’t] know” Darroch, who has served as the U.K.’s ambassador since January 2016, “but [has] been told he is a pompous fool.” Diplomatic cables written by Darroch were published Sunday in the British paper the Mail on Sunday, covering a period from summer 2017 to last month. “As seen from here, we don’t really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept,” Darroch wrote in one memo.

Lam said the government’s work on the bill, which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, was “a total failure.” “I have immediately put a stop to the amendment,” she said at a press conference. But she refrained from calling it “cancelled” as protesters have repeatedly demanded, and did not invoke legislative procedures to officially terminate the bill. Lam acknowledged “there are still lingering doubts as to the government’s sincerity” over fully scrapping the bill and not resuming it at a later date. “I reiterate here there is no such plan. The bill is dead,” she said. The extradition bill, which detractors say would have destroyed the firewall between semi-autonomous Hong Kong and its sovereign power China, has ignited massive peaceful marches and separate, smaller clashes between protesters and police. Initially, Lam’s administration advertised the bill as a way to prevent the city from becoming a haven for criminal fugitives. But many in the former British colony saw it as pretext for Beijing to erode the freedoms and rights that distinguish the enclave from the mainland. The sustained month of unrest has since snowballed into a broader rebellion against Beijing’s control, and demands now include greater democracy and self-determination, as well as the release of jailed protesters, an investigation into the police use of force and Lam to step down. Last month, after organizers estimated two million people thronged to the streets, an embattled Lam suspended the controversial bill and later apologized.

King said that he first dreamed of scaling the building when he saw it on a school trip to the city. “I felt an immediate passion to climb it,” King wrote on Instagram, “the same type of passion I want to the world to feel.” He said that it took “years of training and careful preparation” before he was able to make his dream a reality. In an interview with the Evening Standard, King said that he divided his experience into three parts. “You’ve got the pre-climb, which is about the preparation, training and perseverance,” he said. “Then the present, while you’re doing it, you get the sense of fulfillment and the flow of climbing — it’s an incredible feeling. Afterwards, you have an overwhelming sense of achievement.” King is not the first person to climb the building. In 2013 a group of six women affiliated with the environmental group Greenpeace scaled the sky-scraper to protest the Shell oil company drilling in Russia and Alaska. London police were called to address King’s ascent at 5:15 AM local time. Officers waited at the 95th floor and persuaded him to come inside, about 45 minutes after he began the climb. A spokesperson for Real Estate Management, the company that operates the Shard, said, “We dealt with an incident at The Shard earlier this morning involving a member of the public who climbed the building. The person was safely apprehended and detained by police.”  After police spoke to King, they chose to not arrest him. “Of course that doesn’t give people carte blanche to do what they like on London’s buildings, and although it was judged that a criminal offense didn’t take place, there may be a civil element between the owners of the building and the climber,” a police source told the Telegraph.",British Teen Scales London's Tallest Building With No Climbing Gear,"July 8, 2019"
680,Andrew R. Chow,"When Chef Gordon Ramsay hosted a preview for his Asian-inspired London restaurant Lucky Cat in April, he called the evening “warm, buzzing & brilliant.” But Angela Hui, a British food writer, felt otherwise. In her article on food website Eater London and in an Instagram story, Hui, who is of Chinese descent, lamented the menu lumping together various Asian cuisines, the lack of Asian staffers or invited guests, and what she perceived as the head chef’s scant experience with Asian food. “It was nothing if not a real-life Ramsay kitchen nightmare,” she wrote, pointing out culturally ignorant names on the menu, like “White Geisha” cocktails. But after publication, Hui faced a torrent of racist abuse on social media. Ramsay, the creator of the award-winning series Kitchen Nightmares, also weighed in on Instagram, calling her posts “derogatory and offensive.” (TIME repeatedly attempted to contact Gordon Ramsay Restaurants but received no response.) Chinese food has been served out of scrappy basement joints, lunch boxes and regal dining rooms, and cooked by striving immigrant mothers and millionaire restaurateurs alike. But in recent years, debates surrounding the cuisine have intensified, with allegations of cultural appropriation, insensitivity and oversensitivity being cast from all sides. The Lucky Cat flare-up followed two recent firestorms surrounding Chinese or pan-Asian restaurants with white proprietors accused of being culturally insensitive. Earlier in April, a New York City restaurant, Lucky Lee’s, was the target of public fury for purporting to offer “clean” Chinese food. And in December, television chef Andrew Zimmern had to walk back comments he had made about Chinese food in the Midwest being served in “horseshit restaurants” while promoting his own chain, Lucky Cricket. For Hui, the narratives around cultural appropriation have often lacked nuance. “The question of whether white people can cook Chinese food is completely missing the point,” Hui says. “Instead, it’s about respecting it.”  As debates about authenticity rage, two central questions emerge: Why is this conversation happening primarily around Chinese cuisine? And why now? While Chinese food is tied up in personal identity for many, the current intensity of the conversation is partly rooted in a history of viewing Chinese cuisine as cheap and dirty. When the U.S. Congress passed the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, the country’s immigration quota system was abolished; as a result, a wave of working-class Chinese immigrants–many of them Cantonese– started to arrive in the United States, opening up slews of low-budget restaurants. Because many of the restaurants operated on tight budgets in dense city centers, Chinese food came to be seen by many as unsanitary or worth little more than a quick bite. Around the same time, prompted by land reforms in the former British colony of Hong Kong, many agricultural workers from the island were attracted to the U.K. in search of new lives. Two decades later, significant migration from mainland China began as the People’s Republic relaxed restrictions on emigration. In cities like London, Liverpool, Birmingham and Bristol, Chinese communities of significant size set up shops and food establishments, creating world-renowned Chinatowns and Chinese Quarters. A 1985 survey indicated that 90% of employed Chinese people living in Britain worked in the catering industry, and by 2001, an estimated 12,000 Chinese takeaways and 3,000 Chinese restaurants were operating in the U.K.",Fights Over 'Authentic' Chinese Food Have a Long and Complicated History.

681,TIME Staff,"In their first major protest since an unprecedented break-in at the government complex last week, tens of thousands of Hong Kong demonstrators marched to a controversial railway terminus Sunday in a symbolic attempt to bring their grievances to Beijing’s doorstep. As the day drew to a close, the peaceful protest once again culminated in a late-night confrontation with riot police who arrived en masse shortly after 10 p.m. The holdout protesters still gathered on the streets were declared an “illegal assembly” and police repeatedly warned them to disperse or force could be used. At least two arrests were caught on livefeeds from the scene, but protesters mostly retreated as columns of police advanced to clear the area. Earlier in the day, organizers estimated 230,000 people attended a march billed as an opportunity to take the month-long protest movement into a new neighborhood and engage with mainland Chinese visitors to the city. Police said the crowd size maxed out at 56,000. While the previous anti-government protests have mostly converged near the city’s political center, Sunday’s march hopped across the harbor for an inaugural rally in Kowloon, a peninsula connected to the mainland. The afternoon’s route forged through the heart of the Chinese tourist district and ended at a high-speed train that links the territory to the rest of China. As they snaked through mega-malls and high-end hotels, protesters said they aimed to win over residents of the mainland, where news coverage has mostly been limited to state media’s anti-protester invectives. “What little the mainland people might know about these demonstrations is incorrect,” Cherry Chow, a 21-year-old student, tells TIME. Chinese media, she said, paints a picture of violence and chaos. “They don’t show that most of us are actually peaceful.” Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese enclave, has been seized by a spiraling political crisis this summer that kicked off over legislation that would have allowed extraditions to the mainland. The proposed law inflamed fears about the former British colony’s freedoms and independent judiciary—protected after its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997—and also underscored the depth of anxiety over its relationship to Beijing. Massive protests, which drew up to two million people, forced the government to suspend the bill. But the move did little to pacify public anger. Protesters’ initial demands for the outright cancellation of the bill and for the city’s unelected, Beijing-backed leader to step down have since swelled into broader aspirations for genuine democracy, with some even agitating for independence from China.",Hong Kong Protesters Try to Drum Up Support Among Mainland Chinese Tourists,"Updated: July 7, 2019 11:45 AM ET"

The pictures of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and her baby again gave royal fans insight into the fascinating lives of their favorite family. The first official portraits were shared on the Sussex Royal Instagram page hours after the christening, which was held on Saturday, July 6. Archie’s parents, the Duchess and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, smiled from ear to ear in the photos taken in Queen Elizabeth II’s Private Chapel at Windsor Castle in Windsor, England.  Many members of the royal family, including William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, got together for the occasion. Queen Elizabeth II did not attend. However, the queen also didn’t attend Prince Louis’ christening, so that’s not exactly a surprise. The first photo features Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

683,"SAMER KHALIL AL-ATRUSH, ILYA ARKHIPOV and HENRY MEYER / BLOOMBERG","(Bloomberg)— Libyan security forces have arrested two men accused of working for a Russian troll farm seeking to influence elections in the oil exporter and other African countries. A letter from the state prosecutor of the internationally-backed Tripoli government to a Libyan security chief said the men were involved in “securing a meeting” with Saif al-Islam al-Qaddafi, the fugitive son of the ousted dictator and a potential presidential candidate who enjoys the backing of some officials in Moscow. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was aware of the reports and was seeking to verify them. “We haven’t received an official notification from the Libyan side regarding this matter,” the foreign ministry’s press service said. Laptops and memory sticks found with the suspects showed that they worked for an outfit identified as Fabrika Trollei, Russian for Troll Factory, that “specializes in influencing elections that are to be held in several African states” including Libya, the letter, stamped by the attorney general’s office and obtained by Bloomberg, stated. Two Libyan government officials with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed the authenticity of the document. Fabrika Trollei was the moniker given to a network of media and political outfits connected to Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who’s been accused by the U.S. of funding and organizing operations to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Libya had planned to hold elections this year as part of a UN-sponsored roadmap to heal divisions that have plagued the country since the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that ended Moammar al-Qaddafi’s four-decade rule. That initiative has been upended since eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar launched a military assault to capture Tripoli in April. Haftar himself has presidential ambitions and is fighting to seize the capital from the United Nations-backed government led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, which carried out the arrests. The offensive has descended into a proxy war with each side accusing the other of inviting foreign interference. Haftar is supported by the U.A.E and Egypt, and had received Russian assistance, though Russia has also tried to cultivate other partners in Libya, including Saif al-Islam, as it looks to expand its role in North Africa and build its geopolitical might.",Libyan Security Forces Arrest Two Russians Allegedly Attempting to Interfere in Elections,"July 5, 2019"
684,Jasmine Aguilera,"A new monument to Melania Trump has been erected in her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, and its creators are calling it the first public statue in commemoration of her. The idea came to Brad Downey, an artist from Kentucky currently based in Berlin according to his Instagram account, who commissioned Sevnica local and “amateur chainsaw sculptor” Ales “Maxi” Zupevc to carve it, according to AFP. According to Downey’s Instagram, the statue will be the subject of a documentary and exhibition he is working on. Via the artist’s statement Downey has shared online: The statue depicts the First Lady on Inauguration Day in 2017, wearing a blue dress designed by Ralph Lauren and waving at crowds. Zupevc took to a tree and carved the statue with a chainsaw. Critics of the statue immediately began comparing it to a scarecrow, however. “I can understand why people might think that this falls short as a description of her physical appearance,” Downey told AFP. “We in Sevnica can only laugh and, at the same time, hold our heads in our hands over their [the Trumps’] catastrophic reputation,” one local resident identified as Nika, a 24-year-old architecture student, told AFP. Other locals, speaking with the British TV network ITV, described the statue as “a disgrace,” and argued it looked more like Smurfette than the First Lady. AFP reports that Downey came up with the idea as part of a project that explores Melania Trump’s roots both metaphorically and literally. Downey wrote in his Instagram account that he chose to work with Zupevc because he was born in the same year and the same hospital as Melania Trump. He writes that the statue is rooted on the banks of a river facing the town in salute. Residents have also sold Melania Trump-themed food and merchandize, capitalizing on interest in the town’s claim to fame.

685,Madeline Fitzgerald,"When Alison van Uytvanck and Greet Minnen stepped onto the court at Wimbledon on Tuesday, it was their first time playing doubles together in a grand slam tournament match. Off-the-court, however, they have been paired for three years.  Belgians Minnen and van Uytvanck made history by being the first out gay couple to ever play together at the famed tennis tournament in London, England. The two were victorious over British players Katie Swann and Freya Christie on Wednesday.  “We [would like to] see more people coming forward and saying ‘It’s OK,’” van Uytvanck said after the match. “I think people would have more confidence.” This is not the first time the couple has made headlines at Wimbledon. Last year, after defeating then-reigning Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza to reach the third round of the tournament, van Uytvanck immediately headed to kiss her girlfriend sat in the stands. “I know it was a big deal but we just didn’t think about it,” said Minnen in an interview with the Telegraph. “She had just made the biggest win of her career and I was so happy and not thinking in that moment.” While the number of gay athletes in the sport is still low, included in their numbers are tennis legends. Billie Jean King, famous for her defeat of Bobby Riggs in the 1973 “battle of the sexes” was outed as a lesbian in a 1981 lawsuit. Martina Navratilova came out as a bisexual in a 1981 interview, though she has since described herself as a lesbian. And in 1976, transgender woman Renee Richards made history when she sued the US Tennis Association and won so she could compete in the Women’s U.S. Open. In addition to van Uytvanck and Minnen, two other out gay women — Johanna Larsson of Sweden and Richel Hogenkamp of the Netherlands — competed in this year’s singles tournament.  Among male players, however, being out is still a rarity.

686,Megan McCluskey,"Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex introduced their firstborn son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, to the world on May 8, just two days after his May 6 birth. But in the months following, Harry and Meghan have largely kept their new royal baby out of the spotlight — with the exception of a few Instagram posts, that is. Royal baby Archie was christened on July 6. Of course, the baptism itself was a private affair. But royals fans will at least have a chance to catch a glimpse of Archie in photos from the day. If we’re lucky, we may even get our first shot of the full Cambridge and Sussex broods all in one place. Check back for updates on the latest news on the event. And here’s what we know to know about royal baby Archie’s christening. Royal baby Archie’s christening took place on July 6, two months after his May 6 birth. The baptism ceremony was held at Queen Elizabeth II’s private chapel at Windsor Castle in Windsor, England. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby presided over the christening, during which royal baby Archie was officially baptized into the Church of England. The Archbishop used the Lily Font, a gilded silver bowl that has been used at the christening of every royal baby since 1841, to bless Archie with water from the River Jordan, where Jesus was believed to have been baptised by John the Baptist, and welcome him into the Anglican faith. As with all royal christenings, the ceremony was a smaller, private affair, with no access to the public. The Sussex duo shared the first photos from the christening on their Instagram page following the christening. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are so happy to share the joy of this day with members of the public who have been incredibly supportive since the birth of their son,” the Instagram caption said.

687,Julia Webster,"Every morning for more than two decades, thousands of listeners across Italy tuned in to Radio Radicale to hear the iconic voice of journalist Massimo Bordin hosting the daily newspaper review. But when the news of his death was announced on April 17, it came at an especially difficult time for the Rome-based radio station: after 47 years on air, Radio Radicale was already at risk of being shut down. For many, the move seemed to be part of a wider populist campaign against the media. Now, weeks on, the question of its future is still deepening divisions in Italy’s government.  The dispute over Radio Radicale, a political radio station that broadcasts live parliamentary debates and court cases alongside its political shows, has furthered a schism between the two coalition partners that currently govern Italy: the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the increasingly influential far-right Lega (League) led by minister of the interior Matteo Salvini. It was back in April that Italians launched into a national debate over the station, after M5S leader and economy minister Luigi di Maio announced the government, which partly funds the station, would not renew the station’s funding and authorization to broadcast live during parliamentary sessions.  The turning point in the debate came when the League, which does not share many of Five Star’s anti-establishment values and is gaining supporters, sided with the opposition instead. On June 13, the Italian parliament, helped by support from the League, voted to keep the state-funded radio station afloat for the rest of 2019 in defiance of M5S’s wishes. In response to the decision, di Maio said Radio Radicale is “a private political radio station paid for with your money. We are proud to have opposed it.” He added: “The League will have to explain why they have supported this indecent proposal.”  Meanwhile the League’s Salvini, a former reporter himself, told journalists: “I try to defend everyone’s freedom of expression, including that of Radio Radicale, which has accumulated a large cultural heritage, of archives and experience.”  “It would be a shame to wipe it out with the stroke of a pen,” he said, in a news conference after the June 13 vote. The anti-establishment M5S, which started out in 2009 with a blog written by a famous comedian called Beppe Grillo, was founded on the idea that traditional media will eventually be made redundant by the internet. Its leaders communicate predominantly through Twitter and Facebook, where they have repeatedly attacked the press in the name of defending “the people” against the establishment. Last year, some members called journalists that criticized the party “jackals” and “whores”. “It’s not surprising that M5S have voted against the financing,” says Salvatore Vassallo, professor of politics at the University of Bologna. “However Five Star are completely isolated when it comes to this issue. In Italy’s political history, the financing of party newspapers has played a very important role.”  On the other hand, the League’s position on this issue “is not typical of the populist anti-establishment parties, because it’s not really an anti-establishment party,” Vassallo says. Founded in 1989, two decades before M5s, the League (formerly Northern League) held ministerial positions is all three of Silvio Berlusconi’s governments. Unlike M5S, the party has run its own newspaper and radio station for decades thanks to government funding. Salvini himself worked the League’s radio station, Radio Padania Libera. Its daily newspaper, La Padania, closed in 2014 when it ran into financial trouble.",A Radio Station in Italy Finds Itself on the Frontline of a Populist Attack on the Press,"July 5, 2019"
688,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"Law enforcement would inevitably arrive to evict the hundreds of young, black-shirted demonstrators who broke in and defiled the Hong Kong legislature. A rumor that police were already there briefly dispersed the sea of anti-government protesters from the harbor-front complex. But after the false alarm, the jittery crowd returned. For the last hours of July 1—exactly 22 years after Hong Kong ceased to be a British colony—the city’s political heart was theirs. “This Legislative Council belongs to us, the people,” said one of several masked protesters, delivering an impromptu speech at the chamber’s dais. “Day by day, night by night, you will be seeing us,” he vowed to the absent authorities as he raised a defiant arm. It was sheathed in cling-wrap, as a protection against the fiery sting of police pepper spray. He and the thousands of other young activists who spent the day battering their way through the building’s glass and metal entrances see themselves as commandos in a movement to safeguard Hong Kong’s freedoms from Beijing’s depredation. Many are high school and university students. For weeks, they had been arguing that confrontation was the only way to make their voices heard by stonewalling officials. But the storming and ransacking of the legislature has cast their struggle in rather more dramatic light. With the corridors trashed and “H.K. is not China” spray-painted on the walls, their movement was now not just a protest but a rebellion—against the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communist Party itself. By the time the police materialized that Monday night, the protesters were already retreating through the Admiralty district’s maze of luxury malls and multistory government offices. Volleys of tear gas and an advancing column of officers cleared any would-be holdouts. “Welcome to the war zone,” said one, as he ran from the smoke. The political crisis gripping Asia’s financial capital this summer kicked off over a bill that would allow, for the first time, extradition to mainland China. But it has since swelled into a broader struggle for democracy, and a repudiation of Chinese sovereignty over the enclave. Opposition to the bill, which critics fear would enable Beijing to round up local dissidents and detractors, has united business owners, families, church groups and bespectacled students, galvanizing them into millions-strong marches. Consecutive weeks of unrest forced the government to suspend the controversial proposal. But the protesters are not pacified by a deferral. The bill has released years of collective rage not only against a political oligarchy, rigged to disenfranchise the great majority of the metropolis’ 7.2 million highly educated citizens, but also against the looming menace of Beijing. “This fight against extradition to mainland China is seen as the violation of the last firewall protecting Hong Kong from Beijing,” said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame. “The threat is too severe.”",'We Are Risking Everything.'

The city’s Beijing-backed leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has suspended but not withdrawn the bill, as protesters over the past month have demanded. She has also pledged to do a better job of listening to the young people who have thronged to the streets opposing her bill and demanding her resignation. Student leaders called Lam’s invitation “insincere” and a “public relations act.” Speaking to reporters on Friday morning, students from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology insisted that the meeting be made public. “If she really had sincerity, she would lay it all out and speak publicly to the whole world, to all of Hong Kong,” Lai Wai Chun, Provisional President of the student union at the University of Science and Technology, said, echoing a post on the union’s Facebook page explaining why it had refused the meeting. Lai also criticized Lam for only reaching out to two universities. “Are you saying that students from just two universities can represent all the young people? This makes us feel doubtful.” President of Chinese University’s student union, Jacky So, called Lam’s request a public relations stunt. “Throughout the whole of June, she never asked to meet us young protestors, even refusing to speak with pan-democrat lawmakers,” he said.

690,TIME Staff,"A 28-year-old Hong Kong protester was found dead Wednesday near her home, local media reports. The woman, who has been identified only by the surname Mak, is being hailed locally as the fourth “martyr” in a massive protest movement that has seized the semi-autonomous Chinese enclave for the past two months over a controversial extradition bill. The woman’s family and friends said they decided to make her death public because they believe she would have wanted her message conveyed, local site Stand News reports. Friends described being shocked by the woman’s death. “A lot of people would say she is a ‘happy nut,'” one unnamed friend told Stand. They also said she had been preoccupied by the protests against the now-suspended extradition legislation. The movement has morphed into a fight to preserve the freedoms that make Hong Kong China’s freest city, as well as push for greater democracy. Protest paraphernalia, including googles and saline solution to combat teargas, were found on the woman’s bed, her friends and family said. They added that they believe she clearly intended to signal to the government the protesters’ desperation for a meaningful democratic vote. “It’s the responsibility of the government to give hope to young people,” a friend reportedly said. The woman’s death is the fourth to have included a suicide note or other reference mentioning the ongoing political crisis. Last month, in the first of the instances, a 35-year-old man fell to his death from a luxury mall located near the epicenter of the protests while unfurling a banner denouncing the extradition bill. Fellow protesters and mourners erected a shrine in his honor, laying wreaths and origami flowers near the site of his death. Suicide prevention groups told local media that they have recently been inundated with calls for help related to the protests, and warned of a mental health crisis.

691,"Verity Ratcliffe, Julian Lee and Arsalan Shahla / Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) — British special forces seized a supertanker off Gibraltar carrying Iranian oil to Syria in violation of European and U.S. sanctions against the war-torn country. Iran responded by declaring the action illegal and summoning the British ambassador to the Foreign Ministry in Tehran to explain the ship’s arrest. The diplomatic row heightened tensions just as the U.K., France and Germany try to keep the Islamic Republic from walking away from an international deal to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons. The U.S. quit the pact a year ago, prompting Tehran to make good on an earlier warning that it would exceed the limits on its stockpile of enriched uranium. While Syrians will feel the immediate impact of halting the crucial oil shipment to the country, the arrested vessel shows the difficulty Iran faces in finding outlets for its crude as President Donald Trump’s administration ramps up sanctions. Iran’s oil production has dropped by 1.5 million barrel a day over the past year, poleaxing the Islamic Republic’s economy. The Grace 1, able to ship 2 million barrels of crude oil, was intercepted by detachments of Royal Marines and Gibraltarian police, who boarded the tanker from a helicopter and speed boat in the early hours of Thursday morning. The ship is now anchored near Gibraltar, a British overseas territory on Spain’s southern tip that overlooks the strait between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. “We have detained the vessel and its cargo,” said Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar’s chief minister. “This action arose from information giving the Gibraltar government reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel, Grace 1, was acting in breach of European Union sanctions against Syria.” Gibraltar didn’t say where the crude came from, but ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed the vessel loaded at Iran’s Kharg Island oil terminal in mid-April. Several weeks later, the ship began a journey around the bottom of Africa, passing Cape Town in early June, rather than taking the more direct route through the Suez Canal. Iran’s decision to lodge a diplomatic complaint shows Tehran isn’t attempting to disavow the cargo’s origin. Seyyed Abbas Mousavi, a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, said on state TV that Britain’s move was “a kind of extraterritorial sanction” that could “escalate tension in the region.” Britain’s Foreign Office confirmed that its ambassador had been summoned. Earlier in the day, Theresa May’s spokesman had offered London’s full support for Gibraltar’s actions. “We welcome this firm action to enforce EU sanctions against the Syrian regime,” the prime minister’s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters in London. “This sends a clear message that violation of the sanctions is unacceptable.”","British Marines Seize Supertanker Carrying Iranian Oil to Syria, Causing Diplomatic Row","July 4, 2019"
692,Suyin Haynes,"A British lawmaker has compared the U.K’s exit from the European Union to the emancipation of slaves in the first speech from a Brexit Party representative at the new European parliament. The Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, won 29 seats in the 2019 election. In a fiery speech at the E.U. headquarters in Strasbourg Thursday, veteran British politician and former Conservative Member of Parliament Ann Widdecombe railed against recent decision making processes conducted by the E.U. The previous day, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and the International Monetary Fund’s Managing Director Christine Lagarde were nominated by E.U. leaders for the Union’s two top jobs. Widdecombe said that the negotiations were not democratic, and were one of many reasons that Britain was right to be leaving the Union on Brexit’s recently-updated date of October 31, 2019. “If that’s this place’s idea of democracy that’s a serious betrayal of every country represented here,” she said. “There is a pattern consistent throughout history of oppressed people turning on their oppressors, slaves against their owners, the peasantry against the feudal barons, colonies against empires, and that is why Britain is leaving,” Widdecombe added, standing next to Farage. “It doesn’t matter which language you use, we are leaving and we are pleased to be going. Nous allons, wir gehen, we are off!” One fellow Brexit MEP tweeted saying that Widdecombe’s speech prompted “tears in my eyes” and that the veteran politician represented the “ignored majority.” However, other MEPs were reportedly emotional for rather different reasons. “Some British MEPs were in tears listening to Ann Widdecombe’s rant in the European Parliament today. It is one of the most shameful episodes I have witnessed in my five years there,” Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said in a statement provided to TIME. “Anybody who values our place in the world will hang their head in shame after witnessing this humiliating incident.” It’s not the first time Widdecombe has courted controversy. Earlier this month, the 71-year-old suggested that science could “produce an answer” to being gay, leading to cancelations of several scheduled public appearances. During her time as U.K. prisons minister in the 1990s, she defended a policy that forced pregnant women prisoners to be chained up to prevent escapes and in 2009, she condemned a proposed E.U. energy policy by denying the existence of climate change. The speech came amid an eventful first week for newly-elected European parliamentarians. Earlier in the week, 29 Brexit party MEPs faced criticism for turning their backs during a rendition of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, the E.U.’s anthem, in the Strasbourg chamber.

693,Kimberly Dozier,"As President Donald Trump prepares to tout his achievements at a Fourth of July speech on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., here’s a snapshot of how global hot spots have fared since he took office. North Korea was a crisis on the boil when President Barack Obama left the White House. Trump’s personal outreach to leader Kim Jong Un has turned the temperature down but failed to produce tangible steps to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. The two men have held three face-to-face meetings, progress of a sort compared to early 2017 when Trump was promising “fire and fury” and Kim was testing missiles capable of reaching the United States. But Kim resumed weapons testing, and U.S. intelligence believes he has built more nuclear weapons, according to David Maxwell of Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “The North is no closer to denuclearization today than in the previous administration,” Maxwell says. Trump abandoned Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, ramped up sanctions and brought Tehran to the brink of economic implosion. In response, Tehran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz and shot down a U.S. military drone. European officials fear the tension could lead to an all-out U.S. war with Iran, or drive Tehran to ramp up a mothballed nuclear weapons program, or both. Iran had dismantled much of its nuclear program by 2016, but also had continued supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad, Houthi rebels in Yemen, and other extremist groups. Trump’s sanctions are aimed at ending those regional activities. Tehran defiantly produced enough enriched uranium this week to bust the nuclear agreement, trying to pressure the Europeans to get Trump off Tehran’s back.",President Trump Boasts About What He's Done for the World.

695,Suyin Haynes,"An Italian airline has “deeply apologized” after one of its promotional videos featured an actor wearing blackface in an apparent attempt to portray former U.S. president Barack Obama. Alitalia, Italy’s flag carrier airline, quickly faced backlash on social media for the video, which was promoting the airline’s new nonstop flight route from Rome to Washington. The video, which has since been removed from the company’s social media channels, depicted ‘Obama’ finding his way to Washington; three other videos in the series included actors playing President Trump, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln making similar trips. “The ad is ‘unwatchable.’ It paints a perfect picture of a sovereignist little Italy that is proud of its ignorance and still remembers Obama as the “handsome and tanned” president, as Berlusconi once described him,” said Leonardo de Franceschi, a researcher at the University of Rome who confronted the airline over the advert on Facebook. According to the New York Times, an airline representative initially responded by defending the video, saying that the actor playing Obama’s character was not Caucasian and that “makeup was applied to highlight features.” (Though a photo from the actor’s Instagram page that appears to show him at the beginning of the ‘makeover’ suggests his skin was darkened for the video.) Alitalia also told another commenter they were “exaggerating” with their criticism, per Al Jazeera, but later walked back the comments and pulled the video from its social channels. “For our Company, respect for everyone is mandatory,” the airline said in a statement posted on social media July 3. “It was never our intention to hurt anyone and we will learn from what has happened.” Write to Suyin Haynes at suyin.haynes@time.com.",Italian Airline Apologizes For Promotional Video With Actor Playing Barack Obama in Blackface,"July 4, 2019"
696,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong police have arrested a suspect in relation to the July 1 ransacking of the legislature, while Beijing intensified its condemnation of the protests and of political leaders in Britain, who have voiced support for them. Local government-run radio reported in the early hours of Thursday that a 31-year-old man had been arrested and accused of forcible entry into the Legislative Council, while 12 other suspects were detained Monday in connection with other public order violations, including possessing offensive weapons. A further wave of arrests is expected as police track down protesters suspected of storming the city’s parliament. Hundreds of anti-Beijing demonstrators smashed their way into the Legislative Council on the 22nd anniversary of the former British colony’s retrocession to Chinese sovereignty. The unprecedented attack caused millions of dollars of damage. Protesters defaced the semi-autonomous enclave’s official emblem, tore up its post-colonial constitution, and draped the British colonial flag across the president’s chair. Slogans spray-painted inside the complex read “We are not China” and “H.K. is not China.” In a stern rebuke Wednesday, Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily said “Inciting illegal activities” damaged the reputation of Hong Kong as an international financial center and hurt “the immediate interests and fundamental welfare of Hongkongers.” It went on to say that “those who love the country and love Hong Kong” should “strongly condemn extremely violent acts” and seek the prosecution of those who “seriously violate the law.” In an editorial Tuesday, the state-run, English language Global Times asserted that “Chinese mainland society and Hong Kong belong to the same big family” and stated that it was “a disgrace that such a developed society could carry out this kind of reckless and savage violence that has signaled an ominous alert for the city’s future.” Tensions have also risen between Beijing and Whitehall, after the Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming accused the U.K. of interfering “in the internal affairs of Hong Kong” and supporting “violent lawbreakers.” His remarks came after British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had witnessed “terrible scenes” in Hong Kong. “My heart goes out to people who do have to fight for their freedoms and who are worried they could lose their very, very precious way of life,” he said.",Authorities Begin Arrests in Hong Kong as Beijing Ramps Up the Rhetoric,"July 4, 2019"
697,Julia Webster,"Princess Haya Bint al Hussein, the sixth wife of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the billionaire ruler of Dubai, is said to be seeking refuge in London after reportedly leaving her husband and fleeing Dubai. She is thought to be living with the couple’s two children in a mansion near Kensington Palace worth about $107 million. According to the BBC, Princess Haya, who is the daughter of King Hussein of Jordan, is said to be “afraid for her life.” A person close to the royal family told the New York Times that she arrived London months ago, and is seeking political asylum while asking for a divorce. A legal battle between the couple is now underway in the London courts regarding divorce and the custody of the couple’s two children. Sheikh Mohammed, 69, is a billionaire and racehorse owner that was seen speaking to the Queen at Royal Ascot, Britain’s most famous annual horse-racing event in June. Princess Haya failed to appear at this year’s event. The couple married in 2004, with Princess Haya then becoming the sheikh’s sixth and youngest wife. Princess Haya is thought to have sought refuge in Germany first. However it is thought she would prefer to stay in the UK, where she went to school and studied at the University of Oxford. She is also close to the British royal family. While the reasons for Princess Haya’s move are as yet unclear, Sheikh Mohammed, who enjoys writing poetry, has seemingly been sharing his emotions online. In a recent post on Instagram, he accused an unnamed woman of treachery and betrayal. Under Islamic law in the UAE, men can easily divorce their wives — but women must go through a long legal process. It is likely to be complicated in the UK due to it being a polygamous marriage, and will put the UK in a difficult position, considering its longstanding alliances with the UAE.  Sheikh Mohammed reportedly made an application to divorce his wife and claim custody of their two children in the Family Court division of the High Court. The case was last heard in the courts on May 22 before Mr. Justice Moor, and is next listed on July 30 with a time estimate of 2 days.","Princess Haya, Wife of Dubai's Ruler Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, Is Reportedly Seeking Protection in London","July 3, 2019"

The German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen will replace Jean Claude Juncker as the E.U.’s commission president.  Von der Leyen is a centrist and a loyal ally of Angela Merkel and her nomination was seen as a victory for the German chancellor. She’s less well known internationally than Lagarde and was seen as a surprise nomination. This is her first E.U. position but the role, one of Europe’s most powerful, would put her front and center in trade deals as well as proposing and enforcing E.U. rules.  In her speech taking up the role, she championed gender equality. “We represent half of our population. We want our fair share,” she told MEPs. On climate change, she said the EU’s target of cutting carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 was not enough. It should be 50%, if not 55%, she said.

699,Madeline Roache,"The biggest pride event in Central and Eastern Europe brought more people than ever to the streets in the Polish capital of Warsaw on June 8. Tens of thousands of people marched, danced and sang waving colorful flags and umbrellas. Back in 2005, gay rights activists had to fight to march in Warsaw. Pride events were officially banned in 2004 and 2005 by then mayor Lech Kaczynski, who later became President.  What started as hundreds of people marching in defiance of the mayor, grew to nearly 50,000 marching in June alongside the new mayor, who was elected in 2018. In June, Rafal Trzaskowski became the first mayor to take part and speak to crowds from a parade float in Warsaw, which is Poland’s largest city with a population of 1.76 million people. And in at least 20 cities across Poland from June 29 to July 6, Equality Parades have taken place, including in the western city of Poznan, with more people than ever taking part.  But as support for LGBTQ rights has grown, so too has the backlash. Ahead of European Parliament elections in May, Poland’s right-wing ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), ramped up its opposition to the LGBTQ community, calling it a “direct attack” on family values. PiS, which has been in power since 2015, warned that if the opposition prevailed in the European Parliament elections, so would the LGBTQ “attack” on society (PiS eventually scored a victory in the May elections). Jacek Kucharczyk, President of Poland’s leading think tank, the Institute of Public Affairs tells TIME he expects anti-LGBTQ rhetoric to increase ahead of national elections this fall.  Poland, home to some 38 million people, is one of Europe’s most Catholic countries, with about 86 percent of the population identifying as Roman Catholic. It ranks 27 out of 28 European Union states when it comes to equality and non-discrimination, according to Rainbow Europe, an organization linked to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.  Same-sex marriage, still illegal in Poland, is legal in 27 EU countries. Anti-gay attacks are not considered a hate crime by law. In 2016, parliament rejected a bill that would have included gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and age as potential grounds for a “hate crime.” Kucharczyk from the Institute of Public Affairs says there’s a “refusal to recognise that LGBTQ people need to be protected. This group is systematically excluded. Hate crimes against sexual minorities are not reported because police aren’t required to report it.”  According to the Campaign Against Homophobia, 12 percent of people who don’t identify as heterosexual are victims of physical violence in Poland, while around ninety percent of incidents go unreported, according to the 2016 survey. Nevertheless, “attitudes towards the LGBTQ community have come a long way” says Robert Biedron, who became Poland’s first openly gay and atheistic politician when he came out in 2011. Biedron, 42, served as mayor of the northern town of Slupsk until 2018. He cites the rising number of pride demonstrators and the fact that he now endures far fewer anti-gay insults from politicians and the media. “It’s a big change compared to a few years ago,” he says. In February Biedron founded a pro EU political party, which has vaulted into third place in a public opinion poll, potentially threatening the ruling party’s prospects for winning the general election. Opposition to LGBTQ rights became a cornerstone of PiS’s campaign after Warsaw Mayor Trzaskowski, who belongs to opposition party Civic Platform, signed a declaration in February that promised an LGBTQ hostel and community centre, a local crisis intervention system, and access to anti-discrimination and sex education in schools along World Health Orgnization (WHO) guidelines.",Poland Is Holding Massive Pride Parades.

Others defended the captain of a German rescue ship who was arrested in Italy on Monday over migrant rights. The event took place as EU leaders went into a third day of negotiations about who to appoint for its top jobs. The Brexit Party’s 29 MEPs turned their backs when an ensemble started playing Beethoven’s ‘Ode to joy’, the European anthem.

702,Justin Worland,"When the Kenyan government had second thoughts about allowing the country’s first coal-fired power plant, the Trump Administration’s representative in the country protested. U.S. Ambassador Kyle McCarter, a Trump appointee who previously served as a Republican state senator in Illinois, went on Twitter to argue in a string of tweets that coal is environmentally sound, that the plant would boost the country’s economy and that a critical analysis of the plant from a clean energy think tank amounted only to the work of “highly paid protestors.” “Coal is the cleanest, least costly option,” U.S. Ambassador Kyle McCarter wrote from his official Twitter last week. “Investors will come.” It’s unclear what lobbying — if any — McCarter has engaged in behind the scenes to promote the coal-fired power plant, but the voice of the U.S. government, which contributed more than a $1 billion in foreign to Kenya in 2017, carries weight within the country, and the White House has said that similar tweets from President Donald Trump are “official statements.” Regardless of whether McCarter’s tweets were approved by the State Department ahead of time, they reflect the Trump Administration’s support for growing the coal industry internationally even as scientists warn that the energy source is one of the biggest contributors to climate change and growth in its use could make it all but impossible to keep the planet from warming to catastrophic levels. These warnings have been left unheeded by Trump, who promised to promote coal throughout his presidential campaign and has unwound environmental policies to that end as president. Most significantly for coal, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency has rewritten President Barack Obama’s landmark regulation of the power sector to reduce its impact on coal-fired plants. Still, Trump has been unable to halt the market forces and other pressures that have led hundreds of coal-fired power plants to close. McCarter Twitter comments began on June 25, after Kenya’s National Environmental Tribunal’s announced that it would halt construction of the Lamu coal-fired power plant, which would have been the first such power plant in the country. The court said the project’s planners had failed to engage the local community and argued that the environmental review conducted ahead of the project did not adequately address several environmental issues including the country’s commitment to fighting climate change. The project could still be revived if a new environmental assessment adequately addresses the concerns laid out in the decision. “These extraordinary measures are necessary to ensure sufficient access to information by the public on a project that will be the first of its kind in Kenya and the East African region,” the National Environmental Tribunal said in its ruling.",The Trump Administration Protested When Kenya Halted a Coal-Fired Power Plant,"Updated: July 8, 2019 11:25 AM ET | Originally published: July 2, 2019"
703,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"While hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters, including families toting young children, marched through the sweltering Hong Kong afternoon on Monday to express their opposition to a divisive extradition bill, a separate group took more forceful swings against the government On the 22nd anniversary of the territory’s retrocession to China, hundreds of mostly young radicals used metal poles, hammers, garbage bins and carts to smash through the legislature’s glass façade and eventually invade the complex. The spray-painting of slogans like “Hong Kong is not China” around the walls shattered any lingering illusions over the nature of their rebellion: This was a clear repudiation of China’s sovereignty over the enclave. Beijing, hypersensitive to any threat to its territorial integrity, will bristle at the unprecedented provocation from this former British colony. The smell of tear gas from the police’s midnight eviction of the protesters had barely dispersed before the full-throated condemnation began. China’s state media Tuesday pledged “zero tolerance” for the “open and symbolic attack.” “A zero-tolerance policy is the only remedy for such destructive behavior witnessed. Otherwise, and without this policy, it would be similar to opening a Pandora’s Box, upending social disorder,” the Global Times said in an editorial Tuesday. After days of ignoring the Hong Kong unrest, state media also ran footage of police driving protesters from the streets, the Associated Press (AP) reported. Beijing has frequently suggested that foreign forces are behind Hong Kong’s democracy movement. According to AP, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang warned that other nations “must not support any violent criminals in any form, and not send any misleading signals or take any erroneous actions.” Pro-government politicians echoed Beijing’s sentiments. “No slogan, no demand can justify this sort of violence,” lawmaker Regina Ip told reporters.",The Ransacking of Hong Kong's Legislature Prompts a 'Zero Tolerance' Warning From Beijing,"Updated: July 2, 2019 7:20 AM ET"
704,TIME Staff,"Hong Kong was struggling to come to terms this morning with the violent ransacking of the legislature on July 1—the 22nd anniversary of the former British colony’s retrocession to China. On Monday night, hundreds of anti-China rioters battered their way through glass doors and steel shutters and ran rampant through the Legislative Council, locally referred to as LegCo. They smashed fixtures, spray-painted the walls with slogans and destroyed portraits of unpopular leaders, before breaching the debating chamber and draping the colonial flag across the president’s desk. Government-run media reported Tuesday that the legislature’s president had canceled all sessions for the next two weeks, effectively beginning the body’s summer recess. Authorities meanwhile pledged to bring rioters to justice, with police cordoning off the wrecked building and declaring it a crime scene. Looking tired and subdued, Hong Kong’s embattled top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, called a press conference at 4:00 a.m. local time, three hours after police reoccupied the legislature, and deplored “the extreme use of violence and vandalism by protesters.” She added that “nothing is more important than the rule of law in Hong Kong” and hoped “society will return to normal as soon as possible.” Police Commissioner Stephen Lo appeared with Lam and, speaking in Cantonese, said: “The violent acts by the protesters have crossed a bottom line. Hong Kong is a peaceful society. I believe a lot of Hongkongers are saddened by the protesters’ violent actions.” Lam meanwhile defended her handling of the escalating political crisis that has its origins in the government’s attempt to make it possible for fugitives to be extradited to the mainland. This does not happen at present, because even though Hong Kong is considered part of China, it is a semi-autonomous territory with a separate legal system and no extradition agreement with Beijing.

In a joint news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, President Trump claimed that his predecessor had tried to meet with Kim on multiple occasions, only to be rebuffed. “President Obama wanted to meet, and Chairman Kim would not meet him,” the President said. “The Obama administration was begging for a meeting. They were begging for meetings constantly, and Chairman Kim would not meet with him.” “Trump is lying,” tweeted Ben Rhodes, who served as Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications during the Obama administration. “I was there for all eight years.

Stepping across the border, Trump became the first sitting American President to visit North Korea’s isolated state. The two leaders met for nearly an hour, and agreed to restart talks on North Korea’s nuclear program.

708,Joseph Hincks / Hebron,"As White House senior adviser Jared Kushner rolled out the first stage of a long-awaited Middle East peace plan in Bahrain last week, Palestinian store owner Abdul Al-Mohtaseb was serving cardamon coffee outside his shop in Hebron, the largest city in the occupied West Bank. Al-Mohtaseb’s store sells sodas, ceramics, traditional fabrics, and tote bags printed with the images British artist Banksy graffitied on the separation barrier meant to divide Israelis from Palestinians in the West Bank. It also occupies prime real estate, overlooking the sacred site where both Muslims and Jews believe Abraham, the “father of the faithful” is buried. The 58-year-old told TIME on June 26 that settlers backed by an Australian mining magnate once offered $100million for his store and adjoining house. He turned it down, he says. “They called me crazy Abdul.” Kushner too believes monetary incentives can appeal to Palestinians in the occupied territories, judging by the first glimpse at his proposal to resolve the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict. At the “Peace to Prosperity Workshop” in Manama on June 25-26, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law called on private investors from the Gulf and other countries to raise as much as $50 billion over ten years for infrastructure and development projects, including a a transportation link between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. “Today is not about political solutions — we will get to them later,” Kushner said.  But the West Bank’s Ramallah-based leadership boycotted the event, and in a June 27 interview with TIME one of its most senior diplomats called the summit a “conspiracy” aimed at furthering the ambitions of Israelis who would annex the West Bank completely. Kushner’s plan “puts the economic cart before the political horse,” said Husam Zomlot, head of the Palestinian Mission to the U.K, and is “not meant to work.” Instead it is designed “to kill time for Israel to finish off the swallowing and annexing off what is left of the Palestinian occupied territories, while blaming the Palestinians for not riding a dead political horse.” Before his U.K assignment, Ambassador Zomlot had served as head of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) delegation to the United States. But Trump closed the Washington liaison office in September 2018. The White House has moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, cut funding to Palestinian refugees, and signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights—a rocky plateau that the rest of the international community considers part of Southwestern Syria. “All the carrots were taken away and given to Israel. The only stick that is used is against us, the Palestinians,” says Zomlot. Rather than presenting a viable plan for peace, he claims, the Bahrain conference was an opportunity to gift Israel another carrot: normalization of its relations with the Arab world. While neither Israeli nor Palestinian officials attended, state representatives of Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Gulf countries were present. Bahrain granted Israeli journalists—and at least five rabbis—unprecedented permission to visit the tiny Gulf Kingdom. Trump’s senior advisor calls his plan a novel approach to resolving the decades-long conflict, and it succeeded in bringing some powerful international actors to Manama. Attendees at the conference included IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Police said both Graniel and Swank were found dead with multiple gunshot wounds. Swank’s body was found floating facedown 30 feet away from Graniel’s. According to police, the two went fly fishing on Sunday on the San Pedro lagoon. At around 10 a.m. a dark-colored skiff passed by and opened fire, killing both men. On Monday, Belize Police Commissioner Chester Williams told local News 5 that investigations revealed a possible motive for the double homicide might have stemmed from Graniel having a “misunderstanding” with a notorious gang figure in San Pedro. Williams told reporters that Graniel’s home was shot at last Friday and police detained the suspected shooter, but Graniel never showed up to give a report. Williams said police did everything they could to protect Graniel, but “we can’t follow the man everywhere he goes.” “We don’t have a boat to follow him and we can’t put police on every tour guide boat,” Williams said. “We did what we could have done in terms of detaining those who we believe were responsible and maintaining presence in the area where he lived.

710,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner kicked off his much anticipated—and plenty derided—plan to bring peace to the Middle East with a two-day economic workshop in Bahrain. The Palestinians boycotted the event, the Israelis are busy gearing up for another national election in September, and the rest of the world is fixated on rising tensions with Iran and the upcoming do-or-die meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 this weekend. Still, the Bahrain conference went ahead as scheduled. Why It Matters: The political impasse between Israelis and Palestinians has proven to be one of the world’s most intractable problems for the better part of a century. So Kushner opted for a different approach—rather than start with the thorny politics, he wants to start with the economics instead. His proposal is centered on a $50 billion investment push to fund 179 regional infrastructure projects over the next 10 years. Roughly $27.5 billion of that $50 billion will be earmarked for the West Bank and Gaza, with the remainder going to fund projects in Jordan ($7.4 billion), Egypt ($9.1 billion) and Lebanon ($6.3 billion). The hope is that this sudden, sizeable injection of capital will allow the West Bank and Gaza to better access international markets, while also improving basic infrastructure through upgrades to electricity, water and telecommunications infrastructure. This infusion of cash is meant to double Palestinian GDP over the next decade, generate 1 million new jobs, reduce Palestinian unemployment (which the IMF says is currently 30 percent in the West Bank and 50 percent in Gaza) and halve the poverty rate. The plan will also boost business ties in the region, and will help facilitate trade between Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. Crucially, neither Israel nor the US will be on the hook for funding these programs—the point of the Bahrain workshop was to congregate key players in the Arab world and the private sector who will be able to raise the money necessary to make this proposal a reality. To be clear, there is not much new about these proposals themselves—many of the infrastructure programs had already been proposed from other outfits like the World Bank and the Rand Corp. What’s new is that these proposals are being offered separate from the politics—as Kushner said in Bahrain this week “Today is not about the political issues. We’ll get to them at the right time.” That may be Kushner’s hope, but when it comes to pouring billions into the Middle East, investors tend to care about the region’s political trajectory. What Happens Next: While the economic component of Kushner’s Middle East plan is now out in the wild, it won’t gain much traction without the release of a political plan to accompany it. The earliest that’s likely to come is in November, once Israel holds new elections and forms a new government, one which might not even have Bibi Netanyahu at its head (much to the Trump administration’s consternation). But by November, the US presidential race will have kicked off in earnest, making it an especially precarious time for the Trump White House to release a plan that will undoubtedly be among its most politically controversial foreign policy proposals. Expect the Trump team to forge ahead, if only to avoid the criticism that their vaunted Middle East Peace plan never materialized. But by then it will be too late—once the US presidential race kicks into full gear, investors will be waiting to see if Trump even wins reelection before they sign on to such a divisive program. Others will be looking to see if Trump sticks around the Oval Office before signing-on, too. Chief among them are the Saudis and the Emiratis, who will have to tread carefully before publicly supporting a political solution that will eschew the traditional “two-state” framework most are striving towards in favor of a “state-and-a-half” solution that will probably be tilted towards Israeli interests while giving Palestinians more political and economic power, but still fall well short of full sovereignty. Public opinion still matters plenty to these leaders, and a deal that obviously favors Israel over the Palestinians will be difficult for them to publicly endorse.",The Quick Read About… Jared Kushner’s Bahrain Workshop,"June 28, 2019"
711,Rana Ayyub,"On June 22, a viral video did the rounds on social media in India. A young Muslim man tied up, bleeding profusely all over his body, hands folded, was being lynched by a mob that forced him to chant of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Jai Hanuman.’ (Glory to Lord Ram and Lord Hanuman.) The man, later identified as 24-year-old Tabrez Ansari, was beaten for hours until he died at the hands of a Hindu mob in the eastern state of Jharkhand. The death of Ansari, who married less than two months ago and is seen crying and begging for mercy in the video, has sparked protests in cities across India. His family says they were threatened by the police with a similar fate when they begged to get him treated while he was in custody, according to a report in The Wire. Police have arrested at least 11 people over the attack. Ansari became the first victim of hate crime in the second term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. He is survived by a young wife who wants to know who in the country she can now turn to for justice. “My husband was my only support. Who will I live for now? I want justice,” she told the TV channel NDTV. Just two days after the attack on Ansari, a 26-year-old Muslim teacher who taught in a religious seminary was thrown out of a train in the eastern state of West Bengal. Hafeez Mohammed Haldar was traveling when a mob chanted ‘Jai Shri Ram’ ( Glory to Lord Ram) and pushed him out of the train. Hafeez managed to escape death with minor injuries. In the same week, on June 27, a Muslim cab driver, 25-year-old Faizal Usman Khan was beaten up by a group of men at night, barely minutes away from Mumbai, India’s celebrated cosmopolitan city. When Faizal begged for mercy, the men asked him to chant Jai Shri Ram, now a rallying cry for Hindu nationalists in the country. The U.S. Commission for International Human Rights has condemned the lynching of Ansari, observing the recognizable pattern of hate crimes against minorities that marks India’s dangerous slide into a majoritarianism long dreaded by those who have observed Modi’s past on human rights. The USCIRF chairman Tony Perkins called for the Indian government to take action to prevent further violence. “We condemn in the strongest terms this brutal murder, in which the perpetrators reportedly forced Ansari to say Hindu chants as they beat him for hours.”  Soon after Modi was re-elected as the Prime Minister of India on May 23, he gave a conciliatory speech trying to reassure Muslims. But in the five years of Modi’s first term in power, hate crime against Muslims soared; data shows that some 90% of religious hate crimes in the last decade have occurred since Modi came to power. On May 26, in his acceptance speech addressing the members of the new Indian Parliament, Prime Minister Modi vowed to protect the interest of India’s minorities. He made a departure from his consistent dog whistle and told his legislators: “Due to vote bank politics, Indian minorities were crushed, boxed into a corner, subjected to imaginary fears, and exploited during the elections. Like the poor, they remained covered with a cloud of deception. It would have been better if their health, their education had been taken care of. In 2019, I expect you to punch a hole in that deception. We have to earn their trust.”",What a Rising Tide of Violence Against Muslims in India Says About Modi's Second Term,"June 28, 2019"
712,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"President Donald Trump has never been afraid to stir up a tempest, which is why he has already indicated that this weekend he will be discussing the political crisis gripping Hong Kong with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun declared the topic off the table at the Group of 20 summit of world leaders, which convenes today in Osaka, Japan. Trump, however, looks set to raise Hong Kong when he meets with Xi tomorrow for a tête-à-tête on the trade war. “I’m sure this will be among the issues that they discuss,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News Sunday. For Washington, Hong Kong has emerged as the latest potential pressure point in the standoff with the world’s second-largest economy. The semi-autonomous entrepôt has been seized this month by massive protests demanding the cancellation of a controversial bill that would allow extradition to the mainland. The local government says the measure is necessary to prevent the former British colony from becoming a haven for fugitives. Detractors counter that Beijing, which resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, will simply use the law to arrest dissidents and critics. Intense opposition to the bill forced the city’s Beijing-appointed leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, to suspend the legislation, but many in Hong Kong demand its total withdrawal and demonstrations swelled to an estimated two million people on June 16. The fight has since snowballed into a broader struggle for democracy and the preservation of freedoms that differentiate the enclave from China. Protesters in Hong Kong visited several consulates Wednesday hoping to drum up international support ahead of the G20. Some held placards reading “President Trump please liberate Hong Kong.” and “Free H.K. from China colonization.” When they reached the U.S. consulate, protesters handed over a petition asking Trump to “Back Hong Kong at the G20 Summit.” In seizing on the G20 to elevate Hong Kong’s plight, protesters will infuriate Beijing, which insists that all matters related to the semi-autonomous territory are an internal affair. The spectacle of Chinese citizens mobilizing to repudiate the political system exercised in the rest of the country deals a humiliating blow to Xi, who has increasingly proffered up the Chinese model as a viable alternative to Western liberal democracy. “Trump will use Hong Kong protestors’ slogan—‘Liberate us from China’—to tell Xi that the China model is not working. ‘You have a virtual rebellion in a major city in China. Don’t tell me about replacing the Western model with the China model,'” says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Xi has to live with the fact that the rebellion in Hong Kong is one more major defeat for China soft power.” Many already perceive in the U.S.-led West and China-dominated East an ideological schism splitting the world into polarized economic and political spheres. As the rivalry between established and rising superpowers intensifies, Hong Kong, at the crossroads of both East and West, looks caught in the crossfire.",Hong Kong Is a Rebel Enclave in a Sea of Totalitarianism.

713,Madeline Roache,"The liberal ideology that has underpinned Western democracy for decades is “obsolete,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with the Financial Times published Friday. Speaking to the FT on the eve of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, during which world leaders will discuss trade, security and other matters, Putin said “the liberal idea” had “outlived its purpose” and “come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.” Putin, 66, has been Russia’s de facto leader for almost 20 years and has trumpeted the rise of nationalist populism. He has been accused of using financial aid and social media to support populist movements abroad, including during the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections and the recent European Parliament elections, which Putin has vehemently denied. On the topic of tensions between the U.S. and Iran, Putin said the situation has become “explosive.” He attributed the problem to American unilateralism and the lack of rules underpinning world order. Tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalated after Iranian forces shot down a U.S. drone on June 20. Relations between the countries have been deteriorating since Trump decided to withdraw from an international accord that curbed Tehran’s nuclear program. Turning to Russia’s direct relations with the U.S., Putin said he was concerned about the threat of a renewed nuclear arms race. “The cold war was a bad thing … but there were at least some rules that all participants in international communication more or less adhered to or tried to follow,” Putin said. “Now, it seems that there are no rules at all.” Putin took aim at Chancellor Angela Merkel‘s 2015 policy to admit more than one million refugees to Germany, mainly from war-torn Syria, describing it as a “cardinal mistake.” Meanwhile he praised U.S. President Donald Trump for trying to stop migration and drug trafficking from Mexico. Merkel’s decision “presupposes that nothing needs to be done. That migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected,” said Putin. “Every crime must have its punishment. The liberal idea has become obsolete,” he added.","'Liberalism Is Obsolete,' Russian President Vladimir Putin Says Amid G20 Summit","June 28, 2019"
714,Madeleine Albright,"As the leaders of the world’s largest economies convene on Friday in Osaka, Japan, for the 14th G20 Summit, headlines are likely to focus on meetings between world leaders, rather than this year’s themes of sustainable growth, innovation and health. Those talks include ones between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping — though a breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade war is unlikely. A trilateral meeting between India’s Narendra Modi, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Xi will also attract attention. But, while such talks are important, they must not overshadow the larger message of this year’s G20: international cooperation still matters, as do the platforms that facilitate such cooperation. In this era of rising nationalism, institutions such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and NATO have, in many circles, become rhetorical punching bags. Yet the emergence and successes of the G20 indicate that the international system is more resilient and flexible than most people tend to assume. As a former U.S. Secretary of State and a former Foreign Minister of Argentina, which hosted last year’s G20 summit at the end of November, we see the G20 as a critical platform for international cooperation. Through the Aspen Ministers Forum, a network of former foreign ministers, we have been working on an initiative to reform the international system to meet new challenges. Adaptable institutions such as the G20 are at the heart of this effort. Founded in 1999 as a forum for finance ministers to consider responses to—and ways to prevent—global economic crises, the G20 brings together major economic powers and key developing countries. After the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the G20 expanded its agenda and established leaders’ summits. Since then, G20 Summits have been used as a time for heads of state to discuss the most pressing global challenges, from terror attacks in Paris to the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the Eurozone debt crisis. Responding to crises is at the very core of the G20. In Osaka, there will be important discussions about the global impact of the U.S.-China trade conflict, North Korea’s nuclear program and tensions in the Gulf. But given the troubling headwinds facing the current rules-based order, there is a need to go beyond crisis management and towards consensus-building at the Osaka Summit. This is especially true for three issues that cannot be addressed by any country acting alone: trade, climate change, and the digital economy. Given its founding mandate, the G20 is well-suited for a discussion of trade. This year, reform of the World Trade Organization is on the agenda at Osaka. Trade is a positive-sum exercise, lowering prices, increasing the variety of goods available and generally raising the quality of life. But the current system of global trade is under siege as many countries, but most notably the United States, are introducing and increasing tariffs. This slide into unilateralism and protectionism is endangering the global economy and undermining the WTO’s ability to enforce a common set of rules. While tariffs pose short-term threats to economic growth, climate change poses an existential long-term threat to all countries. In the face of this pressing danger, the current U.S. Administration stands shamefully alone. At last year’s G20 Summit in Argentina, all G20 countries except the United States reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Climate Accord. While this is unlikely to change in Osaka, the G20 remains a useful mechanism for raising awareness, maintaining pressure and building sustained commitment for action on climate change.",This Year’s G20 Summit Is a Major Test of International Cooperation in a Trying Time,"June 28, 2019"
715,Hillary Leung,"In a video appeal, a Hong Kong pro-democracy party urged world leaders assembling today at the G20 Summit to push China on a controversial bill that has ignited a political crisis in the semiautonomous enclave. Joshua Wong, the international face of Hong Kong’s democracy movement, published the video on his Facebook page Thursday. He and two other members of his Demosisto political party appealed to the foreign nations in English, Japanese and German. “Hong Kong has always been a safe harbor from China’s abusive system, but now the ‘World City’ is under threat,” Demosisto member Agnes Chow says in Japanese in the video, which includes trilingual subtitles. The video comes as millions of Hong Kong residents have taken to the streets this month over an extradition bill that has now been suspended but that protesters want altogether scrapped. They blocked roads and stormed the justice secretary’s office on Thursday in the latest bout of unrest. The demonstrators are hoping to use the G20 summit in Japan over the weekend to elevate the plight of Hong Kong, and get the political crisis put on the agenda. Earlier in the week, protesters ran a marathon circuit of foreign consulates, including those of the U.S., U.K., Japan and France, soliciting their backing in the push for greater political freedom in the city. As night fell, as many as 10,000 rallied at City Hall while representatives read out calls for the withdrawal of the bill in Korean, French, Spanish and other languages of the G20 nations. Beijing has said it would not tolerate discussions of the topic at the summit. “The upcoming G20 summit and the meetings between political leaders and [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping] are a key opportunity to address the hard line policy from Beijing to Hong Kong,” Wong Yik-mo, a Demosisto member and vice-convener of the group that organized the City Hall demonstration, says in the video appeal. “We implore citizens of the world to deliver our concerns to your government.” Though Hong Kong’s leader has indefinitely suspended the extradition bill, protestors continue to take to the streets to demand a full withdrawal, as well as an independent investigation into the police’s use of tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators on June 12 and a retraction of the government’s characterization of some protestors as rioters. In a separate call to action, Demosisto co-founder and former lawmaker Nathan Law urged President Donald Trump to broach Hong Kong’s struggle when he meets with Xi in G20.",Hong Kong Protesters Release a Video Appeal to World Leaders Meeting at the G20 Summit,"June 28, 2019"
716,Hillary Leung,"The Dalai Lama says U.S President Donald Trump has a “lack of moral principle” and should take global responsibility instead of putting America first. Speaking with the BBC ahead of his 84th birthday, the Tibetan spiritual leader said Trump was “emotional” and “a little bit too complicated.” He told the BBC that “One day [Trump] says something, another day he says something [else],” adding “I think, lack of moral compass.” The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India since fleeing Tibet during a failed uprising against the Chinese government 60 years ago, also chided Trump’s foreign policy. “When he became president, he expressed America first. That is wrong. America should take global responsibility,” the spiritual leader said. In a March interview with TIME, the Dalai Lama said that Trump’s “America first” policy made him “uncomfortable.” The exiled leader’s criticism of Trump, who he said has not requested a meeting with him, is a departure from his cordial relationships with past U.S. presidents. He has been received by every president since meeting George H. W. Bush at the White House in 1991. The Dalai Lama also had warm encounters with Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and most recently, Barack Obama, whom he had a number of closed-door meetings with and called “a powerful example of what it means to practice compassion.” Besides speaking on Trump, the Dalai Lama also weighed in on other topics, including Europe’s migrant crisis. “Keep Europe for Europeans,” he said, adding that the E.U. should provide education and training for refugees but that they should then return to “their own land.”",The Dalai Lama Says President Donald Trump Is 'Emotional' and Has a 'Lack of Moral Principle',"June 28, 2019"
717,Rachel E. Greenspan,"It’s official: the newest members of the royal family are headed to Africa for a trip this fall. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex will make their first official tour as a family, and the first major working trip for Meghan Markle since giving birth to royal baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor last month. The royals announced the news on their Instagram page — as is tradition — on Thursday. “The Duke and Duchess are really looking forward to meeting so many of you on the ground and continuing to raise awareness of the high impact work local communities are doing across the commonwealth and beyond,” the Sussex Royal caption said. The caption closed by noting that it will be their “first official tour as a family,” suggesting that royal baby Archie would join along during the trip. The couple did not announce when exactly the tour begins. In another post shared earlier on Thursday, the Duke of Sussex commented on a partnership between National Geographic and the government of Angola to protect the nation’s habitat and environment. Prince Harry, who has had a special connection with Southern African nations since he was a boy, said in the post’s caption that “uncontrolled fires, the bushmeat trade, unsustainable harvesting of the forest and rapid biodiversity loss are already destroying this incredible and delicate landscape.” It continued: “This is our one and only chance to save this magnificent last Eden.” Prince Harry and Meghan last took a big trip in October of 2018, when they headed to Fiji to meet leaders. During that tour, the Duchess highlighted her feminist passions by meeting “people involved in women’s empowerment,” Kensington Palace wrote in a tweet at the time. During the visit to Fiji, the Duchess gave a speech about women’s rights, saying that affording girls the right to education is “vital” in developing countries.

718,Madeline Roache,"Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Georgia’s capital city Tbilisi since June 20 in protest against Russian interference, the largest demonstrations in over seven years. Shouting “Russia is an occupier” and burning photos of Russian President Vladimir Putin, demonstrators gathered outside the parliament one week ago. In response, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested 300 people. More than 240 people were injured, according to officials, including at least two people who lost their eyesight. “I remember trying to stop my brother from being hit by a police officer, but I couldn’t see anything because of the gas, then out of nowhere a baton slammed into my face,” Irakli Khvadagiani, who has a large bruise on his eye, tells TIME by Skype. “Police were punching and kicking the crowds. It was scary to see how close they were shooting people with rubber bullets.”  The 31 year-old academic researcher was arrested early on June 21 and taken to holding cell for two days, which was “overloaded with other protestors,” he says.  Here’s what to know about the protests: Protests began after Sergei Gavrilov, a member of Russia’s lower house of parliament, took the chair of an inter-parliamentary session between Orthodox Christian lawmakers on June 20. It angered the opposition, which sees the current Georgian government as overly friendly to Russian interests. “It symbolizes the failure of our government to stand up to Russia, which is still our biggest challenge today,” Khvadagiani says. Anti-Russian sentiment runs strong among the Georgian population. The two countries have had no formal diplomatic ties since the 2008 war, which lasted five days and killed hundreds of soldiers and civilians on both sides. After crushing Georgia’s army, Russia propped up South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states where it stationed permanent military bases. This area makes up one-fifth of Georgian territory. Tbilisi and Western allies have denounced Russia’s actions as “illegal military occupation.”  Because they see it as being too close to Russia. Since 2012, the government has been led by Georgian Dream, which has sought to restore pragmatic and economic relations with Russia. Last year, on the 10th anniversary of the war, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said that improvements in economic relations and tourism would also ultimately lead to normalization of “political ties and resume full-scale dialogue between Moscow and Tbilisi.”",Georgians Have Now Been Protesting Russian Interference for a Week.

720,Karl Vick,"Personal business is what’s brought the President of Rwanda to Manhattan. Paul Kagame’s daughter is graduating from Columbia University with a master’s degree in international affairs. “I probably will have to come back in two weeks again,” Kagame says of his U.S. visit, in a room in the Park Hyatt, half a block south of Central Park. “My son is graduating from Williams College.” His country, meanwhile, is marking an anniversary. It was 25 years ago that some 1 million Rwandans were murdered, a genocide that went unchecked by Western governments. The slaughter lasted until guerrilla forces led by Kagame drove the killers from the country that he has ruled since–six years in the de facto capacity of Vice President and since 2000 as President. The trauma still defines Rwanda, not least in the minds of foreigners. “We live kind of under that shadow,” Kagame says, adding, in the abstract terms he prefers, “It is just one set of narratives built around a geographically small country in the heart of the continent of Africa. They may not even bother to know where it is or even what it is.” What Rwanda is, even before the genocide, is an unusual parcel of East Africa: made up entirely of hills, with a population of 12 million extremely organized from the center outward–prefecture, commune, sector. The genocidaires used that organization to mobilize the slaughter by ethnic Hutu extremists against the ethnic Tutsi minority. That organization survived the genocide and in the quarter-century since has reported to Kagame. What has he done with it? It depends on whom you ask. “Twenty-five years on, we have built a stable society, a stable economy,” Kagame says. “We are developing. Everything is still a work in progress, but you can measure and understand where we have been and where we are now.” The measures are impressive. Since 1990, life expectancy has risen from 48 years to 66, and the mortality rate for children under 5 dropped from 152 per 1,000 live births to 42. The country remains poor, but Kagame’s government is trying to position it as something exceptional in Africa–a place to do business. It ranks 29th in a World Bank survey assessing the business environments of 190 nations. And Rwanda has made striking progress when it comes to gender parity: 61% of its legislators are women, higher than in any other country. The World Economic Forum says only five countries have more significantly narrowed their gaps. But in other ways, Kagame’s government fulfills the cliché of governance in Africa, where the watchdog organization Freedom House says only 20% of nations qualify as “free.” Rwanda is essentially a single-party state, dominated by the Rwandan Patriotic Front and with Kagame in the role of indispensable man. Under the constitution, revised four years ago, he can serve until 2034.","Is Rwanda's Paul Kagame a Strongman, a Technocrat, or Something in Between?","June 27, 2019"
721,W.J. Hennigan,"When a U.S. Navy surveillance drone was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz on June 20, the U.S. blamed Iran. The commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said his country was “ready for war,” and President Donald Trump responded by declaring that Iran had made a “very big mistake.” Around the world, observers worried that the two countries were headed for battle. In a sense, however, they were already at war. Also on June 20, the U.S. military conducted a Trump-approved cyberstrike on Iran-linked computer systems, U.S. officials say; two days later, the Department of Homeland Security reported it had seen a “rise in malicious cyber activity” directed at U.S. industry by hackers with Tehran ties. These were the latest moves in a rapidly escalating cyberconflict that is proving to be a test run in the future of war. Compared with a potential military clash over the drone’s destruction, the little noticed computer skirmish may seem reassuring. But if it was an off-ramp from the highway to airstrikes and invasion, it also posed new dangers of its own. There are no international rules governing digital conflict; tracing attacks is notoriously difficult, and targets can include industry, infrastructure and ordinary citizens. “There is not even an agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a cyber ‘act of war,’ assuming the term itself is still relevant,” former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper tells TIME. The U.S. has powerful capabilities in this new area. Military hackers and coders at Fort Meade, Md., maintain a long list of potential targets. The command, created in 2009, has played a larger role in war planning since the Trump Administration granted commanders new authority and Congress quietly issued a declaration defining online operations as a traditional military activity. The U.S. military refused to comment on the latest offensive, after Yahoo News first reported that hackers with U.S. Cyber Command had taken aim at computers belonging to a spy group connected to the IRGC. Subsequent reports revealed U.S. attacks on networks belonging to a proxy militia and military missile-launch systems. But Iranian officials said they failed, and cybersecurity firms say Tehran-linked hackers retaliated by increasing attacks on U.S. networks. Such attacks have been going on for more than a decade, mostly for espionage. But cyberacts hold potential for physical destruction. It is believed that the U.S. and Israel teamed together on a cyberattack in 2010 that briefly disabled spinning centrifuges at a uranium-enrichment facility in the Iranian city of Natanz, and in 2016, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York indicted an Iranian, Hamid Firoozi, for hacking into the control system of a dam near New York City. A 2018 report by Collin Anderson and Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described the evolving risks, noting “legitimate reasons to be concerned” that Iran is readying for a world in which such actions are part of its wartime toolbox. The U.S. is worried that those preparations are about to pay off. Since it walked away from the 2015 six-nation deal to curb Iran’s nuclear-weapons program, the Trump Administration has continued to ratchet up its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran, imposing ever tougher economic sanctions. That, experts like Georgetown University professor Trita Parsi say, prompted Iran’s latest series of attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf. As the U.S. runs out of economic pressure to apply and Trump balks at the costs of a new military conflict in the Middle East, cyberspace seems like the inevitable next arena of conflict.   For now, the costs of cyberwar have gone largely unnoticed. But a series of ransomware attacks, in which hackers lock their victims out of computer networks until they pay up, have stung the U.S. A recent breach cost the city of Baltimore $18 million to regain control of its data, and attacks on institutions such as hospitals, schools and local police endanger public safety.",The U.S. and Iran Are Already at War Online,"June 27, 2019"
722,Ian Bremmer,"In March, Turkish opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu defeated Binali Yildirim, the candidate of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, by about 13,000 votes to claim victory in the race to become Istanbul’s mayor. The exceptionally narrow margin in a city of 15 million people gave Erdogan cover to demand an election rerun. On June 23, Istanbul voted again, and Imamoglu won again–this time by about 800,000 votes. It was a stunning rebuke for Erdogan, himself once Istanbul’s mayor, and a clear signal that many in Turkey’s largest city are fed up with the man who has dominated the country since 2003. In the process, voters have proved once again that while Erdogan may continue to reach for Putin-like powers, Turkey is not Russia. It’s a legitimate multiparty democracy with genuinely contested elections. After triggering the second vote, the President campaigned vigorously for his party’s candidate and used his government’s tight grip on Turkey’s media to ensure favorable coverage. Despite that advantage, his demand for a do-over transformed a loss by 0.16% of the vote into a 9-percentage-point blowout. Given that margin, Erdogan had little choice except to publicly acknowledge the result, but he’s unlikely to truly accept such a stinging political defeat. Over many years in power, he has demonstrated an instinct for responding to political setbacks with a more emphatic power grab. In this case, he’s likely to use the courts to strip powers from Istanbul’s mayor’s office and shift them to the central government. With a weak economy and contentious relations with the U.S., Erdogan is likely to double down on his confrontational nationalist agenda. His greatest vulnerability comes from Turkey’s feeble economy. During his first years in power, Erdogan earned credit for good economic times. Emboldened by this success, his party promised in 2012 that Turkey’s per capita income would climb to $25,000 by 2023. The IMF estimates that 2018 per capita income stood at about $8,700. Turkey’s gap between rich and poor is one of the widest in the world. Erdogan will face two major potential challenges in coming months. First, an emboldened opposition and an assertive President may bring large numbers of protesters into the streets of Istanbul and other Turkish cities, particularly if Erdogan is seen as interfering with the city’s government. In 2013, a demonstration that began with a few people protesting urban overdevelopment led to an Erdogan-ordered crackdown that resulted in injuries and deaths. Those Gezi Park protests became a national phenomenon, involving as many as 2.5 million people across 79 of the country’s 81 provinces. Six years later, the conditions for a repeat of large-scale unrest–urban residents infuriated with an aggressive leader–remain. Erdogan’s more immediate worry comes from political challenges within his own party. The election embarrassment in Istanbul will encourage former Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and former Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan to establish new political parties of their own, giving disillusioned supporters new options. Thanks in part to support from former President Abdullah Gul, Babacan is the candidate most likely to draw votes away from Erdogan. Recep Tayyip Erdogan has proved himself over 16 years in power to be one of the world’s most resilient and resourceful politicians, but now he is about to be truly tested–and Turkey with him.

Temperatures have climbed above 104°F in much of western Europe, far outstripping the comfortable weather normally enjoyed in the region at this time of year. France recorded its highest-ever temperature, of 114.6°F , in the southern town of Gallargues-le-Montueux on Friday afternoon. The country’s previous record was 111.4°F, set during a heatwave in August 2003. The previous record for June, set in the same year, was 107°F. Germany also broke its record for June, with 101.5 °F recorded in the town of Coschen near the Polish border on Wednesday. The country’s previous June record, of 101.3 °F, had been set in 1947 – a measure of how unusual this level of heat is in the region. In Spain’s Catalonia region, the first wildfire of the summer broke out Wednesday night near the town of Torre de l’Espanyol, quickly becoming the region’s worst in 20 years. It had burned an estimated 5,700 hectares by Friday morning according to local media. Investigators say the cause may have been a “badly managed” pile of manure that self-combusted. Hundreds of firefighters are battling the blaze.

724,Gina Martinez,"Police in Barbados are searching for a New Jersey couple who went out to sea on a jet ski and never returned. Oscar Suarez, 32 and Magdalena Devil, 25, were staying at the Discovery Bay Hotel about nine miles from the capital of Bridgetown, according to the Royal Barbados Police Force. Police said that on Monday afternoon, the couple rented a jet ski from an operator at nearby Holetown Beach. According to the operator, the pair were both wearing life jackets when they boarded the jet ski. When the couple did not return after half an hour, the operator became worried and contacted other operators in the area to carry out a search, police said. The Barbados Police Marine Unit and the Barbados Coast Guard performed a search of the area, but did not find the couple or the jet ski, police said. Police also checked the couple’s room at the Discovery Bay Hotel and found that they had not returned. Police said Suarez and Devil arrived on the island on June 22 and had been scheduled to return home a week later. Barbados police confirmed to TIME that they have contacted at least one family member and are working with the U.S. Embassy. Police added that they are still conducting aerial and sea search in an attempt to find the pair. The Royal Barbados Police Force are asking anyone with information to contact the nearest police station or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-TIPS (8477).

Mette Frederiksen, 41, was able to form a left-wing coalition government led by her Social Democrat party after three weeks of negotiations.  “Now we have reached the goal … we have shown that when Danes vote as they have done, a new majority can turn their hopes into actions,” said Frederiksen. Denmark’s election on June 5 saw support for the Social Democrats decline slightly, but the coalition of left-wing parties won a clear majority, prompting the resignation of conservative Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen. The right-wing nationalist Danish People’s Party (DPP), which had been the country’s second largest party, lost more than half its votes compared with 2015. The party made headlines during the campaign after demanding the deportation of Muslims. Denmark is the third Nordic country to form a leftist government, after Social Democrats came into power in Finland and Sweden earlier this year. As in the rest of Europe, immigration was a key issue in the election. Frederiksen campaigned in favor of strict controls on refugees and asylum seekers, a measure that was seen as a necessity to win back votes from the DPP.

727,Ian King and Jenny Leonard / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — American technology companies have resumed selling certain products to Huawei Technologies Co. after concluding there are legal ways to work with the Chinese telecom giant in spite of its inclusion on a Trump Administration blacklist. Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. maker of computer memory chips, said on Tuesday that it had started shipping some components to Huawei after its lawyers studied export restrictions. Intel Corp., the largest microprocessor maker, has also begun selling to Huawei again, according to a person familiar with the matter. It’s not clear how many other suppliers have reached the same conclusion. The U.S. Commerce Department added Huawei last month to what’s known as an entity list, a move designed to bar the Chinese company from buying American components and software. The Trump Administration said Huawei helps Beijing in espionage and represents a security threat — charges the company denies. Officials at Commerce and the White House are frustrated that companies have resumed Huawei shipments, according to another person familiar with the matter. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The chipmakers are taking advantage of certain exceptions to the export restrictions. Even when companies have headquarters in the U.S., they may be able, through ownership of overseas subsidiaries and operations, to classify their technology as foreign, according to Cross Research analyst Steven Fox. If less than 25% of the technology in a chip originates in the U.S., for example, then it may not be covered by the ban, under current rules. “It took them weeks to figure this out,” Fox said. “What they did was look at the laws and the rules and applied them to their business.” Shares in Asian chipmakers from Tokyo Electron Ltd. to SK Hynix Inc. rose Wednesday, after Micron reported results ahead of estimates. Micron was up 9.2% at 6:47 a.m. in New York during pre-market trading. Micron has operations all over the world, some added through acquisitions, and it owns plants in Singapore, Japan and Taiwan. Intel has factories in China and Ireland and a major design center and production facility in Israel. The company declined to comment. Companies like Micron and Intel can legally continue some shipments to Huawei under what’s known as the de minimis rule, says Kevin Wolf, former head of the Commerce Department’s export control section. The de minimis threshold is 25%, according to the Commerce Department. “Commodities made overseas from U.S.-origin technology are only subject to the entity list prohibitions if the technology and commodity are sensitive items controlled for ‘national security’ reasons,” Wolf said. “But a commodity made overseas from less sensitive U.S.-origin technology is not subject to the entity list prohibitions.”",U.S. Companies Are Finding Ways to Work Around Trump’s Huawei Blacklist,"June 26, 2019"
728,Rebecca Collard,"When Iranian state television broadcast images of the destroyed U.S. spy drone it shot down over the strait of Hormuz it served two purposes. One was intended to prove the RQ-4 Global Hawk had illegally entered Iranian airspace, contradicting U.S. claims the $170 million unmanned aircraft had been flying in international airspace. The other was to display Iran’s impressive anti-aircraft capabilities. The RQ-4 Global Hawk is one of the U.S.’s most sophisticated intelligence-gathering devices. It can peer into countries from outside their borders and is able to fly as high as 60,000 feet, a greater altitude than many fighter jets. Yet Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRCG) was able to detect it, and shoot it down with a surface-to-air missile fired by the Iranian-made Khordad 3 air defense system. As tensions continue to escalate in the Persian Gulf, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that if war breaks out with Iran “You’re not going to need an exit strategy. I don’t need exit strategies.” But that could be underestimation of the cost of war with one of the Middle East’s most powerful militaries, which has well-equipped allies and proxies across the region. Iran is estimated to have around 700,000 military and security forces, according to a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report from May. That includes about 350,000 regular ground troops. But it was the parallel forces of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard, which number around 130,000, that took credit for downing the RQ-4 Global Hawk. The US has also accused the IRGC of carrying out attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Iran’s military arsenal is significant enough to defend itself against its neighbors, but no match for the U.S. might in conventional warfare. However, the country’s significant and seemingly advanced surface-to-air missile (SAM) capabilities would complicate U.S. airwar attempts.",War With Iran Might Be More Costly Than Trump Thinks,"June 26, 2019"
729,TIME Staff,"Protesters in Hong Kong Wednesday directly solicited foreign backing for their push for greater political freedom, in a bold move that is certain to draw the ire of Beijing. Several hundred protesters gathered in the heart of the former British colony’s business district, wearing t-shirts reading “Liberate Hong Kong.” They then marched on the consulates of G20 nations, including those of the U.S., U.K., Japan and France, and handed over letters asking for the plight of Hong Kong to be raised at the G20 summit in Osaka at the weekend. In the evening, thousands gathered for a rally outside the City Hall, chanting “Free Hong Kong! Democracy now!” and carrying placards that read “Give me back my freedom.” The crowds stretched to the towering International Finance Centre, almost a kilometer away, and spilled over into Lung Wo Road, blocking westbound traffic during the evening rush hour on one of Hong Kong’s main waterfront thoroughfares. Organizers of the evening demonstration, the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), said it was held so that the people of Hong Kong could “sincerely urge” G20 leaders, “including Xi Jinping,” to consider the enclave’s desire for genuine self-rule.  Addressing the crowds packed into Edinburgh Place, the CHRF’s vice-convenor Wong Yik-mo said: “We are telling the Hong Kong government, the Beijing government and people of the world that we deserve freedom and democracy.” After the rally, around a thousand people marched to police headquarters and surrounded the building, daubing it with obscene graffiti, barricading entrances, and hurling abuse at officers inside. The tense standoff lasted into the early hours and is a repeat of the siege of the building that took place last Friday. Many are angry at what they claim is heavy-handed suppression of earlier protests by the police. The U.K. said Tuesday it would suspend sales of tear gas to the Hong Kong police until an independent investigation into the allegations is made. Earlier in the day, protesters at the U.S. consulate held signs reading “President Trump please liberate Hong Kong.” One carried a placard asking for Hong Kong to be freed from Chinese “colonization.”",'Save Hong Kong from China!'

730,"Kate Krader, Joanna Ossinger and Richard Vines / Bloomberg","Mirazur in Menton, France, is the No. 1 restaurant in the world. This is the first time chef Mauro Colagreco and his sunny Provencal dining room have clinched the top spot; previously the restaurant was No. 3. This is also the first time France has gotten the No. 1 spot since the awards began 18 years ago. That’s in part because executives behind the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list made a profound change to the rules this year, decreeing that no previous winner can be No. 1 again—or even be ranked on the list. Previous winners have now been relegated to a “Best of the Best” category. That includes Osteria Francescana, Massimo Bottura’s modernist restaurant in Modena, which has won the award twice; Eleven Madison Park, which took the top spot in 2017; El Cellar de Can Roca; and the original Noma. But the 2.0 version of Noma, which is set in a different location in Copenhagen with a new menu format, is eligible for the top spot and in fact skyrocketed to the No. 2 place on the list. William Drew, group editor of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, says the criteria they used, which included location and menu concept, was not just to allow Noma, one of the world’s highest-profile dining spots, to be in contention. “The aim is to have an objective set of criteria that prevails over time,” he says. Leading up to the announcement, which took place in Singapore on the evening of June 25 before an audience, Noma was an insider favorite to clinch the top spot. The Best of the Best is a convenient landing place for some formerly top-ranked restaurants that have been falling on the list, like the Fat Duck in Bray, England, which last year came in at No. 74. Nonetheless, chef/owner Heston Blumenthal is sanguine about the experience: “If you get on the list, lap it up, bathe in the warmth of it, but just do your work. Nothing is permanent.” Mirazur sits at the foot of a mountain and is housed in a 1930s building looking out over the sea, just inside France’s border with Italy. The Argentine-born chef draws inspiration from the region, serving vegetables from his own gardens and other local produce to create colorful Mediterranean dishes. Colagreco’s signature creation is oyster with tapioca, shallot cream and pear. The lunch menu costs 160 euros ($180), while the full menu is 260 euros. “What a great year. Three Michelin stars and No. 1 all in the same year,” said Colagreco while accepting the award. “It’s a year I shall remember forever. I don’t have words to explain.

731,James Stavridis,"When oil tankers were bombed in the Persian Gulf two weeks ago, my thoughts turned to the summer of 1987 when I sailed through the narrow Strait of Hormuz for the first time as the Operations Officer in a brand-new Navy Cruiser, the U.S.S. Valley Forge. She was the fourth of the vaunted AEGIS-class guided missile cruisers, and our job was to protect the aircraft carrier carrying the admiral in command of our forces in the Arabian Gulf. Like today, tensions were elevated with Iran as a result of their attacks on merchant shipping, carried out largely through dumping mines in international waters – part of the so-called “Tanker War.” Several oil tankers were hit, passage through the Strait was problematic, and the international community sought to keep the Strait open to allow some 30% of the world’s oil that moves through it. That became the Navy’s mission. Over the next 18 months, a reasonably effective convoy system was put in place, but more tankers hit mines and were attacked by Iranian gunboats, further elevating tensions. By spring 1988, the U.S. had attacked the Iranian Navy, sinking several warships and destroying naval bases in Operation Praying Mantis. While we have not had equally active combat with Iran over the three decades since, the US Navy has continued to have a very troubled relationship with both the Iranian Navy and the maritime arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Since that summer, I deployed five more times to the Arabian Gulf, and have sailed in and out of the Strait of Hormuz in command of destroyers, cruisers, and a carrier strike group as a Rear Admiral. It is dangerous, stressful and exhausting duty for our sailors. While President Donald Trump correctly called off the strike against Iran last week over collateral damage concerns, the US warships in the Gulf remain at the highest state of readiness and combat alert. Led by the massive nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, the current strike group will be prepared to resume offensive operations if diplomacy does not work. They will also be keenly aware of their vulnerabilities to Iranian attack, and will be taking significant steps to repulse anything that manifests hostile intent toward them. The crews of those warships, from the Admiral on the carrier’s Flag Bridge to the youngest sailors in the depths of the engineering plant, would have known a strike was about to be launched. Having a launch pulled back at literally the last moments is rare. While we do very occasionally stop strikes due to collateral damage concerns — and we should — it always creates further uncertainty in crews already poised on the edge of combat. All of that adds to the tension. The Iranians have a highly capable asymmetric warfare capability, meaning they know they cannot match the pure firepower of a US strike group – with its 80+ combat aircraft, hundreds of long-range cruise missiles, and sophisticated air and subsurface defensive systems. Instead, they will focus on smaller, less expensive systems that can attack the warships in ways that potentially could spoof the high-powered US systems designed for major combat against a peer force. These Iranian systems include using mines, both floating and implanted by special forces (as they did against half-a-dozen tankers over the past six weeks); launching “swarm” attacks by small, high-speed gunboats, often with surface-to-surface missiles; employing stealthy, diesel powered submarines which are very quiet, hard to detect, and carry torpedoes; or barrages of cruise missiles capable of being launched in a concentrated attack at a single US warship. Each of the U.S. ships, including the carrier, will have a high percentage of the crew up and at combat stations around the clock. While simply remaining at General Quarters 24/7 (everyone at their battle stations) is tempting, it simply burns out the crew too quickly. So the ships will be at a modified level of battle station manning, rotating for rest periods. Maintaining the highest level of surveillance around the surface of the ocean, below it, and in the air will be at the top of the crew’s priority list. This will be accomplished by linking into the vast U.S. satellite surveillance system; tapping into Iranian command and control via cyber work of the National Security Agency; relying on the U.S. intelligence community (including the CIA) for human intelligence “tippers;” and employing all the organic sensors of the strike group itself. This means flying surveillance aircraft on long patrols; sending out helicopters with sonar systems that dip into the water and listen for Iranian submarines; using the sophisticated radars on all the warships, especially the AEGIS ships; and listening with sophisticated electronic warfare receivers to pick up an early indication of Iranian fire control radars being employed. The cat-and-mouse games in the Arabian Gulf will continue in the weeks and months to come as both sides attempt to position their maritime forces advantageously to conduct both offensive and defensive operations. The US holds an additional advantage in that we have a network of allies and bases in the region (in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Bahrain – the latter being the home of the headquarters of the Navy’s Fifth Fleet). We also have a long history of naval operations in the region, as well as more pure firepower at sea. But we cannot underestimate the danger of Iran, which likewise has deep experience in this type of operation, a highly motivated naval force, extensive bases on their own territory, and a sense of anger over the US sanctions which are crippling their economy. On every US warship, the officers and crew understand the danger and the importance of their work. They are well aware of the decades of tension with Iran, and the Navy’s long and proud history in the Gulf. In their few hours off watch, they see the political and diplomatic twists and turns on CNN like other Americans back home. But for them, the stakes are deeply personal and very high indeed.

Bellavia is the only living serviceman to receive the honor for fighting in the Iraq War. The ceremony was held at the White House in front of some of members of his squad that he fought with 15 years ago. “David, today we honor your extraordinary courage, we salute your selfless service and we thank you for carrying on the legacy of American valor that has always made our blessed nation the strongest and mightiest anywhere in the world,” *Trump said. TIME featured Bellavia in a cover story in November 2004 with a first-person account of Bellavia’s platoon being ambushed during operation Phantom Fury in Fallujah. The cover story was written by Michael “Mick” Ware, a war correspondent and documentary filmmaker, who was there with Bellavia during much of the action. Ware’s story was part of the testimony that was used in Bellavia’s Medal of Honor nomination. Ware also filmed most of the battle, which appeared in his 2015 documentary Only the Dead.  He will be at the ceremony Tuesday where President Donald Trump presents Bellavia with the Medal of Honor. Only five others have received the Medal of Honor for their actions in the Iraq War.

733,Ciara Nugent,"For more than four months, Haitians have been taking to the streets to demand the resignation of President Jovenel Moïse amid allegations he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars of government funds earmarked for badly needed social programs. A damning report on government corruption, delivered to the Haitian senate by official auditors on May 31, has triggered fresh demonstrations, with thousands marching through the capital, Port au Prince, and other cities throughout June. On June 20, a delegation from the Organization of American States traveled to Haiti in hopes of “[lowering] the political temperature,” an official told the Miami Herald. One government program, PetroCaribe, is at the center of the 600-page report––and protesters’ anger. Under PetroCaribe, a strategic oil alliance signed with nearby Venezuela in 2006, Haiti––the poorest country in the Americas––saved precious dollars by borrowing fuel from its oil-rich neighbor and deferring payment for up to 25 years. Governments were supposed to use the extra money to develop the economy and fund social programs. Instead, at least $2 billion (equivalent to almost a quarter of Haiti’s total economy for 2017) went missing and Haitians saw few of the promised benefits, according to protesters and local media. Haitian taxpayers still owe Venezuela billions of dollars for the borrowed oil. The scandal has become a rallying cry for anti-corruption activists, many of whom call themselves PetroChallengers. Here’s what to know about PetroCaribe and how it helped spark Haiti’s protests. Venezuela’s former president Hugo Chávez set up PetroCaribe in 2005. Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves and in the mid-2000’s, long before its current economic collapse, the country was producing around 2.5 million barrels of oil per day. Chávez wanted to convert those resources into greater regional influence and win allies against the U.S. in the Organization of American States.  The PetroCaribe program was effectively a way for Venezuela to give other countries development loans––except it loaned oil instead of cash. Venezuela’s state oil company sold oil to Haiti and 17 other Caribbean countries and allowed them to defer payment on 40% of what they bought for up to 25 years, charging a low rate of interest for the debt. Recipient governments then sold that oil and used the proceeds to pay for social programs. With global oil prices at record levels in the early years of the program, the oil sales generated a lot of cash. The program suffered after Venezuela’s economy began to break down in 2014, as a drop in the oil price laid bare the effects of years of corruption and mismanagement. Venezuela’s oil production is down to 830,000 barrels a day and it stopped fulfilling its PetroCaribe commitments to Haiti last year, Reuters reports. Haiti is “one of the most vulnerable members” of the PetroCaribe agreement, according to analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit and it is now suffering fuel shortages as a result of the program’s decline.",Why a Venezuelan Oil Program Is Fueling Massive Street Protests in Haiti,"June 24, 2019"
734,Joseph Hincks / Istanbul,"Turkish opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu won a landslide victory in Istanbul’s re-run mayoral elections June 23, inflicting a heavy defeat on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose rise to power began with winning the city’s mayorship in 1994 and who has said “whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey.” What might have been a contest over garbage collection and municipal budget management became a “fight for democracy” after “the people’s freedom was robbed,” Imamoglu told TIME in a pre-election interview Friday. In a speech shortly after the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) candidate Binali Yildirim conceded defeat Sunday evening, Imamoglu congratulated his supporters on a “victory for Turkish democracy in front of the whole world.” Imamoglu, a soft-spoken 49-year-old, narrowly won Istanbul’s March 31 municipal elections, breaking the AKP’s quarter-century hold on the city by a margin of about 14,000 votes, or 0.16% of the total. But the new mayor’s tenure lasted just 18 days before Turkey’s Supreme Election Council annulled the result, citing irregularities at the ballot box in a decision critics claim was ordered by Erdogan. Indeed, European Union lawmaker Guy Verhofstadt called the cancellation a sign that “Erdogan’s Turkey is drifting towards a dictatorship.” Turkey’s municipal contest was to be a relatively minor political event compared with the country’s 2018 general elections and the 2017 referendum that handed Erdogan sweeping powers. But shock AKP losses in Istanbul and Ankara were widely seen as an indictment against the President’s economic stewardship of Turkey, which entered recession in late 2018 after 17 years of nearly uninterrupted economic growth under the AKP. Losing Istanbul again after having staked so much political capital on the re-run could be “the beginning of the end” for Erdogan, said Gonul Tol, Director of the Middle East Institute’s Center for Turkish Studies, days before the election. Two days before Istanbul went to the polls, Imamoglu sat for interviews at a hotel in the city’s upscale Sisli neighborhood, breaking occasionally to pose for photographs with supporters who held up soccer shirts bearing his name. Grinning into the camera, Imamoglu’s fans quoted the slogan plastered across his campaign posters. The same slogan has blared from his tour bus in Istanbul traffic jams, and boomed from the terraces of at least one of the city’s gigantic soccer stadiums. “Her şey çok güzel olacak” it goes. “Everything is going to be fine.” Spoken in the Anatolian cadence that recalls Imamoglu’s Black Sea childhood—a heritage he shares with millions of Istanbul residents who migrated to the city from rural Turkey since the 1960s—the stickiness of that reassuring platitude reflects a connection that has long eluded his secular Republican People’s Party (CHP), often seen as aloof from the struggles of religious and working class Turks. While the dialing back of the CHP’s traditional stances against religion and Kurdish nationalism predates Imamoglu, the comfort with which he talks about his religious upbringing, and his willingness to quote the Quran on the campaign trail, makes him the embodiment of that moderation, says the Middle East Institute’s Tol. “We talked about poverty. We talked about justice. We talked about the redistribution of Istanbul’s resources and the peaceful co-existence of people with each other,” Imamoglu tells TIME through an interpreter. “People could feel that I was sincere.”",'People Could Feel That I Was Sincere.'

735,John Walcott,"U.S. officials and some outside experts say they expect this week’s meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to head off an escalating trade war and restart trade negotiations between the world’s two largest economic powers. The two leaders are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the June 28 and 29 G20 economic summit in Osaka, Japan, amid signs that both sides are eager to forestall an escalating round of tariffs that is pushing China deeper into debt and prompting U.S. business and political leaders to oppose additional tariffs on imports from China. One sign that the Trump Administration wants to give economic peace a chance is the fact that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is set to attend the Trump-Xi meeting, is holding up a final decision on selling advanced U.S. tanks and other military equipment to Taiwan, said a U.S. defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Defense Department has notified Congress of the proposed $2 billion sale of M1A2 heavy tanks and anti-air and anti-tank missiles. But the administration has yet to act on the move, which would anger Beijing in the midst of an effort to restart trade negotiations. “We are firmly against U.S. arms sales to Taiwan,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on June 4. “We urge the U.S. to see the high sensitivity and severe harm of arms sales to Taiwan.” Another signal of the Administration’s reluctance to anger Beijing right now is its muted response to the massive protests in Hong Kong to a bill that would allow China to extradite the territory’s residents. The bill has now been suspended. Some U.S. lawmakers reintroduced a bill defending Hong Kong’s autonomy on June 14, but the Administration so far has not picked up the issue. In addition, U.S. Special Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a trade hawk, sounded a slightly more moderate tone on Capitol Hill this week, saying, “It’s certainly in the interest of both China and the United States to have some kind of successful agreement.

736,Fadwa Hodali and Gwen Ackerman / Bloomberg,"Palestinians on Sunday rejected the White House’s $50 billion economic proposal meant to boost the Palestinian and Arab economies, calling it a “snow job.” Their objection came as no surprise. Palestinian business organizations and officials have declined the U.S. invitation to attend the Bahrain conference this week meant to promote their development, saying any economic proposal must come as part of a political agreement and not separately or ahead of it. Mounir el-Jagoub, information officer for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party, said the plan was based on using Arab money “to kill the political aspirations of the Palestinian people.” Abbas didn’t even respond to the plan directly in a speech to the Fatah Central Committee on Saturday after the proposal was released in Washington. The 40-page U.S. proposal includes the creation of a global investment fund that the U.S. hopes will lift Palestinian and neighboring Arab state economies. More than half of the $50 billion would be spent in Palestinian territories. “This is a nice snow job,” said Sam Bahour, a Ramallah-based Palestinian-American business consultant and chair of the board of Americans for a Vibrant Palestinian Economy. “Go home,” he advised President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.“You’re wasting time and taxpayers’ dollars trying to whitewash 52 years of military occupation.” The Palestinian economy is suffering in part because the Trump administration halted hundreds of millions of dollars of funding, making it hard for the government to pay salaries. Israel also withheld about $11 million in taxes, roughly 5% of the amount it collects on behalf of the Palestinians, prompting the Authority to reject the remaining 95 percent that it was due. Israel said its move was to offset stipends paid to families of Palestinians who killed Israelis or are held in Israeli jails on security-related charges. Azzam Shawwa, head of the Palestine Monetary Authority, said economic growth slowed to 0.8% last year from 3.3% in 2017, and he expects this year “to be a big mess” after the funding was halted. The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said on Sunday that the Palestinian budget deficit had reached $700 million and had the League reconfirm providing the Authority with a monthly safety net of $100 million. Palestinians view the U.S. plan with suspicion, said Kamel Husseini, an adviser to the Palestinian private sector, because it comes before and not in conjunction with a political plan that would culminate in statehood. What he called “dubious” measures by the U.S. have also undermined confidence, he said.",Palestinians Call White House's Economic Proposal a 'Snow Job',"June 23, 2019"
737,Justin Worland,"As lawmakers around the world debate how best to fight climate change, one goal is rapidly becoming standard: net-zero emissions by 2050. That means that greenhouse gases would be dramatically reduced — most likely by using a combination of switching from coal and gas to wind and solar, becoming more energy-efficient and putting taxes or fees on carbon — and whatever remains would be offset by planting trees or using budding technology to pull carbon dioxide out of the air. Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom have agreed to work toward the net zero goal by the middle of the century. New York state passed a bill this week requiring the state to hit net zero by 2050. Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee called for net zero emissions by 2045 in his presidential campaign — after signing a related bill in his home state — while rivals Joe Biden, Beto O’Rourke, Michael Bennet and John Delaney are pushing for net zero by 2050. The European Union, meantime, has said it would move toward zero emissions, though it disappointed environmentalists by not setting a deadline. The newfound attention to the net zero target represents a significant development in the push to decarbonize the global economy along the lines scientists suggest is necessary to stave off the worst effects of global warming. But two key problems remain: the worst polluters, including the United States, haven’t yet signed on, and most places still need to figure out the details of how they will reach their goal. “We are in a very dangerous position now where action could go forward or backward,” Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare told reporters Wednesday. “The next 12 months or so will really tell.” The goal didn’t come out of the blue. Scientists have known for years that achieving that target by the middle of the century is essential to limiting temperature rise. Research from Climate Analytics released in early 2015, for example, suggested that global greenhouse emissions would need to hit zero by 2100 at the latest to have a good chance of keeping temperatures from rising more than 2°C by the end of the century.

738,Madeline Roache,"As former U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appears increasingly likely to become Britain’s next Prime Minister, the husband of a British-Iranian charity worker who accuses Johnson of helping Iranian officials justify his wife’s controversial imprisonment is on his seventh day of a hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London. “She’s utterly desperate,” says Richard Ratcliffe of his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who he says is also on a hunger strike while in prison. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was imprisoned three years ago on charges of “membership of an illegal group,” though human rights activists have called the accusations made-up. Ratcliffe started his hunger strike on June 11, pitching a tent outside the Iranian embassy and consuming only water and tea. The couple decided to go on their joint hunger strike after their daughter Gabriella turned five, Ratcliffe tells TIME. “It’s been over three years, we’ve pushed hard and now I’m sleeping on the pavement,” Richard Ratcliffe says while sitting in a camping chair outside the embassy. Next to him stands a framed photo of his wife and daughter. “We have to end this.”  Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport in April 2016 after visiting family in Iran with her then-infant daughter. She was sentenced to five years in prison in September of the same year. Amnesty International said she has committed no crime and is a “prisoner of conscience.” “It should never have come to this,” an Amnesty International statement said of the couple’s hunger strike. Richard Ratcliffe has accused Johnson, the current frontrunner in the race to become Britain’s next prime minister, of making misleading statements that afforded cover to the Iranian government. Johnson, then Foreign Secretary, said in 2017 that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been “teaching people journalism” in Iran. Three days later, Iranian officials cited his comments as proof that she was engaged in “propaganda against Tehran’s government.” Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s relatives and employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, say she was not working in Iran, but was on holiday to see family.  For his part, Johnson, said his comments didn’t “make any difference” to Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s sentence. “If you point the finger at the U.K., all you are doing is exculpating those who are truly responsible which is the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and that is reality and people should realize what this regime is up to, and that is where the responsibility lies,” Johnson said on June 18 during a BBC leadership debate. Some experts disagree. “International attention on prisoners wrongfully jailed by repressive regimes is usually a good thing,” says Brian Dooley, senior advisor at Human Rights First. “But not when a senior government official blunders in unprepared, unthinking and unhelpful. This sort of careless talk can cost people their freedom.”",A British-Iranian Woman and Her Husband Are On Hunger Strike Over Her Imprisonment in Iran,"June 21, 2019"
739,Billy Perrigo,"Boris Johnson is all but certain to become Britain’s next Prime Minister next month, following the resignation of Theresa May. The race to succeed May as leader of the ruling Conservative Party is ongoing, but Johnson is the clear frontrunner and has only one remaining opponent, Jeremy Hunt. The winner of that race will be decided in a ballot of the 124,000 or so card-carrying Conservative Party members. They are significantly more right-wing, more pro-Brexit and more white than the average British citizen. And Boris Johnson is their darling. So, barring a catastrophic collapse in support, Johnson is likely to be Britain’s next PM. Here’s what to know about him. Johnson is a Conservative lawmaker and former journalist. He is known for being a former Mayor of London and a leading figure on the “leave” side of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Following his side’s success, he was installed as Foreign Secretary. After a tenure characterized by gaffes, he stepped down in July 2018 over May’s Brexit negotiating strategy. Now he is a so-called “backbench” lawmaker who doesn’t hold government office, but is still seen as a leading Brexiter. The son of British politician Stanley Johnson, Boris was born Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson and can trace his family line back to King George II. Johnson went to Eton, the most prestigious private school in the U.K., where he was “a fully fledged school celebrity,” according to Just Boris, a biography of Johnson written by Sonia Purnell. But even as a teenager he was already being reprimanded for what his modern critics still today argue are his failings, including a lack of organization and attention to detail. He also went to Oxford University, where he was a friend of David Cameron, who would go on to become British Prime Minister. There, they were both members of the so-called “Bullingdon Club” of exclusively male students, which was known for trashing restaurants and being made up largely of scions of the aristocracy. Johnson started his professional life not as a politician but a journalist. It was in the newsroom that he developed his understanding of the British electorate. But he was fired from his first job, at the Times of London, after he made up a quote.",Boris Johnson Is Likely to Be Britain's Next Prime Minister. Who Is He?,"June 21, 2019"
740,Mahita Gajanan,"United Airlines has canceled some direct flights after the Federal Aviation Administration banned U.S. carriers from Iranian airspace following Iran’s shoot-down of a high-altitude U.S. drone in the area. Other airlines around the world are following suit and avoiding the area. The FAA order comes after Iran shot down an unarmed RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drone on Thursday that was “operating in the vicinity of civil air routes above the Gulf of Oman,” according to the FAA’s guidance. Iran said it struck down the aircraft over Iranian airspace. The U.S. said the drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait, which links the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and sees much of the world’s oil supply pass through it, has been a source of conflict recently, following a series of attacks on oil tankers and escalating tensions over Iran’s nuclear program. The U.S. took steps toward a military strike against Iran in retaliation for the downed drone, but President Donald Trump said he called off the operation Thursday night. The increased military activity and political tensions in the region pose an “indvertent risk to U.S. civil aviation operations and potential for miscalculation or mis-identification,” the FAA wrote in its guidance. The ban applies to all U.S. carriers and commercial operators. While the ban from the FAA does not extend to foreign air carriers, airlines around the world have followed the guidance. OPSGROUP, which offers guidance to global air carriers, recommended avoiding Iran’s airspace and the Strait of Hormuz area in a new notice. “Misidentification of an aircraft is possible,” OPSGROUP wrote. “Civil aircraft were very close to the site of this incident.” Passenger jets have previously been caught in the crossfire of military standoffs, with deadly results. After flight Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 was show down over Ukraine in 2014, killing 298 people, all countries have followed advice from the U.S., United Kingdom, France and Germany regarding airspace risk, OPSGROUP said, according to Reuters.",The FAA Just Banned Flights Over Iranian Air Space.

741,TIME Staff,"A day of mostly peaceful protests in Hong Kong turned ugly Friday as crowds laid siege to the city’s police headquarters, barricading officers inside, plastering the building with slogans and pelting it with eggs and other objects as they demanded that officials apologize for the force’s handling of a demonstration last week. During the late morning, thousands of black-clad demonstrators marched on the building and encircled it, setting up barricades across adjoining roads. Police appeared to be taken by surprise and retreated into the headquarters complex after attempts at negotiations failed. By nightfall, hundreds of protesters, many in protective gear, began to surge forward as if making to storm the building, defying police warnings and appeals from legislators to remain calm. The blockade follows a day in which protesters occupied major thoroughfares, government offices and law courts, forcing their closure. Protesters are furious with the police over what Amnesty International alleged was “unlawful use of force by police against peaceful protesters” in a June 12 crackdown, during which police fired tear gas and rubber bullets. The clashes left more than 80 wounded. The crowds outside the headquarters complex are demanding an investigation into the police’s handling of the disturbances as well as the release of all those arrested. That protest, and two massive marches on June 9 and June 16, were held to voice opposition to a controversial bill that for the first time would allow extradition to mainland China—a law that Hongkongers fear would allow Beijing to apprehend its many critics and political opponents in the former British colony. But the demonstrations have since morphed into a broader push for political freedom and a direct challenge to China’s sovereignty. Protesters carry banners reading “Hong Kong is not China” and wave the Union Jack alongside Hong Kong’s old colonial flag. By 9:00 p.m. local time, the crowd outside the headquarters complex had swelled considerably and chanted “Dead cops,” “Apologize!” and “No extradition to China!”",Thousands Besiege Hong Kong's Police Headquarters After a Day of Anti-Government Protests,"June 21, 2019"
742,Julia Webster,"A video showing a U.K. Member of Parliament aggressively grabbing a female climate protester by the neck and marching her out of a banquet dinner is dividing the country. The footage, filmed by TV news cameras on Thursday night and widely shared on social media, shows Mark Field, who is also a minister in the Foreign Office, pushing the woman against a pillar, grabbing her by the back of the neck and forcing her out of the room. The activist, Janet Barker, was one of dozens Greenpeace activists who interrupted a black-tie dinner for London’s banking elite to draw attention to the climate crisis. They were dressed in suits, red dresses and sashes with “climate emergency” on them. Following the release of the video, Field was suspended as a minister in the Conservative party and apologized to the activist. In a statement released on Friday, before he was suspended, he said he reacted “instinctively” and said he was worried the woman may have been armed. Barker told the BBC that Field’s actions were “over the top” and that he “should go to anger management classes.” However, she said she will not press charges with the police. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said she had seen the footage and “found it very concerning.” Greenpeace has accused Field of assault and May’s spokesperson said, “The police have said they are looking into reports over this matter.” Field was widely criticized, with thousands signing a petition demanding he be fired from the government, but others have defended him. Peter Bottomley, a Conservative MP, congratulated Field. “Not intervening often has a cost and if it becomes a fashion there will be casualties,” he told the BBC.",A British Politician Grabbed a Climate Protester by the Neck and It's Dividing the U.K.,"June 21, 2019"
743,Lisa Abend,"Even now, five years on, René Redzepi’s face still lights up when he recalls the April night his restaurant Noma was named best restaurant in the world for the fourth time. After a difficult 2013, whose nadir came when the Copenhagen restaurant dropped one position on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list, reclaiming the title the following year felt like redemption. “We had been wondering is this it? Is it the beginning of the end?” Redzepi, 41, said with a smile as he surveyed the crowd at a recent outdoor party in Copenhagen’s meatpacking district. “ So when we won, it was like “Oh, you still like us.” It was even better than the first time.” On June 25, when the 18th edition of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants’ lavish award ceremony takes place in Singapore, he may well get the chance to repeat the sensation. After closing the original Noma in 2016 and re-opening it in 2018 in a new location and with a new menu tied more closely to the seasons, Redzepi and his team are again among the favorites to cinch first place on the prestigious list. But as of this year, no other chefs — at least apart from any who have also rebuilt their restaurants from the ground up — will have the same opportunity. In January, the organizers of World’s 50 Best announced that any restaurant that takes or has previously taken the top spot on the list is disqualified from subsequent editions and moved instead to a Hall of Fame-like collection called The Best of the Best. That includes 2018’s #1, Osteria Francescana, as well as five other revered restaurants. It might seem a small matter, but coupled with other recent changes, the new rule — which came as a shock to many in the restaurant industry — reveals a tremendous amount about the relationship between chefs and an institution that for nearly two decades has played an outsized role in determining which restaurants receive the lion’s share of bookings, accolades, and media attention. And it raises a question that only a few years ago would have been unthinkable: in this age of social media, can any conventional system for evaluating restaurants, including World’s 50 Best, remain relevant? Launched in 2002 by editors at the U.K.-based Restaurant magazine, the World’s 50 Best Restaurants ranking quickly became one of the most influential forces in modern gastronomy. A restaurant that earns a spot on the list routinely sees a bump in reservations, and those that make the top 10 can expect a bombardment from eager diners and media alike. “Within 24 hours of the ceremony, we got 2 million booking requests,” says Catalan chef Joan Roca, whose restaurant El Celler de Can Roca, took number one in 2013 and 2015. “We’re still feeling the impact.” Beyond the publicity frenzy, the list also gained influence by tapping into the very human need for approval and belonging. Unlike the Michelin Guide, which is judged by a small group of anonymous inspectors, the 50 Best ranking is today decided by more than a thousand mostly well-known chefs, food writers, and gourmands — a composition that gratifies chefs whose restaurants make the list with the knowledge they have the respect of their peers. “To know that the people you so admire return the affection is a beautiful feeling,” explains Roca.  Yet for all its success, the ranking has always been plagued by controversy. There is no prohibition against lobbying, nor are voters required to pay for their meals, so some countries’ tourist boards — and even some individual restaurants — have subsidized expensive junkets to bring jurors to their tables. The list has also had difficulties achieving regional and gender diversity. Only 16 — a historic high — of the restaurants on 2018’s list are located outside of Europe or the United States. Five of them (also a record high) are led by women, although three of the women (at Arzak in San Sebastian, Cosme in New York, and Central in Lima) share their restaurant’s head position with a man, and another (at Nahm in Bangkok) assumed the role from its former male head chef too late in the year to have been considered. While some individuals gripe about “forcing” women onto the panel, the restaurant industry as a whole has become widely alert to its need to reduce its long-entrenched sexism, especially in the wake of #MeToo, which revealed harassment and abuse at a number of formerly well-regarded restaurants . So far,the measure has not been met with significant resistance.  More controversial, however, is the decision to remove previous number #1s from subsequent competitions. The organization presented the move as part of its efforts to diversify the list’s upper echelons. “There was some stagnation in the top 10,” says Pietrini. “We don’t want to artificially skew it, but we think it’s a healthy decision to make sure we’ve got a new dynamic every year.”",Why The World's 50 Best Restaurants 2019 List Is More Controversial Than Ever,"June 21, 2019"
744,Ciara Nugent,"At first, it seemed sweet. Natalie Curtis’s boyfriend called her dozens of times a day, keen to hear every detail of what she was doing in her daily life: what she ate for lunch, who she saw at work. But she says the longer she spent with him, and particularly after they married in 2016, four years after meeting, the more his behavior became intimidating. He made comments about what she ate. He picked fights when she went out with her friends. He threw her things around their house. He berated her while out shopping. One night, she says, he even threatened to kill her. “It’s such a drip effect, each event gets a bit worse and a bit worse,” Curtis says, speaking softly from her home in Essex, southeast England. “And then someone has control over you.”  “Coercive control” is the label domestic abuse experts give to the experience that Curtis, a 38-year-old safety specialist on the U.K.’s railways, endured. It encompasses a series of non-physical behaviors — including threats, humiliation, monitoring and isolation from friends and family — that they say can be just as damaging as physical violence, often causing severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2015, England and Wales became the first nations in the world to criminalize such controlling behavior within relationships, making coercive control punishable by up to five years in jail. Women make up 95% of those who experience coercive control and 74% of perpetrators are men, according to a study by one U.K. police force. Curtis began taking notes about the abuse, saving text messages, phone records and even filming her husband’s outbursts. She left him last June, and in October, he was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to a charge of coercive control. Her case marks an early victory for England and Wales’ legislation. For decades, law enforcement agencies worldwide have seen domestic abuse almost exclusively in physical terms, measuring its severity in individual beatings and injuries. The 1994 federal Violence Against Women Act in the U.S., for example, criminalizes only “felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence” in domestic contexts.  In this corner of the world, though, policymakers are trying something new. Ireland and Scotland followed England and Wales with their own coercive control laws in January and April of this year. By criminalizing behaviors many previously considered merely unpleasant, domestic abuse advocates hope these laws will transform how society views acceptable power dynamics in relationships and how we tackle abuse. “We’re beginning to understand that it isn’t about one-off incidents. Abuse is a pattern, a war of attrition that wears a person down,” says Laura Richards, a British criminal behavioral analyst who helped pass the 2015 law after nearly two decades working in the domestic abuse sector. “Coercive control is the very heart of it.”",'Abuse Is a Pattern.'

745,TIME Staff,"Angry protesters once again stormed the political heart of Hong Kong on Friday. In a series of rolling occupations, they forced the hurried evacuation of multiple government offices and shuttering of law courts. They also surrounded police headquarters in a siege that appears set to continue into the night. The actions erupted after the embattled administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam refused to meet an ultimatum for her resignation and the withdrawal of a divisive extradition bill. However the government issued a statement around 8:00 p.m. local time saying that when the term of the current legislature ended, the bill would “automatically expire.” The government “will accept this reality,” the statement said. Chanting a Christian hymn that has become the anthem of Hong Kong’s freedom movement, thousands of black-clad demonstrators began streaming into the forecourt of the legislature from early morning. They demanded the unconditional release of all protesters arrested to date and an investigation into the police handling of the demonstrations that have rocked the semi-autonomous enclave for the past 10 days. Shortly after 11: 00 a.m., large crowds of protesters chanting “Withdraw [the bill]!” erected barricades on Harcourt Road—a key thoroughfare in front of the government headquarters that was the center of the 2014 Umbrella Revolution. A banner hung across the road read “This Is Hong Kong Not China.” Urged by recently freed activist Joshua Wong, crowds then marched on police headquarters at Arsenal Street, just under a kilometer away. They began taunting police and chanting for the release of prisoners. Officers retreated behind metal gates as demonstrators encircled the building and dragged barriers across Hennessy Road and a part of Queensway, both vital arteries. Protesters are furious with the police over what Amnesty International alleged in a statement Friday was “unlawful use of force by police against peaceful protesters” on June 12, wounding scores. Amnesty claimed that the evidence against the Hong Kong police was “irrefutable.” On Friday, agitated demonstrators plastered police headquarters with a sign reading “Fight to the bitter end” and photographs purported to be of people injured at the earlier demonstration. Barricades were erected across main entrances to prevent officers from leaving and small side doors were sealed with zip ties. Other used ladders to reach CCTV cameras installed along the building’s walls and covered them with duct tape. Addressing the crowd through a microphone, Wong said “[Police Commissioner] Stephen Lo has to come down and face Hongkongers.” He told TIME at the scene: “It’s time for the police to apologize.”","Escalating Their Campaign Into a Push for Political Freedom, Protesters Return to Hong Kong's Streets","Updated: June 21, 2019 9:01 AM ET"
746,Gina Martinez,"The first Dominican-American to serve in Congress says there’s no reason to fear visiting the Dominican Republic, but he’s planning to visit the Caribbean nation next month to get answers following the deaths of nine American tourists this year. “First of all, I’m concerned about the deaths,” Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat from New York, tells TIME. “I will look into them and I’m sure the U.S. authorities, including the FBI and the Dominican authorities, are looking into the causes of them. I will fight for that to happen, for them to get to the bottom of it.” Espaillat made the announcement on Wednesday, saying he plans to speak to tourism and government officials to learn the latest details on the headline-making deaths––many of which came after travelers reportedly fell suddenly ill. A New Jersey man who died earlier this month in his Terra Linda Sosua hotel room raised the death toll to nine, and the news has spooked some travelers who fear it is an unsafe destination. Espaillat says he wants to prioritize getting answers for the families of the victims during the visit. He also notes that statistics have shown the country is a safer destination than many other vacation spots in the region. According to the State Department, there has been no evidence of foul play and no sign that the deaths are connected. Last year, 13 U.S. citizens died while traveling to the Dominican Republic. The number was 17 in 2017. More than 2.7 million U.S. tourists visited the island in 2017, making the island the fourth most popular travel destination for Americans. Citing  InSight Crime’s 2018 Homicide Round-Up,  Espaillat compared the Dominican Republic’s homicide rate to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Statistics show that the Dominican Republic recorded 10.4 homicides per 100,000 people––compared to 81.4 in Venezuela, 25 in Mexico and 11.7 in Costa Rica.

747,W.J. Hennigan,"President Donald Trump downplayed the likelihood of U.S. military action against Iran after a military drone was shot down Thursday during a reconnaissance mission in the Middle East, the latest test of an escalating conflict that the President is seeking to avoid. Speaking at the White House, Trump suggested the shoot-down of the $100 million high-flying U.S. drone could have been an accident carried out by a “general” acting “loose and stupid.” “I find it hard to believe it was intentional,” he said, adding that the downing of the military aircraft was “a new fly in the ointment” in his Administration’s dealings with Iran. He did not indicate how the U.S. would respond. The President hasn’t been shy about saying he doesn’t want to get involved in additional military entanglements overseas, often issuing interpretations of Iranian actions that are more measured than those of his advisers. In an interview with TIME on Monday, Trump called Iran’s alleged attacks on oil tankers in the region “very minor,” striking a notably different tone than the Pentagon. But his Administration has been on a collision course with Iran since the U.S. withdrew from the landmark nuclear deal a year ago. The shoot-down Thursday represented the most serious clash yet. Whether or not Trump wants to admit it, the U.S. and Iran are already locked in a low-grade conflict that could evolve into a wider war, either by miscalculation or deliberate action. Trump’s remarks appear to be an attempt to lower the tensions, seizing on an assessment by some U.S. intelligence analysts that an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commander might have launched the attack without authorization from the government. The IRGC is an Iranian military entity with a separate line of command that runs through Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rather than President Hassan Rouhani, who oversees the country’s military. The Iranian government celebrated the shoot-down on Thursday, however, indicating it was highly unlikely to have been a mistake or the work of a rogue actor. “The downing of the U.S. drone had an explicit, decisive and clear message that defenders of the Islamic Iran’s borders will show decisive and knockout reactions to aggression against this territory by any alien,” said Hossein Salami, an IRGC commander, according to Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency. “Borders are our redline, and any enemy violating these borders will not go back.”",Trump Suggests Iran Mistakenly Shot Down a U.S. Drone.

The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps declared that it had stuck down the RQ-4 Global Hawk over Iranian airspace, but the United States countered that the incident was an “unprovoked attack” and that the aircraft had been traveling in international airspace. A few days ago, the U.S. officials also accused Iran of firing missile at a different drone that had been responding to the attack on the tankers. But what exactly is an RQ-4A drone, and why does this attack matter? TIME spoke to drone aircraft experts to find out what you need to know. In technical terms, the drone that Iran shot down was a U.S. Navy Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) aircraft, which is a Navy version of the Air Force’s high-flying RQ-4A Global Hawk. In simple terms, it is an unmanned aircraft that is intended for surveillance at sea. Unlike the missile-launching MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones that are used to conduct airstrikes, Global Hawk drones are unarmed are used only to collect information. To do this, they fly at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet–– almost twice as high as a commercial airliner.

Many people are reported to have been waiting hours in line for water being provided through government tankers. The water crisis is being felt throughout India—at least 550 people were reportedly arrested Wednesday during protests in Coimbatore, about 300 miles southwest of Chennai, alleging negligence by the municipal government. Some political parties are calling on more protests. The region relies heavily on monsoon rains, but delayed monsoon seasons have started to become more frequent, and temperatures this month have reached 104 degrees. Rainfall dropped by 99% from June 1-19. During that period, Chennai only received 0.3 millimeters of rainfall, compared to the 40mm it normally receives. But weather forecasters predict the dry weather might end soon as the southwest monsoon slowly makes its way to the region. Some rain has been reported in Chennai on Thursday. Local media reports the reservoirs water levels are some of the lowest in 70 years. Several restaurants, hotels and other businesses have been forced to close. Many wealthier people are paying for private water sources, while violence has been reported as people wait in line for water from government tankers. Jyoti Sharma, founder and president of FORCE, a water conservation NGO, told CNN that some water tankers have been hijacked and drivers have been attacked. The tankers also can’t reach all neighborhoods, including most of the Chennai slums, where about 820,000 people live, according to CNN.

750,Rachel E. Greenspan,"Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex are leaving the charity they share with Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will establish their own new charitable foundation with transitional operating support from The Royal Foundation,” the charity said in a statement on Thursday. The statement adds that the two couples will continue to support The Royal Foundation’s mental health initiative, Heads Together, as a group. Naturally, many have interpreted the news as a sign of discord among the iconic “Fab Four,” as the group has been dubbed. But royal experts say there’s no bad blood. “The fact that they’re separating is not a big deal,” Marlene Koenig, a historian and expert on the British royal family, tells TIME. It’s uncommon for siblings in the royal family to have collaborative charities and foundations like this in the first place, according to Koenig, who thinks the only reason for the joint venture from the beginning was for both brothers to have a project to share as they grew up. This is just the “natural progression,” she says. Though both couples participate in other philanthropic causes, the Royal Foundation is their “primary philanthropic and charitable vehicle,” according to its website. The two brothers founded the organization in 2009, when they were both still single, so it only makes sense that they would split up now to establish themselves as two individual families. As for rumors of feuds among the four royals, Koenig thinks the notion that there’s trouble in paradise has nothing to do with the facts. “They’re just [on] two different career paths,” she says. After his father Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, takes the throne, Prince William will be the heir — and eventually the king of England, which gives him more responsibilities and duties. Given his position in the line of succession, Prince Harry will likely never be king, affording him more opportunities to pursue his own interests and passions. “I think this is all about them pursuing different trajectories,” says Katie Nicholl, the author of Harry and Meghan: Life, Loss, and Love. “While they might be sentimental about the whole thing, they also have to be pragmatic, and this makes sense.” It’s also not the first time the Cambridge and Sussex families have begun to write their own stories. Earlier this year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex started their own royal court with their primary home at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, separate from Kensington Palace. (Prince William and Kate Middleton, meanwhile, retain Kensington Palace as their main residence. Their country estate, Anmer Hall in Norfolk, serves more as a weekend escape.)",Why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Are Leaving the Charity They Share With Prince William and Kate Middleton,"June 20, 2019"
751,Sally Hayden,"If Florida Kayindo hadn’t contracted Ebola herself, she wouldn’t believe that it existed. The 36-year-old grins with bemusement thinking about all the rumors she’s heard. “In the beginning people thought Ebola wasn’t a real illness, it was brought in by white people,” she explains.  “White people are evil, that’s what people in the community believe,” Kayindo tells TIME. “Before Ebola white people were around, but now they’re thinking white people came with Ebola.” Kayindo was declared Ebola free in November 2018 and since then she has been working in a childcare center on the grounds of Beni General Hospital, in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, North Kivu province, close to where the Ebola outbreak began last August. Like other survivors, she has antibodies that mean she can’t get sick from the virus again, and is now being paid to care for the children of others who are undergoing treatment.  Despite her experience with the virus, Kayindo occasionally appears to question whether her understanding of Ebola and how it is contracted is correct. She finds herself asking could it have been spread through food or water, similar to a scene she once saw in an old sci-fi movie.  Kayindo is not alone in her skepticism. Misinformation has contributed to the difficulties containing the virus in DRC, where more than 1,300 people have now died in the second largest Ebola outbreak in recorded history. Rumors have led local Congolese to distrust both medical workers and the authorities’ response. Souleymane Diallo, UNICEF’s Senior Ebola Coordinator, said residents in affected areas have limited understanding about the management and treatment of Ebola or how vaccinations and interventions work. “The lack of information leads the community to ask a lot of questions about the Ebola virus,” Diallo tells TIME. “It’s become a source of the community’s lack of confidence in the response. Given political tension in the country, there is speculation among communities that the central government – roughly one thousand miles away in Kinshasa – is spreading the virus on purpose to gather support or using it to quell opposition. This was exacerbated when residents of Beni and Butembo were barred from voting in the recent presidential election, ostensibly because of health risks.  Others believe that international aid organizations are behind the outbreak. This belief has been compounded by the amount of money that suddenly seems to be flowing into DRC’s east to help assist efforts to contain Ebola. They argue they got little relief from conflict and other health issues before this, and ask why Ebola would be any different.",How Misinformation Is Making It Almost Impossible to Contain the Ebola Outbreak in DRC,"June 20, 2019"
752,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: As anticipation builds for the G-20 meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump next week in Japan, China’s state broadcaster announced on Monday a surprise state visit by Xi to North Korea for later this week. Why It Matters: While this state visit is intended for an audience of one that’s currently sitting in Washington, it also serves as a reminder to the rest of the world that any lasting resolution on the Korean peninsula still runs through Beijing. China remains North Korea’s main link to the outside world—Beijing is Pyongyang’s largest trade partner, and has been responsible for 90 percent of North Korea’s trade since 2000. China’s decision to join (and actually enforce) UN sanctions against North Korea helped push Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table with the US in the first place. This will be Xi’s first trip to North Korea as president (he previously travelled there in 2008 as China’s vice president), and it will be the first trip to the Hermit Kingdom by a sitting Chinese president since Hu Jintao visited Kim Jong-il back in 2005. Crucially, this trip is being billed as an actual “state visit”, a departure from the usual designation Beijing uses to describe trips to North Korea (usually referred to as “official friendly visits”). South Korea has also endorsed the trip, hoping that Xi’s trip will kickstart the stalled denuclearization talks. There’s also an element of PR damage control here for Xi. Criticism over his dealings with the US on trade, and more recently the mass protests in Hong Kong over the controversial extradition bill, have put Xi on the back foot. Taking this trip to North Korea puts him back in the driver seat of a critical global issue ahead of next week’s showdown with Trump. What Happens Next: The visit will be cordial and filled with pomp, but don’t expect substantial headlines to emerge from the meeting between Xi and Kim. The real measure of Xi’s Pyongyang trip will come one week later when Xi meets with Trump at the G20 in Japan. In the past, Trump has tied China trade talks to Beijing’s support in dealing with the North Korea threat. While that has been lost in recent months as the trade war between the US and China has heated up, Xi may be banking on a last-minute trip to Pyongyang to remind Trump that his most promising foreign policy success to date—engagement with North Korea—requires Xi’s blessing to move forward. While the US currently has the upper hand in trade negotiations with China (evinced by the US decision to include Chinese state-champion Huawei on the Commerce Department’s Entity List, which has brought the company to its knees), China has something that Trump wants, too—a legitimate foreign policy victory that eluded Barack Obama. It’s doubtful that moves the needle much with Trump given how much political capital he has invested in taking a hardline against China, but Xi may be hoping to play to Trump’s ego. That isn’t the worst strategy in the world.",The Quick Read About… President Xi Jinping’s Trip to North Korea,"June 20, 2019"
753,Mark Niquette / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Book publishers are imploring President Donald Trump not to impose “a Bible tax.’’ Proposed tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods would include printed materials, which would especially affect Bibles and children’s books predominantly produced in China because of the unique paper, printing technology and skills needed, company and trade group officials testified during the second day of a seven-day hearing on the proposed duties Tuesday. “We believe the administration was unaware of the potential negative impact these proposed tariffs would have on Bibles and that it never intended to impose ‘a Bible tax’ on consumers and religious organizations,” Mark Schoenwald, chief executive officer of HarperCollins Christian Publishing, told a panel of officials at the U.S. International Trade Commission. A 25% tariff would make it difficult to continue printing some formats and raise prices, leading to a Bible shortage that would hurt the Christian bookseller market, as well as ministries, churches, nonprofits and other religious organizations that couldn’t afford them, Schoenwald said. There also is no viable alternative to the U.S. children’s books printed in China because of the waterproof and nontoxic materials used in some cases, as well as China’s investment in recent decades in needed equipment, said Daniel Reynolds, CEO of Workman Publishing Co. in New York. “If tariffs are imposed, there will be fewer books available to American kids,” he said. Publishers try to use U.S. printers when possible, but capacity has become extremely constrained since the 1980s, said M. Luisa Simpson, vice president for global policy at the Association of American Publishers. Because of thin margins in the industry, higher prices would mean some books would be discontinued, publishers might have to scale back, and book stores, schools and libraries would be affected, she said. Trump has broad political support from evangelical Christians. Publishers are hoping he’ll be receptive to sparing Bibles from tariffs, said Stan Jantz, head of the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association.",Publishers Plead With Trump Not to Impose a 'Bible Tax' With New China Tariffs,"June 20, 2019"
754,Julia Webster,"Every year around June 21, thousands of visitors from around the world gather at Stonehenge in southwest England to celebrate the summer solstice. It’s a tradition that is thought to go back thousands of years, ever since Neolithic peoples created what is believed to be a temple aligned with the movements of the sun. Stonehenge is the only neolithic monument in the U.K. to use stones not from the local area. While some were most likely taken from the neighboring Marlborough Downs, the “bluestones,” weighing around 3.6 tons each, were transported from quarries in Wales that are 180 miles away. Historians still struggle to explain how, in pre-wheel Britain, humans could have managed this architectural feat. Though its exact purpose remains a mystery, Stonehenge is still sacred to members of Britain’s Druid and Pagan communities, who observe various rituals at the site, including on the summer and winter solstices. But these days, historians, archeologists and local residents worry for the landmark’s future, as digging for a tunnel motorway past the site could start in 2021. The A303, one of the main routes between London and rural southwest England, passes through the World Heritage Site of Stonehenge and Avebury, creating what many see as a blemish on an important landscape. In December 2014, the U.K. government announced plans to invest in a two-mile-long tunnel to upgrade the road, hiding the section closest to Stonehenge from view — the latest in a series that have been proposed since 1995 to solve the notorious traffic jams around Stonehenge, where the road narrows to a single lane. The National Trust and English Heritage, who between them manage the central core area around Stonehenge, welcomed the proposal, describing it as a “momentous decision” that would remove much of the traffic from the landscape. But anti-tunnel campaigners warn the scheme could cause irreparable harm. The Stonehenge Alliance, a group made up of NGOs including Friends of the Earth and the Council for the Protection of Rural England, have warned that building a tunnel there would risk destroying the site. “It would betray millennias’ worth of history,” says Tom Holland, a historian and president of the Stonehenge Alliance. “It’s Europe’s most precious prehistoric landscape, and that’s because it’s not just Stonehenge itself, but the entire surroundings that give those stones their significance.” In addition to the stone circle, the area recognized as a World Heritage Site comprises several complexes of Neolithic and Bronze Age ceremonial and funerary monuments that indicate that hundreds of people were buried there in ancient times. The main concerns about the tunnel have to do with the damage that could be made to archeological remains. “If we start messing around, drilling things, then we don’t know what will happen. We’ll end up not even knowing what it is that we have lost,” says Holland. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter Not all archeologists, however, oppose the tunnel. Mike Pitts is an author and archeologist specializing in British prehistory, and one of a few to have excavated within Stonehenge itself. He says that aside from the traffic problem, the road is a “major scar in the middle of the World Heritage landscape” and “the only acceptable solution is to hide it on its existing course.”","Stonehenge Has Attracted Summer Solstice Visitors for Centuries, But Some Historians Worry About Its Future","June 20, 2019"
756,Eugene Rumer,"For thirty years, since the end of the Cold War, U.S. policy toward Russia has been going in circles with the relationship getting worse as different U.S. administrations came and went. Today, the U.S.-Russian relationship is at the lowest point since before the Cold War ended and the best we can hope for is that it will not get even worse. Russia is to blame for most of what went wrong in this relationship. It invaded Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, it interfered in the 2016 United States presidential election, and it continues to meddle in Venezuela, in Syria, in Libya, etc. But it takes two to tango. Rarely, have U.S. policymakers questioned U.S. policy toward Russia. Have we done everything right? A look back at the record of the Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush presidencies’ dealings with Russia produces surprising results. These three very different administrations embraced the same set of policies toward Russia. They were built around two pillars: a refusal to accept Russia for what it was and insistence that it reform itself to better fit the image of what U.S. policymakers thought Russia should look like; and the view that NATO was the only legitimate European security organization, while expanding it ever deeper into the former Soviet lands. Russia rejected both of these, but U.S. policymakers proceeded with these policies anyway on the assumption that sooner or later Russia would recognize what was good for it. In the community of Russia hands it became known as the “spinach treatment”—kids don’t like spinach, but should eat it because it’s good for them. Every U.S. administration has gone through the boom-bust cycle in its dealings with Russia. The Clinton administration took charge of the relationship in 1993 and promised to build a partnership with Russian democracy, Russian reforms, Russian markets. The two presidents—Clinton and Russia’s Boris Yeltsin—built a strong personal bond. Yet the road to partnership became more and more difficult as disagreements arose over Russia’s slow reform progress, NATO expansion, the Kosovo campaign, and much else. By the end of the 1990s both sides grew frustrated with each other. The Clinton chapter of that relationship ended amid fears that Yeltsin’s successor, Vladimir Putin, was backsliding on democracy. Despite these misgivings, the George W. Bush administration attempted to build its own partnership with Russia. In 2001, Bush and Putin pledged to build a new relationship based on a “joint commitment to democracy, free market, and the rule of law.” That relationship followed the familiar pattern as disagreements arose—over the Iraq war, Russian backsliding on democracy, and NATO expansion. In 2008, following NATO’s pledge of future membership to former Soviet republics Georgia and Ukraine, Russia crushed the tiny Georgian military as the United States and its NATO allies watched, but did not interfere. Russia effectively declared the former Soviet states off limits to NATO. The relationship with Russia was once again at the lowest point since the Cold War. The Obama administration attempted to “reset” the relationship with Russia and launched its own partnership. The idea there was to modernize its economy and liberalize its politics. That too proved short-lived, as hopes for both political liberalization and economic modernization proved unrealistic. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014 plunged U.S.-Russian relations to yet a new low, only to be followed by Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Trump administration attempted its own “reset” with Russia but did not get far as Russia-related scandals and investigations proliferated. Sanctions have become not just a tool of U.S. policy toward Russia, but the replacement for it. The relationship is at an impasse, while a reasoned policy discussion about Russia is not possible because the issue has become toxic in U.S. domestic politics. This situation is not sustainable. The time has come to recognize that Russia is not going to change its domestic arrangements to suit U.S. preferences, and conditioning U.S. policy on such a change is pointless. Similarly, Russia is not going to change its view of NATO and accept further enlargement to include Ukraine and Georgia—both countries with which it shares a long and complicated history, and in which it has much greater interests than the United States. The United States and its allies are not prepared to go to war for Ukraine or Georgia. Russia is and has. That is a clear indicator that the goal of their membership in the alliance is unrealistic and should be dropped.",How to Reset U.S.-Russian Relations Today,"June 20, 2019"
757,Charlie Campbell,"Smelling blood, the protesters thronged in greater numbers. Demonstrations against an extradition bill in Hong Kong swelled on June 16 even after the city’s political leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, suspended the controversial legislation. March organizers say nearly 2 million people, young and old, packed the city center demanding the bill’s complete withdrawal and Lam’s resignation. Given that the former British colony’s population is 7 million, it’s hard to imagine a more stinging indictment of Hong Kong’s leadership. Lam is hanging on, for now. She issued a “most sincere apology,” though it was quickly rejected by demonstrators. They accuse her of jeopardizing Hong Kong’s judicial independence by attempting to fast-track changes to the Basic Law, which introduced effective self-rule for 50 years from the moment in 1997 the British handed over the colony to China under a model dubbed “one country, two systems.” The amendment would have allowed criminals to be extradited to territories including the Chinese mainland, where chances of a fair trial are best summed up by its conviction rate of 99%. The chief executive is widely seen in Hong Kong as a loyalist to Beijing, and her humbling backpedal will reverberate on the mainland. The sight of millions of Chinese citizens standing tall to reproach the political system that governs the rest of the country will be chastening to President Xi Jinping and his much hyped Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation. Xi is paying the price for overreaching, says Jude Blanchette, an analyst at Crumpton Group and author of a new book on China’s resurgent revolutionary ideology. “He’s managed to alienate China and frustrate its forward progress.” The popular revolution in Hong Kong comes as Xi is facing international pushback on a variety of fronts. His signature Belt and Road Initiative is running into red tape and political opposition in Europe. State repression of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang is being held up as an international emergency by human-rights groups and multilateral institutions. And his Made in China 2025 technology drive is being derailed by the trade war with the U.S. It’s possible demonstrators will still be on the streets of Hong Kong when Xi sits down with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump at the G-20 in Osaka, Japan, in late June to negotiate a truce. The U.S. President noted to TIME on June 17 that the Hong Kong protests were “having a big impact.” The likely failure of the bill is an embarrassment to Xi, but not much of an obstacle. Demonstrators note that China has already eroded Hong Kong’s autonomy through the extrajudicial rendition in 2015 of five booksellers who published salacious tomes about Beijing elites. And “one country, two systems” has an expiry date, meaning the protesters’ victory may prove hollow in the long term. In 2047 the topic of extradition will be “top of the agenda,” says Simon Young of the University of Hong Kong’s law school. “When it’s addressed at that time, I fear that none of the safeguards discussed now will exist.” There will be a more immediate cost to the Chinese economy, though. Hong Kong’s slippery legal jurisdiction has long made it attractive to criminals; its port has historically been safe harbor for smugglers, its skyscrapers provide semi-legal gloss for North Korean shell companies, and its archaic banking system has proven fruitful to money launderers. This freewheeling status was once a boon to the impoverished mainland. In the mid-1990s, Hong Kong’s economy comprised almost a third of China’s GDP. Now that figure is less than 3%, and the same laissez-faire capitalism has become a hitch on the Chinese economy’s growth through capital flight. The extradition bill was arguably less about cracking down on Hong Kongers than about preventing Chinese businesspeople and officials from using Hong Kong to expatriate ill-gotten gains as growth slows. Perhaps the bigger cost will be to Xi’s territorial ambitions. Since its inception, “one country, two systems” has been floated as a means of reuniting the mainland with the island of Taiwan, which has ruled itself since the defeated Nationalists fled across the strait in 1949 after China’s civil war. Reunification is key to Xi’s “China Dream” of returning the Asian superpower to “center stage in the world.” But the Hong Kong protests have galvanized support for Taiwan’s China-skeptic President Tsai Ing-wen, whose policy is to keep Beijing at arm’s length. Even her most pro-China opponent in the 2020 general election, prospective Nationalist candidate Han Kuo-yu, said recently on the hustings that “one country, two systems” would be introduced in Taiwan only “over my dead body.”",Hong Kong’s Uprising Rattles the Mainland,"June 20, 2019"
758,Ciara Nugent,"An ongoing Ebola outbreak has already caused 1,400 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo–and across the border, Ugandan authorities are bracing for their own possible outbreak of the deadly virus. Though the World Health Organization (WHO) decided on June 14 not to classify the outbreak as an international emergency, two people died of Ebola after returning to Uganda from a trip to the Congo in early June, and health workers fear the porous border between the countries could allow the disease to spread. Congo’s 10-month outbreak has been the second worst since Ebola, which causes fatal dehydration and organ failure in up to 90% of cases, first surfaced in 1976. There have been over 2,000 cases since August, and guerrilla violence has made it hard to contain, as attacks on medical centers have killed health workers and prompted agencies to suspend operations at times. A lack of public awareness has also been an obstacle. Mistaking the initial symptoms for malaria, communities often fail to isolate patients and handle still infectious corpses during traditional burials. The WHO said authorities had identified 112 people in Uganda who may have come into contact with Ebola, and quarantined some of them. Uganda’s science and drug agencies, looking to pre-empt a large-scale outbreak, also approved three new experimental treatments for the virus on June 18. But Uganda’s Health Minister said unofficial footpaths on the border with Congo–which people from both countries use regularly to visit family–will make containment difficult, and some Ugandan hospital workers say they lack the resources to tackle Ebola if it comes. The WHO has warned that the world is entering “a new phase” where epidemics of deadly diseases are the “new normal,” with the agency tracking more of them than ever before. Congo’s Ebola outbreak comes just two years after the worst one in history ended in West Africa in 2016. As climate change and political instability drive populations to move around more, it’s getting harder to contain diseases. As Uganda prepares for the current threat, doctors are urging all governments to follow their lead for the future.   Write to Ciara Nugent at ciara.nugent@time.com.

759,Karl Vick,"Now that both Iran and the United States have announced what they do not want–war–the search is on for what they do. That’s always been easier to answer from Tehran’s side. The Islamic Republic of Iran was founded in frank and vociferous opposition to the U.S. It’s a binary republic. For: Islam, as defined by its patently political mullahs. Against: Washington, which deposed Iran’s last freely elected leader, then kept on meddling. Iran is also against Israel, the only non-Muslim nation in the region, but it’s more gratifying to face off against the U.S., often referred to in official statements as “global arrogance” (and sometimes just “arrogance”). The U.S. has been delighted to respond in kind. Its enmity toward Iran has survived the Cold War’s end, the rise of China and 9/11, albeit narrowly. Washington and Tehran actually worked together to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. But then George W. Bush included Iran in his “axis of evil” and quixotically invaded Iraq–empowering Iran by toppling its longtime nemesis and leaving it the dominant player in Baghdad. Today Iran stands at the epicenter of the Middle East, despite a deeply dysfunctional economy and restive population. The Iranian people’s failed uprising in 2009, over a stolen election, effectively inoculated Iran’s leadership from the Arab Spring revolutions that instead created opportunities for the country around the region. In Syria, with the help of Russia, the Islamic Republic prevailed against proxies of the petro-monarchies who refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf. From Yemen, its Houthi allies lob missiles into one of them, Saudi Arabia, mortifying the crown prince, who told TIME last year that “whatever happens, the Saudi people shouldn’t feel it.” And now Donald Trump has come courting. What we are hearing are not the drums of war but more of a fanfare. “I’d much rather talk,” Trump has replied, when asked if war with Tehran is on the horizon. The President sees himself as a master negotiator. He ran against the “bad deal” that Barack Obama had cut–the pact by which Iran discarded almost all of its nuclear program, in exchange for relief from one of the most effective sanctions programs the world had ever come together to enforce. Galvanizing that effort was Iran’s progress toward enough fissile material to make an atomic bomb, and Israel’s credible threats to launch airstrikes against Iran’s facilities before it got one. It was a group effort. The dynamic this time is different. Trump alone has imposed sanctions in hopes of coercing the Iranians into new talks. But there are problems. One is that the old pact still exists. China, Russia and the E.U. also signed it and, because it’s working, want to keep it. Problem two is that there’s no longer any imminent threat of military action against Iran–not even when Iran looks like it’s trying to provoke one. Since May 12, a half-dozen oil tankers have been punctured by explosions, and on June 13 an Iranian military vessel was photographed retrieving a mine that had failed to detonate. One of the burning vessels was Japanese. As it happened, that same day Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Tehran delivering a message to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, from Trump. “I do not see Trump as worthy of any message exchange,” Khamenei replied. “And I do not have any reply for him, now or in the future.” Instead, four days later, Iran spoke to the rest of the world, declaring it would violate the nuclear pact. The announcement–giving 10 days’ notice before Iran exceeded limits on enriching uranium–was clearly intended to stir European nations to defy the U.S. sanctions and find a way to keep trading through barter. If that happened, Iran signaled, it would continue to stick to the pact.","If Neither Trump Nor Iran Want War, What Do They Want Instead?","June 20, 2019"
760,Ian Bremmer,"Revolutions are hard to launch and harder to sustain. That’s the legacy of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi, the man elected Egypt’s President following the Arab Spring demonstrations that ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak. After a year in power, Morsi’s government was overthrown by a military coup, and now Egypt is led by a military-backed strongman, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. Morsi collapsed and died on June 17 inside a cage in a Cairo courtroom, where he was facing espionage charges. That’s a useful backdrop to help us recognize what’s now happening across Egypt’s southern border in Sudan. After three months of nationwide demonstrations, protesters began congregating in central Khartoum on April 6, demanding the removal of longtime strongman Omar Hassan al-Bashir. On April 11, the uprising ended al-Bashir’s 30-year rule. He now faces criminal charges, just as Egypt’s Mubarak did. But thousands of protesters in Sudan, aware that the country’s army would likely try to replace one military-backed tyrant with another, refused to leave the streets of Khartoum. Organizers of a large protest outside military headquarters demanded that al-Bashir be put in prison. The army complied. The demonstrators then called for early elections and a civilian-led government. The generals countered by offering a “managed transition” led by a military council, which would produce elections and a civilian government within two years. Not good enough, said the protesters. The crowd grew, and tensions surged. On June 3, men in military fatigues opened fire on the crowd. At least dozens were massacred, and hundreds more were wounded. Witnesses reported that soldiers dumped bodies into the Nile to hide the death toll. The counterrevolution had begun. Like Egypt’s al-Sisi, a military man has stepped forward to restore order in Sudan. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti, now serves as vice president of Sudan’s ruling military junta. On June 5, he spoke out against the violent crackdown on protesters and pledged to bring the perpetrators to justice. “We are working hard to take those who did this to the gallows,” he said. The trouble, say the protesters, is that the murders were committed by the so-called Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary force, previously known as the janjaweed. This group is also widely blamed for murder, rape, theft and arson committed against civilians in the Darfur region of Sudan. The janjaweed commander is Hemeti himself. Human Rights Watch, a nongovernmental watchdog group, holds Hemeti responsible for overseeing “torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes” in Darfur. Counterrevolutions often earn backing from interested neighbors, and Hemeti appears to have powerful friends. He reportedly visited Saudi Arabia in May and promised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that Sudan’s military would support Saudi goals in the region, including sending Sudanese soldiers to support the Saudi war in Yemen.",The Fight to Save Sudan from the Counterrevolution,"June 20, 2019"

For decades the party existed largely underground, but it was ready and waiting when the uprisings known as the Arab Spring abruptly produced free elections. Mohamed Morsi was the Brotherhood’s candidate for Egyptian President, and its archetype: middle class, professional (engineering degree from USC), with a neat beard and self-confidence verging on smugness. On June 17, 2012, Morsi–seen above in Cairo in that all-important year–became the first democratically elected President in Arab history. Seven years to the day later, Morsi died in a Cairo courtroom, at age 67. He had been imprisoned after only 13 months in office, a victim of Brotherhood insularity, mounting public distrust and an Egyptian security apparatus accustomed to being in charge. The coup was announced by General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, whose forces slaughtered at least 800 Morsi supporters in the street. Al-Sisi now heads a government that international human-rights groups, noting Morsi was deprived of crucial medical care in prison, call responsible for his death too. Contact us at editors@time.com.

762,AMY GUNIA / HONG KONG,"Demonstrations in Hong Kong over the past two weeks have been recognized as likely the largest in the city’s history. Sparked by a proposal to amend extradition laws to allow suspects to be transferred to mainland China for trial, two marches drew extraordinary numbers into the streets for what have mostly been peaceful demonstrations. Organizers say more than a million attended an initial march on June 9, while an estimated 2 million people—out of Hong Kong’s total population of 7 million—joined another one week later. Critics of the proposed legislation, which the Hong Kong government suspended shortly after a protest ended violently on June 12, fear China would use it to extradite political opponents and dissidents on trumped up criminal charges. Protesters say this will erode the semi-autonomous territory’s cherished freedoms and carry signs that read: “Hong Kong Is Not China! Not Yet.” The former British colony was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, and was guaranteed 50 years of effective self-rule that would leave its way of life, and independent judiciary, unchanged. The deal does not expire until 2047, but attempts by Beijing to exert greater control over the territory in the meantime have cast doubt on the integrity of the so-called “one country, two systems” policy. The looming deadline is particularly troubling for Hong Kong’s youth, who have grown up with liberal values, and expectations, in an international city outside of China’s Great Firewall. “Freedoms, equality before the law and judicial justice are widely shared values among Hong Kong people across generations,” Ming Sing, associate professor of social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told TIME. “Beijing’s suppression of those values will invite persistent resistance.” Indeed, every attempt by Beijing to draw Hong Kong closer since reunification has been met with panic and protest, often led by students. Here’s a brief look at the major flashpoints. An attempt to introduce anti-subversion legislation drew fierce criticism from Hong Kongers worried that it would infringe on their freedoms. Commonly referred to as Article 23 after the constitutional clause requiring its introduction, the legislation prohibited treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the Chinese government, and outlawed theft of state secrets. It is believed that more than 500,000 people turned out for a march on July 1, 2003 to oppose it. Following the protest, Michael Tien, chairman of the Liberal Party, abruptly resigned from the government’s Executive Council after his calls to delay a vote on the bill were rejected. Without enough support to pass it, the bill was shelved indefinitely. “The huge number of protesters compelled a major government party to reverse its support for the bill,” Sing, of HKUST, told TIME. “It’s party chief was apprehensive of the subsequent political instability if the government did not withdraw it.”",A Brief History of Protest in Post-Handover Hong Kong,"June 20, 2019"

The federation also called for acts of “civil disobedience” in what is fast becoming not just a demonstration against divisive legislation but a push for greater political freedom and a mass repudiation of the territory’s sovereign power, Beijing. “I urge [Hong Kong’s top official] Carrie Lam to answer those demands by 5:00 p.m. The government needs to face the voice of the people; they need to respond,” prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong, 22, told TIME. Earlier, he told reporters: “Civil disobedience is the plan.” Hong Kong’s biggest circulating newspaper, the Apple Daily, gave the protesters’ demands front-page prominence in Thursday morning’s edition. Several versions of the ultimatum have been widely spread online. An anonymous “Open Letter to All Hong Kongers,” posted in an online forum heavily used by protesters, said that demonstrators were “forced to escalate” and asked “the general public for your understanding and sympathy … This pain is nothing to us: for as long as you stand there, either behind us or beside us, we will face whatever danger is ahead with unflinching hope.” Protesters began showing up outside Lam’s office from the mid-afternoon, holding signs that read “Culprit Carrie Lam.”",Hong Kong's Protesters Are Preparing to Return to the Streets After a Key Ultimatum Expires Today,"June 20, 2019"
764,Nadia Suleman,"The Canadian Arctic permafrost is thawing 70 years earlier than expected, a rate shocking a group of scientists who released the findings of their long-term study this month. A research team affiliated with the University of Alaska Fairbanks observed three sites over a period of 13 years between 2003 and 2016, according to a brief of their findings. Researchers discovered that a series of unusually warm summers triggered the rapid thawing, which is occurring 150 to 240 percent above the average rate between 1979 to 2000. Bill Cable, a co-author of the study and engineer at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, tells TIME that the primary purpose of the research was to gather baseline measurements in those areas that didn’t have any data regarding permafrost. While Cable didn’t join the project until 2008, he said that no one anticipated finding the results that they did. “We were all quite surprised when we went back later and saw how the landscape had been transformed,” says Cable. Throughout the duration of the study, Cable says the researchers would visit the site once every three years, accessing it via a Twin Otter propeller aircraft that is able to land without runways, which was necessary while conducting research in remote areas without commercial airports. “The amount that the permafrost thawed isn’t surprising necessarily — we see this in other locations. What is surprising is the speed at which this happened, especially for an area that is very cold permafrost,” says Cable. “We found that this really isn’t as stable as we think it is.” University of Alaska Fairbanks geophysics professor Vladimir E. Romanovsky told Reuters he was also shocked to see that land frozen for 1,000 or more years is thawing so quickly. “It’s an indication that the climate is now warmer than at any time in the last 5,000 or more years,” he said.","Canada's Permafrost Is Thawing 70 Years Earlier Than Expected, Study Shows.

765,Suyin Haynes,"When M was 7-years-old, her parents told her that she had had an operation as a young infant that meant she couldn’t have children. But, they weren’t telling her the whole story. M (who wishes not to be identified) is intersex, and only found out when she was 22-years-old, happening upon her medical history hidden in a wardrobe at home. “The operative report stated in black and white ‘testicular tissue’,” she says. “I felt wounded to the marrow.” No Box For Me, a new film premiering in the U.S. at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival on June 19, follows 27 year old M’s journey of self-acceptance and discovery as a young intersex person living in France. Alongside her is Deborah, 25, who is also intersex and writing her university dissertation on the subject. Living in bodies often seen as taboo by western society and western medicine, the film looks at the relationships intersex people have with their bodies and their identities in a world that is not always accepting of those born with a difference. When Swiss filmmaker Floriane Devigne was first commissioned to create the documentary, she was unsure of how to approach the portrayal of intersex people in a sensitive way. “At first, all I could see were all the pitfalls in treating such a subject,” she tells TIME. “There was a genuine risk of reinforcing stigma and stereotypes, and reducing these people solely to what makes them different, without ever managing to change or at least shake up that representation.” Devigne decided to explore how intersex people are treated by society, by filming M and Deborah in their ordinary environments over the course of several months, interspersed with home videos and animation segments. “Since society labels intersex as an “anomaly,” and a “disorder,” I thought it was important that I film people who are apparently perfectly “normal,” so that the viewer could identify with them.” It’s estimated that up to 1.7% of the world’s population are born with intersex traits, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The term is used to describe people born with sex characteristics, including genitals, testicles, ovaries and chromosome patterns, that do not fit binary notions of male or female bodies. Sometimes these differing characteristics may not be apparent at birth, and other variations may not be apparent until puberty, or at all. Often stigmatized, many intersex people are subject to violations of their human rights. One common practice worldwide is surgical intervention on intersex babies, toddlers and children to make their sex characteristics conform to binary sex stereotypes. It’s one of the film’s challenging themes, as M struggles to come to terms with her body as a result of undergoing a non-consensual surgical procedure when she was younger. Another man featured in the film, who is also intersex and interviewed by Deborah for her dissertation, likens such surgeries to rape, given their invasive nature on the bodies of people unable to consent. “It’s like a kind of mutilation,” says Devigne. “It takes a lot of time for people to build a life and an identity. It takes a lot of time to understand that it’s unfair to change the body, because society decides that the body of intersex people is not like other people.” Gradually, M comes to accept her body and her identity through meeting Deborah and other intersex people. Devigne says that for the four young intersex people featured in the film, it was the first time in their lives that they had met another person with a similar background to their own. “Everything became clearer through the birth of the friendship between them,” she says. Deborah and M also look to other intersex people around the world for information, such as intersex American activist Pidgeon Pagonis, whose videos are featured in No Box for Me.",New Documentary Explores the Realities of Being an Intersex Person and Their Treatment By Society,"June 19, 2019"
766,Katie Reilly,"A United Nations special report has found “credible evidence” warranting further investigation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year — a conclusion that follows a five-month investigation into what the U.N. special rapporteur called a “deliberate, premeditated execution.” In the 98-page report, released Wednesday, U.N. Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard called for bin Salman, often referred to by the initials MBS, and other top Saudi officials to be investigated for their role and asked the United Nations to demand a criminal investigation into Khashoggi’s killing, citing an “insufficient” response thus far from Saudi Arabia. She said “there is no reason why sanctions should not be applied against the Crown Prince and his personal assets.” “Indeed, this human rights inquiry has shown that there is sufficient credible evidence regarding the responsibility of the Crown Prince demanding further investigation,” she wrote. Saudi Arabia has consistently denied bin Salman’s involvement in the killing. Khashoggi, who was a Washington Post columnist and a vocal critic of bin Salman, was killed and dismembered in October 2018 inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. “It is the conclusion of the Special Rapporteur that Mr. Khashoggi has been the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under international human rights law,” Callamard wrote. “In addition, the execution of Mr. Khashoggi demands that those responsible be identified and held to account for their role in the execution of Mr. Khashoggi. Yet, some eight months after the execution of Mr. Khashoggi, the determination and assignment of individual responsibilities remain clouded in secrecy and lack of due process.”",U.N.

767,Mahita Gajanan,"An elderly woman sustained serious injuries after a collision with Prince William and Kate Middleton’s police convoy, police said Wednesday. The royal couple was en route to Windsor from London when the incident occurred in Richmond, south west London on Monday afternoon. A marked police motorcycle that was part of Prince William and Kate Middleton’s convoy hit the woman. A police watchdog is investigating the collision after receiving a referral from the London Metropolitan Police, according an Independent Office for Police Conduct spokesperson. “The woman, in her 80s, suffered serious injuries and was taken to a London hospital where she remains in a serious but stable condition,” the IOPC spokesperson said. “Our staff attended the scene of the incident and after careful consideration, we have launched an independent investigation. The investigation is in its very early stages and the officer involved is assisting our enquiries as a witness.” British media outlets, including the BBC, have identified the woman as Irene Mayor, 83. “I do like the royals, but the way my sister’s life has been endangered is completely unacceptable,” Mayor’s sister told The Daily Mail. A spokesperson for Kensington Palace told TIME that the royal couple was “deeply concerned and saddened to hear about the accident.” “The royal highnesses have sent their very best wishes to Irene and her family, and will stay in touch throughout every stage of the recovery,” the spokesperson said. The collision marks the second time this year a member of the public has been injured in a crash involving a member of the royal family. In January, Prince Philip crashed his Land Rover into a Kia while driving near the Queen’s Sandringham estate, injuring the two women who were in the car with a baby. In February, he voluntarily gave up his driver’s license.

768,Sally Hayden,"Outside a brown cement house in the eastern city of Beni in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, a government-employed psychologist is telling 19-year-old Merveille Mwenze that her husband has tested positive for Ebola. She’s seven months pregnant and nine months married, with so few possessions she doesn’t even own a chair to sit on and digest the news. Mwenze sways, processing the information, before she wonders aloud if the baby could have the virus too.  Mwenze and her 23-year-old husband, a pastor and community leader, share this home with another family, who watch in concern as a hygienist in protective gear begins the process of decontaminating everything in sight. “He was feeling bad,” Mwenze recalls. “I thought it was malaria. I knew about Ebola but I didn’t think about it in relation to my husband.” The pastor suffered a fever for several days in early June before going to hospital, where he was immediately isolated. Mwenze still has no idea how he contracted the virus and she hasn’t been tested, though she swears she doesn’t feel ill. Ebola’s incubation period is 21 days: there’s still time for symptoms to show. Mwenze’s husband is the third pastor in Beni, a city of more than 200,000, to test positive for Ebola in recent weeks. Aime Fatal Wabenga, a hygienist and public health promoter for the World Health Organisation, says some religious leaders have been rejecting Ebola vaccinations as a sign of faith. “They say ‘we believe in Jesus, Jesus will save us’,” he tells TIME. Roughly 135,000 people in the DRC have now been vaccinated against Ebola, a prevention measure that wasn’t widely available during the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. The DRC is currently experiencing the second-largest Ebola outbreak in recorded history, and the response has been critically slowed by violence and insecurity. Between January and mid-May this year, there were 130 attacks on healthcare facilities, according to E.U. figures, during which dozens of medics and civilians were injured, and some killed. In the affected provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, a large number of armed groups are active. Since August 2018, at least 2,087 people have contracted Ebola and 1,359 people have died — meaning a survival rate of around one third. The deadly disease, formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, was originally passed to humans by animals. It causes a high temperature, vomiting, headaches and muscle pain, and progresses to internal and external bleeding, severe dehydration and organ failure. Many Congolese victims still aren’t presenting at hospitals, with 25 percent of cases only identified in postmortems. Nearly 100 more “probable” deaths have been logged by the Health Ministry, largely in cases where medical teams weren’t able to conduct examinations because the patient was already buried. “Ebola is spreading very quickly and we are running after [it],” says Gaston Tshapenda, a government-employed incident manager, sitting in his office at the Ebola response coordination center for the Beni region, about 18 miles northeast of Mangina, where the outbreak began.

769,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"Twice in as many weeks protesters have thronged to Hong Kong’s streets in unprecedented numbers to demand the government withdraw a proposal that would allow extraditions to mainland China. Both times, Hong Kong’s top official refused to scrap the widely unpopular legislation. The protests, sit-ins and marches convulsing Asia’s financial capital over the past week have forced Chief Executive Carrie Lam to backpedal, but her apology and decision to indefinitely suspend the bill have done little to mollify detractors. The protesters want nothing short of her resignation and a full cancellation of the proposed legislation. One week after an estimated 1.03 million people joined a June 9 march, defiant protesters crammed back into the streets in even larger numbers for another repudiation of Lam, as well as to decry the police’s use of tear gas and rubber bullets just days prior. Organizers said nearly two million of the city’s seven million residents took part in the march, even after Lam had announced the bill’s suspension the previous day. The government insists the extradition measure will prevent Hong Kong from becoming a haven for criminals. But critics fear Beijing will use the provision to apprehend its many political opponents in this freewheeling and semi-autonomous enclave. The snowballing crisis has exposed a deep-seated rift between the former British colony and its sovereign power China. For the second time in five years, young, angry protesters are out on the streets pushing back against perceived meddling from Beijing, and fighting to sustain the freedoms that distinguish this territory from the mainland. As they see it, the autonomy of China’s freest city is at stake. Here’s why they are unwilling to backdown without a full cancellation of the extradition proposal. The proposed bill would amend two existing laws and allow Hong Kong to transfer suspects to countries that it currently lacks a formal extradition agreement with. Crucially, one of those jurisdictions would be mainland China. The update to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance was proposed in February ostensibly to prosecute a Hong Konger for the murder of his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan. But Taiwan has sharply criticized the bill, and says it won’t sign any deal that would entangle Hong Kong with China’s opaque legal system.",Why Hong Kong Protesters Aren't Calling It Quits After the Suspension of a Controversial Extradition Bill,"June 19, 2019"
770,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"On a footbridge leading to the Hong Kong’s Legislative Council building, about three dozen people are intoning “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord,” giving barely a pause after the short, four-line verse ends before starting it again. Around the corner in Tamar Park, by the Central Government Offices, a group is singing the same hymn — and so is another down the road outside the Chief Executive’s Office. The song is performed as a round. Its minor-key melody is heard everywhere at the mass demonstrations against Hong Kong’s controversial extradition bill and has become the movement’s anthem. The reason? Religious gatherings are exempt from the definition of a “gathering” or “assembly” under Hong Kong’s Public Order Ordinance and are thus more difficult to police. The Christian hymn was written by the Indiana-born Linda Stassen in 1974. According to the Complete Book of Hymns, Stassen was a follower of the Jesus People movement and wrote the song as an assignment for a music composition class, with the words inspired by the early Church. The song has since been included in many Christian hymnals, its popularity stemming from its austere, beautiful simplicity. Protestors young and old have joined in the singing of the song since taking to the streets on June 9 to oppose the contentious bill. The proposed legislation would allow China to extradite fugitives from the semi-autonomous enclave for the first time. The bill’s detractors say Beijing will use it to apprehend dissidents and critics of the communist regime, threatening the city’s cherished freedoms.

771,Julia Webster,"As it continues to explore new business models that may work in a world focused on privacy rather than broadly sharing data online, Facebook on Tuesday revealed plans for its own global digital currency, Libra, which aims to allow users to make purchases or send money with close to zero transaction fees.  Facebook said it hopes Libra will make it easier for the estimated 1.7 billion unbanked adults worldwide to access banking services and transfer money electronically. “Just as people can use their phones to message friends anywhere in the world today, with Libra, the same can be done with money — instantly, securely and at a low cost,” Facebook said in a Libra white paper. Users will be able to make transactions with Libra by 2020, Facebook says, both through a standalone app called Calibra as well as with Facebook’s own family of apps. Unlike bitcoin and some similar offerings, the price of Libra is tied to low-risk assets, which should prevent the speculative behavior and wild price swings plaguing other digital currencies. The currency will be overseen by the Libra Association, a Switzerland-based collective of more than a dozen companies, including Visa, Uber and Mastercard, each of whom have invested at least $10 million in the technology. Users of Libra will pay $1 to use Libra which will sit in a bank account and earn interest which will pay the Libra Association. Libra arrives at a turbulent time for Facebook. It has made little progress in recovering from the Cambridge Analytica scandal that undermined the public’s trust in the company. It’s expecting as much as a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission over that and other data breaches. And multiple Democratic presidential candidates have called for big technology companies like Facebook and its rivals to be broken up as monopolies.  A lack of trust in Facebook could be the company’s biggest hurdle in making Libra a success, experts say. “It’s a bold and strategic move that has clear risks as well as opportunities tied to it,” Wedbush Securities Analyst Dan Ives told the Associated Press. “For now, it really comes down to execution, and how comfortable consumers feel around Facebook and cryptocurrency.” Facebook has promised that Libra users’ financial histories will be kept private and separate from Facebook data. But some experts worry about concentrating all that data in one place regardless. “The whole of point of having an entity like Bitcoin is to exactly avoid one party having all the data on who is paying whom,” says Carsten Sorensen, associate professor at the Department of Management at the London School of Economics. “One possible reading is that this is an attempt from Facebook to try and divert a little bit of all the flack it had for all its invasion of our privacy.” Others argue that Facebook is wise to relegate oversight of Libra to a consortium. “Facebook is just one of the dozens of members who are going to run it, and so I think that’s how they are addressing the concern,” says Jerry Brito, executive director of the Coin Center, a cryptocurrency research and advocacy non-profit.

772,Anna Pujol-Mazzini,"A dozen Chinese tourists, armed with their cameras, are capturing the sights, standing on sandstone cliffs looking over dusty plains 1500 feet below. The sky is clear: in the distance, hundreds of villages on the plains of Dogon country stretch as far as the horizon. Behind them, hardly visible, a handful of Malian soldiers wait with assault rifles at the ready. Their military green outfits and flak jackets blend in with the light brown cliffs. The tourists take pictures of the view and pose with the villagers who welcomed them earlier with a few songs, an activity organized by Mali’s Ministry of Tourism, which says it wants to show visitors “the real Africa.” Then they return to their convoy of vehicles, surrounded by armed men dispatched by the government to ensure their protection.  Just four days before their arrival, an hour’s drive south in Bankass, armed men slit the throat of a nearby village chief before carrying his lifeless body away on a motorbike.  The Bandiagara cliffs, in central Mali, are one of West Africa’s most renowned tourist attractions. Today, they are at the heart of the new frontline of Mali’s 7-year-long conflict. Over 500 people have died in the violence in central Mali in the past six months alone, where the rise of Islamist extremist groups and ethnic militias has turned into deadly violence between Fulani herders and Dogon and Bambara farmers. In March, 160 Fulani civilians — among them children, pregnant women, elderly people — were killed in their homes in the Ogossagou village by suspected Dogon militiamen. On June 10, at least 35 Dogon civilians were shot and burned alive in their village by suspected Fulani militiamen, only a few miles away from the cliffs. The trip is part of the government’s latest strategy to revive a once-thriving tourist industry. A decade ago, people came from all over the world to see Mali’s landscapes and monuments, which include four UNESCO World Heritage sites. That industry virtually disappeared after violence surged in 2012, and countries like France, the United States and the United Kingdom warned their citizens to avoid holidays in the country and most major tour operators pulled out. Now, the country, home to more than 18 million people, is hoping to tap into the world’s biggest market for tourism: China. The visitors here in Bandiagara are tour operators and journalists, in town to assess the possibility of offering travel packages to their customers back home. The destination was a hard sell. It is fast becoming an impossible one. Trouble in Mali’s tourism industry started brewing as early as 2009, with a series of high-profile kidnappings of Western tourists and aid workers that were attributed to Tuareg rebels and Islamist extremist groups. In early 2012, the country eventually descended into full-blown conflict after Tuareg independentists, who had long felt marginalized by the government, launched an uprising in the north. The rebellion was quickly hijacked by jihadist groups, and by that summer, they were ruling nearly half of the country.",Violence in Mali Put an End to a Thriving Tourist Industry.

As Google itself put it, falafel is “the best thing that ever happened to chickpeas – with the possible exception of hummus, of course.” Although, as Google notes, the origins of falafel are unclear, it is a treat that has been enjoyed across cultures for centuries. India is by far the largest exporter of chickpeas in the world, producing over 9 million metric tons of the crop in 2017, according to Statista. Australia is a distant second at 2 million metric tons. Israel has long had a love affair with the crispy chickpea delight, paying homage to the popular street food with its own song: And We Have Falafel. While some claim the treat has Egyptian roots, Google notes that the nation puts its own twist on the deep-fried balls with their variation dubbed “ta’amiya,” which uses fava beans instead of chickpeas. Different cultures also use a variety of toppings to put their own spin on their falafel sandwiches. Google notes that fried eggplant is popular in Iraq, while mango sauce is popular in India and hot sauce in Yemen. Falafel is often found in areas with prominent Middle-Eastern or Jewish populations, as well as large metropolitan areas like New York City, where falafel has endured as a popular street food. And falafel fans should know that the world’s largest falafel was prepared by ten chefs at the Landmark Hotel in Amman, Jordan, in 2012.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam shelved the bill and issued a public apology on Tuesday but has not acceded to all the demands of the protesters, which include canceling the bill entirely. “It’s been pulled back,” Trump said, “and it’ll be pulled back further.” When asked during an interview with TIME in the Oval Office on June 17 if he supports the demands of the demonstrators, Trump said, “I’m going to let the protesters speak for themselves.

775,Vera Bergengruen,"A new lawsuit filed on Tuesday alleges that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke the law by allowing President Donald Trump to seize the notes from a key meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and failing to take any steps to preserve records of their other face-to-face meetings. The lawsuit filed by American Oversight and Democracy Forward, two progressive non-profit government watchdog organizations, says that the Federal Records Act requires Pompeo to preserve the meeting notes prepared by State Department employees. “President Trump has taken unusual, and in some cases extreme, measures to conceal the details of these meetings, not only from the public at large, but also from key members of his administration,” the filing says. As a result, there is a “total absence” of a detailed record of Trump’s five in-person interactions with Putin over the last two years, even in classified files, the filing says. Tuesday’s lawsuit comes a week before the next G20 summit, which will take place in Osaka, Japan, on June 28 and 29. Although there is no official meeting planned, the Kremlin has said the two leaders could meet informally. “On the eve of another meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin, Secretary Pompeo’s actions ensure that our relationship with Russia remains shrouded in secrecy, with the American government left in the dark,” said Anne Harkavy, the executive director of Democracy Forward. While the lawsuit alleges that Pompeo repeatedly failed to document the president’s meetings with Putin, it focuses on Trump’s actions at the G20 in Hamburg in July 2017, where he met with the Russian president for two hours with no aides present. Trump “took possession of written notes documenting the meeting from the official who created them” and instructed them not to discuss what was said at the meeting with other members of his administration, the filing says, citing details first reported by the Washington Post. Not only was there no official read-out or public statement, but the absence of documentation left White House and State Department aides scrambling to find out what had been said. This caused confusion when the Russian side claimed a number of agreements had been reached. “We aren’t talking about old outtakes from ‘The Apprentice,’” American Oversight Executive Director Austin Evers told TIME. “This may be the only written record of a meeting between two heads of state, and the interpreter’s notes can’t be seized or destroyed just because President Trump might want them hidden.”",Watchdogs Sue Trump Administration Over Missing Notes From Putin Meeting,"June 18, 2019"
776,Joseph Hincks,"U.S. allies in the Middle East have held back from a full-throated endorsement of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s claim that it is “unmistakable” Iran perpetrated a June 13 attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.  Despite a grainy video that purports to show Iranian military personnel removing an unexploded limpet mine from the side of one of the two ships attacked, allies in the region and elsewhere remain unconvinced by U.S. claims of Iranian culpability. Like the U.S., Britain’s government has blamed Iran for the attack, while a senior Japanese official dismissed the evidence offered by America as “speculation”; Germany and the U.N. have called for an independent investigation.  But it is in the Middle East where the impact of escalation is likely to be most acute. The prospect of military confrontation appears to have risen again after Iran, which denies responsibility for the tanker attack, announced on Monday that it would breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the landmark 2015 nuclear deal that the U.S. pulled out of last year—despite U.N. inspectors determining Iran had been abiding by its terms. In response to Iran’s stated intent to break with what Trump called “the worst deal in history,” Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan announced he had authorized approximately 1,000 additional U.S. troops for “defensive purposes” in the Gulf. In an interview with TIME the same day Trump called the alleged Iranian attacks “very minor” and cast doubt on the U.S. going to war to protect international oil supplies. But tensions remain high. Here’s how American allies in the region are responding: “Iranian recklessness has reached unprecedented levels,” Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman told newspaper Asharq al-Awsat in an interview published Sunday. “The kingdom does not seek war in the region,” he added, “but we will not hesitate to deal with any threat to our people, sovereignty and vital interests.” Even in the long context of Saudi Arabia–Iran enmity, Bin Salman, known as MBS, has been brazen in his criticism of the Islamic Republic. As defense minister, he dubbed Iran’s Supreme Leader “the new Hitler” and said the regime’s “extremist ideology” made dialogue impossible. In May, a Saudi newspaper owned by MBS’ brother ran an unattributed editorial urging the U.S. to direct “calculated surgical” airstrikes at Tehran. “Hit them hard,” its editor-in-chief Faisal J Abbas urged on Twitter. Riyadh (like the U.S.) also blames Iran for explosions that struck two of its oil ships in May, and a drone attack on an oil pipeline claimed by Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen.  Iran’s foreign ministry on Monday criticized the Saudi leader’s “militaristic, crisis-based approach” and “wrong policies” which it said were responsible for escalating tensions in the region.",How U.S. Allies in the Middle East are Responding to Rising Tensions with Iran,"June 18, 2019"

The former British colony, now a semi-autonomous region of China, has been rocked by a week of massive protests as millions of people took to the streets to oppose the bill, which for the first time would allow criminal suspects to be transferred to mainland China for trial. Critics accuse Lam of being a “puppet” of Beijing, which they say is steadily chipping away at the city’s freedoms.  “I have heard you loud and clear and have reflected deeply on all that has transpired,” Lam said at a press conference.

Speaking to reporters shortly after Lam’s address, he said the demonstrations will not cease and further actions are being considered. An earlier demand that police retract their designation of a June 12 protest as a “riot” was met late Monday. Local media also reported late Tuesday night local time that 8 arrested protesters were released without charge.

778,Tessa Berenson,"Facing twin challenges in the Persian Gulf, President Donald Trump said in an interview with TIME Monday that he might take military action to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, but cast doubt on going to war to protect international oil supplies. “I would certainly go over nuclear weapons,” the president said when asked what moves would lead him to consider going to war with Iran, “and I would keep the other a question mark.” Just hours earlier, Iran announced an escalation of its nuclear program, saying that within 10 days it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium that was set under a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Last week, U.S. officials blamed Iran for attacks against Norwegian and Japanese oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Trump described those and other recent attacks attributed by administration officials to Iran as limited. “So far, it’s been very minor,” Trump told TIME. Trump’s comments, made in a nearly hour-long interview with TIME, struck a different tone than the public stance of the Pentagon and other Republicans in Washington. They also cut against a series of recent diplomatic and military moves that his Administration has made amid escalating tensions with Tehran. While Trump was speaking to TIME, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan announced he had authorized approximately 1,000 additional troops for “defensive purposes” in the region. “The recent Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have received on hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region,” Shanahan said in a statement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has insisted the U.S. is “considering a full range of options” in response to the recent attacks. When asked on CBS Sunday if that included a military response, he responded, “Of course.” On Tuesday, Pompeo is going to visit U.S. Central Command, the Tampa-based headquarters which oversees all military operations in the Middle East. Speaking to TIME, Trump argued that the Gulf of Oman is less strategically important for the United States now than it used to be, citing China and Japan as nations that still rely on the region for significant proportions of their oil. “Other places get such vast amounts of oil there,” Trump said. “We get very little. We have made tremendous progress in the last two and a half years in energy. And when the pipelines get built, we’re now an exporter of energy. So we’re not in the position that we used to be in in the Middle East where … some people would say we were there for the oil.”",Exclusive: President Trump Calls Alleged Iranian Attack on Oil Tankers 'Very Minor',"June 18, 2019"
779,Tony Capaccio / Bloomberg,"The Trump administration will send about 1,000 more American troops to the Middle East as tensions between the U.S. and Iran continue to rise. “I have authorized approximately 1,000 additional troops for defensive purposes to address air, naval, and ground-based threats in the Middle East,” Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said in a statement Monday evening. He offered no details on where the troops would be deployed or what their missions might be. The U.S. has accused the Iranians of being behind attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week. The Tehran government has denied any involvement in the episode. “The recent Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have received on hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region,” Shanahan said. “The United States does not seek conflict with Iran. The action today is being taken to ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region and to protect our national interests,” he added. Earlier Monday, the Pentagon released new photos and a timeline that it said bolstered U.S. accusations that Iran was responsible for the attacks in the Gulf of Oman. President Donald Trump said last week that “Iran did it,” and U.K. officials said it was “almost certain” that Tehran was behind the attacks. A Navy explosives expert, who is not part of the U.S. investigation, told reporters that while the explosive only damaged the tanker Kokuka Courageous, he cannot infer what the attackers intended to accomplish.","U.S. to Send 1,000 Additional Troops to the Mideast Over Tanker Attacks","June 17, 2019"

Toronto police said they identified four victims who were injured in the shooting. A Toronto police representative told TIME that the injuries were not life-threatening, though the specific extent to their injuries is unknown. Police took three people into custody and recovered two firearms, according to a statement from the police department. Crowds gathered at a rally for the Raptors were seen running from the area after gunshots were reported during a parade, according to videos shared on social media. Earlier in the day, police said there were reports of a woman shot.   Reporters and witnesses in the area shared video footage of people running. Some were injured in a “stampede of people” fleeing from the area, according to one witness. Police have asked for anyone with photos or video footage from the area to share it with them. The ceremony to honor the Raptors was interrupted due to the incident, when Raptors broadcaster Matt Devlin came out on stage to announce that “we’re dealing with a situation that’s not far from here. This is serious.” Proceedings later restarted as police and emergency services responded to the scene.

781,Ciara Nugent,"Millions of people in Argentina and Uruguay woke up Sunday morning without electrical power after what an Argentinian national energy supplier called “a massive failure of the grid.” While sporadic, small-scale blackouts are not unheard of in that part of the world, the sheer scale of the outage was “unprecedented,” as Argentinian President Mauricio Macri said. The outage delayed local elections in some provinces of Argentina and disrupted daily life for millions. It took several hours for authorities to begin restoring the power supply across the two countries. It’s still unclear exactly how the power outage happened, and why it caused such widespread disruption. Here’s what we know so far about Argentina and Uruguay’s blackout. 44 million people live in Argentina and another 4 million in Uruguay. The outage affected all of both countries, apart from the Tierra del Fuego, a sparsely populated archipelago off the southern tip of mainland Argentina that has its own electrical system. The power supply in some towns in southern Paraguay and Brazil was also interrupted. Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, was particularly badly hit. Train and subway services were suspended while cars and buses crawled along unaided by signal lights. Thousands lost water access, because the city’s water system relies partly on electrical pumps. Elevators in apartment blocks stopped working, leaving elderly and less mobile people unable to move in and out of their homes. 90% of Argentina had power by Sunday night, the country’s state news agency reported, while Uruguay’s state energy utility said 98.5% of services had been restored. It’s not entirely clear what caused such a widespread loss of power. Argentina’s energy ministry claimed the outage had begun with “a failure in the transmission of electricity” from the Yacyretá Dam, a power plant on the Paraná River along the Argentina-Paraguay border. The binational body that runs the Yacyretá Dam denied that its power station had caused the problem, saying it was in normal working order.",Millions Were Left Without Power in Argentina and Uruguay After an 'Extraordinary' System Failure.

782,TIME Staff,"The international face of Hong Kong’s democracy movement, Joshua Wong was released from prison in Hong Kong Monday at a critical juncture in the city’s fight for political freedom. Just the day before, a huge demonstration in the heart of the city forced Hong Kong’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, to issue an apology for her handling of a bill that would allow for the extradition of fugitives to mainland China. Sunday’s march was the second massive demonstration in a week to call for the withdrawal of a bill that has united virtually all segments of society—from teens to grandparents, student radicals to conservative business figures—in opposition to it. While the government says the bill is necessary to stop Hong Kong from becoming a haven for criminals, critics say it will be used by China to apprehend dissidents and political opponents, thereby threatening the semi-autonomous enclave’s cherished freedoms. Wong was in prison for both demonstrations, completing a sentence for his role int he 2014 democracy uprising known as the Umbrella Revolution. But he is now out and eager for the fray. At 21, Wong is already a seasoned organizer, and his release will be a boost for a movement that has been characterized as leaderless. He went straight from prison to address a rally outside Hong Kong’s legislature, and spoke to TIME immediately afterward. How do you plan to get involved in the protests now that you’re out of jail? I believe more and more rallies, protests, and marches will happen. If Carrie Lam refuses to step down, she needs to pay her political price. What I mean is that it’s time for her to end her political career. Are you afraid of going back to prison? [This won’t be] the final time for me to serve a jail sentence. I believe the government will prosecute me again, but things can’t defeat me, just make me stronger. At least I hope to prove, to let people to know, that even though I’ve been jailed … I’ve not stepped backwards. I still stand on the front lines with the people in Hong Kong. The current demand is for Carrie Lam to step down and withdraw the bill.

783,TIME Staff,"Activists and striking students gathered outside Hong Kong’s Legislative Council on Monday to listen to freed democracy campaigner Joshua Wong on the day he was released from prison—and one day after massive protests forced an abject climb down from the government over highly contentious legislation. From mid-morning, protesters braved the stormy weather in their push for the withdrawal of a divisive extradition bill and the ouster of the semi-autonomous enclave’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, whose championing of the bill has proven to be a disastrous miscalculation. Wong began addressing the cheering crowd at around 2:30 p.m. local time. “Just this morning, I left prison,” he told the crowd in Cantonese. “I regret that I was not able to participate in [Sunday’s] protest. But in my prison clothes, I watched it all happen. “Our demand is that the government totally withdraw the bill, and retract [its depiction of] the demonstrations as a riot, and condemn police violence.” “On TV, I saw Carrie Lam speaking in an interview. She was crying tears, while Hong Kong protesters are bleeding.” Huge numbers of Hongkongers brought the city’s downtown areas to a standstill Sunday as they peacefully marched against a legislative amendment that would allow fugitives to be extradited to China for the first time. The government says that the extradition measure is necessary to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a haven for criminals, but many in Hong Kong fear that Beijing will use the provision to come after its political opponents in Hong Kong. The size of the march prompted an apology from Lam, but her mea culpa has only infuriated protesters, who see it as insincere. They are also dissatisfied by her promise to postpone the bill, demanding that it be dropped altogether.",Freed Hong Kong Activist Joshua Wong Addresses Rally on the Day He Is Released From Prison,"Updated: June 17, 2019 5:17 AM ET"
784,TIME Staff,"Prominent freedom campaigner Joshua Wong was released from prison Monday morning local time—a day after one of the largest street protests in Hong Kong’s history forced an apology from the city’s top official over a divisive extradition bill. Wong, 22, was completing a three month sentence for his role in the 2014 democracy protests known as the Umbrella Revolution. His release from jail at a critical juncture in the city’s push for greater political freedoms will give a morale boost to youthful protesters and has the potential to make the authorities nervous. A media scrum in the sweltering June heat greeted the young dissident. Members of his Demosisto party chanted “Oppose China extradition! Oppose the evil law!” as Wong walked out to meet the press. He thanked Hong Kong people for their support and called for the city’s embattled leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, to step down. “It’s hard for us to believe a liar,” he said. He also vowed to join the fight against the extradition bill and urged the international community to help preserve Hong Kong’s “unique standing.” In an article written for TIME while still in jail, Wong appealed for the world to keep watching local developments. “A victory for Beijing is a victory for authoritarianism everywhere,” he wrote. “Keeping an eye on this place sends an important message to Chinese authorities that democracy, not authoritarianism, is the way of the future.” He quickly returned to Twitter after his release to announce his solidarity with protesters. Wong is expected to speak at a rally later today outside the legislature, where protesters have been gathering since the middle of the morning. Many of them are young striking students. “I want to support Hong Kong and I want to see Carrie Lam step down,” said Olivia Ho, 15. “I have a test tomorrow but this is about Hong Kong’s future and my future.”",Hong Kong Freedom Campaigner Joshua Wong Released From Prison as Protesters Vow to Fight On,"Updated: June 19, 2019 1:18 AM ET | Originally published: June 17, 2019"
785,TIME Staff,"A man being hailed as a martyr of the Hong Kong freedom movement was mourned at an impassioned memorial Sunday, with protesters accusing the city’s top official Carrie Lam of being responsible for his death. “We have to mourn the martyr—he is a martyr. Carrie Lam should apologize to the martyr,” said Daphne Tsoi, a 28-year-old teacher. The vigil was held at the so-called Lennon Wall—a part the Legislative Council building that became a focal point during the 2014 Umbrella Revolution, when protesters plastered the wall with brightly colored messages of hope and liberty. Thousands of mourners bowed solemnly before holding up their mobile phones to create a sea of light all the way up Harcourt Road, in the shadow of Hong Kong’s Central Government Offices and legislature. The dead man, surnamed Leung, 35, plunged to his death the night before after unfurling a banner on scaffolding at the Pacific Place mall in the city’s Admiralty district—the site of violent clashes with the police on Wednesday that left more than 80 injured. His banner called for the withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill that would allow fugitives to be sent to the mainland for the first time. Lam has argued that the bill is necessary to stop Hong Kong from becoming a haven for criminals. But critics fear that Beijing will use the extradition provision to apprehend dissidents and political opponents, posing a serious threat to semi-autonomous Hong Kong’s way of life. Leung’s death has galvanized massive protests against the bill and dangerously raised the stakes in the struggle between Hong Kong’s democracy movement and the Beijing backed administration. Hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life marched through the city Sunday, shutting down major thoroughfares and calling for Lam’s ouster. Thousands formed long queues at the site of Leung’s death during the day, leaving floral and origami tributes and saying prayers.",Hong Kong's Freedom Protesters Mourn Their Martyr at an Emotional Vigil,"June 16, 2019"
786,Amy Gunia,"Massive protests shut down the streets around Hong Kong’s government offices Sunday to demand that the city’s leader step down, and a controversial extradition bill be withdrawn, a day after the government suspended the measure in response to snowballing unrest. The size of the demonstration — organizers estimate some 2 million people attended, making it likely the largest in living memory — forced the city’s top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, to issue an apology. “The Chief Executive acknowledges that her government work has been unsatisfactory, leading to confusion and conflict in society, and leading to disappointment and heartbreak,” read an official statement issued in Chinese. “The Chief Executive would like to apologize to the city’s citizens and is open to receiving criticism [on how to] further improve and provide better services for the broader society.” Neither the apology nor the debacle over the bill will mollify her opponents. Jimmy Sham, convenor of protest organizer the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), told reporters Sunday morning that demonstrators would not step down until the bill was dropped entirely. Lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan said that demonstrators were also demanding that Lam take back her characterization of the bill’s opponents as rioters. A minute’s silence was meanwhile held Sunday for a 35-year-old man, who plunged to his death from scaffolding on the side of a shopping mall late Saturday after unfurling a banner denouncing the extradition legislation. The man’s surname was given by local media as Leung. During his hours-long standoff with police negotiators he wore a raincoat on which were scrawled the words, “Carrie Lam is killing Hong Kong.” Protesters hailed him as a “martyr” on social media and many on Sunday carried white flowers to commemorate him. Well-wishers formed long queues, more than a kilometer long, to leave floral tributes outside the Pacific Place mall, where floral bouquets and origami tributes were piled high and memorial services were held. “I hope these words will help carry him into the next life,” said a 75-year-old woman named Luk, who was reading Buddhist prayers aloud.",Massive Protests Force Apology From Hong Kong Leader Carrie Lam for Divisive Extradition Bill,"Updated: June 16, 2019 4:16 PM ET"

788,Tara Law,"A woman whose photo went viral after she was allegedly beaten in a homophobic attack in London this month has spoken up in a Guardian op-ed about the experience of her face being used as what she calls “cheap clickbait.” The woman, whose name is published as “Chris,” was photographed beside her date, Dr. Melania Geymonat, after being beaten and robbed on a bus by a group of men who demanded that the two women kiss. The photo multiplied across the internet after Geymonat posted it on Facebook, writing that the pair had refused. Five men were later arrested on suspicion of attacking the women. In her op-ed, Chris writes that looking back, what angers her the most is not the attack itself, but what came afterward. “My persisting anger is directed not towards the idiots on the bus but the reduction of my battered face to cheap clickbait,” Chris writes. According to Chris’s op-ed, the press coverage of the incident was strange for her to read. Many articles described her as a lesbian, while she identifies as bisexual. She also wrote that she doesn’t remember the attack very clearly, and doesn’t recall why it started. What she said frustrates her the most, however, was the “commodification and exploitation” of her face. She expressed frustration that the image was expropriated by conservative publications and politicians – especially because she feels that people only cared about the attack because she and Geymonat were “white, feminine, draped in pretty hair.” She wrote that while some people may find the attack surprising, it shouldn’t come as a shock, saying “people of colour, indigenous people, transgender people, disabled people, queer people, poor people, women and migrants” have long been targeted by violence. “I have evaded much of the violence and oppression imposed on so many others by our capitalist, white supremacist, patriarchal system because of the privileges I enjoy by dint of my race, health, education and conventional gender presentation.

Lam has faced unprecedented pressure to scrap the legislation, which its critics say could become a backdoor for China to round up political and commercial adversaries. An estimated one million people joined what is believed to have been the city’s largest ever protest on June 9, and a second round of demonstrations ended violently on Wednesday. “After repeated internal deliberations over the last two days I now announce that the government has decided to suspend the legislative amendment exercise,” Lam said at a press conference, adding that the central government in Beijing supported the decision to take more time for discussion. Read more: Hong Kong Is on the Frontlines of a Global Battle For Freedom Reiterating her position that the legislation is necessary to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a “haven” for criminals, Lam told reporters the government had not provided adequate explanation to the public. The bill, she maintained, was designed to bring justice in the case of a Hong Kong man accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan in February 2018. “The original urgency to pass the bill this legislative year is perhaps no longer there,” Lam said, a reference to statements from Taiwanese officials that it would not seek the suspect’s return under the proposed legislation. She added that a majority of lawmakers support the bill and it would not be completely withdrawn, as the protesters demand. “As there are still loopholes in our [extradition] mechanism we are not in a position to retract this bill,” Lam said, as that would suggest that the legislation was not justified. Suspending the bill came as an abrupt about-face after Lam’s attempt to fast-track the legislation earlier this week. She said there is no timeframe for reopening debate on the matter. Lam said she “felt heartbroken” by the violence, adding that “this is a time for a responsible government… to restore as quickly as possible the calmness of society.”",Hong Kong Suspends Controversial China Extradition Bill After Massive Protests,"Updated: June 18, 2019 11:56 PM ET | Originally published: June 15, 2019"
790,Currie Engel,"A small island, three miles off the coast of Ireland, has been making efforts to attract new residents, touting its newly established internet connectivity as a draw for remote workers. Just a ferry-ride away from the village of Burtonport in northwest Ireland sits Arranmore Island—an island known for its history, fishing culture, beautiful landscapes, and now, its high-speed internet. The island has been working with the Irish mobile operator company, Three Ireland, to become the first Irish island to have an offshore internet hub. Three’s efforts have brought high-speed wireless connection to the 469 people currently living there. But the island is ready for more. With a population that has spent years in decline, Arranmore seeks to revive its economic and social color. Arranmore has been touting its new high-speed internet in an effort to attract new residents, whom locals suggest could work remotely with their new resource. They’ve even written letters to America and Australia, according to reports, in an effort to increase the number of people living on the island. A campaign has been launched directed at those who have emigrated from Ireland as a way of enticing them back home. According to CNN, the letter detailed the benefits of island life, explaining, “there are less people here than would fit in a couple of Amtrak carriages but enough musicians and good Irish whiskey to keep the party going well into the night.” The lack of wireless connection in Ireland’s rural areas has been an ongoing issue for the country. Despite government promises of a National Broadband Plan, which is attempting to bring high speed broadband to every citizen and workplace in the country, the government’s rollout has been slow, and Ireland’s many inhabited islands have yet to see results. So Arranmore decided to take matters into its own hands. The Irish Independent reports that Three was able to set up a dish on the mainland which connects to a hub on the island, delivering faster download and upload speeds. This “hub” is a shared space that has been named MODAM, an acronym for an Irish phrase which means “Arranmore Digital Hub.” Spaces can be rented out for €20 a day. The Independent also reported that Three has helped Arranmore fund the purchase of equipment for this new facility, which now has video conferencing, smart technology, and telecommunication abilities.",This Remote Irish Island Is Hoping To Lure New Residents,"June 14, 2019"
791,Jasmine Aguilera,"Exactly a year after the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo began, health officials underscored that a coordinated, consistent global response is necessary to keep the public-health emergency of international concern under control. “I never thought that, after one year, we’d be talking about the same outbreak,” United Nations Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator David Gressly said at a press conference Thursday. “It will be a long fight. It will be hard fight. We need vigilance. It will take discipline.” The outbreak, which has infected around 2,600 people and killed almost 1,700 since it began a year ago, was declared an international emergency after the World Health Organization (WHO) on July 14 confirmed a case of Ebola in the DRC city of Goma, a transit hub near the Rwandan border that has about 2 million residents. On Wednesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced that another case had been confirmed in Goma—and while the two diagnoses do not seem to be related, the news has raised fears of continuing spread in the populous city. In June, two people, including a 5-year-old boy, also died from the Ebola virus in neighboring Uganda. Gressly also said Thursday that the Rwandan border with the DRC remains open, despite earlier reports to the contrary. He emphasized that the WHO, upon declaring the outbreak an international public-health emergency after three times declining to so, directed countries not to restrict travel or trade with the DRC. Doing so, the WHO’s Margaret Harris said, just “sends an epidemic underground.” Instead, Gressly said ending the outbreak will depend on consistent funding from the international community and coordinated efforts to fill in geographic gaps in Ebola response, so the disease cannot spread further. It is also crucial to stop interruptions in care due to attacks on and mistrust of health care workers, he said. Dr. Henry Walke, incident manager for the CDC’s 2018 CDC Ebola response, told reporters on Thursday that the CDC is still committed to fighting the outbreak one year later. Walke said that the rate of new infections does not appear to be slowing down, and that the CDC is planning to double the number of experts it has deployed in the country from 15 to 30. Walke said that the efforts to combat the outbreak have been hampered by the unstable security situation in the area of the outbreak and the mistrust of public healthcare in the affected communities. “If the security situation improves, we would rapidly increase our staffing,” Walke said.",The Congo Ebola Outbreak Began a Year Ago.

792,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: Back in 2017, Turkey agreed to purchase Russia’s advanced S-400 air defense missile system over the strong objections of both the US and NATO, of which Turkey is a member. Turkey has been adamant it will follow through with the purchase, and delivery of the missile system is expected in July. Late last week, the Pentagon announced that Turkey would be cut out from the F-35 fighter jet program unless it changed course; this week, the US House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution condemning Turkey for its purchase and urged sanctions should the deal go through. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated this week that the purchase from Russia is a “done deal.” Why It Matters: Because Turkey is taking concrete steps towards breaking ranks with the U.S.. Turkey has been a member of NATO for 67 years, and while relations between Washington and Ankara have been testy at times, it has been decades since they’ve shown this kind of genuine strain. Turkey seems determined to push the boundaries of the relationship, because not only are the Americans upset that Turkey decided to purchase weapons from perennial-NATO foe Russia (or that the missile system is incompatible with NATO systems), but the installation of the S-400 system will compromise American jets—the radar system on the S-400 can undermine the F-35’s stealth capabilities, and just as importantly, the installation of the system could give Russian military personnel a first-hand look at the vulnerabilities of the F-35. The Turkey purchase also represents yet another potential flashpoint between the U.S. and Russia, and should the deal be completed, it will arguably be Russia’s most tangible success sowing division among Western allies to date. What Happens Next: While Erdogan maintains that the S-400 purchase is no longer up for debate, there is a small chance that Turkey decides to delay the delivery to avoid the ire of Washington (though doing so would annoy Russia). But that seems unlikely at this point; the US will officially cut Turkey from the F-35 program on July 31 or when Turkey accepts delivery of the missile system, whichever comes first. Meanwhile, the US will begin the process of sanctioning Turkey under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). As of this writing, it’s an open question of how severe US sanctions will be. The most draconian option for Washington would be to broadly hit the still-fragile Turkish economy and jeopardize Turkey’s access on IMF financing, but it’s more likely that the sanctions will target the Turkish military’s procurement division. At the upcoming G20 meeting in Japan, it will be critical to watch the meeting between Erdogan and Trump. We should have a better sense of where things stand by end of June. Another thing worth paying attention to: where Turkey places the S-400 systems, which are mobile. If it places the systems near the Mediterranean in defense of North Cyprus, it could stoke tensions with both Greece and the Republic of Cyprus, and by extension the E.U. If Turkey stations the defense systems by the American air base in Incirlik, it would represent a threat to American aircraft and would be seen as a major provocation against the US. So major, in fact, that it could cause the US to abandon Incirlik all together, one of its most important bases in the region.

793,W.J. Hennigan,"Julian Assange appeared in a British court Friday in the first of what is likely to be many battles over a recently filed U.S. extradition attempt. Speaking via video link from a maximum-security prison near London, the 47-year old WikiLeaks founder declared that “175 years of my life is effectively at stake,” while banner-waving supporters demonstrated outside Westminster Magistrates Court. It was typical theatrics surrounding Assange, a man who has achieved worldwide notoriety for his commitment to exposing closely held national security secrets. But the supporters who paint him as a victim of far-reaching government power aren’t wrong about one thing. The U.S. has gone further in the charges it brought against Assange than any prior American government, putting into motion a legal process that has sweeping implications for the First Amendment’s bedrock protection of free speech. Late last month, the Trump Administration filed an 18-count indictment that included charges Assange had violated provisions of the Espionage Act by publishing one of the largest troves of classified documents in U.S. history. It is the first time the federal government is prosecuting a defendant for receiving and publishing still-classified information. That extraordinary step sets up what may be a bitter irony for the U.S. government. By choosing to use the Espionage Act as aggressively as it has, rather than sticking to a single count of computer hacking, American prosecutors may have ensured that Assange will never see justice in the United States. Foreign governments have tended to view espionage as a political crime, says Jameel Jaffer, executive director for Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute, and it would be highly unusual if Britain extradited Assange to face charges under the Espionage Act. “Countries don’t ordinarily extradite individuals facing prosecution for political offenses,” he said. Even without the challenges posed by the Espionage Act, extraditing Assange promises to be a protracted, politically charged process that faces long odds. Human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, have already called for the extradition request to be dismissed. Additionally, any ruling against Assange will almost certainly be appealed to Britain’s Supreme Court, which takes time. For instance, two men — suspected hacker Lauri Love and banker Stuart Scott — won their appeals against extradition last year to the United States after fighting the cases for several years. Regardless of what happens next, the indictment should be perceived as an ominous threat to newsgathering and journalism, Jaffer said. “The U.S.’s indictment of Assange should be understood as an assault on press freedom, because the theory of the indictment is that routine practices of investigative journalism are criminal,” he said. “Cultivating sources, communicating with sources confidentially, protecting sources’ identities, and publishing government secrets — this is what good national security journalists do every day.” What’s now at stake, constitutional lawyers say, is how far the First Amendment extends to protect journalists who publish information they deem to be in the interest of the American public, even if that information is secret. In recent years, the most publicly significant national security stories exposing problematic government behavior, including revelations of CIA black sites, the torture program, and NSA domestic surveillance practices, were based on secret information. Publication of these stories led to sweeping reforms in U.S. policy. The danger of going after Assange, civil libertarians say, is an attack on Americans’ right to know about what the government does with taxpayer dollars in America’s name.",Prosecutors Threw the Book at Julian Assange.

794,Wilder Davies,"Expedia Group, the digital travel industry conglomerate has agreed to pay $325,406 to the U.S. government for breaching Cuban travel sanctions between 2011 and 2014. According to a memo released by the treasury department on Thursday, Expedia subsidiaries assisted 2,221 people, including Cuban nationals with travel-related services with travel between the U.S. and Cuba, or within Cuba and beyond. The services were in violation of Cuban Assets Control Regulations that were first established in 1963 and were offered prior to the easing of travel restrictions during “Cuban thaw,” which began under the Obama Administration at the end of 2014. The treasury department stated that foreign subsidiaries of the Seattle-area company that “lacked an understanding of and familiarity with U.S. economic sanctions laws” were responsible for the violation, adding “Expedia employees overlooked particular aspects of Expedia’s business that presented risks of noncompliance with sanctions.” Expedia Group owns U.S. based websites CheapTickets, Expedia, Hotels, Hotwire, Orbitz in addition to foreign-based Trivago, Venere and Wotif. The company voluntarily disclosed the violations to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and after learning of the violations, the treasury department stated that “Expedia implemented significant remedial measures to strengthen its U.S. economic sanctions compliance program throughout the Expedia corporate family” and that the company cooperated with the OFAC investigations. Expedia did not respond to TIME’s request for comment. The news comes at a time when U.S.-Cuban relations have stiffened after President Trump’s reneging of Obama-era negotiations with the Caribbean nation. Last Tuesday, Trump announced new restrictions on travel to Cuba from the U.S., barring cruise ships from visiting the country and banning “People to People” travel. This includes organized tour groups, one of the primary ways U.S. citizens have visited Cuba.   Write to Wilder Davies at wilder.davies@time.com.","Expedia Fined $325,000 for Breaching Travel Sanctions to Cuba","June 14, 2019"

Around 20 worshippers will attend the service on Saturday, which is being held in a side-chapel that was undamaged by the fire for “obvious security reasons,” according to the Parisian diocese. All attendees must wear hard hats. Saturday is an important date for the 850-year-old Notre Dame: it’s the anniversary of the consecration of its altar, which before the fire was celebrated each year with a special mass inside the main hall. The mass will be broadcast live, and led by the Archbishop of Paris. The fire began on the afternoon of April 15, while the cathedral was undergoing renovations. It appeared to start within scaffolding that was covering the roof. Nobody died in the blaze, and firefighters were able to control it before it caused major damage to the stonework. The roof, however, was destroyed. In the aftermath of the fire, French billionaires and businesses pledged 850 million euros ($955m) to repair the roof. On Friday, French media reported that only 9% of that figure had so far been paid.

796,Farhana Yamin,"At this point in human history we have three choices: to die, to survive or to thrive.  From the wildfires in the U.S., coral die-back in the tropics and the deadly hurricanes battering small islands, the signs are crystal clear: climate devastation is already here. The world’s poorest people and indigenous communities are on the front line. They are also bearing the brunt of the sixth mass extinction, which is under way due to conversion of their forests, wetlands and other wild landscapes into concrete cities, dam reservoirs and fields growing soya.  I joined Extinction Rebellion to fight against the climate and ecological emergency we are now facing – an emergency that threatens the very conditions of all life on Earth. I have been an environmental lawyer for thirty years, working to create new treaties, E.U. agreements and national laws aiming to prevent the situation we now find ourselves in. Sadly, I know this emergency cannot be averted by governments signing weak compacts and voluntary agreements with the biggest polluters on Earth. Nor by tweaking carbon markets that have been gutted of climate ambition by fossil-fuel lobbyists. We need to overhaul our political systems to limit access to government by big business. We need citizens’ assemblies to allow ordinary people to decide the scale and pace of transition on the basis of independent scientific advice.    Normal politics has failed us. It has brought the whole planet to the brink of ecological disaster. We cannot invoke and rely on the inadequate legal tools of the past 30 years that have allowed this crisis to happen. We need everyone to unite – from the left, the right, and every shade in between, and especially young people, many of whom are too disillusioned to vote or are excluded because they are only 16. We need everyone to undertake mass civil disobedience to create a new political reality the whole world over.  But we can’t get there if we work in silos and factions. We need a “movement of movements” to model the unity and urgency we need right now. The new movement of movements must be led by our youth and by those who have been resisting “business as usual,” especially communities of color and those at the forefront of oppression. The new movement must be based on the reality that the legacy of colonialism, combined with current forms of capitalism based on never-ending extractive growth, is literally killing us. The reality is that four environmental defenders a week are being killed in the Global South. We in the Global North need to honor their work and join their struggles by also throwing our own bodies on the line.  We need a socially just transition for everyone on Earth, not just for workers trapped in the toxic industries that need to be phased out, but for everyone at the sharp end of austerity and ecological destruction. Climate and ecological destruction are at heart issues about social and intergenerational justice. We can’t just fixate on the maths and science of climate change and leave people and fairness out of the equation.  These are the facts that justify the unification and intensification of our shared struggles and which will only succeed if we have a worldwide rebellion. Climate-change denialists cannot cover up the fact that the struggle for access to natural resources, especially fresh water and arable land, is intensify- ing, and that large parts of the planet are already becoming uninhabitable due to food and water scarcity.",This Is the Only Way to Tackle the Climate Emergency,"June 14, 2019"
797,Billy Perrigo,"A ban on advertisements containing “harmful” gender stereotypes came into force in the U.K. on Friday, in a move experts hope will reduce gender inequality. Adverts containing stereotypes such as women being bad at driving, or a husband being lazy while his wife cleans, will likely fall foul of the new rules recommended by the U.K.’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). “Making assumptions about how people should look and behave might negatively restrict how they see themselves and how others see them, and limit choices they make in life,” said Ella Smillie of the ASA, who led the 2017 study which recommended the new rules. Other scenarios likely to be disallowed include stereotypes of children’s ambitions, for example boys aspiring to be engineers and girls aspiring to be dancers. The new rules will affect social media advertising as well as ads on TV and in public places. They add to existing British guidelines banning sexualized imagery in ads unless it is relevant to the product being advertised. “Our evidence shows how harmful gender stereotypes in ads can contribute to inequality in society, with costs for all of us,” said Guy Parker, chief executive of the advertising authority, in a statement. “Put simply, we found that some portrayals in ads can, over time, play a part in limiting people’s potential. It’s in the interests of women and men, our economy and society that advertisers steer clear of these outdated portrayals.” Not all stereotypes will be banned, but those that are deemed “likely to cause harm or serious widespread [offense]” will. Ads that satirize gender stereotypes will still be allowed.

798,Hillary Leung,"Members of Congress have reintroduced a bill defending Hong Kong’s autonomy in the wake of violent protests over a controversial proposal to amend the city’s extradition law that would allow the transfer of suspects to mainland China. The bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, co-sponsored by U.S. Senators and members of the House, “reaffirms U.S. commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law at a time when these freedoms and Hong Kong’s autonomy are being eroded,” according to a press release. The legislation would require an annual assessment of Hong Kong’s political autonomy to determine whether it still qualifies for special trade status with the U.S. It would also threaten sanctions and travel restrictions against individuals found to be involved in disappearances in the semiautonomous region. “We introduce this legislation today because democracy and freedom are under assault in Hong Kong,” U.S. Representative Jim McGovern said in the press release. Hong Kong has been rocked by protests since June 9, when an estimated one million people took to the streets in opposition to the proposed extradition bill. Critics say it represents a further erosion of the city’s freedoms and would allow China to round up opponents to face trial on the mainland, where justice is opaque. The former British colony was handed over to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 under an agreement called “one country, two systems,” which guaranteed that its political system would remain unchanged for 50 years. The city enjoys political and social freedoms that don’t exist elsewhere in China, but those freedoms have come under increasing threat by Beijing. Organizers estimated that more than a million people turned up for the march on Sunday, which would make it the biggest demonstration in the city’s history. Tens of thousands returned to the Hong Kong legislature Wednesday for a protest that postponed debate on the controversial bill descended into violence later in the day, as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowds of mostly young people.

799,W.J. Hennigan,"On May 19, President Donald Trump appeared to set a red line in a tweet: “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!” Nearly a month later, Iran has put Trump’s red line to the test with apparent attacks on two foreign tankers transiting through the Gulf of Oman that drove up oil prices and escalated tensions. The U.S. military released grainy black-and-white video footage late Thursday of what officials said were Iranian forces on a patrol boat removing an unexploded mine from a ship — allegedly attacked just hours earlier — in an effort to destroy incriminating evidence. It was an extraordinarily rare move for the military to quickly declassify such imagery for public consumption, but the footage provided compelling documentation to support the Administration’s claims about Iran’s role in sabotage. Still, the events Thursday pose a dilemma for Trump. Not responding to the latest attacks, if they were perpetrated by Iran, could encourage even more in coming days. Ruling out even limited military action, such as sinking several small fast-boats belonging to Iranian forces, which often harass U.S. Navy ships in the region, could encourage Tehran to launch even more brazen attacks. But a large military response would spike shipping insurance rates and oil prices, cost lives and further destabilize the region, officials said. The Gulf of Oman, where the attacks took place, is near the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, through which much of the world’s oil passes. Iran denied its involvement in the attacks, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted that intelligence reviewed by U.S. officials had indicated Iran’s culpability. He provided no evidence to support the assertion at the time, but laid out the Administration’s case. “This assessment is based on intelligence, weapons used, level of expertise needed, recent similar Iranian attacks, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication,” he told reporters at the State Department. It was the latest of several recent attacks in the Middle East that Pompeo attributed to Iranian government. The incidents, he said, included an earlier assault on four tankers in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz, armed drone attacks against Saudi oil facilities, a deadly bombing in Afghanistan and a rocket attack on the Green Zone in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, where the U.S. embassy is located.",Oil Tanker Attacks Put Trump's Iran Red Line to the Test,"Updated: June 14, 2019 12:49 AM ET | Originally published: June 13, 2019"

801,Billy Perrigo,"The race to replace Theresa May as U.K. Prime Minister is in full swing, and with it, scrutiny of those who hope to take her job. Ahead of Thursday’s first round of voting, media focus was not so much on the candidates‘ Brexit policies, nor on their plans to avert environmental catastrophe. Instead, admissions of past drug use by eight out of the ten candidates on the ballot dominated the front pages of the U.K.’s newspapers. After the first round of voting, six out of the seven candidates still standing had previously admitted taking drugs. The bizarre start to the leadership race reflects that coming clean on past drug use no longer carries the same political weight it once did. “I think these days, because you can’t really prevent these drug stories from coming out, that honestly is the best policy,” says Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. A bigger issue is what that drug use might show about a candidate’s character. “The damage done by appearing to cover something up, or by being accused of hypocrisy, is greater than the damage done by admitting you’ve done something in your youth,” says Bale. That’s particularly true for candidates aspiring to lead the Conservative Party, which continues to oppose liberalizing tough drug laws. The trend began last week when Environment Secretary Michael Gove, one of the frontrunners, was forced to admit that he had taken cocaine on social occasions when he was a young journalist, after a section from a forthcoming biography was published. “The book is correct,” Gove said on June 8. “I did take drugs.” The story dominated the weekend newspapers, and soon his competitors were being quizzed on their drug-taking histories. Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, soon admitted to having a “cannabis lassi when I went backpacking through India.” Dominic Raab, another competitor, admitted to trying cannabis at university, though “not very often as I was into sport.” Things soon got even more bizarre. Rory Stewart, an outsider candidate, admitted he had smoked opium at a wedding in Iran. “I was invited into the house,” he said by way of explanation. “The opium pipe was passed around,” he said, before speculating that he may not have felt the drug’s effects because the family was poor and therefore may have put only a small amount of opium into the pipe.",6 Out of 7 Candidates for U.K. Prime Minister Admitted to Using Drugs.

802,Jamie Ducharme,"Two oil tankers on Thursday morning were reportedly attacked near the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil transport route that sits between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, echoing a similar attack last month and stoking fears about escalating tensions in the region. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for Thursday’s attacks, but the U.S. blamed Iran for last month’s bombing of four tankers in the same general area, without offering a clear explanation as to why. Iran denied that allegation, but it is embroiled in several conflicts in the region. It has long feuded with U.S.-allied Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—tensions only heightened by a clash over the civil war in Yemen—and Thursday’s incident fueled fears that tensions in the region are approaching a breaking point. The vessels attacked Thursday were identified as the Marshall Islands-flagged MT Front Altair, which was lit ablaze, and the Panama-flagged Kokuka Courageous, which sustained structural damage, according to the Associated Press. Crew members from both ships had to be evacuated, according to AP, and one sailor aboard the Kokuka Courageous reportedly suffered minor injuries. The U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet said in a statement that it was “aware of the reported attack on shipping vessels” and dispatched the USS Bainbridge for assistance. The alleged attack also comes amidst escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Last month, National Security Adviser John Bolton accused Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, and said any attacks in the Persian Gulf would prompt a “very strong response” from the U.S. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denied that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons, but said “America could not do anything” about it if it were, according to AP. The New York Times reports that Iran has also threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a move that would greatly disrupt oil transport.

805,Ian Bremmer,"Once again, Italy and the E.U. are headed toward confrontation. They fought a protracted battle last year over the impact of Italy’s budget on its debt before arriving at a compromise in December, but the problem has re-emerged, and it’s not clear whether a larger fight can be avoided. In recent days, Italy’s technocratic Prime Minister has pledged to resign if leaders of the Five Star Movement and the League, the two parties that make up the country’s fractious coalition government, fail to put aside differences to agree on a budget the E.U. will accept, one that won’t saddle Italy with ever more dangerous levels of debt. At first, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s threat seemed to have worked. League leader Matteo Salvini and Five Star head Luigi Di Maio emerged from a meeting on June 10 talking of a “shared goal” of avoiding E.U. action against Italy “while safeguarding economic growth, employment, as well as tax cuts,” according to a statement from Salvini. “I’m not interested in fighting with the E.U.,” Di Maio said on June 11, “but we must get the results Italians are interested in.” The reasoning is straightforward. Italy’s economy is weak; the Bank of Italy has cut its 2019 economic growth forecast to 0.3%. Five Star wants to respond by spending more to help people manage hardship, creating a minimum wage and continuing a “citizen’s income” scheme, similar to the idea of basic income. The League wants sharp personal and corporate tax cuts that its leaders say will jump-start growth and reduce unemployment. But the E.U. says Italy is already on track to spend too much. Its rules say Italy must keep deficits at 3%, and the European Commission has forecast a nominal deficit of 3.5% for next year. Italy’s budget will violate E.U. rules. The only real question is by how much–and what Brussels will do about it. E.U. fears are well founded. Italy’s €2.3 trillion ($2.6 trillion) debt is about 132% of its 2018 economic output. Only Greece is in worse shape, and Greece’s economy is small enough that it can be bailed out. Italy’s economy, the euro zone’s third largest, is far too big for that. That’s why Italy’s worries are well founded too. The E.U. has power to impose fines, cut funding and order Italy to cut spending and raise taxes to meet its commitments. The greater concern is market fear, underlined by Prime Minister Conte, that ratings agencies could downgrade the country’s credit rating, making it more expensive for Italy to borrow. E.U. action, even if it doesn’t come with specific penalties, makes these troubles more likely. Underneath the market jitters are fresh concerns that Five Star and the League are competing with each other to please voters in advance of potential snap elections. Five Star remains the coalition’s senior partner, but it’s the League that is gaining popularity and political momentum. Both sides know that austerity measures will anger the electorate, and both have won votes in the past by attacking the E.U. and its rules.",Italy’s Precarious Economy Again Threatens the E.U.,"June 13, 2019"

A leading pro-democracy organization announced a mass march against a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China at 2:30 p.m. Sunday, followed by a boycott of classes and work Monday. “Even with brutal police force and the government’s orders for the violence, Hong Kong will never give up,” says Jimmy Sham, convener of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), the group organizing the march. CHRF is calling for protesters to once again convene at Victoria Park in an echo of the massive march that began there last Sunday and saw an estimated 1 million people rally against the extradition bill and Beijing’s tightening grip on the semi-autonomous territory. “We had 1.03 million people come out on Sunday. This time, we will have more,” Sham said at a press conference Thursday. The financial hub has been seized by an enormous backlash to the government’s attempts to fast-track the extradition legislation, which critics fear will undermine the city’s civil liberties and be used to target dissidents. In 1997, the former British colony was handed back to China under an agreement that promised to respect the city’s autonomy and independent judiciary, but the extradition fight has exposed deep-seated concerns over Beijing’s encroachment. The protesters have so far won a partial victory as a reading of the contentious bill was postponed for a second time on Thursday. But Beijing’s hand-picked Chief Executive for Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, refuses to back down from the bill, despite the mass mobilization against it.

The chaos unfolding in the financial hub, where young, black-clad protesters have squared off with armed riot police, prompted global leaders to urge police restraint. President Donald Trump said he hopes that Hong Kong “will be able to work it out with China.” Speaking from the White House, Trump said Sunday’s march against the bill—at which organizers counted 1.03 million participants—was “as big a demonstration as I’ve ever seen.” “I understand the reason for the demonstration, but I’m sure they’ll be able to work it out,” he added.

President Donald Trump and Macron originally planted the European sessile oak together in April 2018 when Macron made his first official state visit to the White House. The tree was taken from Belleau Wood in France — the site of a World War I battle in which thousands of U.S. Marines died defending France against Germany’s invasion. According to Le Monde, the tree planted by the two world leaders was meant to “symbolize the tenacity of friendship.” And, at the time, Macron tweeted that the tree served as “a reminder at the White House of these ties that bind us.” French news outlets broke the story over the weekend that it had died, with the New York Times confirming the oak’s passing on Tuesday. Macron also confirmed the tree’s death in an interview with Swiss television station RTS on Tuesday, CNN reported. “We will send him another,” Macron told RTS when asked about the tree. “It is not a tragedy.” Then-French Ambassador to the U.S. Gérard Araud said that the tree was “enclosed in plastic protection” during the planting ceremony, as it had to be quarantined per U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations on foreign plants to prevent possible soil contamination. During his interview with RTS, according to CNN, Macron said that it was because of this quarantine that the tree died. The United States and France have a historically shared a close relationship. However, in recent months Macron has become more outspoken and critical of Trump’s behavior, while the U.S. President has recently threatened to impose tariffs on French wine imports.

Members of the royal family don’t usually discuss politics in order to remain politically neutral. But Prince William, who is second in line to the throne, was interested to know whether Brexit was a big concern for the sheep farmers he was speaking to.  He was careful, however, not to share his own views. Sam Rawling, a sheep farmer, said he was very surprised to see his industry voting for Brexit. “It was like turkeys voting for Christmas,” he told the royal. One of the main concerns was the prospect of a no-deal Brexit––which would see the UK leave the European Union with no agreement about the “divorce” process. Farmers told the royal couple that possible 40% tariffs on sheep, combined with a loss of E.U. subsidies for farmers would bring about a “perfect storm.” Adam Day, who runs the Cumbria Farmer Network, a non-profit organization that provides help to farmers, said: “The reality is that there is not enough income to make a living from old-fashioned traditional sheep farming or cattle farming.

813,Billy Perrigo,"Russian investigative journalist Ivan Golunov made his career writing the news, revealing corruption among Moscow’s elite for the news site Meduza. But he became the subject of headlines himself last week, after he was arrested on trumped-up charges of drug trafficking that could have landed him 20 years in prison. After an outcry and scrutiny from Russia’s remaining independent media, authorities eventually conceded a lack of evidence on Tuesday. When he was released that day from house arrest, activists hailed it as a rare victory amid a sea of repression. But they also say he should never have been arrested in the first place. Golunov was stopped on the street in Moscow on June 6, handcuffed and bundled into a police car. Police then strip-searched him and allegedly beat him. They then said they had found a packet of mephedrone in his bag, and charged him with conspiracy to traffic the drug. His disappearance initially went unreported, and when his lawyer was finally able to see him after more than 12 hours, Golunov said he had not been allowed to eat or sleep. By the time the journalist appeared on June 8 in a Moscow court, where he was sentenced to two months of house arrest awaiting trial, doctors suspected he had a concussion and broken ribs. Cracks soon started to appear in the official story, however. Photos purporting to show a drug lab in Golunov’s apartment were removed from a government website after his journalist colleagues established they were taken elsewhere. On the streets, meanwhile, a wave of support was growing. One-person vigils—which, unlike other forms of protest in Russia, don’t require a permit—were held on a rolling basis, despite police intimidation. Video footage posted on Twitter showed crowds of supporters lining up to “change shifts” with a lone picketer. And on June 10, three of Russia’s biggest newspapers each carried the same front-page headline: WE ARE IVAN GOLUNOV. “We have grounds to believe Golunov is being persecuted because of his journalistic activity,” his editors at Meduza said in a statement. Ivan Kolpakov, editor in chief of Meduza, tells TIME that he believes Golunov’s ordeal was prompted by one particular piece he was working on as recently as last week. Golunov might be a free man now, but intimidation of journalists is common in Russia, which is ranked 149th out of 180 countries for press freedom by Reporters Without Borders. “Ivan’s arrest is just a part of the Russian system,” Kolpakov says. But in this case, Golunov received an unexpected wave of support. His incarceration became a test of solidarity among Russian journalists, who rallied to his defense. In front of the country and the world, they effectively dismantled the police narrative. Even some reporters in the state-run media stood up for Golunov. Eventually, the Russian Interior Ministry stepped in to order his release. The officers involved in his arrest have been suspended. Nevertheless, their tactics revealed something about the way public discourse is stifled in Russia today. “The easiest way to put anyone in prison in Russia is to plant drugs in his bag,” Kolpakov told TIME shortly before Golunov was released. “It means that he immediately goes to prison. It means that his reputation is immediately destroyed. It means it’s going to be a dirty case.” In Russia, reporters routinely face intimidation, and most newspapers and TV channels avoid criticizing powerful figures in politics and business.","‘He Had Powerful Enemies.’ Russian Journalist Ivan Golunov Has Been Released, But Media in Russia Still Can't Work Freely","Updated: June 12, 2019 2:27 PM ET"
814,Saritha Rai / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — India will launch a lunar mission on July 15, attempting to become the fourth country to land on the moon and cementing its place among the world’s space faring nations. The Chandrayaan-2 mission aims to deliver a rover to an elevated plane close to the uncharted lunar South Pole on Sept. 6 or 7 and investigate the surface for signs of water and potentially new sources of abundant energy. It’s one step in an envisioned progression that includes putting a space station in orbit and — eventually — landing a crew on the moon. Chandrayaan, which means “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit, exemplifies the resurgence of international interest in space. The U.S., China and private corporations are among those racing to explore everything from resource mining to extraterrestrial colonies on the moon and even Mars. If successful, India will be only the fourth country to make a soft landing on the moon, in which vehicles touch down without damage, after the former Soviet Union, the U.S. and China. “We have left no stone unturned to make the lunar soft landing a success,” Kailasavadivoo Sivan, chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation, the country’s equivalent to NASA, told reporters at the headquarters in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru. The upcoming moon mission is the most complex ISRO has attempted. Two Chandrayaan modules — an orbiter and a lander — will be stacked together inside a launch vehicle equipped to lift heavy satellites into orbit. A third module, the lunar rover, will roll out on landing and operate for at least 14 days on the surface. It will wander about 1,300 feet, surveying a surface that reaches minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 157 degrees Celsius) in the shadows. And heading this exercise are two women — mission director Ritu Karidhal and the project director Muthayya Vanitha, Sivan said. Women employees account for nearly 30% of India’s space agency’s total workforce. The idea is to explore virgin territory on the lunar surface and analyze crust samples for signs of water and helium-3. That isotope is limited on Earth yet so abundant on the moon that it theoretically could meet global energy demands for 250 years if harnessed. The rover will send pictures of the lunar surface within 20 minutes of landing, Sivan said. The landing area in South Pole was chosen as it has no craters or boulders and is nearly flat with very good visibility due to solar light, he added.",India Plans to Launch Moon Mission in July,"June 12, 2019"
815,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"Hong Kong police unleashed rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag pellets at protesters Wednesday, transforming the financial hub into a battleground in an effort to disperse large crowds assembled to demonstrate against a proposed extradition law. Thousands of demonstrators had poured into the streets surrounding Hong Kong’s legislature Wednesday morning, choking major thoroughfares with barricades and human chains. The unrest prompted the government to abruptly postpone a planned debate over highly divisive amendments to an extradition law that would allow for fugitives to be extradited to mainland China for the first time. The city has boiled over into massive protests in recent days as the government attempts to fast-track the controversial legislation. The proposed law has ignited fears about the former British colony’s continued autonomy—promised after its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997—and also underscored the depth of anxiety over its relationship to Beijing. Hundreds of young demonstrators staged an overnight protest Tuesday in the park abutting the Legislative Council, undeterred by the bouts of rain. They were joined by thousands more black-and-white-clad protesters at the height of the morning commute and proceeded to block key roadways leading to the government headquarters. Clashes began shortly after some protesters attempted to storm a government building, prompting police to set off rounds of tear gas and smoke bombs inside, as well as outside the premises. Protesters said they wanted to signal to the government that opposition to the extradition bill was widespread. “We’re furious, we’re angry, and some of us are afraid, but we’re here anyway. This is a chance to do something important,” said Laurie Wen, 48. But Hong Kong Leader Carrie Lam decried the protests as “organized riots.” In a televised, tearful interview Wednesday, she said she was not acting against Hong Kong’s interests, but insisted that “radical confrontation is not the solution.” The government is standing by the proposed legislation despite today’s protests and a massive march on Sunday. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung made a video appeal for protesters to return home, but the crowds are defiant.",Protests Over a Divisive Extradition Bill Turn Violent in Hong Kong,"Updated: June 12, 2019 11:34 AM ET"
816,Emily Barone,"For most of the year, Mount Everest is left alone to pierce the sky and slice the hurricane-speed winds that whip its summit. But for a few weeks every spring, the winds die down and mountaineers from all corners take a shot at reaching the top of the world. This year, an estimated 891 climbers reached Everest’s summit — a record year, but not necessarily one to celebrate. The crowds on Everest, which have been problematic for years, have become a serious safety issue. And this season, there were only five days with winds under 30 m.p.h., compared with 11 such days last year. The combination of more people making the attempt and fewer climbing days exacerbated the bottlenecks and created long queues. Climbers suffering from altitude sickness could not descend to seek medical attention. In total, there were 11 deaths on Everest this year, marking one of the deadliest seasons in the mountain’s history. The Nepalese government, which controls permits for the southern and more popular side of the mountain, has vowed to investigate what happened. Seasoned climbers are calling for significant reforms. Alan Arnette, a respected mountaineer who chronicles Everest expeditions, says a confluence of events have contributed to the crowded conditions, including the proliferation of low-cost guides, ignorant and inexperienced climbers and a government he believes is willing to turn a blind eye in the name of revenue. “Greed is at the country level and the guide level,” he says. Here’s a look at Everest’s climbing history, and how deadly this season has been compared to past years: Correction, June 13 A graphic accompanying the original version of this story included the incorrect number of icons representing climbers for the years 1998 and 2019.

817,Aryn Baker/Mauritius,"With its modernist buildings, spacious grounds and airy cafeteria packed with young adults slinging backpacks while scrolling through their Instagram feeds, the African Leadership University on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius looks much like any other college campus. Except, perhaps, when it comes to the library. Here you will find no silent temple to books and knowledge; in fact, the university’s Pure Learning Library has no books at all. Instead there’s a cacophonous din of competing ideas, as students convene in animated groups around communal tables, shouting out solutions while feverishly diagramming them on the whiteboards that panel the walls. “We aren’t really encouraged to be quiet here,” explains Jeremiah Nnadi, a second year Computer Science student from Nigeria, with a shrug. “We believe that the best way to learn is from our colleagues. Regurgitating the stuff you memorized from books just to pass an exam isn’t really going to solve Africa’s problems, is it?” While books can be found elsewhere on campus, ALU’s approach to educating the next generation of African leaders looks a lot different from the traditional Western universities it was once modeled upon, starting with the scope of its ambition. When the Ghana-born, Stanford Business School-educated entrepreneur Fred Swaniker opened the Mauritius campus in 2015, he not only pledged to build 25 more like it in Africa, he also promised to produce 3 million young African leaders over the next 50 years. The first class of those leaders, made up 79 people hailing from more than 40 countries across the continent, graduate on June 12. For Swaniker, this graduation serves as the first milestone in an ambitious program to reinvent education for a new generation in a uniquely African context. It is also the solution to an unanticipated problem that sprung up when he first sought to disrupt African education. In 2008, Swaniker launched his African Leadership Academy in Johannesburg, recruiting high school students from across the continent and promising to prepare them for the best universities the world had to offer. But once they got into those Ivy League and European universities, they rarely came back. “I realized we were actually contributing to the brain drain,” says Swaniker. “So I said it’s time that Africa had its own Stanford and MIT and Harvard. But instead of replicating the universities that were built for another era, we should build a university that looks to the future, that educates the leaders Africa needs.” The Mauritius campus, with a residential program catering to 355 students, focuses on collaborative learning and pan-African leadership examples. Each classroom is dedicated to a influential African leader or artist — the Sankore wing, referencing one of the oldest universities in the world, in Timbuktu, Mali, features classrooms named after Ethiopian runner Haile Gebrselassie, U.N. general-secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali and South African writer Bessie Head; the faculty lounge celebrates South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. The four dormitories are dedicated to the great African civilizations, such as Axum, Kongo, and Songhai. Even the cafeteria aspires to pan-African cuisine, though Nnadi, the Nigerian computer-science student, says the attempt to create his nation’s national dish, jollof rice, “needs a lot of help.” Complaints about cafeteria food being a universal college constant, the real difference at ALU can be found in the classrooms. ALU emphasizes real-world problem solving, starting on day one. Incoming students are presented with a list of challenges currently facing African countries, from climate change to health care, education, urban growth or immigration. For the rest of the year they are expected to research the issue, discuss it with classmates, teachers and outside specialists, and present concrete solutions. Developing leaders for the 21st century, says Swaniker, goes beyond academics. “The whole idea is to create problem solvers who have learned how to learn, rather than regurgitate knowledge. That means developing vital skills: critical thinking, leadership, communication, entrepreneurship, data analysis—this is what we need to develop Africa.” Instead of majors, students have missions. Last year, one student established—and found funding for—a shelter for the island’s street dogs. Another team developed a campus-to-town transport system, vital for co-eds itching to get away from the sugar-cane fields surrounding the university for something more lively. Group work is encouraged because it develops leadership skills, says Nnadi, 20. “Going into real life from this point, I feel like there is no problem I won’t be able to deal with because I have seen it all: slackers, fights, conflict.” And summer internships are mandatory. The school coaches students through the rigorous internship research and application process; by the time they graduate, most will have at least a year’s worth of work experience in Africa, and have applied to multiple jobs, giving them a head start in the real world. Nnadi has two internships lined up this summer—one at the Bank of Kigali in Rwanda developing an online platform for mobile banking, and another back home in Nigeria, mostly, he admits, so he can fill up on jollof rice before starting another school year. The laser focus on problem solving means that graduates should be well prepared to tackle whatever comes their way, from finding a job to taking on some of the continent’s biggest issues. But the ALU experience has also raised the bar, making it harder for some students, like 25-year-old Kaone Tlagae from Botswana, to go back home. “I left home with the idea that I would come back and create change, but now that I have seen what the other countries [in Africa] have to offer, the other opportunities out there, I’m not sure it’s the right place for me anymore.” Maybe, she admits with a twinge of guilt as she contemplates taking a job in Kenya instead, ALU isn’t so good at stopping the brain drain after all.",‘It’s Time Africa Had Its Own Harvard.’ Inside a University Training African Leaders to Solve African Problems,"June 11, 2019"
818,Julia Webster,"Botswana has scrapped laws criminalizing same-sex relations on Tuesday, in a victory for LGBT rights in Africa.  The country’s high court overturned the law dating back to colonial times that criminalized consensual same-sex relations. It’s a big step for LGBT rights in Africa, where more than 30 out of 54 countries across the continent have laws criminalizing gay sex.  Judges voting to revoke the laws said they were unconstitutional. Sexual orientation “is an important attribute of one’s personality,” and “is not a fashion statement,” judges said. The court was packed with activists cheering the decision. The case was brought two months ago by a student at the University of Botswana and supported by local and regional gay rights groups.  It comes just weeks after Kenya’s courts upheld its own laws that punish same-sex relations with up to 14 years in prison, after Kenyan human rights and LGBT organizations filed a petition. Homosexuality has been a crime in Botswana since the late 1800s, when it was under British rule. Section 164 of the country’s penal code, defines same-sex relations as “carnal knowledge against the order of nature”. The wording resembles that of the laws of many other former British colonies where homosexuality is illegal. Judge Michael Leburu said anti-sodomy laws are a “British import” and were developed “without consultation of local peoples”, according to journalists tweeting from the courtroom.",Botswana's High Court Overturns Laws Criminalizing Homosexuality,"June 11, 2019"
819,Katherine Greifeld / Bloomberg,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest Twitter missive on financial markets holds water for some currency watchers. Trump said Tuesday that the euro is “devalued” against the dollar, “putting the U.S. at a big disadvantage.” He may not be wrong: the common currency is over 22% undervalued versus the greenback according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s purchasing-power-parity model. And then there’s the “Big Mac” approach to gauging currency valuations, which shows the euro is about 15% too cheap. “The euro’s definitely undervalued on most measures,” said Kit Juckes, Societe Generale SA’s chief global FX strategist. “A persistent current-account surplus when unemployment is falling makes it hard to argue the currency isn’t undervalued.” The euro briefly dipped following Trump’s tweet to a daily low of $1.1302, before rebounding to trade little changed at $1.1314. The common currency has weakened about 4% against the greenback over the past 12 months. Other gauges suggest that valuations haven’t skewed too far from historical norms. A Federal Reserve dollar index that’s inflation-adjusted and trade-weighted is about 6% above its 20-year average. Meanwhile, the euro is about 6% below its average since its debut at the start of 1999. “It’s well within the normal range of valuation,” said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “I don’t think there’s a policy of maintaining an undervalued currency, or holding it at undervalued levels.” The euro is only a few percentage points undervalued, based on proprietary measures that show the exchange rate that would bring consumer prices to equal levels across countries, Cole said. The dollar’s value is a concern for the U.S. administration if its strength makes American exports less competitive abroad. It’s also a worry for monetary-policy makers as it tends to restrain import prices, working against their efforts to boost inflation.","President Trump Is Right: The Euro Is Too Cheap, According to Most Measures","June 11, 2019"
820,Hillary Leung,"A U.S. citizen, detained in Vietnam on charges of “attempting to overthrow the state,” is expected to face trial at the end of this month and could be sentenced to death if found guilty, Agence France-Press (AFP) reports. Michael Nguyen has been held in Vietnam since July last year. He was traveling with two activists, both of whom were also arrested. His family, who live in the U.S., say Nguyen is innocent and not involved with any dissident groups. The father of four daughters left Vietnam in 1975 during the communist takeover and fled to the U.S. “He is severely disadvantaged and unable to properly defend against any accusations against him,” said a family statement cited by AFP. The family added that he has been denied access to lawyers. His trial is reportedly set for June 24 to 25 in Ho Chi Minh City. In February, his wife Helen Nguyen attended the State of the Union address in Washington D.C. in the hope of raising awareness about her husband’s detention. Vietnam, a one-party communist state, has intensified its crackdown on dissidents since a change in leadership three years ago. At least 128 prisoners of conscience are currently being held by the Vietnamese government, according to Amnesty International.

821,Hillary Leung,"Canada has set a goal to ban single-use plastics by as early as 2021 in a measure aimed at reducing waste that ends up in the ecosystem, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday. Single-use plastics such as bags, straws and cutlery will be prohibited in the country, which throws away about 3 million metric tons of plastic waste yearly, the Prime Minister’s office said in a statement. The initiative will also include targets for companies that manufacture or sell plastic products to responsibly dispose of their waste. “This is a problem we simply can’t afford to ignore,” the statement said. Currently, Canada recycles just 10% of its plastic. According to the Canadian government, over 1 million birds and over 100,000 sea mammals worldwide die or become injured due to plastics every year. “As parents we’re at a point when we take our kids to the beach and we have to search out a patch of sand that isn’t littered with straws, Styrofoam or bottles,” Trudeau said, according to the BBC. “That’s a problem, one that we have to do something about.” Canada follows in the footsteps of a host of other countries that have also set targets to ban single-use plastics in the coming years. In March, the European Union voted overwhelmingly to ban straws, food containers and cotton bud sticks, among other plastics by 2021. Last year, India pledged to eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022. Trudeau’s announcement also comes after both Malaysia and the Philippines announced plans to send tons of non-recyclable waste back to the countries of origin, including Canada.

Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday that he could impose tariffs of 25%, or “much higher than 25%” on $300 billion in Chinese goods. “We’ve never gotten 10 cents from China and now we’re getting a lot of money from China,” the president said. Trump was asked in an interview with CNBC earlier in the day whether the additional tariffs would be enacted immediately if there’s no meeting at the summit later this month. “Yes, it would,” he answered. “I think he will go and I think we’re scheduled to have a meeting. I think he’ll go, and I have a great relationship with him. He’s actually an incredible guy, he’s a great man. He’s very strong, very smart, but he’s for China and I’m for the United States.” Trade talks with China hit an impasse last month after the president accused Beijing of reneging on provisions of a tentative agreement. The two countries have since escalated their trade war. “China is going to make a deal because they’re going to have to make a deal,” Trump said Monday. Trump again suggested that an eventual trade deal could involve Huawei Technologies Co. The Trump administration is campaigning to block the company from emerging 5G telecommunications networks around the world and has moved to cut off Huawei from U.S. suppliers, citing national security concerns. “I do see it as a threat,” he said Monday. “At the same time it could be very well that we do something with respect to Huawei as part of our trade negotiation with China.

The proposal, under debate in Hong Kong’s legislature, “could undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy and negatively impact the territory’s long-standing protections of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus told reporters on Monday. Ortagus spoke after opposition to the proposal sparked one of the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen since 1997, with organizers reporting more than 1 million people turning out on Sunday to demand the plan be abandoned. Police put the figure at 240,000. If the proposal is passed, it could for the first time mean that by law Hong Kong residents might face justice in Chinese courts. The proposed change “could damage Hong Kong’s business environment” and subject U.S. citizens to “China’s capricious judicial system,” Ortagus said. She highlighted what she called the continued erosion of Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework, under which citizens are guaranteed rights not afforded to mainland Chinese citizens.

824,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: Theresa May has finally stepped down as head of the Conservative Party—Britain’s long national nightmare is finally over. Well, one of them anyways. Why It Matters: It’s been clear for some time now that Theresa May would be unable to get her Brexit deal over the finish line. Some of that had to do with the particulars of the deal itself (like that endlessly confounding Irish “backstop”), but much more of it had to do with the fact that no politician aside from May was invested in seeing her particular deal succeed. Every “Leave” parliamentarian had a different vision for what their ideal Brexit would look like, and there was little political incentive for any of them to throw their support behind a deal that just 13 percent of Brits supported back in March. Politicians tend to do things that are popular, and May’s deal… just wasn’t. May might have been able to push her deal through British Parliament if voting down said deal came with consequences, like a crash out “no deal”, but that was never an option so long as EU extensions were on the table. But as Europe’s patience begins to wear thin—along with the patience of the British public—the political calculations have started to shift. And with May’s departure, the Brexit proceedings enter their next phase. What Happens Next: Despite her resignation as head of the Conservative Party, May will stay on as a caretaker Prime Minister until her successor has been decided (currently slated for the week of July 22). But she’s given up the reins on the Brexit process, ushering in a new political drama for Britain to focus on these next few months. The next Conservative leader will be selected in two stages: first, Conservative members who currently hold seats in Parliament will whittle down the list of possible contenders to two individuals (out of the current 11 who have announced their candidacies). That will be followed by a mail-in vote from the rest of the country’s registered Conservative members (numbering somewhere around 124,000) to determine the ultimate winner and next British prime minister.",The Quick Read About… the U.K. after Theresa May,"June 10, 2019"

826,Katya Kazakina / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — A Leonardo Da Vinci masterpiece, whose whereabouts has been a mystery since it sold in 2017 for a record $450 million, has turned up in an unlikely place, according to Artnet.com. “Salvator Mundi” is being kept on superyacht Serene owned by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the publication reported Monday, citing two “principals involved in the transaction” that it didn’t identify. Another Saudi prince was said to have purchased the 500-year-old painting on MBS’s behalf at a 2017 Christie’s auction, the New York Times reported previously. Christie’s declined to confirm that report. The Saudi government’s Center for International Communication didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The yacht’s location as of May 26 was in the Red Sea off Sharm el-Sheikh, an Egyptian resort town on the Sinai Peninsula, according to Bloomberg ship tracking data. While the high seas may not be the best place for a fragile Old Master painting, it’s not uncommon for the super-wealthy to decorate their yachts with trophy art. Joe Lewis hung Francis Bacon’s “Triptych 1974 – 1977,” worth an estimated $70 million, on the lower deck of his yacht, the Aviva. ‘‘Salvator Mundi,” whose provenance has been questioned, will remain aboard MBS’s 439-foot (134-meter) Serene until the Saudis create a planned cultural hub in the Kingdom’s Al-Ula region, Artnet said. The project was in an “exploratory phase,” a spokesman for the commission overseeing the plan said in December. Experts at the Louvre have attributed the work to Da Vinci’s workshop, rather than to the artist alone, according to a published report. Celine Dauvergne, a spokeswoman for the Louvre, declined to comment on the painting’s attribution, but said the Paris museum has asked to borrow the work for an October exhibition.

828,Amy Gunia and Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam said Monday she will not scrap a contentious extradition plan or step down from her position, following a massive protest that gripped the city over the weekend. Speaking from the Legislative Council where hours earlier police and holdout protesters had clashed overnight, the Chief Executive doubled down on her commitment to the proposed legislation. She told reporters the bill will be a “long-term benefit” to the city. “No one wants to see Hong Kong be a haven for fugitives,” Lam said. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people joined a demonstration that choked major thoroughfares as it snaked its way from Hong Kong’s Victoria Park to the Legislative Council, displaying widespread opposition to a bill that would allow China to extradite fugitives from the semiautonomous region. Protesters chanted “Carrie Lam, Step Down” and “No China Extradition” as they marched in the city’s largest protest in years. Police estimated 270,000 people participated, but organizers say more than a million people—or nearly one in seven Hong Kong residents—took part. Lam thanked those who joined the largely peaceful march, but condemned the clashes that broke out around midnight when riot police brandishing batons and tear gas moved to clear out protesters who threw metal barricades at officers. “I want to thank every one of you because…the scrutiny helps to enhance good governance,” she said. The Chief Executive said the demands of Hong Kong citizens have been heard, but insisted that the bill “will resume its second reading debate on June 12.” Critics say the extradition bill signals Beijing’s creeping encroachment on the territory, which was returned to China from British rule in 1997. The legislation would allow Beijing to round up opponents that live in or transit through Hong Kong, threatening the city’s judicial independence and further eroding its democratic freedoms.

829,Alejandro de la Garza,"Despite the Trump Administration’s reported refusals this year to grant permission for U.S. embassies to fly rainbow flags during Pride Month, some diplomats are finding ways to still show their support for the LGBTQ community. Under the Obama administration, all U.S. embassies received permission to hoist rainbow flags during the month-long celebration. This year, President Trump’s State Department has been denying requests by U.S. embassies around the world to fly rainbow flags on embassy flagpoles during June, according to NBC News. Currently, embassies are permitted to fly the flag on exterior walls or inside the embassies, according to NBC. The lack of approval to raise a Pride flag alongside Old Glory hasn’t stopped many embassies from displaying rainbow colors or the flag itself. A picture tweeted by the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India, shows the building’s facade lit up with rainbow lights. The Embassy in Seoul, South Korea, displayed a large pride flag several stories up. The U.S. Consulate General in Chennai, India posted a video of the Consul General speaking in front of an enormous rainbow flag. And the website of the U.S. Embassy in Vienna featured a photo of the Pride flag hanging below the American flag from International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia in May. In Jerusalem, the U.S. Embassy sent a delegation to the city’s Pride parade, according to the Jerusalem Post. Additionally, Randy Berry, the U.S. Ambassador to Nepal, tweeted a photo of himself with embassy staff holding up letters spelling “PRIDE 19.”   According to the Washington Post, the policy changed last year, after Mike Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, became Secretary of State. Last year, the Post said all requests to fly pride flags on embassy flagpoles were approved by the State Department. Under this administration, some State Department employees told the Post it’s better to maintain a low profile.","Despite Trump Administration Request Denials, U.S. Embassies Are Displaying Pride Flags Around the World","June 9, 2019"
830,Amy Gunia / Hong Kong,"Protesters flooded the streets of Hong Kong Sunday to oppose a bill that would allow China to extradite fugitives from the semiautonomous region, bringing the busiest parts of the city to a standstill and drawing the largest crowds seen here since pro-democracy demonstrations paralyzed its center for months in 2014. Critics fear the extradition bill would allow Beijing to round up opponents that live in or transit through Hong Kong, threatening the city’s judicial independence and further eroding its democratic freedoms. The former British colony was returned to China in 1997 under an agreement called “one country, two systems,” which granted it a high degree of autonomy for 50 years, but an increasingly assertive Beijing has called the deal’s integrity into question. The Hong Kong government says the extradition bill is meant to plug “loopholes” in the current legal system, and it could be up for a vote before the end of June. If passed, Hong Kong could decide on a case-by-case basis whether to send fugitives to places including China, Macau and Taiwan, with which it has no formal extradition agreements. Taiwan has already said it won’t seek extradition if the bill is passed. Organizers said more than a million people joined the march, which would make it the largest demonstration in the city’s history. In 2003, an estimated half a million people joined a march opposing proposed national security legislation outlawing offenses against the Chinese government, which is believed to be the second largest protest since the end of British rule. “This bill amounts to the biggest political sellout of Hong Kong,” lawmaker Claudia Mo, a member of the Civic Party, told TIME. She was among the massive crowds that withstood sweltering heat and evening rains to protest. “It would completely destroy the ‘one country, two systems’ promise and put Hong Kong effectively under Chinese law.” Read More: 30 Years Later, Hong Kong Still Harbors the Spirit of Tiananmen Extradition is just the latest flashpoint in the city as Beijing has sought greater influence in recent years, attempting with varying degrees of success to exert control over Hong Kong’s national security, education and electoral framework. Opponents of the extradition bill say they distrust China’s opaque legal system, whereby forced confessions, torture and closed criminal trials are commonplace, according to rights groups. Shortly before the demonstration, the Hong Kong government said in a statement that the measure would not “in any way impact on, interfere with, or have a chilling effect on the freedom of assembly, of the press, of speech, of academic freedom or publication; or relate to offenses of a political nature.”",Massive Protest Held in Hong Kong Against Proposal to Ease Extradition to China,"Updated: June 19, 2019 12:01 AM ET | Originally published: June 9, 2019"

The couple appeared together for the first major public event since Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor’s birth on May 6. Though the one-month-old royal baby stayed home during the event, the Duke and Duchess joined Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s 93rd birthday.  Meghan smiled as she rode in the processional carriage with her husband, Kate Middleton, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall before overlooking the celebrations from the Buckingham Palace balcony. According to People, Meghan wore a navy blue dress by Clare Waight Keller, her wedding gown designer, and a hat by Noel Stewart. The annual Trooping of the Colour, which is the queen’s birthday parade, features military units waving their flags (colours) while marching (trooping) in London. Royal Air Force planes also fly above the spectacle. Queen Elizabeth was born on April 21, 1926, but the royal family has a tradition of celebrating a monarch’s birthday with this special parade at the start of summer. The queen first attended the Trooping the Colour in 1947, according to the royal family’s Twitter.  With June being ideal weather for an outdoor production, the occasion has been around for more than 260 years, according to the royal family’s website. The day of Trooping the Colour marks a monarch’s “official” birthday.

833,Mahita Gajanan,"Police in London are calling for witnesses after a couple was assaulted and robbed in a homophobic attack on a London bus. Melania Geymonat, one of the victims in the attack, posted a photo on Facebook of her and her girlfriend Chris, both covered in blood. Geymonat wrote that she and Chris were on a date the evening of May 30. They caught the bus to head home and were sat on the upper deck when a group of about four men began harassing them, according to her Facebook post. “They started behaving like hooligans, demanding that we kissed so they could enjoy watching, calling us ‘lesbians’ and describing sexual positions,” she wrote. “In an attempt to calm things down, I started making jokes. I thought this might make them go away.” The men ignored Geymonat’s attempts to diffuse the situation. Instead, their behavior escalated. They punched both women repeatedly and stole their belongings. “I don’t know yet if my nose is broken, and I haven’t been able to go back to work, but what upsets me the most is that VIOLENCE HAS BECOME A COMMON THING, that sometimes it’s necessary to see a woman bleeding after having been punched to feel some kind of impact,” she wrote. “I’m tired of being taken as a SEXUAL OBJECT, of finding out that these situations are usual, of gay friends who were beaten up JUST BECAUSE.” London’s Metropolitan Police are investigating the incident, according to a statement, which details that the women were punched several times before the men ran off the bus, and that a bag and phone were stolen during the attack. Both women were taken to the hospital to treat injuries to their faces, police said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the assault a “disgusting, misogynistic attack” and a hate crime. “This is not the first situation men see two women kissing and they start acting like we were a show,” Geymonat said in an interview with BBC Radio 4’s World at One, adding that said she had experienced “a lot of verbal violence.” Other gay friends of hers living in London have also been the victims of assaults, she said.",Lesbian Couple Assaulted on London Bus By Four Men Who Had Demanded The Women Kiss 'So They Could Enjoy Watching',"June 7, 2019"

Crowds will gather on beaches and river banks to cheer on rowers paddling furiously to the beat, trying achieve victory in boat races that mark a beloved holiday in Asia, the Dragon Boat Festival. Friday’s Google Doodle — which depicts drummers on dragon-shaped boats — is a nod to the festival, also known as Duanwu in Mandarin and Tuen Ng in Cantonese. Here’s what to know about the holiday, which is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar to mark the summer solstice. People across Asia will be celebrating. Friday is a public holiday in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. Other cities, like Singapore, will have races too. As the name suggests, dragon boat racing is an important tradition on the day. Rowers will gather to paddle in festive races in various waterways, with crowds gathering on shore to watch. In China and a few other places, onlookers will drink local yellow wine and eat sticky rice dumplings called zongzi, which are wrapped in bamboo or lotus leaves. The dumplings are filled with various toppings — in northern China they are typically filled with sweet red bean paste or taro, and in the south pork belly and mushrooms. Taiwanese versions are filled with ingredients like salted eggs, peanuts, chestnuts and squid. Twenty paddlers sit side by side in a long canoe-like boat, usually decorated with a dragon head and tail, facing a drummer who sits in the front of the boat drumming energetically to keep the rowers in time.

836,Kamakshi Ayyar,"The first time self-described “ocean advocate” Emily Penn was confronted by the magnitude of the plastic pollution problem was during an international sailing expedition 10 years ago. She spotted bits of debris, things like toothbrushes, floating in the water a thousand miles from land, and saw beaches on remote Pacific islands piled high with waste. “I saw these huge changes to our marine environment that I had no idea were happening,” she says.  Now 32, Penn has since led numerous scientific sailing expeditions around the world that have conducted research on things like ocean acidification and toxics in the water. Plastic is a big source of those toxics; according to the U.N., about 13 million tons of plastic enter our oceans every year, damaging marine ecosystems and eventually infiltrating the global food chain. The material has been found in the depths of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean, the bellies of whales and the excrement of humans. One study suggests that micro-plastics can even be passed from pregnant women to their unborn babies. Penn believes women must play an integral role in finding solutions, and aims to prepare more women with the skills and experience needed to tackle plastic pollution. Since co-founding eXXpedition, an all-women sailing crew that focuses on the environmental and health impacts of plastic, Penn has taken part in 11 voyages where women from around the world contribute to research projects and participate in community outreach programs. They have visited the Caribbean, South America and North Pacific Gyre, a massive, swirling soup of marine debris better known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  Ahead of World Oceans Day on June 8, Penn spoke with TIME about the perils of plastics, changing how people think about pollution, and the role women play in protecting our oceans. As we studied the gyres, we realized that the pieces of plastic out there aren’t an island or great big raft, they’re actually breaking down into very small fragments, what we call micro-plastics. We also realized that there are other chemical pollutants in the ocean, in the plastics, and also getting into our bodies, that we really wanted to investigate. Some of these issues, particularly chemicals getting into our bodies, are quite a female issue because they’re endocrine disruptors, they mimic our hormones. And so we wanted to tackle this problem with a team of women. Hence eXXpedition began, to get women to study this issue of plastic and toxic pollution. It was when I started doing scientific work with Pangaea Explorations [an organization Penn co-founded in 2010]. We sailed to the South Atlantic Gyre, between Brazil and Africa, and we set off expecting to go to this accumulation zone where all the plastic was ending up. When we got there, we found surprisingly little floating on the surface, but when we took the net through the water, then we realized that what we were dealing with is trillions of micro-plastic pieces that you can’t see. Trying to clean up these pieces is so hard because they are so small. And now we know that a lot of it is sinking to the bottom of the ocean.  The trip to the North Pacific Gyre, the Great Pacific Garbage patch last summer… it’s so unbelievable. I’ve been working on this issue for over 10 years and we pulled the most dense sample of plastic that I ever have [seen]. Which, given the amount of global awareness on the issue right now, we were hoping for something different. From purely the volume of plastic, that was horrifying.",Meet the Woman Sailing Around the World to Raise Awareness About Plastic Pollution,"Updated: June 8, 2019 5:56 PM ET | Originally published: June 7, 2019"
837,Wilder Davies,"During the month of June, Jupiter will be at its biggest and brightest in the sky, offering even casual skywatchers the opportunity to get a good look at the largest planet in the solar system — with no special equipment required. Jupiter will be easily visible to the naked eye all month long, with the most ideal conditions happening next week; with a pair of binoculars you will be able to get an even more spectacular view of the planet, as well as the four largest Jovian moons. Here is why Jupiter is so bright this month, and when and where the best place is to see it. Aside from the Sun, Jupiter is the largest celestial body in our solar system. Despite its size, the massive gas giant is usually the second brightest planet in the sky, behind the much closer planet Venus. But once a year, when Jupiter and Earth reach their closest proximity and align with one another in orbit, Jupiter will appear to outshine Venus as it rises high in the evening sky. The distance between the Earth and Jupiter varies widely throughout the year, due to the distance and speed at which the planets orbit the sun. (It takes Jupiter approximately 12 earth years to orbit the sun.) Since all the planets in the solar system orbit the sun on the same plane, imagine them as runners on a track going at varying speeds. While the planet will be visible through the night all month long, the best time to see it will be between June 10 and 12. According to Earthsky, Jupiter and Earth will be in opposition — which is the point when both planets are aligned with the sun — on June 10. This alignment occurs once a year, when Earth “laps” Jupiter in orbit. On the evening of June 10, Jupiter will rise shortly after the sunset, reach high into the sky before setting around dawn. It will be the brightest visible object in the sky aside from the moon. However, since the planets have slightly elliptical orbits, the actual point in which they will be closest will be on June 12, at around 11 p.m. EST. At this point, the two planets will be separated by a mere 398 million miles. Regardless, this distinction won’t make too much of a difference for the purposes of casual viewing. And, unlike other astronomical phenomena, your geographical location on Earth shouldn’t impact your ability view Jupiter, provided you have clear skies and minimal light pollution. If you happen to get your hands on some vision enhancing equipment, you might even be able to make out Jupiter’s largest moons, Europa, Ganymede, Io and Callisto, which were first spotted by Galileo Galilei in the early 17th century. You could also get a glimpse some of the gas giant’s zones and belts, which are the variegated bands of color encircling the planet. As a backup, and an even more detailed view, NASA’s Juno spacecraft satellite is currently orbiting Jupiter, and has captured some spectacular footage, which you can check out below.","Jupiter Will Appear its Biggest, Brightest, and Most Visible This Week.

838,Skye Gurney,"For the cover of the June 17 international issue of TIME on what author Tina Brown calls “the nervous breakdown in Britain” we reached out to British collage artist Christopher Spencer, aka “Cold War Steve.” Spencer’s satirical artwork, published mainly on his @coldwar_steve Twitter account, has become synonymous with the frenzied zeitgeist of Brexit-era Britain. His surreal collages, where world leaders rub shoulders with minor British celebrities, have appeared in newspapers and magazines in the U.K. and have been exhibited in London galleries. This is one of the first times his highly U.K.-specific work has found a global audience. “While I have never created something specifically for an American/international audience before,” Spencer says, “being commissioned to do the cover of TIME was mind-blowing and capped off a remarkable first half of 2019 for me.” Asked about his inspiration for the cover, which imagines political and pop-cultural icons in a sinking London bus, Spencer replied: “The sinking London bus is a fairly obvious metaphor–as too the Union flag being waved by Boris Johnson, which is tattered and becoming torn down the middle.” The accompanying essays, by British novelist Jonathan Coe and former Vanity Fair editor Brown, explore how the Brexit vote of June 2016 has impacted the country in the three years since. Says Spencer: “The saddest impact of Brexit I feel, is the way it has literally ripped the country in half.” The artist’s book Cold War Steve Presents…The Festival of Brexit is out now.

839,Tina Brown,"When did Britain go out of its mind? As a transplant from London to New York, I’m often asked that question. Americans, watching the D-Day anniversary this week, find it hard to understand how the British ruling class so profoundly lost the plot since the 2016 vote to say FU to the E.U. Given that over 70 percent of the British people dislike President Donald Trump, his outsized state visit to the UK was a rare uniting force in the midst of the three-year civil war. His presence offered some ironic consolation that the last three years of furious argument in Britain are linked to more global fevers. That the country’s economic distress and the vast carelessness of its elite gave rise to mythic nostalgia and tribal chest-beating in other kingdoms, too. Exceptionalism is oh-so-unexceptional. Yet Britain’s nervous breakdown has its own unique loony flavor, providing daily vignettes of a country trying to remember what it stands for. For decades the loss of empire was compensated by the lingering triumph of World War Two. The post-war generation was consumed by the earnest task of building a better world (and Britain). Those events and people are now a long time ago. The last hard patriotic triumph in most Brit’s recall was Margaret Thatcher’s 1982 invasion of an obscure dot in the South Atlantic, the Falkland Islands, to wrest it back from another country no one has time to read about, Argentina. Now all that’s left of Hope and Glory is Brexit champion Nigel Farage’s Union Jack socks and the certainty that the Queen is the last person who still knows how to behave in public. The irony is that before David Cameron, Theresa May’s predecessor as prime minister, fecklessly called for the referendum just to pacify a rabid arm of his own party, few people in the country at large gave a toss about the issue. Europe came eighth in opinion polls about the nation’s concerns. But the very word “Remain” as a choice on the ballot—with its stench of stagnation—called-up the smugness that was anathema to the boiling white working class. Who wants to “Remain” in a place where Tory austerity cuts have stalled your income for years, where Polish immigrants are ahead of you for a National Health Service appointment, and the Guardian-reading media and political elite tell you you’re racist if you say so? Vote OUT of that, mate! Say Stuff it to Jonny Foreigner! Toffs in the Tory party who despise liberal meddlers had the momentum at last behind their cause, as well as the thrill of slumming it with boisterous blue-collar types. Brexit devolved into an identity war: an English counter-revolution between nationalists and internationalists, country geezers versus young metropolitans, Little England versus Great Britain. The Scottish and Irish Celts are such staunch Remainers that the Scots could be driven at last to vote for Independence and Northern Ireland pushed to unite with the Republic. U.K. RIP. From the moment a flotilla of pro and anti-Brexit boats dueled on the Thames outside Parliament the week of the Brexit vote, the tone was set for successive national absurdities. Unlikely heroes and anti-heroes emerged. A viral favorite was John Bercow, the barrel-chested Speaker of the House of Commons, whose calls for “Order, Order Order” over the brawling MPs have sound-tracked the opposite of his exhortation. Piquantly, earlier this year, he was spotted with a sticker on his car that read “Bollocks to Brexit.” May’s doomed attempt to play the straight man in a Fawlty Towers world was torpedoed by her stunningly awkward dance-on to Abba at a Tory Party conference, looking, as Allison Pearson noted in the Telegraph “like a stork who had been struck by lightning.” May’s offer (twice) to resign in exchange for getting her own party behind a more sensible, watered-down Brexit deal was, according to Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon, “the only time a leader has fallen on her sword and managed to miss.” Many of the leading characters in the national meltdown don’t even take themselves seriously, let alone require us to. The thatched charlatan Boris Johnson, with his sliding allegiances and faux-Falstaffian ways, depends on everyone being in on the joke that he has no principles. Now that he’s again the frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest to be the next prime minster, he has proved there is no lie you can’t recover from if you have mastered the sly vernacular of British irony and gone to Eton. The gangly country squire and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg often answers interview questions in Latin. On the other side, Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn, is an unreconstructed seventies socialist who presents as a refugee from the pre-Thatcher Winter of Discontent when undertakers went on strike. His limp endorsement of Remain and anti-Semitism within his party have shorn him of support. This is all good news for Farage, who has capitalized on the boredom most Brits feel with the one-story news-cycle and formed his own Brexit Party to charge off the cliff.",Tina Brown: How Britain Lost the Plot Over Brexit,"June 6, 2019"
840,Jonathan Coe,"On a Friday evening in July 2012, 80,000 people gathered at the Olympic Stadium in East London to watch the opening ceremony of the 30th Olympiad. Some 27 million British people watched it on their televisions, and many more around the globe. Expectations were sky-high and tinged with skepticism. Many of us sat down to watch the ceremony in that typically British frame of mind–ironic, self-deprecating, pragmatic–which did not predispose us to be impressed. But impressed we were. It’s very hard to articulate a resonant, complex vision of your own national identity without resorting to cliché, but the creators succeeded that night. They did it by using humor–by deploying witty and creative use of British icons such as James Bond and Mr. Bean, by digging deep into our great cultural and political heritage. The fact that audiences in other countries were bemused, apparently, by some of the more specific cultural references only confirmed the ceremony’s determination not to project the well-worn, flag-waving, red-London-bus version of Britishness that the rest of the world was used to seeing. As a result, millions of Britons went to bed that night fired up and inspired, proud to be part of such a confident, inventive and quirky country. Fast-forward to just short of four years later: Thursday, June 16, 2016. It’s one week before voting in the Brexit referendum called by David Cameron primarily to heal long-term splits within his Conservative Party. A national debate supposedly about membership in an economic and political bloc had become, instead, about many things–one of them immigration–and discussion had become bitter and polarized. The arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage set a low point that morning, grinning and joking with reporters as he posed before a gigantic poster showing a column of dark-skinned migrants lining up to cross an E.U. border. The tagline: Breaking Point: the E.U. has failed us all. Later that same day, a far-right extremist murdered a young British lawmaker, Jo Cox, in the street. Few British people went to bed that night feeling anything but shock and disgust. Brexit is a lesson in how quickly a country can degenerate into division and factionalism, and how tenuous are the bonds that hold us together around the vexed issue of national identity. Of those two competing representations, which one shows the real United Kingdom–the intelligent, forward-looking, inclusive one articulated in that Olympic ceremony, or the insular, ungenerous one expressed on that poster? Three years after the vote, the answer is still far from clear. Britain today is just as divided as it was in June 2016, if not more so. One thing is certain, at least: Brexit is not primarily about Britain’s membership in the European Union, and never was. Polls conducted before 2016 show the British public was far more concerned with pressing issues like housing, education, health and welfare. Instead, the narrow majority for Leave was patched together from a grumbling coalition of discontents that had been bubbling away beneath the surface of British life for at least 10 years. People were suffering the effects of a punishing government austerity program, ostensibly designed to deal with the shock of the 2008 financial crisis. Anxieties about immigration were being remorselessly stoked by populist newspapers. And there was a growing mistrust of the political class in general, after dubious expense claims by lawmakers were the subject of a lengthy newspaper exposé in 2009. The majority for Brexit was wafer-thin–just 2% of the population–and casual observers may wonder how Britain should have allowed such a radical change in its constitutional and geopolitical arrangements based on such a shaky mandate. But we Brits live in a winner-takes-all culture: our first-past-the-post electoral system and addiction to reality-TV contests are different symptoms of this. We do not have the political culture of coalitions and compromises upon which our European neighbors’ governing systems depend. Our media also thrives on drama and sensationalism, and in the days after the referendum, it celebrated the result with all the drunken fervor of soccer supporters after a freak goal three minutes into injury time. The days and weeks after the referendum vote could have provided a space for reconciliation and calm reflection. Instead they became an occasion for frenzied triumphalism. The rift between Leavers and Remainers became even more bitter and entrenched, setting the tone for what was to come. The premiership of Theresa May set these divisions in stone. Chosen by her party to replace Cameron, she did not attempt to unite the country around this fractious issue but instead laid down red lines and talked in populist slogans like “Brexit means Brexit.” As her government twisted itself in knots negotiating a withdrawal deal with the E.U. leadership, her authority slowly slipped away–especially after the disastrous 2017 election in which she lost her parliamentary majority. By the time negotiators emerged with a compromise deal, lawmakers had long refused to engage with the reality of the sacrifices Brexit would require. At this point, a crucial fact about Leave’s victory in June 2016 became impossible to ignore: namely, that it had not just been narrow, it had been vague. During the referendum, campaigners had been skillful at stirring up resentments but had not set out in sufficient detail the nuts and bolts of leaving the E.U. or what Britain’s future relationship with Europe should be. When Brexit was an ideal, nebulous, undefined notion, just about 52% of the electorate could coalesce around it. When it had to be translated into political reality, nobody could agree what “it” was meant to look like.",How Brexit Broke Britain and Revealed a Country at War With Itself,"June 6, 2019"
841,Ian Bremmer,"Over the course of six weeks in 1989, Chinese students and those they inspired gathered in central Beijing in Tiananmen Square. It began as a spontaneous outpouring of respect and grief following the death of reformist leader Hu Yaobang, but the event then took on a life of its own as mourning became protest against corruption and repression and a call for greater political freedom. The demonstrations expanded to other Chinese cities. As the crowds swelled, some within the Communist Party leadership began to fear that the protests might continue to expand and to threaten the Communist Party’s political dominance. A cat-and-mouse game began as the state tried to find ways to move security forces into the square to end the Tiananmen occupation and as the protesters looked for ways to block them. As the crowds grew, so did the audience of people watching from around the world. Then the decision was made. On June 4, 1989, Chinese tanks used the cover of darkness to force their way into the square. In the process, the Chinese government massacred at least hundreds, maybe thousands, of its own people, most of them students. Three decades later, the fight over Tiananmen continues. On the rare occasion when a Chinese state official addresses these events at all, it is to justify the decision. On June 2, 2019, China’s Defense Minister described the events of 1989 as “political turmoil that the central government needed to quell, which was the correct policy.” Because of this, he said, “China has enjoyed stability, and if you visit China you can understand that part of history.” On the one hand, it’s hard to understand how a visit to China can shed light on the events of that era. Yes, China’s people have much more access to information today than they did in 1989. Yet, particularly when it comes to a subject as sensitive as the protests and massacre in the square, the Chinese state keeps a tight grip. Those who use social media in China must register accounts under their real names, and the authorities can demand access to those names whenever it wants. The government also uses state-of-the-art censorship tools to erase mention of a number of politically sensitive search terms or to redirect the user toward other subjects. Video recognition software can detect images related to the square and its bloody history. In short, China’s leaders have come as close as technically possible to erasing all record of what happened. On the other hand, the Chinese Communist Party leadership has presided over the largest economic expansion in human history. In 1989, when adjusted for differences in purchasing power, China’s economy generated just 4.11% of global GDP. Today it’s 19.24%. There is an obvious human dimension to this success. Market reform in China has undeniably lifted hundreds of millions of people from poverty. Nearly two-thirds of the population lived on $1.90 per day or less in 1990. In 2015, it was less than 1%. Per capita income increased by more than 900% over that period, and infant mortality rates fell by more than 80%. Thirty years after the murders in Tiananmen Square, China presents a contradictory legacy. Its leadership has provided opportunities for a better life to a larger number of people than any government in history. And China remains a police state, where citizens can’t publicly acknowledge that this mass murder ever took place.",The Legacy of the Tiananmen Square Massacre in China,"June 6, 2019"
842,Aryn Baker,"At least 60 people were killed and hundreds wounded in Khartoum on June 3 when the Sudanese military raided a peaceful sit-in calling for democratic reform. Troops shot into the crowd with live ammunition, set tents alight and beat fleeing protesters. By the next day, the once festive camp, which was set up by activists in April after the overthrow of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, was dismantled. So too were hopes that Sudan could peacefully transition to civilian rule after a 30-year dictatorship. The April coup came after months of popular protest, and led military leaders and opposition groups to agree on a three-year transition to democracy. But talks broke down when the protesters insisted the Transitional Military Council step down for a civilian-led interim body to oversee the transition. The day after the June raid, council leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan declared on state TV that earlier agreements with the protesters would be canceled and that the council would preside over national elections within nine months. The only way to rule Sudan, he said, “comes through the ballot box.” Al-Burhan may have spoken the language of democracy, but to many, the June 3 raid proves the military has little intention of relinquishing power for good. Pro-democracy activists and opposition parties say nine months is not enough time to muster resources, prepare voter rolls and strengthen civilian institutions after three decades of repression. They fear elections would serve up a weak leadership that could be easily overthrown–which is how al-Bashir took power back in the 1980s. This time, the protesters say they have no intention of repeating the same mistakes. U.S. officials criticized the military crackdown, but with little leverage, and even less interest in getting involved in yet another regional uprising, the repercussions are likely to be limited. For their part, the protesters are determined to carry on with the nationwide civil-disobedience campaign that first brought down al-Bashir, even if it brings more crackdowns. “We have no choice,” protest spokesman Mohammed Yousef al-Mustafa told the Associated Press, “but to continue until the fall of the military council.”   Contact us at editors@time.com.

843,Tony Capaccio and Kevin Hamlin / Bloomberg,"The Pentagon and State Department have informally notified Congress of a potential $2 billion deal with Taiwan that includes the first-time sale of one of the U.S. Army’s top tanks, according to an official familiar with the proposal, drawing protests from China. The deal would contain the M1A2 Abrams tank, and a resupply of anti-air and anti-armor weapons, the official familiar with the matter said. The notification of the government-to-government sale doesn’t include F-16 fighters, which are still under State Department and Pentagon review, the person said. “We are severely concerned about the U.S.’s move,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing on Thursday. “We are firmly against U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. We urge the U.S. to see the high sensitivity and severe harm of arms sales to Taiwan.” The move comes amid tensions over stalled trade talks between China and the U.S. China sees Taiwan as an integral part of its territory that it must unify, by force if necessary. The package includes 108 of the tanks built by General Dynamics Corp., as well as 1,240 TOW wire-guided anti-tank missiles, 409 shoulder-launched “fire-and-forget” Javelin anti-tank missiles and 250 Stinger shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles made famous by Afghan “freedom fighters” in their war against the Soviet Union. The informal notification, reported earlier Wednesday by Reuters, will be followed by a formal and public notification to Congress that’s likely to be approved within the normal 30-day review process. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense confirmed the request for the arms purchase on Thursday. In March, China vigorously protested the Trump administration’s tacit approval of Taiwan’s request to buy more than 60 F-16s built by Lockheed Martin Corp.

845,Amy Gunia,"Two American women and six children from families with suspected connections to the Islamic State were repatriated from Syria this week, Reuters reports. Kurdish-led authorities said the eight Americans were sent back to the U.S. Wednesday at Washington’s request. The Americans were among thousands of wives and children of foreign jihadists taken into custody after U.S.-backed forces captured the last of the Islamic State’s territory in Syria in March, according to Reuters. The detainees were transferred into overcrowded camps that have posed a dilemma for both local officials struggling to detain large numbers of foreign ISIS adherents, and governments reluctant to take back citizens who lived under the caliphate. The State Department confirmed that the U.S. had “safely recovered” citizens from Syria and is assisting with the repatriation efforts, according to Agence France-Presse. The spokesperson declined to identify the American returnees citing privacy considerations. The Kurdish administration said the latest repatriations were based on the women and children’s “free and voluntary desire to return to their country.” Kurdish authorities are hoping to increase the number of detainees being sent back to their countries of origin. Some governments have shown a willingness to take back their citizens, but “only humanitarian causes,” Abdulkarim Omar, co-chair of foreign relations in the Kurdish-led region said, according to Reuters.

846,Olivia B. Waxman,"Thursday marks the anniversary of D-Day — when, on June 6, 1944, more than 150,000 Allied troops landed in Normandy to liberate Europe from Nazi German control. It was a moment that changed the course of world events. Given its importance and the inherent drama of the massive military operation, it’s perhaps unsurprising that filmmakers have tried to bring that moment to life on screen — some more successfully than others.

847,Jasmine Aguilera,"Traveling to Cuba just got tougher for Americans. The U.S. departments of Treasury and Commerce announced new restrictions Tuesday that include travel bans for cruise ships and group tours from the U.S. effective Wednesday, June 5. The rules target the primary ways Americans travel to the island nation, which was closed to most U.S. travelers for decades until former President Barack Obama eased travel restrictions in 2016. The Trump Administration says the rules are part of an effort to keep U.S. dollars out of the hands of the communist government amid claims it is backing U.S. adversaries in Venezuela and Nicaragua. “Cuba remains communist, and the United States, under the previous administration, made too many concessions to one of our historically most aggressive adversaries,” said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, in a statement released Tuesday. “The Trump Administration recognizes the threat Cuba’s government poses in the region, and the Commerce Department is acting to limit commercial activity that provides revenue for the Cuban regime. Holding other countries accountable remains a focus for this Administration and we will remain vigilant.” Travelers who booked airfare before June 5 are exempt from the new rules. But cruise ships with scheduled stops in Cuba are already changing their itineraries. The restrictions also include halting corporate and private aircraft traveling to Cuba. The restrictions effectively stop all cruise travel from the U.S. to Cuba, and stop all “people-to-people” group tours, one of 12 visa categories Americans can use to travel to the country. It permits groups of Americans to travel for group educational tours. The Cruise Line International Association (CLIA) said cruise lines are eliminating all Cuba destinations from their itineraries, affecting nearly 800,000 passengers.

848,"Billy Perrigo / Portsmouth, U.K.","Local leaders originally intended it to be a humble ceremony of remembrance for the surviving combatants of Europe’s finest hour. But the presence of glittering royals and heads of state at Portsmouth’s D-Day commemoration on Wednesday turned the event into a far more formal — and occasionally contentious — affair. President Donald Trump, whose first state visit to the U.K. had been organized to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in 1944, took pride of place next to Queen Elizabeth II in the royal box. The sometimes emotional ceremony marked the day when more than 75,000 mostly British, American and Canadian troops departed from this city in southern England toward the beaches of France, in what would become a turning point in the war against Nazi Germany. Alongside Trump were representatives of at least 16 nations including British Prime Minister Theresa May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Before the ceremony started, residents of Portsmouth told TIME they were skeptical of whether the presence of so many world leaders would actually benefit veterans, who are now all aged in their 90s or beyond. Security had to be ramped up significantly, with extra police officers sent from across the country. “When we originally planned the event, this was going to be an opportunity for the veterans to meet the Queen, probably for the very last time,” said the leader of Portsmouth city council, Gerald Vernon-Jackson. “It was going to be a very open event for the public to watch and attend. Now it’s a very different thing.” Each of the world leaders had signed a “D-Day Proclamation” in which they pledged to “work constructively as friends and allies to find common ground where we have differences of opinion and to work together to resolve international tensions peacefully.” But amid the military flypast, speeches from veterans, and commitments from political leaders to work together and never forget that historic sacrifice, the event served to highlight political divisions apparent in the host country. May, overseeing the proceedings, is scheduled to resign as leader of her country this summer after being forced out over Brexit. Trump, who haltingly read a short commemorative prayer by FDR, had seemed much more comfortable two days earlier dining in opulence in Buckingham Palace — despite protests on the streets of London against his visit. Macron, whose popularity has waned amid the Yellow Vest protests, apparently felt comfortable enough to depart from the script of the mostly stage-managed affair to say a few words: “Let me first thank you, sincerely, on behalf of my nation.” Yet for the most part, politics took a backseat on Wednesday to the military parades, historical reenactments and readings of wartime documents. May read from a letter written by Captain Norman Skinner to his wife Gladys two days before D-Day: “I’m sure that anyone with imagination must dislike the thought of what’s coming, but my fears will be more of being afraid than of what can happen to me,” she read. “You and I have had some lovely years which now seemed to have passed at lightning speed.” Captain Skinner died in the assault.",Trump and May Can't Escape Shadow of Politics at Portsmouth's D-Day Ceremony,"June 5, 2019"
849,Siobhan Morrin,"The FIFA Women’s World Cup 2019 kicks off in Paris on Friday. From new teams to new kits to a new host, here’s your cheat sheet for this year’s tournament. Women’s soccer is more popular in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world. The dominance of the men’s game nearly everywhere else was the reality Germany’s women archly pointed up in a video noting that the prize for the first of their eight European championships was a tea set. But the rest of the world is finally starting to catch on to the excellence of the women’s game. In April, FIFA reported more than 720,000 tickets had been sold, over 50,000 more than at the same point for the previous World Cup, and the opening match sold out within 48 hours. TV viewership promises to be in the hundreds of millions; in Europe, national broadcasters like the BBC are showing more of the matches live on mainstream channels. You wouldn’t have expected to see a men’s World Cup without luminaries like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. But the women’s tournament will be missing the first winner of the Ballon d’Or Féminin, given to the best women’s player in the world: Norway’s Ada Hegerberg. The 23-year-old striker for Lyon scored a record number of goals in the Women’s Champions League last season. But in an act of protest over how her country’s federation treats the women’s game, she stopped playing for Norway. Hegerberg’s absence dims the star wattage in France–along with her country’s chances. From our Partner: IBM on how AI can drive equality Four teams are making World Cup debuts: Scotland, Chile, South Africa (above) and Jamaica. Chile has a rough path in Group F, where the top-ranked U.S. is expected to dominate. Scotland will face local rival England, which is riding high after this year’s triumph in the SheBelieves Cup. However, the Lionesses are wary of a slip-up, with English winger Karen Carney telling the BBC before the group draw, “I wouldn’t want [Scotland]. They’d have a lot of fans coming over, and the rivalry can be a leveler.” The top two teams from all six groups, as well as four third-place teams, will pass through to the knockout rounds. Though France’s women have never won a major tournament, Les Bleues (above) are consistently among the favorites, particularly this year. On top of home-field advantage, almost a third of the squad plays for Olympique Lyonnais, far and away the most dominant women’s team in Europe, with 13 consecutive domestic league titles and four Champions League trophies in a row. The team’s stars include French captain Amandine Henry and vice captain Eugénie Le Sommer. But their Lyon teammates–like Canada’s Kadeisha Buchanan, England’s Lucy Bronze, Germany’s Dzsenifer Marozsan and Japan’s Saki Kumagai–populate the rosters of the competition. For the first time in the women’s game, many of the players’ kits will feature a unique design rather than being a copy of the country’s men’s uniforms. There are still a few unis that replicate the men’s designs–notably Nigeria’s, whose green-and-white zigzag pattern with black patterned sleeves echoes the men’s jersey that was so popular at last year’s World Cup. Other, more original throwback styles include Germany’s ’90s-inspired pattern by Adidas and Australia’s green, white and orange “brushstroke” look.

850,Shireen Ahmed,"The biggest women’s sports tournament of 2019 will begin in Paris on Friday. The top 24 teams in the world will be descending on France to compete for the title of World Champions at the FIFA Women’s World Cup. The next six weeks will be ripe with anticipation and and we can prepare ourselves for the joy and heartbreak that comes with the beautiful game. The media hype and marketing around this event reaffirms that this might be the most popular and widely watched iteration of the World Cup since the tournament began (unofficially) in 1970. But the road here hasn’t been easy.  Fans of women’s sport have invested emotionally and financially in these great women athletes. We have witnessed their struggles against systemic sexism (Argentina), their fight for equal pay (U.S.), and their continued commitment to improving society (Canada). The most celebrated women’s player of the year, UEFA Champion and Ballon d’Or winner Ada Hegerberg of Norway is not attending the World Cup because of what she considers inequality in her country. She will forgo the tournament and stepped away from the national team in 2017, after a poor result at the Euros. Despite the fact that Norway was the first football federation in the world to offer pay parity for men’s and women’s teams, Hegerberg maintains that it is not only about money. “There are federations, there are clubs, there are men in high positions who have that responsibility to put the women in the right place and that’s where I think, I feel, and I know, we have a long way to go,” she has explained. In May 2019, UEFA Champions League launched a women’s soccer development and strategy initiative that seeks to double the amount of women and girl players in Europe by 2024. The initiative recognizes the need for support, financial backing or programs, but also the involvement and positions of women in soccer — perhaps a recognition of the sheer inaction thus far. The fact that teams in Europe struggle with sexism at the core of their experiences is a reminder that misogyny is not reserved for the Global South.  But if the most successful and popular women’s teams in the world are fighting for their dues, imagine the obstacles of those who don’t have the platforms, who don’t have the safety and who are simply trying to keep their teams afloat. The ones whose federations are marred with corruption and abuse. The ones whose freedom and identity is tightly connected to soccer, but whose chances of ever developing and realizing a World Cup dream lies in a dark abyss. The ones whose futures and possibilities are not valued by the men who control the sport and reign from thrones of privilege and impunity. Seven of the 10 top-ranked women’s teams are in North America and Europe. Japan is 7th and Brazil is 10th; Australia is 6th. There are three African nations attending (Nigeria, Cameroon and South Africa) this year but there are no Arab or Middle Eastern, Central Asian or South Asian teams in the tournament. As we watch, cheer and embrace the fandom that the women’s game truly deserves, it is equally important to remember the girls and women who did not make it to the world’s stage. We must think more about how to include those players in this experience of the World Cup. In late 2018, players from the Afghanistan women’s national team disclosed horrific sexual abuse by the head of the Afghanistan Football Federation — the same body that is charged with advocating and supporting their development. The investigations and any response in this case by FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) are ongoing (read: pathetically slow and unencouraging).  Several Middle Eastern countries are rife with civil unrest, suffer the destruction of facilities, and like the example of Palestine, suffer constant pressure under occupation. In some regions, there seems to be little time for soccer except for places like refugee camps where sport is used as a tool of development and rehabilitation for survivors of displacement and war.  Freedom Fields is a film by Naziha Arebi about the Libyan women’s soccer program in Tripoli. For five years, Arebi has chronicled their struggles, their journey and their joys on and off the pitch.

The search is believed to be in connection to a 2017 article published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation which detailed potential war crimes, including the killing of children and unarmed men, by Australian special forces in Afghanistan, reports the New York Times. The article was based on leaked military documents. John Lyons, Executive Editor of ABC News and its Head of Investigative Journalism, gave a play-by-play on his Twitter account, including photos of the police search warrant, an update on ABC’s lawyer’s attempts to push back and photos of the police reviewing ABC emails on a large screen in what appears to be a conference room. David Anderson, ABC’s Managing Director issued a statement saying the raid raised serious concerns about freedom of the press, and reaffirming ABC’s supports for its journalists. “The ABC stands by its journalists, will protect its sources and continue to report without fear or favor on national security and intelligence issues when there is a clear public interest,” said the statement. The Times reports that it is illegal for government officials to disclose classified information, which allows the police to investigate, and although journalists do have some legal defense related to protecting sources, courts are able to overrule those protections if it is in the public interest. The search comes a day after the police searched the home, computer and mobile phone of journalist Annika Smethurst, a politics editor for several of News Corp’s publications, including the Sunday Telegraph and the Herald Sun, in relation to a 2018 story which exposed the government’s consideration of a plan to spy on citizens.

854,Jasmine Aguilera,"“Chief Mouser” Larry the Cat briefly stole the show during President Donald Trump’s visit to the U.K. Tuesday, after deciding to rest under the President’s limo. Larry, a famous cat who lives around 10 Downing Street, the official residence of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, is known as the “Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office.” He’s used to national attention and crashing press conferences — he photobombed Trump’s photo-op with Prime Minister Theresa May earlier the same day. But this time, his antics caused a brief delay in the President’s schedule until he finally decided to move out from under “the Beast,” Trump’s security limo, according to journalists who photographed the furry scene. Larry has been living at 10 Downing Street since Feb. 2011 after being recruited from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home for his exceptional mouse hunting skills, according to his official bio. “Larry spends his days greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defenses and testing antique furniture for napping quality,” it reads. “His day-to-day responsibilities also include contemplating a solution to the mouse occupancy of the house. Larry says this is still ‘in tactical planning stage.'” Larry’s relaxing break under “the Beast” happened midway through Trump’s three-day visit to the U.K. to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the 1944 D-Day landings. Trump has met with Queen Elizabeth II, members of the Royal Family and held a joint press conference with May while on his visit. Others, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, have also attempted to impede Trump’s visit, if not so literally.

855,Madeline Roache,"75,000 protestors gathered in central London’s Trafalgar Square on Tuesday to show their anger over U.S. President Trump’s visit to the U.K, according to the Stop Trump coalition. Meanwhile, Trump dismissed the protests as “fake news” during a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May.  He insisted that he’d only seen “thousands of people” who had been cheering during his visit, and a “small protest” earlier Tuesday. “So a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say,” he said.  As the President sat down for discussions with British Prime Minister Theresa May at Number 10 Downing Street, protestors marched from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square with placards which spelt out their disdain for Trump. “Stand up against Trump”, “Make racists afraid again”, “Dump Trump” were some of the messages being raised in the crowd. While thousands turned out, the protests were significantly smaller than the anti-Trump demonstrations that emerged during the President’s visit to the U.K. last July. About 250,000 people flooded the center of London, and an estimated total of 400,000 people protested across the U.K, resulting in a large-scale police and security operation, in which more than 10,000 police officers were deployed. The demonstrations brought together a range of campaigners focusing on issues such as women’s rights, climate change and refugee support. Handmaids Against Trump, a women’s rights group, stood dressed in red cloaks and white hats, with solemn expressions. Their placards read “The Handmaid’s Tale is not an instruction manual” and “Beware for I am fearless therefore powerful”.  Susan Paxton, a Handmaids Against Trump activist and a doctor who specializes in women’s reproductive health, criticized the President’s appointment of conservative justices. She tells TIME that such appointments “undermine women’s reproductive rights” and called the recent abortion ban in Alabama “disgusting”. Trump has spoken openly about his opposition to abortion and promised to only appoint “pro-life” judges. Another protestor and environmental campaigner Joel Benjamin says the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement “undoes a post-war legacy of international cooperation and governance to protect the environment”. In June 2017 Trump announced that the U.S. was pulling out of the 2015 Agreement, which fights global warming by accelerating investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future. Eva Bonham, 68, an activist from the environmental group Extinction Rebellion, held a placard that read “Trump has pissed off grandma”. Bonham travelled from Derby, some 130 miles northwest of London, to protest not only against Trump’s climate change denials, but also because he’s “separated children from their families, he’s putting up a walls, he’s divisive. We want strong relations with America but we don’t approve of Trump.”","While Thousands March, President Trump Dismisses London Protests as 'Fake News'","June 4, 2019"
856,"Randy Covington, University of South Carolina / The Conversation","Myanmar, nudged by the conscience of the world, recently released two Reuters journalists imprisoned for more than 500 days – good news in what otherwise has been a dismal period for media freedom. The 2019 Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders shows how hatred of journalists has degenerated into violence and created “an intense climate of fear” worldwide. According to the Paris-based nonprofit, 12 reporters have been killed so far this year and 172 are in jail. In the last decade, according to the group, 702 journalists have been killed, including 63 last year. “The number of countries regarded as safe, where journalists can work in complete security, continues to decline, while authoritarian regimes continue to tighten their grip on the media,” the report states. Myanmar ranks 138th of 180 countries evaluated on media independence, laws, abuses and other factors. Norway, Finland and Sweden are seen as the most free. The U.S. is 48th, dropping three spots since 2018. Eritrea, North Korea and Turkmenistan are at the bottom of the list. Many countries in the lower third of the Press Freedom Index are authoritarian regimes in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In these places, which have few protections for free speech, media organizations are weak and often depend on the government for advertising. Journalists typically are poorly paid and have little training. In this environment, reporters who upset the government are at risk.","More Journalists Are Being Killed, Arrested and Assaulted as Authoritarianism Spreads","June 4, 2019"
857,Ciara Nugent,"The Chinese government issued two travel alerts to its citizens Tuesday, warning of rising levels of violent crime in the U.S. and harassment of Chinese visitors by American authorities, in the latest escalation of political tensions between the two countries. “Recently, U.S. law enforcement agencies have repeatedly harassed Chinese nationals travelling to the U.S. through border interrogations, drop-in visits and various other means,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on social media. The country’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism meanwhile urged Chinese tourists to “improve their awareness of safety and security” in light of “shootings, robberies and thefts [that] have occurred frequently in the United States.” A day earlier, China’s Education Ministry said Chinese students were having increasing trouble obtaining U.S. visas, urging them to assess the “risk” of choosing to study in the U.S. Chinese visitors to the U.S., including tourists and international students, contribute more money to the U.S. economy than any other group of foreign travelers, spending $36.4 billion last year, according to the National Tourism and Travel Office. Numbers of monthly visitors from China have fallen slightly in 2019, partly as a result of a stronger dollar making vacations in the U.S. more expensive. Relations between the U.S. and China have worsened steadily in recent months as trade disputes – and the Trump Administration’s blacklisting of Chinese technology giant Huawei – have sparked broader political tensions.  On Tuesday, China rebuked U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over his remarks on China’s human rights records ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protest, during which communist authorities killed an unknown number of student demonstrators. Pompeo accused China on Monday of “[abusing] human rights whenever it serves its interests”, citing recent persecution of the Uighur Muslim minority in the western Xinjiang region.",China Warns Travelers About Harassment and Crime in the U.S.,"June 4, 2019"
858,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"The center of one of the densest metropolises in the world fell momentarily quiet Tuesday night, as well over a hundred thousand people gathered in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park bowed their heads and held flickering candles to observe a minute of silence commemorating the bloodshed around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. For the last 30 years, Hong Kongers have held an annual march and candlelight vigil to remind the world of the night the Communist Party unleashed its tanks in response to protesters calling for political change. No one knows how many died — the official count is a secret — but it’s widely believed that hundreds if not thousands were slaughtered as soldiers moved to crush the seven-week democracy movement. The Tiananmen Square massacre forever changed China, and, arguably, the world. But three decades later, the anniversary remains taboo on the mainland, an event off-limits to nearly one-fifth of the planet. Today, semi-autonomous Hong Kong is the only place on Chinese soil that can openly stage large-scale memorials. “You are not here anymore but you continue to live through every single candle in Victoria park,” Chow Hang-tung, one of the event’s organizers and vice chairman of the pro-Democracy Hong Kong Alliance, said in a eulogy to the victims before an audience filling the park with dim, wavering light. “Through every anti-establishment activity we hold, through the hearts of those who fight for democracy, you will live on.” Hong Kong still exercises many freedoms unimaginable on the mainland, but these practices have slowly ebbed under the gravitational force of Beijing. Many wonder how long the Communist Party will continue to tolerate publicly defiant acts like the park’s massive vigil. Despite spitting weather and a government warning about thunderstorms issued just ahead of the event, Hong Kongers young and old crammed into the park for the emotionally charged vigil. Organizers estimate that more than 180,000 people joined this year; the 30th anniversary brought some who had never previously attended, in addition to those who reliably turn up every year. Candy Chan, 35, has attended the vigil every year for the past decade. She is native to Hong Kong, and was only a child when the Tiananmen protests took place, but she feels it’s important to keep the memory alive by exercising her right to commemorate and teaching her daughter about the past. “Hong Kong is the only place [in China] to express freedom,” she tells TIME. “If no one comes out, youngsters will forget this incident.” Joyce Dang, a civil servant who is also from Hong Kong, remembers following the news reports closely in 1989. She was in college at the time, and recalls feeling shocked and unable to sleep. “For those of us who experienced the event, the memories cannot be erased,” she says, but she worries that the freedom to publicly honor the memory in Hong Kong may not always be guaranteed.

859,Ciara Nugent,"President Donald Trump has praised Theresa May, the outgoing British Prime Minister, and called the Queen a “fantastic person” in a joint press conference in London after a key meeting between the two leaders mid-way through Trump’s visit to the U.K. Trump, who is in the U.K. to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in 1944, said that the U.K. and U.S. relationship is “the greatest alliance the world has ever known.” The mood was light at times, with Trump referring jokingly to the time he advised May to sue the E.U. “I would have sued, but that’s okay,” he said with a laugh. “I would have sued and settled, maybe, but you never know. She’s probably a better negotiator than I am.” On Brexit, Trump said he thinks “it will happen. I believe the Prime Minister has done a very good job where something will happen in the near future.” “I believe it would be good for the country,” he added. Trump’s visit is one of the last major engagements scheduled for May, who announced last month that she will step down as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7, allowing a new Prime Minister to be chosen, after she failed to get her Brexit deal with the E.U. through parliament. But Trump threw spanners into that uncertain transition Britain now faces. He appeared to endorse two candidates running to replace May: the frontrunner, Boris Johnson (“I like Boris, I always have,”) and the current Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt (“he’d do a very good job.”) And in an unexpected turn, he said he didn’t know Michael Gove, the current Environment Secretary who many expect will end up facing off against Johnson in the last round of the leadership election. When questioned on whether the U.K.’s beloved National Health Service (NHS) would be on the table in future post-Brexit trade talks, he replied: “everything’s on the table, so NHS or anything else. A lot more than that.” (May had to whisper in his ear after he appeared to not understand the meaning of the acronym when first questioned.)",President Trump Praises U.K.'s Theresa May and Says Brexit 'Would Be Good for the Country',"June 4, 2019"
860,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"The Goddess of Democracy smiled on China for exactly five days. The papier-mâché likeness of the Statue of Liberty appeared in Tiananmen Square as protests convulsed Beijing and other cities seeking to unshackle the world’s most populous country from endemic corruption. Their calls for political reform were answered in the early hours of June 4, 1989, with a bloody military crackdown that crushed the movement and toppled its symbols. The massacre at Tiananmen killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of the students and laborers who joined massive gatherings lasting more than a month. The movement, favoring democracy and reformist policies that caused rifts within the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, had spread to hundreds of cities before the government resolved to disperse it with brute force. Military tanks rolled into Beijing, where soldiers opened fire with assault rifles on the unarmed demonstrators who tried to stop their advance. And yet in the West, a certainty remained that China would eventually resurrect the dream of democracy that was deferred that night. Thirty years later, many are still waiting for the Middle Kingdom to liberalize, though the CCP’s grip on power has arguably never been tighter. To survive the upheaval, its leadership rewrote their social contract; the post-Maoist effort of “reform and opening up,” whereby China established its own brand of market-economy socialism, was ultimately accelerated but at the expense of political freedoms. By some measures the trade-off was tremendously successful. At the time of the Tiananmen rallies, China’s GDP per capita compared unfavorably to Gambia’s; by 2030, if not before, many indicators predict China’s economy will eclipse the U.S. “The Chinese government used economic benefits to persuade people they can live a good life under the CCP’s control,” says Joanne Ng, a Guangdong native who was nine years old at the time Tiananmen crackdown and who now lives in Hong Kong. “[While] my classmates enjoy these benefits, the truth is not necessarily so important to them.” Eventually the West acquiesced to China’s economic momentum on the premise that economic and social liberalization would develop in tandem. In 2000, on the verge of China joining the World Trade Organization, President George W. Bush declared, “Trade freely with China, and time is on our side.” “Many Western scholars and diplomats predicted that when China… integrated into the global economy it would create a middle class that demanded democracy,” says exiled human rights lawyer and China commentator Teng Biao, a visiting scholar at the U.S.-Asia Law Institute. “But that did not happen.” China several years ago leapfrogged the “political transition zone,” levels of income that reflect when authoritarian states typically undergo democratic transformation. Transition becomes more likely above $1,000 per capita, and dramatically more likely above $4,000 per capita. In 2018, China hit $9,608, according to the International Monetary Fund. Biao says the West’s forecast failed to consider that China’s economic metamorphosis was built on the bloody legacy of Tiananmen and relied on the “suppression of political rights and deprivation of human rights.”",How the Tiananmen Square Massacre Changed China Forever,"Updated: June 7, 2019 9:03 AM ET | Originally published: June 4, 2019"
861,TIME Staff,"For 30 years, China’s Communist Party has worked hard to erase the memory of the massacre on June 4, 1989. Much of the world is aware that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died as tanks and troops rolled through Tiananmen Square in the heart of the capital Beijing, ending the student-led struggle for a more open society. But a news blackout at the time meant that many Chinese were unaware the killings took place until well after the fact. The censorship continues to this day. References to Tiananmen—even simple images of candles, or playing cards showing the numbers 6 (for June) and 4—are kept off the heavily redacted Chinese internet. Parents who lost children are prevented from paying tribute to their deceased sons and daughters. Activists and outspoken dissidents are detained as the anniversary approaches. And many young Chinese grow up unaware of what happened that humid night 30 years ago. On the rare occasions when party officials mention June 4, 1989—as defense minister Wei Fenghe did last Sunday—it mostly sticks to a script: the military crackdown was the “correct” decision, as it ensured the nation’s stability and future economic development. The army officers who dare to voice dissenting opinions do so anonymously—such as the two veterans who told Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post that many in the army felt “guilt and shame” over the killings. On the 30th anniversary of a massacre China would like to blot out from its citizens’ collective memory, TIME spoke to young Chinese about what it’s like to stumble across a history they were not supposed to discover.

862,Suyin Haynes,"A new report published Tuesday reveals that 9 out of 10 girls around the world believe that female leaders suffer widespread discrimination and sexual harassment. Produced by child rights organization Plan International in partnership with the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, the report found that while a majority of girls and women worldwide want to take leadership positions in the workplace, politics and wider society, an overwhelming majority of those surveyed believe that women leaders face unfair treatment. According to the research, 93% of respondents believe female leaders experience unwanted physical contact, and 94% believe women aren’t treated as well as men in leadership positions. The research, titled ‘Taking the Lead,’ was carried out across 19 countries, with almost 10,000 girls and young women aged 15-24 participating in what the report’s authors say is one of the world’s first studies highlighting the leadership aspirations, perceptions and experiences of this demographic on a global scale. The study also found that young women from low-income countries were more likely to want to be leaders of their country, community or family than those from higher-income countries. “The findings show that despite having the aspirations to lead, girls and young women have extremely negative perceptions of what being a female leader involves,” said Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, CEO of Plan International, in a statement. “No matter where you are – USA or India, Japan or Sudan — for girls and women globally, being a leader means discrimination and harassment. That’s a major deterrent.” While a majority of Americans say they would like to see more women in top leadership positions according to a Pew Research Center survey in 2018, most say men still have an easier path to the top and that women have to do more to prove their worth. Worldwide, only 17 heads of state in 2018 were women, and only 6.6% of companies comprising the Fortune 500 are led by female CEOs. The report found that while nearly 60% girls and young women want to be a leader in the work place and over 75% aspire to be a leader in their country, community or career, overall they perceive a lack of respect for, and harsher criticism of, female leaders. “Inequality, intolerance and isolationism are on the rise,” Albrectsen told TIME. “The arc of history is bending back, away from justice.

863,Amy Gunia,"The disappearance of indigenous women and girls in Canada was determined to be genocide by a three-year national inquiry, the findings of which were released at a ceremony in Quebec Monday. The investigation began after the acquittal of the main suspect in the murder of a 15-year-old girl in 2014 sparked outrage and protests, reports the New York Times.  A 2014 Royal Canadian Mounted police report said that 1,200 indigenous women have gone missing or been killed between 1980 and 2012, although some government officials said the number is as high as 4,000. The report said that violence against women and girls was a “race-based genocide of Indigenous peoples, including First Nations, Inuit and Métis” enabled by “colonial structures,” reports the Times. The report cited abuses such as forcing indigenous children to attend government run residential schools, and police and justice system failure to address the concerns of indigenous women, according to the Times. “This is an uncomfortable day for Canada but it is an essential day,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who attended the ceremony, said, according to the Times. “To the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls of Canada, to their families and to survivors — we have failed you.” The Times reports that Trudeau pledged to review the report, to create a “national action plan” to address issues, and to work with indigenous partners on next steps. Marion Buller, the chief commissioner of the inquiry and a retired indigenous judge, defended the use of the word “genocide” to describe abuses against indigenous women in Canada. “The type of genocide we have in Canada is death by a million paper cuts for generations,” she told reporters, according to the Times. Trudeau promised a “full reconciliation” with indigenous peoples after a 2015 report was released documenting abuse against the aboriginal community, and in 2017 he told the U.N. that he was focused on “righting historical wrongs.”","'Genocide' Was Committed Against Canada's Indigenous Women, an Inquiry Found","June 4, 2019"
864,Bloomberg,"First trade, then technology — now talent. The Trump administration has started taking aim at China’s best and brightest in the U.S., scrutinizing researchers with ties to Beijing and restricting student visas. Several Chinese graduate students and academics told Bloomberg News in recent weeks that they found the U.S. academic and job environment increasingly unfriendly. Emory University dismissed two Chinese-American professors on May 16, and China’s Education Ministry issued a warning Monday on the risks of studying in the U.S. as student visa rejections soar. “I’m nervous, worried, even saddened by the unnecessary conflict,” said Liu Yuanli, founding director of the Harvard School of Public Health’s China Initiative and now serves as dean of Peking Union Medical College’s School of Public Health in Beijing. “The restrictions on Chinese scholars and students are irrational and go against the very core value that makes U.S. a great nation.” Liu is a participant in China’s controversial “Thousand Talents” recruitment program, which began in 2008 as a way for Beijing to encourage its brightest citizens abroad to help develop the economy back home. More recently, China has sought to play down the program as U.S. concerns about its activities grow. The developments underscore how the trade conflict is fundamentally changing the relationship between to the world’s two largest economies, from one of greater reliance to increasing suspicion. President Donald Trump’s expanding curbs on Chinese goods and China’s move to set up a sweeping blacklist of “unreliable” foreign entities since their trade talks broke down have helped fuel new Wall Street warnings about a possible global recession. Education has for decades been a strong point of cooperation between the nations, with a surge of Chinese students filling American university coffers while giving the country access to some of the world’s best research hubs. The U.S. hosted more than 360,000 students from China last year, according to a report by the Institute of International Education, more than any other country. Still, growth has slowed amid the trade tensions, with the number of students rising 3.6% last year — or roughly half the pace of the previous year. The share of Chinese government-sponsored students refused visas increased to 13.5% in the first three months of this year, compared with 3.2% in the same period of 2018, according to new Chinese government data. Annual student visa renewals, which previously took about three weeks, are now dragging on for months, according to several Chinese doctorate candidates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who asked not to be named over concerns their career prospects could be affected. One of the students said they were leaning toward returning home after graduation, worried that the scrutiny of Chinese scholars could continue for years.",Trump's Trade War Targets Chinese Students at Elite U.S. Schools,"June 4, 2019"
865,Eric Fish,"It has become tradition around anniversaries of the 1989 Beijing massacre to contrast youth of that era with young Chinese of today. The former, these comparisons suggest, clamored for political change, while the latter show little hint of that revolutionary zeal — in fact they suffer from “amnesia” and “apathy” toward the events. In June of 1989, the blood on Beijing’s streets had barely dried before the state-enforced forgetting began. Thirty years later, authorities continue to aggressively suppress the full story. Some textbooks whitewash the Tiananmen protests as a “riot” instigated by black elements who were justifiably suppressed with violence, along with a small number of bystanders; most don’t mention it at all. China’s sophisticated “Great Firewall” internet censorship apparatus likewise snuffs out any mention of the events, and those who try to publicly acknowledge them are often harassed, intimidated or detained. But some argue that those efforts may not even be necessary. After Tiananmen, China’s Communist Party began pushing a new “patriotic education,” presenting itself as a savior from “hostile foreign forces” past and present. It simultaneously allowed reforms that have grown the economy nearly 30-fold since 1989 and steadily loosened its grip on citizens’ personal lives. This largely negated one major grievance young protestors aired at Tiananmen: the desire to have a greater degree of personal freedom and agency. A generation into these developments, Chinese youth of today have supposedly become too distracted by nationalism and the pursuit of material wealth to care about June 4. But with the number of Chinese who are too young to remember 1989 in the hundreds of millions, what they know and think about that year defies generalizations. While researching a book on Chinese millennials and their relationship with the state, I interviewed at length more than 130 youths from across the socioeconomic and geographic spectrums. Those conversations would usually find their way to Tiananmen Square, but one of the biggest surprises was that often I wasn’t the one who brought it up.

866,Billy Perrigo,"President Donald Trump delivered an aerial assault aimed at London mayor Sadiq Khan Monday morning, calling him a “stone cold loser” as he landed in the U.K. to begin a three-day state visit. Trump sent the tweet as Air Force One prepared to land at London’s Stansted Airport. “Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly “nasty” to the visiting President of the United States,” he wrote. The President’s comments came after Khan said it would be “un-British” to roll out the red carpet for Trump, and that he would boycott the visit. A spokesperson for Khan responded to the President’s comments on Monday: “This is much more serious than childish insults which should be beneath the President of the United States. Sadiq is representing the progressive values of London and our country warning that Donald Trump is the most egregious example of a growing far-right threat around the globe, which is putting at risk the basic values that have defined our liberal democracies for more than 70 years.” Trump’s tweets are the latest barbs in a long-running spat between the pair. In 2016, Khan, who is Muslim, criticized Trump’s campaign proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States, calling his views on Islam “ignorant.” In response, Trump challenged Khan to an IQ test. “I will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements,” Trump said. A year on, after the deadly terrorist attacks in London in 2017, the feud escalated. Khan had told Londoners that they would see an increased police presence on the streets as a precaution after the violence, and to not be alarmed. Trump then tweeted: “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is “no reason to be alarmed!” A spokesperson for Khan later told reporters: “He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump’s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police―including armed officers―on the streets.” Then, when Trump visited London in 2018, Khan gave the green light for a “Trump Baby” balloon to fly outside the Houses of Parliament at a protest.

868,Robin Niblett,"As President Trump landed in the U.K. on June 3 for a visit that also includes Ireland and France, we have yet another opportunity to reflect on the health of the transatlantic relationship. The situation is considerably different from July last year, when Trump’s U.K. trip was lampooned by commentators and hounded by protesters. Trump has now molded a presidential administration that is far closer to his own worldview. The gloves are off when it comes to his two foreign policy priorities – Iran and China. He may have a less pliant U.S. Congress, following the Democratic take-over of the House last November, but the failure of the Mueller Report to land the killer blow that many of his opponents hoped, combined with a strong domestic economy, mean that he is now a favorite to win the 2020 election. For its part, Europe has grown weaker rather than stronger over the same period. The elections to the European Parliament have revealed that Trumpian populism is on the rise on this side of the Atlantic also. President Emmanuel Macron, the anti-Trump standard bearer, has lost his luster; Angela Merkel has formally moved into the twilight of her Chancellorship; and Theresa May is stepping down as Prime Minister after failing to deliver Brexit on schedule. On the international stage, France, Germany and the U.K. have been unable to make any headway in resisting the growing stranglehold that renewed U.S. sanctions are imposing on European companies that might have wanted to follow their governments’ urging and sustain trade relations with Iran. Similarly, Europeans have watched powerlessly from the sidelines as the U.S. has ratcheted up its tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. The spectacle of U.K. chip designer ARM and other European companies cutting business ties with Chinese telecoms company Huawei following its naming on the U.S. foreign entities list, has amplified the extra-territorial reach of America’s geo-economic strategy. Today, Europeans hold no sway and have no say over U.S. foreign policy decisions that many believe run counter to their interests. Yet they and their companies are being forced to serve as agents of these policies. They are being bullied, and it is working. President Trump has exposed pitilessly the fact that, while might may not be right, might generally wins. Europeans cannot play hardball in return unless they have the resources and credibility to follow through. On security, they currently lack both the resources and the combined political willpower to demonstrate strategic autonomy.

869,Hillary Leung,"The global trash trade has reached a turning point; wealthier nations have long shipped their plastic waste to the developing world to be processed, but in recent months, some nations in Southeast Asia have begun sending the exports — much of it contaminated plastic and trash that is unrecyclable — back to where it came from. The pushback comes as containers of trash continue to accumulate on the shores of countries like Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, which are increasingly worried that the environmental costs are greater than the income they bring in from importing the waste. Southeast Asia has not always been the world’s dumping ground. For decades, China was the world’s biggest importer of scrap plastic, taking in millions of tonnes of plastic waste as raw materials from countries like the U.S. and the U.K. to fuel a growing manufacturing sector. China imported close to half of the world’s global plastic waste, reaching a peak of nine million tonnes in 2012, according to environmental organization Greenpeace. But severe pollution as a result of poorly managed waste processes led to a country-wide import ban in January 2018, effectively barring China from receiving the plastic waste it had bought so much of in the past. The legislation caused a significant shake-up in the global garbage trade. “There was a mass scramble for alternative destinations for waste coming from mainly industrialized countries,” Von Hernandez, Global Coordinator of nonprofit Break Free From Plastic, told TIME. The garbage is exported from around a dozen developed countries including the U.S., Canada, France, Belgium, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and the U.K., according to Greenpeace. According to the BBC, the European Union is the world’s biggest exporter of plastic waste, while the U.S. is the largest single-country source. “Richer countries are taking advantage of the looser regulations in poorer countries,” Lea Guerrero, Country Director for Greenpeace Philippines, told TIME. “They export the trash here because it’s more expensive for them to process the mixed, contaminated waste themselves back home due to the tighter laws.”",Southeast Asia Doesn't Want to Be the World's Dumping Ground.

870,Abby Vesoulis,"Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, rebuked the United Kingdom’s efforts to welcome President Donald Trump for his three-day state visit to the European nation that begins Monday. In an 841-word opinion piece published by The Guardian on Saturday, Khan condemns Trump for starting an immigration policy that separated children from parents, using racism and xenophobia as election tactics and introducing a travel ban on predominantly-Muslim countries. “No, these are not the actions of European dictators of the 1930s and 40s. Nor the military juntas of the 1970s and 80s. I’m not talking about Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un. These are the actions of the leader of our closest ally, the President of the United States of America,” Khan writes. Khan, the first Muslim to be elected London’s mayor, and a member of Britain’s Labour Party, warns readers of an expanding allegiance to far-right politics, and classifies Trump as “one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat.” Khan and the President have a contentious history. When terrorists killed eight people and badly injured 48 more during an attack on the London Bridge in 2017, Trump criticized the mayor in a tweet. “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!'” Trump wrote. Though Khan’s fuller remarks were that Londoners should not be alarmed by an increased police presence in the days after the attack. A spokesperson for the mayor called Trump’s tweet “ill-informed” at the time. Khan’s op-ed comes right after Trump gave a preliminary endorsement to Boris Johnson, saying the Conservative party member “would be excellent” and would do a “very good job” running the country after current Prime Minister and fellow Conservative party member Theresa May steps down for failing to to deliver the Brexit she had promised.",London Mayor Compares Trump to European Dictators in Scathing Op-Ed About the President's U.K. Visit,"June 2, 2019"

But wherever Trump goes over the next three days, he’ll almost certainly be met with heated protests. Anti-Trump demonstrations are set to take place in London and across the U.K. during the visit. Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), tells TIME she expects hundreds of thousands to gather from all around the country. “There’s very strong opposition to Trump in the U.K.,” she says. Trump stirred controversy before he even landed. Speaking to the British tabloid newspaper The Sun, Trump backed Boris Johnson as Britain’s next Prime Minister, just days before May steps down as leader of the Conservative Party. “I think Boris would do a very good job. I think he would be excellent,” Trump said, adding “I like him. I have always liked him.” During the interview, he also expressed “shock” at Meghan Markle’s “nasty” comments about him, but said she’ll make a good princess. The Duchess of Sussex, who will not attend the State Banquet as she’s on maternity leave having recently given birth, called Trump “divisive” and “misogynistic” during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has since denied calling Markle “nasty”. Before leaving the White House on Sunday night Trump told the Sunday Times that Britain should “walk away” from Brexit talks and refuse to pay a 39 billion pound ($49 billion) divorce bill if it doesn’t get better deal from the European Union. He said he might meet with pro-Brexit politician, Nigel Farage, during his visit, and claimed Farage should be given a role in the Brexit negotiations. Trump also fired back at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who said that the language used by President Trump was similar to the language used by 20th century fascists in an article for the Observer yesterday. The U.S. President said the labour Mayor has done a “terrible job” and called him “very dumb”, “incompetent” and “a stone cold loser”. Trump was greeted with a special welcome before Air Force One touched down in London.

872,Abby Vesoulis,"A colossal cruise ship crashed into a smaller tourist boat and a dock in Venice on Sunday, injuring at least four tourists. Footage of the collision shows an approximately 900-foot-long MSC Opera blaring its horns and failing to slow down as it approached the San Basilio Terminal on the Giudecca Canal. A much smaller tourist boat, the River Countess, was docked and couldn’t move away from the terminal in time. Four female tourists, including one American, were injured while falling or trying to run away, according to the Associated Press. The incident incited renewed calls to block off the cramped Giudecca canal from large vessels that drop off up to tens of thousands of visitors in the Italian city each day. The cruise ship’s operator, MSC, attributed the collision to a “technical problem” in a statement. MSC said it was performing an investigation to “understand the exact dynamic of the facts,” the operator said, according to the New York Times. Italy’s Minister of the Environment, Sergio Costa, said the crash proved what experts have long been warning. “What happened in the port of Venice is the confirmation of what we have been saying for a long time: big ships must not pass by Giudecca,” he tweeted in Italian.","Cruise Ship Slams Into Dock in Venice, Injuring at Least 4","Updated: June 2, 2019 8:53 PM ET"
873,Abby Vesoulis,"Amid a growing online outcry, President Donald Trump responded to claims he called Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, “nasty” by tweeting that it was “made up by the Fake News Media” on Sunday. His remarks came after an interview with the President was published by British newspaper The Sun on Saturday. Reporters from the publication asked Trump if he was disappointed he wouldn’t see Markle — who is currently on maternity leave after having her first child in May — on his state visit to the United Kingdom. The reporters informed him that Markle “wasn’t so nice to” Trump during the 2016 campaign, and that she said she would have moved to Canada if Trump was elected. Trump was apparently surprised at Markle’s remarks. “I didn’t know that, no,” he said. “So, what can I say? No, I didn’t know that she was nasty.” An official Twitter account for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign had tweeted the audio to the interview on Saturday, asserting the audio proved Trump did not call Markle “nasty.” “Fake News CNN is at it again, falsely claiming President Trump called Meghan Markle ‘nasty,'” the account said. Though the audio it posted clearly included Trump’s “I didn’t know that she was nasty” comment. Politico reports a White House official said Trump did not say that Markle was nasty, and that he was responding to The Sun reporter telling Trump Markle’s criticisms of him. A White House official also told HuffPost that Trump’s comment was regarding Markle’s words, and not Markle herself. “He wasn’t saying she was nasty,” the official told the publication. “He was responding to the reporter reading things she had said about him in the past and he was saying he didn’t realize she had said nasty things towards him. He said very nice things about her, including he thought she would do an excellent job as princess, etc.”",President Trump Denies Meghan Markle 'Nasty' Comment Despite Recording,"Updated: June 2, 2019 4:49 PM ET"

In an interview with the British newspaper The Sun that was published on Saturday, Trump was asked how he felt about Markle calling him “misogynistic” and “divisive” during a 2016 appearance she made on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore. The Duchess of Sussex also said that she would consider staying in Canada, where she was filming Suits at the time, if Trump became President. Trump was apparently surprised by Markle’s remarks. “I didn’t know that… No, I hope she is OK. I didn’t know that, no,” he said. “So what can I say?

875,Mahita Gajanan,"President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs on imports from Mexico could take a toll on American automakers if and when they go into effect, economists and industry experts say, causing collateral economic damage as Trump seeks to pressure Mexico to take more action to curb the migrant crisis. Major American automakers, like Ford and General Motors, have factories in Mexico, letting them benefit from lower labor costs by making vehicles or vehicle parts abroad before importing them into the United States for sale. The U.S. imported $93 billion worth of vehicles from Mexico in 2018, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, more than any other kind of good. About 22% of the vehicles GM sold in the U.S. last year were imported from Mexico, according to research firm LMC Automotive, The Wall Street Journal reports, while that figure is about 10% for Ford. But Trump’s tariffs, which he says would start at 5% on June 10 before escalating to as much as 25%, are effectively a tax on imports. When Ford or GM imports a car or part from Mexico, it would have to pay any tariff that’s in place. That could significantly increase the cost of automakers’ Mexican operations and disturb their complex supply chains, experts say. While Trump’s announcement sent a variety of companies’ stocks tumbling, it hit American automakers particularly hard: GM was down 5.5% in premarket trading Friday, while Ford was down 4%. Neither automaker responded immediately to TIME’s request for comment. If Trump’s tariffs are enacted, automakers’ supply chains will be among the first casualties, experts say. American companies, automakers included, rely on Mexico to provide items that aren’t easily found elsewhere, says Susan Helper, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University and former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Commerce. For example, U.S. automakers might import from Mexico certain instrument panels or a mold that makes a part unique to one vehicle. Tariffs could cause delays in their supply chain that spark a domino effect, she says. “When you’re importing something from Mexico it’s not like you’re buying lumber from Home Depot, where if the wood isn’t available, you go to some other store,” Helper says. “These relationships are longstanding, and the factories have a lot of very specific equipment needed to make a specific part.”  A 5% tariff wouldn’t lead to a total meltdown for automakers, Helper says. But if Trump steadily increases his tariffs to the threatened 25% level, they would cut into profit margins and likely lead to price increases for car buyers. Even the initial 5% level could be a drag on automakers. Italy Michaeli of Citi Investment Research told the Associated Press that General Motors anticipates losing hundreds of millions of dollars if Trump’s tariffs are imposed. But car companies with supply chains based elsewhere, like in Asia, won’t incur the same costs, giving foreign competitors a potential advantage over their American rivals. “It’s disproportionately hurting them,” Helper says. (Foreign automakers that build cars in Mexico for sale in the U.S., like Volkswagen, would also be subject to any tariffs when importing goods to the U.S. from Mexico.) Ann Wilson, SVP for government affairs at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents vehicle suppliers and manufacturers, says that in the long run, Trump’s tariffs will result in prohibitive price increases on auto parts and, eventually, vehicles themselves. The average cost of a new car in the U.S. is $35,000, according to Wilson, who says that Trump’s tariffs could raise that to nearly $40,000.",American Automakers Could Be a Casualty in Trump's Trade War With Mexico,"May 31, 2019"
876,Joseph Hincks,"Just seven weeks after he claimed victory in national elections and prepared to embark on a historic fifth term, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a government within the allotted 42-day limit, plunging the country into political turmoil and forcing Israelis to return to the polls for fresh elections this fall. Netanyahu was on track to become the longest serving Prime Minister in Israeli history, surpassing the country’s founder David Ben-Gurion. But as the deadline loomed Wednesday night, the populist right wing leader had brought together only 60 of the 120 seats that form Israel’s parliament, or Knesset — exactly one short of a majority. The Knesset voted to dissolve itself, with Netanyahu calling another election on September 17. The fact that it is no longer guaranteed that Netanyahu will be in power past the summer could derail President Donald Trump’s already stuttering “deal of the century,” the name his administration uses to refer to its Middle East peace plan. Senior Adviser Jared Kushner was in Jerusalem for discussions just as Netanyahu’s coalition collapsed. The political discord also virtually ends Netanyahu’s chances of passing legislation to insulate him against several corruption charges. Here’s more on how Netanyahu got here. Israel’s complex multi-party system means that the winner on election day always depends on the support of a coalition. Over the past decade, both right-wing nationalists and ultra-Orthodox parties could be counted on to line up behind Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party. The sticking point this year came down to a disagreement between the two factions over whether ultra-Orthodox Jews, known as the Haredim, should have to serve in Israel’s military. Since Israel’s formation in 1948, ultra-Orthodox men who are religious students have been exempt from being drafted into the armed forces and other forms of national service that are otherwise mandatory for Israelis. Historically, the law enabled a few hundred scholars to devote their lives to studying religious texts without interruption. But today the ultra-Orthodox constitute about 10% of Israel’s total population and male non-participation in the country’s economy and military is a source of resentment among many Israelis. It’s a problem that’s only likely to intensify: because of high birth rates, as many as one third of Israelis could be ultra-Orthodox by 2065, according to Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics. While the role of the Haredim has long been a point of contention in Israeli society, nationalist and religious parties have typically put it to one side at election time in order to form an uneasy right wing alliance. That did not happen this year largely because Avigdor Lieberman, chairman of the hardline nationalist Yisrael Beytenu (Israel Our Home party), made his support for Netanyahu contingent on the passage of a bill to end the ultra-Orthodox exemption from national service. The unamended bill’s passage would be a deal breaker for the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party, whose support Netanyahu also needed. While Lieberman, who previously served as Netanyahu’s defense minister for two and a half years, may sincerely oppose exemptions from military service, it is also likely that the savvy politician “senses an opportunity to bring down Netanyahu,” says Yossi Mekelberg, an Israel expert at London think tank Chatham House. Even if Netanyahu were to win again, the new election’s timing — only two weeks before Netanyahu is scheduled to sit for pre-indictment hearings on a series of corruption charges — makes it near impossible for him to pass controversial legislation that would protect him from criminal prosecution.",Israel Will Hold an Election for Prime Minister in September — Even Though Netanyahu Just Won the Vote.

877,Michael Zennie,"After the crackdown on student protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, many Chinese students studying in the U.S. were fearful of returning home as authorities continued to arrest supporters of the uprising.  Jian Tang, a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, described to the New York Times in January 1990 what he believed his fate would be if he was forced to go back to China: “A labor camp, perhaps. Or imprisonment. Or execution.” At least one, protest leader Shen Tong, was arrested and spent two months in prison after moving back to Beijing from Boston University.  Arfat Erkin, a Chinese student who came to the U.S. to study economics in 2015, has a similar response today when asked what would happen to him if he went back home. “If I’m lucky, I will be sentenced to prison or sent to the camp –– if I’m lucky. If I’m not lucky, I think I will just disappear without any information,” he tells TIME.  Erkin, 22, is Uighur –– a long-oppressed predominantly Muslim ethnic minority from the western Chinese province of Xinjiang. The Chinese government has been accused of detaining between 800,000 and 2 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities as part of a sweeping system of suppression across Xinjiang since 2017. Detained Uighurs are held in “re-education camps” that Vice President Mike Pence called a “deliberate attempt by Beijing to strangle Uyghur culture and stamp out the Muslim faith.” He knows the danger he faces if he returns to China. Erkin’s father, a prominent TV producer and journalist was arrested and sentenced to several years in prison. His mother, a mathematics teacher, was swept into one of the Chinese government’s camps for Uighurs, which officials have described as “boarding schools.” He hasn’t heard from either in two years.  In response to the Chinese Communist Party’s bloody suppression at Tiananmen on June 4 and 5, 1989, Congress and the George H.W. Bush Administration acted to protect Chinese students who were in the U.S. at the time. An executive order and the subsequent Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 allowed students who were in the country in the months after Tiananmen to stay. Some 41,000 Chinese nationals became permanent U.S. residents within a year of the order; a total of about 54,000 were granted residency over 18 years. Now, three decades later, activists say it’s time for Congress and the Trump Administration to enact similar measures to protect Uighurs. Many Uighur students are now pursuing their studies in the U.S. knowing their families back home have been detained, says Nury Turkel, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who is chairman and founder of the Uyghur Human Rights Project and one of the leading Uighur voices in the U.S. (Uyghur is an alternative spelling of the name.) The need to protect Uighurs in the U.S. –– and everywhere else –– is clear, says Sophie Richardson, the China Director for Human Rights Watch. Earlier this year, the watchdog group called the Chinese government’s threat to human rights “the worst since the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement of 1989.” The suppression of Uighurs in Xinjiang factors heavily into Human Rights Watch’s concerns about China.","After Tiananmen, the U.S. Protected Chinese Students in America. 30 Years Later, Uighurs Say It’s Time to Do the Same for Them","May 31, 2019"
878,Bloomberg,"It’s effectively a tax on partying: Just in time for summer in the U.S., the cost of chilling out with some guacamole and a margarita is about to go up for consumers. President Donald Trump on May 30 issued a new threat to slap tariffs of as much as 25% on goods from Mexico, an escalation in his trade war that would raise the prices Americans pay for avocados and tequila. Autos are by far the largest category of Mexican-made products sold in the U.S., and top manufacturers from Audi AG to Volkswagen AG produce vehicles in the country. Oil refineries in Louisiana and Texas, as well as builders reliant on imported steel, could be hit. At the same time, Mexico also is a big supplier of fruit and drinks, and Trump’s latest volley may, therefore, mean less joy in Margaritaville this summer. Americans should be prepared to pay more for guacamole, avocado toast and many other items at restaurant chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. or Panera Bread Co. The fruit is on almost half of U.S. menus, according to Chicago-based researcher Datassential, and Mexican imports accounted for more than three-quarters of the U.S. avocado market last year, according to the Hass Avocado Board. Prices spiked last month as Trump was threatening to close the border. Mexico is a favorite location for some of the world’s top makers of TVs. Samsung Electronics Co. makes about 9 million sets a year from Mexican factories and LG Electronics Inc. makes about 4 million, according to Eric Chiou, a Taipei-based analyst with WitsView. Higher tariffs will hit these companies, which rely on North American sales for about one-quarter of their TV revenues. Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group, which produces about 2 million Sony-branded TVs in the country, has facilities in Baja California and Chihuahua. New tariffs could slam companies like Constellation Brands Inc. The Victor, New York-based seller of wines and other alcoholic beverages distributes Mexican-made Corona and Modelo brands and had 5.3% of the North American beer market in 2018, according to data from the National Beer Wholesalers Association. Modelo Especial is the No. 1 imported beer in the U.S., Constellation boasted in a recent press release announcing a partnership with a Chicago-based nonprofit.","Ready for More Expensive Guac, Beer and Cars?

879,Amy Gunia,"A cargo ship loaded with 69 containers of garbage left the Philippines Friday for Vancouver, Canada amid an escalating diplomat row over international trash exports, Reuters reports. The refuse return follows Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte’s campaign to get Ottawa to agree take back its waste, and makes good on threats he issued last week to return the rubbish and dump it in Canadian waters if the country refused. Canada missed a May 15 deadline to take back truckloads of garbage it sent to the Philippines from 2013 to 2014. The junk, which includes household garbage like plastic bags, bottles, diapers and newspapers, was mislabelled plastic for recycling. In 2016, a court in the Philippines declared the import of 2,400 tonnes of waste from Canada illegal, according to Reuters. Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin posted a picture of the departing trash ship with a message reading “Baaaaaaaaa bye” on Twitter. Mark Johnson, spokesperson for Canada’s environment and climate change ministry, said, “The government of Canada is taking all the necessary measures to ensure safe and environmentally sound transport, handling and disposal of the waste in Canada.” Earlier this month, the Philippines called for its ambassadors and consuls in Canada to return home over the trash dispute. Duterte’s spokesperson, Salvador Panelo, said he hopes the diplomatic relationship will normalize, according to Reuters.

880,Charlie Campbell / Shanghai,"It may sound strange now, but when Liu Heung Shing went to China to cover the Tiananmen Square protests, he did it so he could have a rest. In 1989, he was a photographer for the Associated Press stationed in Seoul, where his daily grind was photographing South Korea’s own pro-democracy student demonstrators, whose running battles with the police were then far more vicious than in neighboring China. Liu spent his time dodging hurled paving stones and tear gas canisters, peering down his lens through prescription goggles, clothes saturated with noxious fumes. “I’d walk into the office and everyone would start coughing and sneezing,” he tells TIME with a grin in his Shanghai apartment. And so Liu didn’t mind his reassignment to the Chinese capital, where many international journalists had already left, thinking the peaceful demonstrations demanding political reform were winding down after more than two months. Liu wandered the docile protest sites, capturing students cooking noodles, writing poetry and dancing to pass the time. It was only when a faux Statue of Liberty dubbed the “Goddess of Democracy” was erected in the square, staring down Mao Zedong’s portrait hanging over the adjacent Forbidden City, that he knew a tipping point had been reached. “I told my colleagues, ‘If you understand anything about China, the Communists will never allow this,’” he says. The paving stones and tear gas that Liu left behind in Seoul were replaced by bullets and tanks in the bloody crackdown that followed — the 30th anniversary of which falls on June 4. Estimates for the number killed range from a few hundred to several thousand.

Kim Hyok Chol, who led working-level negotiations for the February summit in Hanoi, was executed by firing squad after being charged with espionage for allegedly being co-opted by the U.S., the newspaper said, citing an unidentified source. The move was part of an internal purge Kim undertook after the summit broke down without any deal, it said. Previous reports in South Korea media about senior North Korean officials being executed have proven false. Speculation has swirled for months about the fate of Kim Hyok Chol, who hasn’t received any mentions in state media reports. Talks between the U.S. and North Korea have stalled since the Vietnam summit, with no plans for them to get underway. Stephen Biegun, the Trump administration’s nuclear envoy to North Korea and Kim Hyok Chol’s counterpart, plans to meet with Japanese and South Korean negotiators this weekend in Singapore. The February summit in Hanoi abruptly collapsed, with Trump calling off the talks. Analysts said Kim may have overplayed his hand by seeking too much sanctions relief and offering too few nuclear disarmament steps in return. A career diplomat known for his expertise in nuclear deterrence against the U.S., Kim Hyok Chol’s appointment earlier this year as Biegun’s counterpart surprised North Korea watchers. One South Korean TV outlet drew a circle around him in a video from a White House meeting between Trump and North Korean officials, asking who he was.

She sent a tweet that said, “You too, can share and give the name and details of any sexual harassment you have experienced in the workplace,” with #balancetonporc (squeal on your pig). A few hours later, she posted another tweet about how Brion had humiliated her and quoted his alleged crude comments about her body. In December 2017, Brion wrote a column in the Le Monde newspaper admitted making “inappropriate remarks” to Muller at a cocktail party, “but only once.” Weeks later, Brion decided to launch legal action against her. He is now seeking $55,000 in damages, $17,000 in legal fees and demands that Muller delete the tweet mentioning his name. At Wednesday’s hearing, lawyers said that he had “never admitted to harassing anyone,” but he did apologize for his clumsy or inappropriate flirtation, the BBC reported. Brion’s lawyer Marie Burguburu told the court, “He said that one evening he tried to flirt with Sandra Muller as he liked her […] This is his right to flirt,” she said.

883,Katie Reilly,"Gucci weighed into the abortion debate at its 2020 fashion show in Rome on Tuesday, unveiling several pieces that made reference to abortion rights and women’s rights. The fashion statement comes amid a battle over abortion rights in the United States. Earlier this month, Alabama passed the strictest abortion ban in the country with the goal of overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that effectively legalized abortion across the country. The last abortion provider in Missouri may lose its license this week, making it impossible for women to obtain a safe abortion in the state. Missouri is one of a handful of states that have recently passed abortion bans as early as six weeks, though many of those laws remain tied up in legal challenges. Anti-abortion sentiments also remain strong inside the Vatican, not far from the site of the Gucci fashion show. At an anti-abortion conference in Rome on Saturday, Pope Francis compared abortion to hiring a “hitman to solve a problem” and said the procedure is never acceptable. Gucci has recently faced accusations of racism and cultural appropriation. In February, Gucci withdrew a black balaclava sweater from stores following criticism that the black turtleneck and bright red cut-out lips resembled racist blackface imagery. Earlier this month, Gucci drew backlash over cultural appropriation for selling an $800 turban and positioning an article of faith as a fashion accessory. The new collection featured in Tuesday’s show included a gown with an embroidered uterus, a jacket with the feminist slogan “My body, my choice,” and a shirt with the date in 1978 when Italy legalized abortion. Alessandro Michele, Gucci’s creative director, said at a press conference after the show that women “should be free to choose what they want and terminate a pregnancy,” calling it “the most difficult choice for a woman to make,” according to the Guardian. In another interview, Michele said the collection draws inspiration from social movements of the 1970s. “It was a historical moment when women — finally — rejected all the constraints that were imposed in the previous centuries and they became free,” Michele told Women’s Wear Daily. “That’s why I am paying homage to the Italian law regarding abortion, the law number 194. It’s unbelievable that around the world there are still people who believe that they can control a woman’s body, a woman’s choice. I will always stand behind the freedom of being, always.”",Gucci Collection Promotes Abortion Rights Amid Wave of Abortion Restrictions in U.S.,"May 29, 2019"
884,Joseph Hincks,"In August 2014, weeks after rigged elections returned Syrian President Bashar Assad a mandate to continue holding the office he had inherited from his father, Syrian border officials denied American-Lebanese journalist Sam Dagher re-entry into the country. A senior Wall Street Journal correspondent and the last Western reporter permanently based in Damascus, Dagher had reported on how Assad’s decisions directly contributed to the rise of ISIS, and how the regime starved rebel-held suburbs after it had attacked them with chemical weapons. But it was his coverage of the June elections that constituted “the point of no return,” he says, “I was reporting on the spectacle, not only saying it was a sham but also showing it.” Barred from re-entering Syria, Dagher later traveled to Paris where he met Manaf Tlass, a confidante of Assad and former Brigadier General in the Syrian Republican Guard until his high profile defection in 2012. Manaf’s father, the late Mustafa Tlass had been a pillar of the Ba’ath party establishment, unwaveringly loyal to Basher’s father, Hafez Assad, and served as his defense minister for 30-years.  Dagher’s meetings with Manaf Tlass sowed the seeds for his book Assad or We Burn the Country, published May 28. In a conversation with TIME he discussed how the regime burnished Bashar’s image after Hafez handed him power in 2000 and how alongside his wife Asma — subject of a fawning Vogue profile published in 2011 — the British-educated ophthalmologist attempted to cast himself as a reformist. But in copying his father’s methods of crushing dissent, he caused a war that has killed more than 500,000 people. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. I felt like there wasn’t a sufficient understanding of this family’s role in the Syria story. People got into the Syria story through the Arab Spring and the revolt but it was a very simplistic narrative: it happened in Tunisia, it happened in Egypt, now the Syrians are rising up and when the regime refused to go so it became a civil war. Then attention shifted to ISIS and the refugee issue. What was missing was a deeper understanding of why Syrians rose up in the first place, how this family ruled over them for 50 years, and the role of its allies, particularly Iran. I felt there was a need to step back and look at the whole picture if we wanted to address the problems emanating from Syria. Western countries relationships with Syria have largely been driven by whatever interests they had in the region at any given moment. During the Cold War, the U.S. agenda was how do we get Hafez Assad on our side? When the civil war started in Lebanon, the Americans wanted him to protect the Christians. And in the early 1990s, the American agenda was to amass this coalition to go after Saddam. Bashar was cooperating with the U.S on intelligence sharing before the invasion of Iraq, after 9/11. But when he realized they might be going after him he calculated that he had better start a pre-emptive war in Iraq to protect the regime. American calculations changed again because they needed to save face in Iraq, so there was a re-engagement period between 2007 and 2010. The Assad regime knows how the West deals with this part of the world and it can wait because it figures it’s not going anywhere. I’m not advocating military intervention to topple the regime. I’m just saying that all these countries have to take history into account when they decide to engage with Syria. He’s trying hard but it’s going to be difficult. The regime understands there’s only so far it can go with rehabilitating Bashar’s image, even domestically. What they’re doing instead is relying on their old trick: brute, naked fear. I’ve heard from a number of Syrians that the regime’s message to them is “we’re on top of you again.” They’ve re-instated a lot of the statues of Hafez, the Mukhabarat [secret police] is telling people we’re back, you’d better watch what you say. In terms of the West, some countries have re-engaged with the regime but it’s mainly intelligence sharing at this point. I don’t see Bashar and Asma being able to pull off a rehabilitation of their image. People are making pragmatic choices but I don’t think that tells the whole story. You have to remember that half of the population is either internally displaced or abroad and most of these people do not support Assad. Inside Syria, the Alawites [ a minority sect to which Assad belongs, whose faith derives from a strain of Shi’a Islam] sacrificed the most for this regime in terms of providing the fighting forces to defend it and they openly support Assad. But for many, they were not defending Assad, they were defending themselves against an existential threat. The same applies to other minorities: many Christians and Druze [a religious minority] sympathized with the protesters and took part in at least the peaceful period of the protests before they realized, yes, the regime may be awful but look at the other side. Even the Sunnis came to that conclusion—but it was more like resignation than support. A lot of urban Sunnis are now questioning the benefits of Assad’s victory and starting to have second thoughts.","'Brute, Naked Fear.'

885,Hillary Leung,"Teenage protester Will Connolly, dubbed “egg boy” after video of him smashing an egg on the head of an Australian senator went viral, announced Tuesday that he was donating the $70,000 raised for his legal expenses to victims of the New Zealand mosque attacks. A day after the Christchurch massacre that killed 51 people in March, Connolly smashed an egg on the back of Senator Fraser Anning’s head while the politician was talking to reporters. Anning then slapped the teen as his supporters tackled him to the ground. The right-wing senator had earlier remarked that “The real cause of the bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.” The  comment sparked a furore in Australia. The 17-year-old said he was not connected with any activist group. He was interviewed and released by police without charge. Following the incident, two GoFundMe pages were set up to help Connolly cover his legal expenses and “buy more eggs.” In a post on Instagram, the 17-year-old said the money raised, after a “huge amount of red tape,” had today been donated to charity. Connolly said he had no legal fees as a lawyer acted pro-bono for his case. The $70,000 raised — close to 100,000 Australian dollars — was donated to the Christchurch Foundation and Victims Support, he wrote. “It wasn’t mine to keep,” Connolly added. “To the victims of the tragedy, I wholeheartedly hope that this can bring some relief to you.”","Australia's 'Egg Boy,' Who Assaulted a Senator, Is Giving Legal Defense Funds to Mosque Shooting Victims","May 29, 2019"
886,Hillary Leung,"Australian navy helicopter pilots were reportedly hit with laser beams from fishing boats during a recent military exercise on the South China Sea, leading experts to believe they were being monitored by Chinese maritime militia on the disputed waters. The pilots were “followed at a discreet distance by a Chinese warship,” according to Euan Graham, an academic with Australia’s La Trobe University. Graham, who was invited aboard the Royal Australian Navy flagship HMAS Canberra during a voyage from Vietnam to Singapore, referred to the episode as “coordinated harassment.” “[This was] despite the fact that our route didn’t take us near any feature occupied by Chinese forces or any obviously sensitive areas,” Graham wrote in a blog post for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s Strategist. While interactions between the Royal Australian Navy and People’s Liberation Army Navy were cordial, Graham said the Australian pilots were told to notify the Chinese in advance of any amendments to their course. The U.S. has observed a rise in Chinese military activity in the South China Sea, a disputed body of water that China lays large claims to but is also partially claimed by several other countries including Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia. Last year, a U.S. military official said 20 incidents of lasers hitting U.S. aircrafts in the Pacific were recorded.

887,Hillary Leung,"More than 50,000 teachers across New Zealand took to the streets on strike Wednesday to demand pay rises and better working conditions following fruitless negotiations with the government, the Guardian reports. The “mega-strike” is the largest education walkout the country has seen, joined by both elementary and high school teachers across major cities including Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. More than 700,000 children were affected as schools closed for the day. Lynda Stuart, the president of teachers’ union NZEI Te Riu Roa, said teachers wanted issues such as large class sizes, lack of funding for special needs students and pastoral care obligations to be addressed. “Our children cannot wait and neither can our teachers,” Stuart said. The government had previously offered teachers pay rises of 3%, which Education Minister Chris Hipkins said is “it” and that the the country is not able to increase their salaries by any more than that. But the unions say that is not enough, demanding at least 15% or more, according to the Guardian. “Teachers are overwhelmed and we don’t have time to teach,” Khali Oliveira, a primary teacher at Gladstone primary in Auckland, told the Guardian. “We want the government to invest in the future of teachers and the country’s children – we’re sick of Band-Aid solutions.” A lack of teaching staff has also led to the government recruiting teachers from Australia and the U.K., but even so, schools have been forced to request retired teachers to come back and principals forced to take over classrooms to make up for the shortfall. The strike comes a day before Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s government’s plans to unveil the nation’s first “wellbeing” budget, which aims to allocate funding towards tackling inequality, mental health and other social issues.",New Zealand Teachers Have Gone on a 'Mega-Strike' for Higher Pay,"May 29, 2019"
888,Michael Zennie,"For the last day of President Donald Trump’s highly stage-managed state visit to Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took him to tour the Japanese warship JS Kaga.  The Kaga, along with sister ship the Izumo, is the biggest warship that Japan’s navy, The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, has built since the end of the Second World War. And last December, Abe’s government announced plans to convert the Kaga and the Izumo to launch American-made F-35B stealth fighter jets. The conversion would effectively give the vessels many of the same capabilities as aircraft carriers––also a first for post-war Japan.  Aboard the Kaga, Trump praised the decision, along with the announcement that Japan plans to purchase 105 American-made F-35 fighters. “And soon, this very ship will be upgraded to carry that cutting-edge aircraft. With this extraordinary new equipment, the JS Kaga will help our nations defend against a range of complex threats in the region and far beyond,” Trump said Tuesday aboard the ship.  That may be overstating Japan’s military ambitions. Japan’s constitution forbids the use of offensive weapons, which aircraft carriers have long been considered.  Still, all of the signals from Japan’s military are that it has no intention of using the Kaga or the Izumo like traditional aircraft carriers, says Jeffrey W. Hornung, a political scientist with the RAND Corporation who specializes in Japanese security and foreign policy.  “Given its history, it’s significant that Japan has come this far and they have the capability now that looks like an aircraft carrier … once it’s reconfigured,” he says. “But, then again, they’re not [aircraft carriers]. They don’t have any of the infrastructure for it to be deployed as such. They don’t have the strike capability. They don’t have any sort of intention to go further then what it is right now.” Abe has been working for many years to strengthen Japan’s military and expand its ability to use force, including a push to amend the constitution to formally recognize the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. However, it’s delicate business in Japan, where the constitution is explicitly pacifist following the country’s surrender in World War II. In Japan’s military heyday, aircraft carriers were some of its most potent military weapons––and were used to launch the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, which drew the United States into that war.",President Trump Visited Japan's Biggest Warship Since World World II.

889,Suyin Haynes,"The World Health Organization (WHO) will no longer categorize being transgender as a “mental disorder”, after a major resolution to amend its health guidelines was approved May 25. The United Nations’ health agency approved a resolution to remove “gender identity disorder” from its global manual of diagnoses, in a move that will have a “liberating effect on transgender people worldwide,” says Human Rights Watch. According to the newly-revised version of the International Classification of Diseases (known as ICD-11), published by the WHO, “gender identity disorders” have been reframed as “gender incongruence.” Gender nonconformity is now included in a chapter on sexual health, rather than being listed with “mental disorders” as was the case previously. Activists are now hoping that the ICD-11 will be implemented by the WHO’s 194 member states over the next three years. In several countries around the world, the process of medically transitioning gender is based on the now-outdated ICD framework, which classifies being transgender as a “gender identity disorder” under the category of “mental disorders.” In Japan for example, the law requires those seeking to transition gender to have a diagnosis of “gender identity disorder” and to be sterilized before their new gender identity can be reflected on official documentation. U.N. member states, of which Japan is one, are now responsible for putting ICD-11 into practice at a national level, a lengthy process that has been given a target deadline of January 1, 2022. “When you have a system that sets up someone’s very existence and identity in a diagnosis as a mental health condition, that feeds an enormous amount of stigma and drives people away,” Kyle Knight, researcher in the LGBT rights program at Human Rights Watch, tells TIME. “We have interviewed transgender people in Japan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Indonesia to name a few countries, and they don’t even want to begin to undergo the process of legal recognition because it requires them to go see a psychiatrist who will tell them they have a so-called mental disorder; something that they don’t feel corresponds with their own reality. People don’t feel like their gender identity is something diagnosable or needs a diagnosis.”  While ICD-11 is being celebrated by many as a step in the right direction, activists are keen to highlight that there is still work to be done. GATE, an organization advocating on issues of gender identity, gender expression and bodily diversity, will be focusing their efforts on contributing to the WHO’s forthcoming reviewing and updating process and encouraging people to put pressure on their own governments to adopt ICD-11 in the coming years. “There’s a sense of happiness, but at the same time, while we are seeing these advances, there are countries where trans people find it more and more difficult to get access to basic healthcare, like the U.S.,” says Argentinean intersex and trans rights activist Mauro Cabral, GATE‘s executive director. As recently as May 24, a new rule issued by the Trump administration proposed the roll back of sex discrimination protection for transgender people in health services, a move that U.S. LGBT rights groups have cautioned could result in a denial of needed medical care.  Cabral tells TIME that among his own activist network, the WHO’s resolution is viewed as a much-needed improvement, but is seen as an imperfect stepping stone to ensuring beneficial outcomes such as trans-related healthcare being included in universal healthcare coverage worldwide.  The use of ‘gender incongruence’ is also seen as an expression of international solidarity with people in parts of the world whose health systems might otherwise exclude them if different language was used. “I personally don’t consider myself, and I don’t know anyone that considers themselves to be a person with ‘gender incongruence,'” Cabral tells TIME. “In that sense, we are accepting this as a way of people in different countries getting access to the healthcare that they need.”",The World Health Organization Will Stop Classifying Transgender People as Having a 'Mental Disorder',"May 28, 2019"
890,Vivienne Walt / Paris,"A giddy sense of triumph has taken hold among Europe’s strident right-wing nationalists since Sunday night, after they won the European Union’s parliamentary elections in the U.K., France and Italy—three powerhouse economies—potentially setting the stage for a shakeout on parts of the Continent. But despite the individual victories, the populist and nationalists parties remain splintered across several political groupings in the E.U’s legislative body and are more likely to continue battling against the establishment than replacing it completely. “The people took back the power tonight,” France’s Marine Le Pen thundered late Sunday, after her National Rally, or RN, party narrowly beat President Emmanuel Macron’s group in France’s biggest E.U. election turnout in decades. The elections, held every five years across 28 countries for 751 delegates to the European Parliament in Brussels, are crucial in shaping policy on bitterly divisive issues like migration, trade, and public spending. The impact of the results reverberated within their individual nations. In Italy, the League Party led by Interior Minister Matteo Salvini took 34% of the vote, far exceeding expectations and confirming its status as the most powerful political movement in the country. And after the new hardline Brexit Party came first in the E.U. elections in the U.K. on Sunday night, its leader Nigel Farage insisted he had earned the right to participate alongside the government in Brexit negotiations with the E.U. In France, the results marked a powerful symbolic reversal of the 2017 presidential election that delivered power to Macron. About 200,000 more French voters opted for Le Pen’s fervently anti-immigrant message than Macron’s liberal, business-friendly policies. Yet for all the celebrations among far-right leaders on Sunday, the victory will not herald the populist takeover of the European Union that some had predicted. In fact, when the new European Parliament convenes in Brussels on July 2, the nationalists and populists could struggle to push through their election promises, or to halt decisions against which they campaigned. For one thing, the nationalist parties remain deeply divided; The Fidesz party of Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, for example, which won a huge 52% vote on Sunday, sits in a different political bloc in Brussels than Le Pen and Salvini; other nationalist leaders are split over issues like Russian sanctions, the environment, and migrant quotas.",Europe's Populist Storm Rattles the Windows of the E.U.

891,Charlotte McDonald-Gibson / The Hague,"Green Party politicians struggle to pinpoint the exact moment when it became clear they were making history in the European Union’s parliament elections. Hopes stirred when Irish exit polls showed the country had elected its first two Green representatives. Next the Greens came in a shock second place to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party in Germany. Then around midnight on the main election day of May 26, the count confirmed that even Portugal—which, like much of southern Europe, has been a longtime wasteland for environmentally-focused parties—had elected Francisco Guerreiro of the People-Animals-Nature (PAN) party. “It was a big surprise because we had been disregarded by the traditional media,” says Guerreiro, who seems a little shell-shocked at the prospect of travelling back and forth to Brussels as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). But he is excited about the future, he tells TIME in a phone interview. “We have to be confident and know that we are leading a new way of making policy and politics, and each day we see the support of society grow.” The challenge for Guerreiro and his Green colleagues is translating these record successes into concrete policies that benefit the environment, at a time when the European political landscape is more fractured and polarized than ever. “The Green issue has grown up”, says Susi Dennison, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a pro-E.U. think tank. “Now it needs to become a core part of the agenda and I expect to see national governments responding to that.” The European Green Party — the federation of national parties that focus on environmental policies — surpassed all expectations in the Europe-wide vote. Buoyed by protest movements, increasingly stark reports from climate scientists, and galvanizing figures like Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, the party won at least 69 seats in the European Parliament, up from their current 50 seats. They will be the fourth largest group in the 751-seat body, which works with the European Union’s executive arm to propose and approve laws for the bloc. Across much of northern Europe they made record gains, coming close to doubling their share of the vote in France, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Finland. It was not just their environmental policies which captured the public’s attention, the group’s leaders say, but a focus on social justice and fairness, and a desire among the E.U. electorate to shake up the traditional parties and vote for people promising change. “Everyone was talking about the rise of the far right and was very concerned about that and were looking for a force of courage and positive change,” says Ska Keller, a German Green MEP who is the group’s co-leader in the European Parliament. “And we have been able to provide a positive vision of the future of Europe.” For the first time, the big center-left and center-right groups – which traditionally worked together to dominate European policy-making – have lost their majority. So the first task for the European Greens is to work out their alliances in this uncharted parliamentary landscape, and figure out how to leverage their newfound influence.",Europe's Greens Hope E.U.

According to a report released Monday, there were 192 attacks on schools in 2018, up from 68 in 2017. UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore called the attacks senseless, adding that “education is under fire” in Afghanistan. “The killing, injury and abduction of teachers, and the threats against education, are destroying the hopes and dreams of an entire generation of children,” Fore said. The number of attacks was previously seeing a decline up till 2015. The 2018 parliamentary elections, which led to the closure of schools to be used as voter registration and polling centers, was one factor that caused the spike in violent incidents, the report said. According to the report, close to half of all school-aged children in Afghanistan between the ages of 7 and 17, totaling an estimated 3.7 million, do not attend formal schools. Girls account for about 60% of the children not attending school; Human Rights Watch cites discriminatory attitudes towards girls, child marriage and administrative barriers as among the reasons for the disparity.

The incident prompted the Aeromexico flight to make an emergency landing in the northern Mexico state of Sonora after flight attendants noticed that he was having seizures. Paramedics then boarded the plane and declared the man dead. Prosecutors said the cause of his death was cerebral edema — a swelling of the brain — caused by the drug overdose.

The plane, which had 198 other passengers on board, resumed its flight to Tokyo’s Narita International Airport after the body was removed. Swallowing drugs, despite its hazards, is one way smugglers use to transport narcotics due to the ability to bypass security systems and screening processes.

895,Hillary Leung,"The Republic of Ireland has voted to relax restrictions on divorce laws by an overwhelming majority, in the latest move to liberalize a constitution heavily influenced by the Roman Catholic Church. A referendum held Friday saw 82.1% of voters supporting the change, which removes a clause requiring couples to have been separated for four of the previous five years in order to get a divorce, the BBC reports. A new timeframe will be decided on by the Oireachtas, or the Irish parliament. The government has previously expressed the view that a two-year separation is enough, according to the BBC. The country’s Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan, tweeted Saturday that the results represent “very positive news” and that he will move quickly with the legislation to “reduce upset and trauma on couples and children” trapped in failed marriages. The Deputy Leader of the Irish Senate, Cahterine Noone, also tweeted her reactions to the results. While Ireland’s main political parties are in favor of easing regulations that would make filing for a divorce easier, Catholic pressure groups have maintained their opposition, stating that separation causes disruption to children’s lives and that the government should instead invest resources into “what makes marriages work.” Divorce was legalized relatively recently in the predominantly Catholic country — in 1995 — after a vote passed by a margin of less than one percent. But the country is seeing signs of moving towards more liberal policies; last year, a ban on abortion was repealed by a landslide, and in 2015, Ireland became the first country in the world to approve same-sex marriage through popular vote.",Ireland Has Voted Overwhelmingly to Ease Its Divorce Laws,"May 27, 2019"

Fisher wrote in his last post on Instagram that he was delaying his summit to May 25, intending to avoid the crowd of climbers who were planning their routes for an earlier date. “With a single route to the summit, delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal,” Fisher said. “I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people.” He added, “Unless of course, everyone else plays the same waiting game.” On Facebook, Fisher’s partner Kristyn Carriere wrote that scaling Everest was his “ultimate challenge” and that she is heartbroken.

899,Alyssa Ayres,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a historic second five-year term — with a single-party majority — for the Bharatiya Janata Party this week. He campaigned in 2014 promising economic growth and job creation, and prioritized business-friendly outreach to lure investment and manufacturing to India. The continuity of a second Modi term, then, suggests to some that a bold economic reform agenda may be what comes next. But equally possible, based on the recent track record, might be stepped-up development projects in lieu of tough reforms, and a more nationalist approach to economic matters. In an atmosphere where trade differences between New Delhi and Washington have slowly escalated, the latter prospect would suggest even rougher economic roads ahead. Due to his pro-business orientation and road-show pitches for investment, Modi has gained a reputation among U.S. industry as someone with a reformist mindset. In his first three years of office, he raised foreign direct investment caps in a wide range of sectors, reduced petroleum subsidies, cut red tape, got a bankruptcy law passed and a constitutional amendment to unify India’s states into a common market. These are all significant steps. But tougher reforms that could boost the Indian economy—for example, reforms to India’s onerous land acquisition and labor laws that could unleash manufacturing—have languished after early-term efforts failed to secure lasting support. It’s precisely these politically difficult reforms that could make a difference to the Indian economy now. The Indian economy is not hitting the growth rates needed to create jobs for its large, youthful and growing workforce. Unemployment is at a 45-year high. In recent years, the Modi government has shifted away from politically contentious further reforms, and emphasized development projects (toilet-building, housing, infrastructure) and welfare programs, such as the world’s largest health insurance scheme. Such projects are important for Indian quality of life, but do not address more macro-level policy reform questions. In addition, although the Indian economy has incrementally become more open since the onset of economic reforms in 1991, the Modi government moved backwards on trade in the past two years by raising tariffs on some goods. And debates about data localization and new regulation in the fast-growing e-commerce space suggest the prospect of a more economically nationalist approach to the important digital economy. Meanwhile, the U.S.-India economic dialogue, for decades fraught at the best of times, is in a tough place. The longstanding list of trade complaints—many of them U.S. complaints about India’s market—contains a mind-numbing array of issues. Some are familiar, like intellectual property rights and concerns over patents, tariffs and foreign direct investment caps. But some are arcane, like price caps on medical stents, or certifying that dairy products came from cows that never ate animal feed containing “tissues of ruminant origin”––i.e. beef. None are easy to solve, and so they have languished on the agenda while trade negotiators attempt resolution. Exacerbating the tough atmosphere in the trade and economic arena, President Donald Trump’s approach to trade adds new issues to the many unresolved problems. Trump wants to cut trade deficits, so a new complaint from Washington concerns the bilateral trade deficit with India—for 2018 around $22 billion, down 7% from 2017. In an unrelated global review, the Trump Administration concluded that steel and aluminum imports presented a national security threat to the United States, and imposed 25% and 10% duties, respectively. This step turns out to have affected steel and aluminum imported from India. In response, India drew up a list of goods for reciprocal tariffs, although New Delhi has held off applying the higher tariffs given ongoing trade negotiations.",India's Economy Needs Tougher Reform.

The incidents, he said, included an assault on four tankers in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz, armed drone attacks against Saudi oil facilities and a rocket attack in Iraq’s Green Zone, where the U.S. embassy is located. Each incident was directed by “the leadership of Iran at the highest level,” Gilday said, adding: “Even more troubling, we’ve had multiple credible reports that Iranian proxy groups intend to attack U.S. personnel in the Middle East.” Gilday did not, however, provide any proof linking Iran to the attacks or produce evidence of the threats. Nor did he explain how any of the behavior is different from what Iran and its proxies have been doing for years throughout the Middle East. “I’m not reverse-engineering this,” he said. “The Iranians have said publicly they were going to do things. We learned more through intelligence reporting they have acted upon those threats and they’ve actually attacked.” When pressed about the evidence that led to additional manpower and equipment being sent to the region, Gilday replied that the intelligence was too sensitive to disclose. “I can’t reveal the sources of that reporting except to say, with very high confidence, we tie the Iranians to those,” he said. According to two intelligence officials and one military officer with inside knowledge of the intelligence, the answers to questions about whether Iran is mounting an offensive remain unclear.",Why Is Trump Sending More Troops and Firepower to the Middle East?

902,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened: Last week, the US government placed China’s state-champion Huawei on the Commerce Department’s Entity List, banning the tech company from buying critical parts it needs from US producers. For all the focus on the current trade war between the US and China, it’s this brewing tech war that has the potential to reshape the world order. And it’s starting to with this Huawei development. Why It Matters: This is a fight over who will build and lead innovation for the next generation of internet and telecommunications technology, which is called 5G. 1G was the tech that enabled us to make wireless phone calls; 2G brought texting capabilities; 3G delivered web browsing to the phone-wielding masses; 4G made wireless video-streaming a reality, and through its constant connection to GPS satellites enabled the rise of companies like Uber. We are currently living in a 4G world, but the transition to 5G is just getting started and will accelerate over the next couple of years. 5G, however, will be different than previous mobile upgrades; for one thing, data will move about 100 times faster. But it will also handle far more data, with far lower lag times, than ever before. It is really about machine-to-machine communications. Think billions of connected gadgets—commonly referred to as “the internet of things,” which means everything from washing machines to self-driving cars to entire “smart cities.” There’s no real reason that 5G infrastructure can’t be built with both Chinese and Western hardware, as our current 4G network currently is (not so fun fact: Huawei already provides much of the world’s network hardware, outstripping its Western counterparts Ericsson and Nokia). But the Trump administration has argued that allowing Huawei equipment into the guts of global 5G networks could allow Beijing to access the streams of data that will be passing through the company’s hardware, leaving American companies and citizens susceptible to spying. The other argument that the US administration is making is that building 5G networks with Huawei networking gear equipment could leave them vulnerable to an infrastructure attack should the US and China ever actually go to war—imagine if China responds to a volley of US missiles by bringing down the US electrical grid. Messaging aside, the decision to place Huawei on the Commerce Department’s entity list as a national security threat is a seminal moment—the US government is effectively saying that where a piece of technology hardware comes from is the deciding factor in determining it’s safe to be used in US networks or those of its allies. For a country like the US whose economic strength was built upon the globalization of supply chains and maximizing efficiencies (the iPhone is “Designed by Apple in California” but “Assembled in China”), this is a sea change. And the fact that it is trying to get other Western countries—particularly in Europe—to join them has the potential to fundamentally reshape the global marketplace and how companies do business around the world. What Happens Next: The Commerce Department this week issued a 90-day exemption to US companies to continue doing limited business with Huawei, but they’re targeted waivers meant to support continuing operations for existing customers. Huawei will struggle to operate like this even if the waivers continue to be renewed. So far, the US hasn’t seen much of a response from Beijing—while China’s political leaders are up in arms about the Huawei developments, they will likely keep quiet publicly and work with Huawei to explore ways to negotiate with the US Commerce Department a remedy to address the charges against the company. This could include a major fine in the $1 billion range and disciplining of executives, much like they did last year with China’s other state-backed tech giant ZTE.",The Quick Read About… the 5G War Is Upon Us,"May 24, 2019"
903,Billy Perrigo,"Toward the end of the speech announcing her resignation on Friday morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May diverted away from Brexit for just a moment, to talk about a man who died in 2015. That man was Nicholas Winton, who organized the safe passage of 669 children out of Nazi-occupied Europe during the Second World War, into the United Kingdom. “For many years the great humanitarian Sir Nicholas Winton — who saved the lives of hundreds of children by arranging their evacuation from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia through the Kindertransport — was my constituent,” May said in front of the black door to 10 Downing Street. She continued, “At another time of political controversy, a few years before his death, he took me to one side at a local event and gave me a piece of advice. He said, ‘Never forget that compromise is not a dirty word. Life depends on compromise.’ He was right.” But one of Winton’s ideological heirs has hit back at May over the comparison, rejecting her comparison and pointing to the effects of her policies as Home Secretary and Prime Minister when she strove to reduce migration into Britain and create a “hostile environment” for new arrivals. “I think Nicholas Winton would be a bit taken aback that she was using his name to ingratiate herself, when her behavior with regard to child refugees has been the very opposite,” Alf Dubs tells TIME. Dubs, 86, is an opposition Labour member of the House of Lords, who came over to the U.K. as a child from Czechoslovakia as a child on a train organized by Winton. “She leaves a negative legacy,” he said. “She did not support refugees coming to Britain and her policies worked pretty well to keep the numbers as low as possible.”",Theresa May Quoted a Humanitarian in Her Resignation Speech.

904,Suyin Haynes,"Hundreds of thousands of students around the world walked out of their schools and colleges Friday in the latest in a series of strikes urging action to address the climate crisis. According to event organizers Fridays for Future, over 1664 cities across 125 countries registered strike actions, with more expected to report turnouts in the coming days. The “School Strike for Climate” movement was first started by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who began her strike outside the country’s parliament in Stockholm in August 2018 and has said that she will continue to strike until Sweden is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Since then, her singular action has spread into an international climate movement, organized by young people around the world. This strike followed the last co-ordinated event on March 15, which saw over 1.6 million people across 133 countries turn out at demonstrations according to organizers. Thunberg was recently profiled on TIME’s global cover as a Next Generation Leader, along with nine other people shaping the world’s future. “This is not about truancy or civil disobedience, this is about the climate and the ecological crisis, and people need to understand that,” Thunberg told TIME in Stockholm, a couple of weeks ahead of the global strike. “May 24 is the last chance to affect the E.U. elections. Politicians are talking about the climate and environmental issues more now, but they need more pressure,” she said. Voting across the European Union takes place May 23-26, where the 751 representatives of the European Parliament will be elected by citizens across the continent. Recent polling suggests environmental issues and policies tackling climate change are high on the agenda for voters considering who to elect. The school strike movement has emerged in tandem with other environmental movements worldwide. The British-based direct action group Extinction Rebellion occupied major locations in London for ten days in late April, and their first demand, for the British government to declare a state of “climate emergency,” received approval from parliament on May 1. And in the U.S., the young activists of Sunrise Movement have pushed to transform climate action into a political reality by calling for a Green New Deal, attracting the support of several legislators and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. While Thunberg is well-known worldwide, she says it is the strike organizers in each country that she looks up to. “Young people who are in developing countries are sacrificing their education in order to protest against the destruction of their future and world,” she told TIME. “They are the real heroes.” Photos and videos from strikers in the eastern hemisphere started flooding social media in the morning, ranging from Seoul, South Korea to Auckland, New Zealand, and later in the day images of crowds surfaced in European cities such as Berlin and Paris, where organizers say an estimated 23,000 turned out to demonstrate. Here is a look at some of the places around the world where young people are taking action on May 24. Thousands of students and young people took part in Friday’s strike marching through the streets of Stockholm. When TIME travelled with Thunberg from London to her hometown in April, she and other young organizers from the Fridays for Future movement were planning and preparing the actions for May 24.","Students From 1,600 Cities Just Walked Out of School to Protest Climate Change.

905,Rana Ayyub,"When the results started trickling in on Thursday showing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP government were set for a landslide victory after a divisive and polarizing campaign, I was not shocked. As a journalist, I have covered Modi’s career since his days as the Chief Minister of Gujarat and know his strategies all too well. Yet the defining image of the Indian election results was not of Modi’s speech in Delhi; it was of Pragya Singh Thakur, dressed in saffron robes, waving at a large crowd after a massive electoral victory. Thakur, a Hindu priestess from the northern Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, is best known for being charged under a terror law for conspiring and carrying out the 2008 bomb blasts in a Muslim-majority city of Maharashtra that left 10 people dead. She swears allegiance to a radical Hindu outfit called Abhinav Bharat that aims to establish a Hindu rashtra (state) and the supremacy of Hindus not just in India but also extending to the neighboring states of Pakistan and Nepal. A week before her constituency went to vote, Thakur hailed Nathuram Godse — the man who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi — as a patriot. (In the Hindu right-wing worldview, Gandhi is often seen as a Muslim sympathizer.) It’s ironic that India will celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday in the same year the Bharatiya Janata Party and its Hindu nationalist leader will induct Thakur in the Indian parliament, seeing their victory as a mandate for their majoritarian policies. The narrative is strikingly similar to what I saw nearly a decade ago. In 2010, I went undercover for eight months to investigate the complicity of the state in the 2002 anti-Muslim riots and the extra judicial killings of Muslims who were labeled as terrorists. In a span of eight months, posing as a student from American Film Institute Conservatory, I spoke to almost every bureaucrat and official working under Modi. I learned that Modi wanted to be seen as a Hindu leader under attack from Muslims. His 12-year term in Gujarat was seen as the victory of Gujarati asmita (Gujarati pride), with crowds welcoming him at electoral rallies. The popular slogan was, “Dekho dekho kaun aaya, Gujarat ka sher aaya.” (Look, the lion of Gujarat has arrived.) That wasn’t the first time I reported on Modi. In 2007 as a reporter covering his provincial election, I sat in the front row of his debut election rally for the assembly elections in the state — his first election after the Gujarat riots. Modi sat next to his then minister of state for Home, Amit Shah, now the President of the ruling party. He held the mic on the stage and asked the crowd, mainly made up of women and upper middle class Gujarati traders: “What do you want me to do with a man like Sohrabuddin?”’ The crowd replied unequivocally and unanimously: ‘Kill him’. Mr. Modi was referring to the 2005 killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, a petty criminal labeled by his government as a terrorist. It seemed Sheikh and his wife were murdered by Gujarat police but after the case was taken to the Supreme Court, India’s central investigation agency discovered that killing had been a fake encounter, an extra judicial murder staged by the state. Instead of respecting the findings of the agency, Modi made it a clarion call about being a victim of minority appeasement by the Congress-led government in Delhi. At every campaign from then on, he told crowds that the Delhi Sultanate (Congress government ) wanted to punish his officers and ministers for shielding him from a Muslim terrorist who had entered Gujarat to attack its sovereignty. A travesty of justice became Modi’s trump card: another Muslim man was made the enemy of the state, and that summer he was re-elected Chief Minister. The result of the 2019 General election in India has been won on the tried and tested plank that Modi has mastered in the last two decades of his political career. It is a strategy that paints the immediate threat to the Indian nationalist as the “infiltrator,” “termite,” “outsider” — all oblique references to the Indian Muslim.",I've Reported on Modi for Over a Decade.

906,Billy Perrigo,"Julian Assange was indicted by the U.S. under the Espionage Act on Thursday, setting the stage for a dramatic confrontation between U.S. and Swedish prosecutors, who each want to extradite Assange before the other. Sweden had, a week earlier, re-opened a rape investigation into the Wikileaks founder and began steps to request his extradition. By indicting Assange with 18 charges under the Espionage Act, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, the U.S. has considerably raised the stakes. The only U.S. charge against Assange before Thursday was one count of conspiring to hack a password, which came with a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The new charges relate to Assange’s role in publishing classified State Department documents on WikiLeaks in 2010 and 2011. Sweden’s move to request Assange’s arrest in the U.K. on rape charges may have prompted U.S. prosecutors to “throw the kitchen sink” at Assange, Ben Keith, a U.K. barrister specializing in extradition law, tells TIME. “It may be that Sweden’s further interest in this case means the U.S. has had to up the ante,” he says. “If Assange goes to Sweden, it’s more difficult to extradite him to the U.S. from there, because prosecutors will have to get both U.K. permission and Swedish permission.” (Officials from the U.S. Department of Justice did not explain why they chose to issue the further charges under the Espionage Act on Thursday.) But the U.S. indictments could backfire, due to provisions in the extradition treaty between the U.K. and the U.S. that protect against political prosecutions. The charges have raised freedom of the press concerns among some journalists in the U.S., and Assange may choose to argue that the new indictments are of a political nature. Even if that doesn’t happen, the decision-maker in this case is the U.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid. He has come under great pressure to treat the rape allegations against Assange with more gravity than the U.S.’s national security charges. “The Home Secretary has to look at the seriousness of the offenses and which offense came first in time,” Keith says. “Even now, the Swedish offense might be more serious.”",The U.S. Just Upped the Ante on Julian Assange's Extradition With Espionage Charges,"May 24, 2019"
907,Dan Stewart,"Looking back over the 34 months Theresa May spent as Britain’s Prime Minister, it’s hard to pick a low point. Was it the Conservative Party conference in October 2017 when she couldn’t stop coughing, a protestor hijacked her big speech and the lettering behind her peeled off the wall? Was it the day President Donald Trump announced his arrival to the U.K. with a newspaper interview in which he poured scorn on her Brexit plan, just a few hours before they were due for a joint press conference? Was it the time she arrived in Brussels for a high stakes meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, only to momentarily find herself trapped inside her car while the world’s media looked on? Or was it on Tuesday, when her new compromise vision for Brexit was summarily rejected by allies and opponents alike within minutes of its release? That at least appeared to be the point at which her political demise, so long forecast and rumored, was finally carved in concrete. In truth, the nadir of May’s premiership came on the morning of June 9, 2017 when the results of the snap general election held the day before became clear. The loss of the Conservative Party’s parliamentary majority was a failure she carried special responsibility for. It was she who called an election she didn’t have to, and she who fronted her Tory party’s campaign. It was a defeat that above all sowed the seeds for her eventual downfall. It’s tempting to think May was chosen to succeed Cameron as Prime Minister as the unity candidate — the experienced cabinet minister whose past fence-sitting on Brexit meant she could unite her divided party. But May won the contest because her rivals self-immolated in a frenzy of backstabbing and electioneering. Her victory came because she was the last person standing, not necessarily the best. She began her premiership still attempting to straddle the divide in the Conservative Party, with so much caution that she won herself the nickname “Theresa Maybe.” But she soon sided with the hardliners agitating for a harder Brexit, egged on by the frenzied editors of Britain’s mass-market tabloids.",This Is the Fateful Decision That Led to Theresa May's Downfall,"May 24, 2019"

Donald Lynn Cash, 54, fainted from high altitude sickness while taking photographs at the summit, according to the company Pioneer Adventure Pvt. Ltd., which leads treks on Everest. While Sherpa guides with the company tried to keep him alive through CPR and by raising his oxygen pressure, Cash was unable to stand up or walk. As they tried to drag Cash down to a camp near Hillary Step, he fainted again and could not be revived, Pioneer Adventures said in a statement. Cash’s children, Brandalin Cash and Tanner Cash, told the New York Times they believe their father had a heart attack. In an Instagram post, Brandalin Cash wrote that she loved hearing “just how wide my [dad’s] range of influence goes,” after people reached out in support. “I know he is in Gods hands.” Cash’s death comes amid a surge of traffic at Mount Everest that has proven deadly for other climbers. More than 200 climbers attempted to scale Everest on Wednesday, according to the Himalayan Times. Several climbers complained about waits as long as two hours at bottlenecks on the way to Everest’s summit. The prolonged exposure to cold, wind and lowered oxygen levels has appeared to lead to the deaths of multiple climbers. Indian climber Anjali Kulkarni, 54, died Wednesday while leaving Everest’s summit with her husband. Kulkarni became stuck in congestion on the mountain while trying to return to camp, a delay that is believed to be a factor in her death, the manager for her tour group told the New York Times.

She will remain Prime Minister until a new leader is chosen by her party, in a contest which will begin the following week and conclude some time in the summer. She will have served as British Prime Minister for three years. May was forced out by her own cabinet and wider party, who lost faith in her ability to deliver Brexit. The final straw came Wednesday, when May’s fourth attempt to put her Brexit deal to a vote was scuppered by her closest allies, who said they could not support her latest compromise that included a concession to let lawmakers vote on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum. “It is in the best interests of the country for a new Prime Minister to lead,” May told cameras. “It is and will always remain a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit,” she said. “It will be for my successor to seek a way forward that honours the result of the referendum. To succeed, he or she will have to find consensus in Parliament where I have not.” May became British Prime Minister in July 2016, after her predecessor David Cameron stepped down in the wake of the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union in the June 2016 referendum. The former Home Secretary (Interior Minister), May had supported the ‘remain’ campaign in the referendum, but pivoted to a ‘leave’ platform as Prime Minister, promising to do all she could to make Brexit an opportunity for the country. Perhaps the moment that defined her premiership came in April 2017, when she called a general election in a bid to increase her majority in Parliament in order to smooth the passage of Brexit legislation. However May’s gambit, based on high polling data at the time, failed to pay off.

913,Amy Gunia,"The White House may bypass Congress to export billions of dollars of weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that are now on hold. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials are pushing for the enacting of an emergency provision which would give President Trump the power to stop Congress from halting sales of the arms, according to the New York Times. The weapons are worth about $7 billion and include combat aircraft and precision-guided munitions. Congress normally reviews prospective U.S. weapons sales, but the Trump administration may not afford Congress that customary assessment. Senator Christopher S. Murphy Tweeted about the issue Wednesday. The loophole Murphy is referring to is one that allows the president to circumvent the congressional review of arms sales if it is deemed that “an emergency exists which requires the proposed sale in the national security interest of the United States,” according to the Times. Pompeo may invoke the emergency based on what the U.S. government says is increased threat from Iran, according to the Times. Tensions have risen in the Middle East in recent weeks. Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for an attack on an oil pipeline and the U.S. warned sailors in the Gulf of an increased threat form Iran or its allies after ships were sabotaged off the coast of the U.A.E. The U.S. cited this threat as justification for the deployment of an aircraft carrier and a bomber fleet to the Middle East.

After worldwide outrage over the harsh laws Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced in April — which stipulate that gay sex and adultery require death by stoning, and also punish lesbian sex through whipping and theft through amputation — Oxford reached out to the Sultan about the honorary law degree the distinguished institution awarded him in 1993. “As part of the review process, the university wrote to notify the sultan on 26 April 2019, asking for his views by 7 June 2019,” the university told Reuters via email. “Through a letter dated 6 May 2019, the sultan replied with his decision to return the degree.” More than 115,000 people signed a petition on Change.org calling on Oxford to rescind the degree. Celebrities including George Clooney and Elton John also spoke out against the Sultan’s proposals. Gay sex and a number of other acts, including rape, adultery, sodomy, extramarital sex for Muslims and insulting the Prophet Muhammed, are all punishable by death under the rollout of the new Sharia laws, though widespread condemnation of the code prompted a moratorium on the anti-LGBT punishments. Earlier this month, the Sultan said in a speech that the predominantly Muslim Asian nation of about 450,000 people would not enforce the draconian laws — acknowledging they raised “many questions and misperceptions” — but also defended them, saying they had “merit.” Before the Sultan announced the changes in April, homosexuality was illegal in Brunei, but punished through prison time.

915,Jamie Ducharme,"Nearly 500 children in a single Pakistani city have tested positive for HIV, in an outbreak that has led to the arrest of at least one doctor and highlighted gross inadequacies in the local health care system. As of mid-May, 410 children and 100 adults in Larkana, a city in Pakistan’s Sindh province, had tested positive for HIV, the Associated Press reported. Those numbers have since climbed to 494 children and 113 adults, according to NPR. How did more than 600 people in one area become infected with HIV? Here’s what to know. According to reports from NPR and the AP, parents in April began to notice lasting fevers in their children and took them to a nearby medical center for testing. By around April 24, 15 children ages 2 to 8 had tested positive for HIV, according to an op-ed written by Larkana Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Nauman Siddique. “Recognising the seriousness of this issue,” local officials shortly thereafter set up a “healthcare camp” where children and their parents could be screened for the virus, Siddique wrote. “The results of the screening within the first few days were shocking,” he wrote. “The tests revealed that the parents of the HIV-positive children were HIV negative”—raising questions about how so many children became infected. By May 14, after screening more than 10,000 people, the number of diagnosed individuals had grown to more than 400, according to the country’s National AIDS Control Programme. As testing continued, that number only grew. A web of unsanitary and unsafe medical practices seems to be to blame, according to local officials. Many of the children who originally tested positive for HIV had been treated in a Larkana clinic run by Dr. Muzaffar Ghangharo, NPR reports. After demands from parents, Ghangharo was eventually tested for HIV. The results came back positive, “and here is when it was suspected that he was the source of spreading HIV in their kids through bad practices,” a district police officer told NPR.",Nearly 500 Children Have Been Infected With HIV in a Single Pakistani City.

918,Suyin Haynes,"Tens of thousands of celebrators gathered outside Taiwan’s parliament on May 17, waving rainbow flags as the island’s government became the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. The move comes at a moment of change for LGBTQ rights in Asia: even as nations like India–whose Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality in 2018–have expanded rights, others including Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei have cracked down. Advocates in the region now hope Taiwan’s example can help tip the scales toward inclusion. While strongly supported by President Tsai Ing-wen, marriage equality provoked strong opposition from conservative and religious groups in Taiwan. Conservative lawmakers had tabled two rival bills proposing same-sex unions, but the government’s own legislation–the bill that passed–includes the word marriage and grants same-sex couples many of the same rights as heterosexual couples. About 200 same-sex couples were reportedly planning a mass marriage registration in Taipei on May 24, the day the law comes into effect. Human-rights group Amnesty International has said the law “falls short of genuine and full marriage equality,” as it does not provide equal adoption rights. The law also does not recognize marriages to foreigners whose countries do not permit same-sex marriage. Despite such limitations, the legislation gained the backing of LGBTQ groups, which saw it as the best option available for equality. Chinese state media tweeted a congratulatory message in support of the law on May 18, but Taiwan’s lawmakers rebuked the praise, seeing it as an attempt by Beijing to take credit for the new law while diminishing their autonomy. (The mainland views Taiwan, an island of 23 million people that lies 112 miles off the coast, as its sovereign territory.) The social scuffle came amid a wave of censorship of LGBTQ subjects on social media in China, where homosexuality is legal but same-sex marriages are not.

But in Austria they got off to a rough start because of an embarrassing video. The details of that case are as ludicrous as they are damning. Vice Chancellor and leader of the far-right Freedom Party Heinz-Christian Strache was caught offering lucrative government contracts to a woman he believed to be the niece of a powerful Russian oligarch in exchange for her willingness to buy an Austrian newspaper and shift its editorial position to favor his party just before an election. For many, this episode confirmed two things: much of Europe’s far right is, or would like to be, on the Russian payroll, and its charismatic leaders lack basic good judgment. The next development says something about the predicament facing center-right parties as they try to beat back attempts by the far right to steal their voters. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, chairman of the center-right Austrian People’s Party, spotting an opportunity to test its far-right coalition partner with voters, called for new elections. That’s smart politics, but while the result may temporarily strengthen the center right at the far right’s expense, it doesn’t solve the larger problem that voters are anxious and angry at mainstream politicians who they believe don’t have their best interests at heart. Across Europe, mainstream conservatives continue to wrestle with this problem, but they would be wise to do so carefully. In Germany, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Chancellor Merkel’s likely successor, has tried to prevent the far-right opposition Alternative for Germany party from pulling away her party’s voters in part by tacking to the right on the immigration policies that have undermined Merkel’s popularity. But she has also tried to force Merkel into early retirement, a plan that has backfired and now threatens her position within her party. In France and Italy, center-right parties have made poor attempts to imitate anti-E.U. and anti-migrant language and policies that alienate centrist voters and make them appear to be pale imitations of more aggressive conservative rivals, who benefit by the comparison. In Spain, the rise of the populist Vox party has pulled the more moderate People’s Party and Ciudadanos party to the right, splitting the right-wing vote in ways that helped a center-left party finish first in the country’s most recent national elections. But still the glaring, and most consequential, example of a center-right party’s miscalculating how best to manage a challenge from the right comes from the decision by then Prime Minister David Cameron to beat back criticism from the fledgling U.K. Independence Party by calling for a public referendum on Britain’s continued membership in the E.U. The punishment his Conservative Party has taken following the Brexit vote and the inability to deliver on its result has only just begun. An angry Briton doused Brexit champion Nigel Farage with a banana and salted-caramel milkshake on May 20, but it’s the Conservatives who are taking the biggest hit. Europe’s populists are so far better at campaigning than at governing, and some of its leaders are more prone to poor judgment than their mainstream competitors. But far-right politicians haven’t simply invented anti-E.U., anti-migrant anger, and those who would deny them votes still struggle to answer this challenge.

920,Amy Gunia,"The President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, says his government has hired a private shipping company to send containers full of Canadian trash back to Canada, vowing to dump the rubbish in Canadian waters if the country does not accept them, according to the Guardian. Tensions have been increasing over the waste since the North American nation missed a May 15 deadline to take back truckloads of garbage it sent to the Philippines from 2013 to 2014. Last week, the Philippines called home its ambassador and consuls in Canada. “The Philippines as an independent sovereign nation must not be treated as trash by other foreign nation,” presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said at a press conference, according to the Guardian. He also said that Canada, who has agreed to take the trash back, was not taking the issue seriously enough.

According to the Guardian, Canada has already agreed to take it back and is working out arrangements to do so. “The removal will be complete by the end of June, as the waste must be safely treated to meet Canadian safety and health requirements,” said a statement issued by the Canadian government Wednesday, according to the Guardian.

921,Amy Gunia,"A new study has determined that the mysterious source of ozone-destroying gases that have increased in the atmosphere recently is eastern China. Last year, scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons, more commonly known as CFCs, were increasing despite an international ban on their use, according to CNN. The findings of a team of scientists from across the world who used computer models to determine where the gases were being emitted, will be published in Nature on Thursday, reports CNN. “We used our models to show that emissions of CFC-11 from north eastern China had increased by around 7,000 tons per year after 2013, particularly in or around the provinces of Shandong and Hebei,” said Luke Western, a University of Bristol atmospheric modeler, according to a statement on the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where several of the researchers hailed from. CFCs, which were invented in 1928 and commercially used as refrigerants and in aerosol cans, are highly damaging to the earth’s ozone layer over Antarctica. In 1987, the U.S. and about two-dozen other countries signed the Montreal Protocol, which agreed to phase out the use of CFCs. China ratified the treaty in 1991. According to CNN, a global ban on the use of CFCs has been in place since 2010. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet commented on the study, according to CNN. The scientists say that their work is not done. “It is now vital that we find out which industries are responsible for the new emissions,” Matt Rigby, a lead author of the study, said in the Sripps Institution statement. The ozone layer is a layer in the earth’s atmosphere that protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation. In recent years, scientists have said that the ozone layer was starting to show signs of healing.","Banned Ozone-Destroying Gases Are Coming From China, Scientists Say","May 23, 2019"
922,Amy Gunia,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared victory in India’s general election, after early results showed his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead in 300 of the 543 seats up for grabs. Modi’s BJP is on track to increase its share of seats in the Lok Sabha, India’s lower house of parliament. It won 282 seats at the last election in 2014, pushing out the Congress party, which had ruled India for 54 of its 67 years since independence. “Together we grow. Together we prosper. Together we will build a strong and inclusive India,” Modi tweeted on Thursday as it became clear his party was on track for a landslide that would lend him another five years in power. The elections, in which some 900 million people were eligible to vote, played out in seven phases set over five and a half weeks, finally coming to a close on Sunday. Counting to determine the winner in the world’s largest democratic election began at 8 a.m. local time on Thursday morning, and results have been trickling out since then — with electronic voting machines meaning the process is faster than in previous years. Here’s what you need to know: As of around 5.30 p.m. local time on Thursday, the Election Commission reported Modi’s BJP party ahead in votes for 303 out of 542 constituencies, and the opposition Congress party ahead in 50 seats. BJP leaders were already celebrating on Thursday afternoon. Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj called the election a “massive victory” for the party on Twitter, according to Reuters.

923,Frances Schwartzkopff / Bloomberg,"The son of Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen has been tripped up by the country’s strict immigration laws, which will force his Harvard-educated American girlfriend to leave Denmark by the end of this month. The development thrusts immigration policy into the spotlight as Danes prepare to vote in national elections on June 5. Rasmussen, 55, leads a center-right minority coalition that rules with the support of the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party. Last week, he stunned the country’s political establishment by announcing he would rather abandon some of his traditional supporters on the far right than let their “extreme opinions” influence his politics. In a debate broadcast by TV2 on Sunday evening, Rasmussen said that his 29-year-old son, Bergur, is being forced to split temporarily with his girlfriend, because she’s too young to seek residence under Danish immigration laws. The young woman, whose name and precise age weren’t revealed, is under 24 and therefore not eligible to remain in Denmark following the 2002 passage of a law that was intended to stop residents, particularly from non-Western countries, from bringing in child brides. It’s since become a key plank in the country’s broader efforts to stem immigration. A student at Harvard University, she’s been in Denmark as part of her studies, Rasmussen said. The prime minister said he stands behind the rule and tougher immigration generally. But he also criticized the lack of flexibility in the current immigration laws, particularly as Danish businesses face a labor shortage and are desperate for highly educated immigrants. “It’s to wonder at, that we live in a country that has no place for her,” Rasmussen said. In response, Mette Frederiksen, head of the opposition Social Democrats, said the rule carries “a price” and rejected efforts to soften it. Most polls show Frederiksen, who has embraced tough immigration policies since taking over her party, will win next month’s election. Meanwhile, the prime minister said he backs a revision of the Schengen agreement, so that the current arrangement enabling passport-free travel across Europe is tightened. Rasmussen told TV2 that Denmark “needs to look after our borders, and that’s why we need to develop a new Schengen regime that gives us more political autonomy over our own borders.” After 2015, when the Syrian refugee crisis hit, Denmark introduced a series of temporary border controls. Rasmussen’s Liberal Party now wants Europe to consider allowing member states to make such controls permanent.",A Danish Law Aimed at Child Brides Could Force the Prime Minister's Son's Girlfriend to Leave the Country,"May 22, 2019"
924,Charlotte McDonald-Gibson,"Spend a few hours with Jesse Klaver, and you realize he is a little different from other politicians in the Netherlands, a country where most people pride themselves on being modest and unpretentious. First, there is the unblinking self-confidence with which he will look you in the eye and tell you he wants to be Prime Minister one day. Then there are his exuberant political rallies, like the one TIME joined in Amsterdam on a windy weekday evening in March. Klaver enters through the crowd to pumping music and rhythmic clapping, like a boxer approaching the ring. The 33-year-old leader of the GroenLinks (Green Left) party made a global splash after his party leapt from four to 14 seats in the 2017 general elections, and his telegenic looks and resemblance to a certain Canadian Prime Minister earned him the nickname “the Justin Trudeau of the Netherlands.” Speaking in a backstage dressing room over a second glass of green tea—“The party drink!” he jokes—Klaver says his approach simply reflects a shift in society, with young people becoming increasingly outspoken and politically active, especially on issues like climate change that affect their future. “A new generation is standing up in the Netherlands,” he says. “Young people are going on the streets for demonstrations. Something is happening, and people are standing up and saying, ‘My generation has to fix this.’” Klaver is one of a band of youthful leaders around the world fighting back against the far-right populist and nationalist trend by tapping into a new political activism and offering a radical vision for the future. Membership in his Green Left party has surged by around 25% since the 2017 vote. Next up are the European Parliament elections on May 23, where environment-focused parties are hoping to challenge the dominant narrative of a right-wing, Euroskeptic surge. In Germany, polls suggest the Greens party is now the country’s second largest; in the next Dutch Senate, the Green Left will be the joint third largest. It’s a fight symbolic of a broader tug-of-war between ideologies, Klaver says. “The big question is who is going to come next? The new progressives—the Greens in Europe and the socialists in the U.S.? Or the populists? This is the fight we have to fight, and we are in a winning mood.” Klaver’s rally in Amsterdam is aimed at drumming up support for the E.U. elections, which will determine the makeup of the legislative body that oversees pan-European policies. A broad section of society is present, from teenagers to retirees. Only one person sports bare feet and dreadlocks, the outdated archetype of the Green voter. During the Q&A session, a 15-year-old boy asks Klaver how he can fight for change: his school did not let him take part in the Europe-wide climate-change strikes led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, he says, and he is too young to vote. After some gentle ribbing about how asking permission negates the point of a strike, the Green leader reminisces about his own youthful activism.","In the War for Europe’s Soul, Holland’s Green Crusader Jesse Klaver Is Fighting for the Future","May 22, 2019"
925,Vivienne Walt,"For months, the European Union’s leaders have waged a fierce battle against Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. They have accused him of targeting minorities and opposition media, and threatened to withdraw Hungary’s voting rights in the E.U. Parliament, and to eject permanently members of Orbán’s far-right Fidesz party from the biggest political grouping in the legislative body in Brussels. Yet none of that has succeeded in softening Orbán’s views — far from it. As his campaign has ramped up for this week’s crucial E.U. Parliament elections, so has his hardline rhetoric — especially his opposition to migrants coming to Europe. In his annual speech to mark Hungary’s national day on March 15, Orbán said that unless the E.U. halts the flow of migrants to the Continent, “Europe will no longer belong to Europeans.” Last Monday, 10 days ahead of the E.U. elections, that hard line received a pre-election boost, when President Donald Trump welcomed Orban to the White House. Trump told him in the Oval Office that “you have been great with respect to Christian communities, you have really put up a block up” against non-Christian immigrants. With migration one of the most divisive issues in the European elections, which take place between May 23 and 26, the government is vowing not to soften its stance of accepting zero immigrants, as Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told TIME in a recent interview. “We have to stick to our tradition, our religion, and we should stick to our cultural heritage as well,” he said, during a far-ranging discussion at the E.U.’s headquarters in Brussels. The battle over how to resettle the 1.4 million or so people who crossed illegally into Europe during the 2014-2016 migrant crisis has opened deep schisms within the 28 E.U. member countries (27 after Brexit). Despite years of summitry and negotiations, leaders have failed to agree on how to resettle those arriving, with countries like Hungary refusing to abide by E.U. quotas in accepting migrants. At the height of the migrant crisis in 2015, about 410,000 people crossed into Hungary in a chaotic scramble to reach countries further West. Hungarian police fired tear gas and beat migrants, in tumultuous scenes that briefly transfixed the world, and the government has vowed to stop any future migrant influx. So far, they have not yielded. “We would never accept any kind of methods or procedure that would change the composition of the population of the European continent,” Szijjártó said. Szijjártó, 40, a strong Orbán loyalist who helped found Fidesz’s youth movement 20 years ago and has spent his career in politics, admits that religion is a key factor in Hungary’s anti-migrant policies. “Europe is a Christian continent. We are based on Christian heritage, Christian history, Christian roots,” he says. “This is something we would like to preserve.”",Hungary's Far-Right Government Has Been Getting a Boost from President Trump Ahead of E.U.

926,Anuk Arudpragasam,"In Colombo, as though there is war once more, the ominous presence of heavily armed soldiers is everywhere. Ever since the Easter Sunday bombings, checkpoints have been posted on all the main roads, as well as outside churches and mosques. There are rumors every day of further possible bombings, of newly discovered perpetrators and accomplices still on the run, and a State of Emergency has been declared in the country. The same State of Emergency that during the civil war allowed the government to detain, interrogate, and torture at will. There are recurring curfews and bans on social media, and even when these are lifted the streets are mostly empty by late evening. People avoid congregating in public spaces, especially Muslims, whose fears that the bombings will be used as a pretext for yet another series of violent attacks on their community are already materializing. There is something almost unbearable in this state of disorientation, something more than just fear for one’s life and safety. Life as usual has been interrupted, the routines and rhythms that anchor people to their environments suspended. People have been compelled to stop, look up from the daydream of ordinary life, and take stock of themselves and the world in which they live, a process that most people in most places, Sri Lanka and elsewhere, would rather avoid. What would drive nine mostly middle-class Sri Lankan Muslims to such acts of violence and self-destruction? And why target Christians, of all people, who in this country have hurt nobody for the sake of their beliefs? In the newspapers and on the TV, in buses and private vehicles, in offices, shops, and living rooms, everywhere there is a palpable anxiety to find answers, to obtain an explanation that will allow for a return to the soothing indifference of ordinary life. In response to similar attacks that have occurred in the Western world, a readymade script has long been prepared for this purpose. The main protagonists of this script, of course, are radical Islamists, terrorists with ruthless disregard for human life, people who have no history except the history of their radicalization, and who will stop at nothing to destroy the peace. It is a script that is easy to use, one that allows complex histories to be simply written and simply processed, and it is this script that the international media have almost universally resorted to in covering the recent events in Sri Lanka. It is worth asking why the Easter Sunday bombings have given the country unprecedented attention in the Western world. There already seems to have been more coverage of the bombings than there was of the massacres of Tamil civilians during the last phase of the civil war that ended in 2009, when according to the UN up to 40,000 people were killed at the hands of the Sinhala-Buddhist state. The accusations of genocide and war crimes made by Tamils, of little concern to the political interests of Europe and the United States, were relayed quietly and with little overt sympathy in the West. The Easter Sunday bombings, on the other hand, offer the Western press an ideological opportunity that has been taken up with aplomb by newscasters and pundits who speak with practiced authority on the subject, their eyebrows gravely furrowed and their voices filled with concern. Whereas jihadist attacks in Europe and the US are obviously connected with the long and brutal history of Western imperialism in the Middle East, the attacks on the overwhelmingly peaceful Christian communities in Sri Lanka cannot easily be explained along such lines. The bombings have therefore allowed commentators in the West to focus solely on the anti-human nature of radical Islam, to portray it as an ideology which, instead of being a misguided political response to a history of oppression, comes out of a free-floating, ahistorical, unbridled will to death. The narrative is useful, since it allows the West to view itself too as the blameless victim of an intrinsically evil ideology, as though its own complicity can now be disregarded when considering the jihadist attacks that have taken place on its own soil. How can the West’s continued military and political interference with affairs in the Middle East be questioned, after all, when the ideology under consideration is one of pure and simple evil? Much the same might be said of the Indian media’s enthusiastic coverage of the bombings in Sri Lanka, too, since actions committed by the Indian military in Kashmir have given rise to a similar obsession with Islamic radicalism there. The Sri Lankan government and media, by and large, has been eager to follow this global script, as though nothing but the abstract evil of radical Islam could be responsible for the Easter Sunday bombings. It has gone so far as to follow various European countries in banning the burqa, despite the fact that no burqa had any role in the bombings or the deaths. As conscientious Sri Lankans know, however, the island has its own long and ugly history of anti-Muslim sentiment. Local stereotypes and discriminations against Sri Lankan Muslims abound – often portrayed as unscrupulous or untrustworthy, the Sinhala and Tamil middle-classes are often reluctant to rent their homes even to well-off members of the community. These prejudices have little to do with Islamic beliefs per se, and much more to do with local histories: with the complex caste-related undertones of anti-Muslim prejudice, with economic resentment against the success of Muslim businesses, and with shifting political alliances and power configurations between the Muslim, Sinhala, and Tamil communities during and after the war. Different political forces on the island are well practiced in exploiting these biases for their own ends. The Tamil Tigers notably did so when they forcibly expelled tens of thousands of Muslims from Jaffna in 1990, on the pretext that the Muslim community was betraying the separatist cause. In the postwar years it has been the forces of Sinhala Buddhist supremacy that have systematically targeted Muslims on the island, in the campaigns for ending Halal certification, in the agitations for the boycott of Muslim-owned businesses, and above all in the anti-Muslim riots of 2014 and 2018 that resulted in the looting and burning of hundreds of Muslim shops and homes. The outbreaks of violence against the Muslim community that have followed the Easter Sunday bombings will no doubt be explained away as anger in response to the actions of the extremists, but the truth is that anti-Muslim violence in Sri Lanka has preceded the recent bombings by several years, and anti-Muslim prejudice by far longer. It is important that these acts of anti-Muslim hatred, largely ignored or condoned by the country’s majority Buddhist population, have come on the heels of the massacre of Tamil civilians during the end of the war, as if with the complete subjugation of one minority the country has needed to find another minority against which its aggression can be expressed. The two events cannot be compared, but they cannot be viewed in isolation. They point to a majority community that continually projects its fears, shames, and insecurities onto various racialized others, a majority that is unable to take responsibility for its own past and its own destiny, which is in constant need of an externalized object of resentment.",A State of Disorientation: Dispatch from Sri Lanka after the Easter Bombings,"May 22, 2019"

Human rights activist Behrouz Boochani, who is currently being detained at the Manus Island Detention Center off Papua New Guinea, told CNN that seven people in his detention center and two people in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea attempted to end their lives, but no one died.

An investigation by London-based non-profit Korea Future Initiative (KFI) conducted first-hand interviews over two years with 45 survivors and victims of sexual violence. KFI claims that although North Korean refugees have long been susceptible to human trafficking due to the dire situation in their homeland, the problem has become worse in recent years due to a “voracious appetite for prostitution in China.” The report says North Koreans are in demand because of the low cost charged for their bodies, which can be as little as $4 for prostitution services and $146 for a wife. “I was deceived by a broker and sold into marriage for ¥5,000 Chinese Yuan ($720 United States Dollars). I spent six years as a slave,” survivor Park Jihyun said in the report. The report estimates that up to 200,00 North Koreans have fled into mainland China, mostly female. KFI claims that 60% of North Korean refugees in China are trafficked into the sex trade, with 50% of those forced into prostitution, 30% into marriage, and 15% into cybersex.

Ray Wong, 25, and Alan Li, 27, faced rioting charges for their roles in a protest that turned into a violent overnight clash with police in February 2016, but the pair jumped bail and fled to Germany in 2017, according to the New York Times.

Germany’s federal office for migration and refugees also confirmed to the Times in an email that it had granted two Hong Kongers refugee protection last year. They are believed to be the first political activists from the city to be granted asylum by a foreign country. The revelation is likely to deal a blow to Hong Kong’s international reputation, at a time when political freedoms have been eroding in the city. “This is a worrying sign, though not entirely surprising given recent trends in Hong Kong,” Kelley Loper, Director of the Centre for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, told TIME. “Although Hong Kong still enjoys a certain amount of autonomy and is politically and legally distinct from the rest of China, recent developments could chip away at those guarantees and negatively affect Hong Kong’s international reputation,” Loper said.

932,Eric Lichtblau,"A few weeks before Donald Trump became president, Russian banker Petr Aven, a billionaire oligarch with Moscow’s Alfa Bank, pulled aside Washington lobbyist Richard Burt at a corporate meeting in Luxembourg with a sensitive request. Aven told Burt that “someone high in the Russian government” wanted “a communications channel between the Kremlin and the Trump Transition Team,” according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s recently released report. Aven wanted Burt, a former ambassador who had helped Trump’s campaign, to work on setting it up. Burt later told Mueller’s team that the request was, in the words of the report, “outside the normal realm,” even for Burt, a well-traveled Washington insider who had worked with Aven for years. It looks even more remarkable now. The “high” Russian official was none other than President Vladimir Putin, Mueller’s team would later learn. Amid what Mueller called a “flurry of Russian activity” during the Trump transition, the Aven outreach is the only publicly known instance in which Putin, a onetime KGB spy, was personally involved in directing Russia’s clandestine efforts with the incoming administration. The surreptitious contacts involving Putin, Aven and Burt as described in the Mueller report contradict repeated assertions by Alfa Bank that it had no contacts with Trump or people around him. At the time of Trump’s election, Alfa Bank was at the center of a mystery over an unexplained surge in computer traffic from Moscow to the Trump Organization in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign. Computer analysts concluded that Alfa Bank had developed a covert communications channel to the Trump Organization. The bank has adamantly denied those assertions, saying in March 2017, for instance, that opponents were trying to use the Internet traffic to create “the false impression that Alfa Bank has business or other dealings with Mr. Trump.” Alfa Bank said separately that same month that the bank and Mr. Aven had not had “any contact with Mr. Trump or his organizations.” Mueller did not address the cyber-traffic one way or the other in his report. That has left some Democrats on Capitol Hill unsatisfied. “Even in the wake of the Mueller report, we don’t know the meaning of the 2016 communications between Alfa Bank and Trump Organization servers, nor do we even know whether the FBI has fully investigated those links,” says Rhode Island Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Judiciary Committee. Burt, who was the U.S. ambassador to West Germany during the Reagan Administration, wears a number of hats in the 2016 story of Aven and Alfa Bank. He helped develop key points for an important foreign-policy speech that then-candidate Trump delivered in Washington in April 2016, with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in attendance. Burt also dined during the campaign with Jeff Sessions, then a top Trump advisor, to discuss policy matters, Mueller said.",Questions Remain About Putin's Request for a Back Channel to the Trump Transition,"May 21, 2019"
933,Amy Gunia,"An Indonesian court sentenced a French citizen to death for smuggling drugs on Monday in a surprisingly draconian verdict that outstripped the prosecutors’ requests for a long prison sentence. Felix Dorfin, 35, was arrested in September at an airport in the tourist island of Lombok with methylenedioxy methamphetamine worth $220,600 and 22 ecstasy pills in his suitcase, according to the Associated Press. Despite Dorfin’s eligibility for capital punishment, prosecutors had asked for a 20-year jail term plus another year unless he paid a fine of about $700,000, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The strict sentence came as a surprise. “Dorfin was shocked,” the defendant’s lawyer, Deny Nur Indra, told AFP. “He didn’t expect this at all because prosecutors only asked for 20 years.” His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict. Indonesia has some of the world’s strictest anti-drug laws, and foreigners implicated in drug smuggling cases have been executed before. The judge, Isnurul Syamsul Arif, cited Dorfin’s involvement in an international drug smuggling ring and the large quantity of drugs he carried as aggravating factors, according to AFP. “The defendant’s actions could potentially do damage to the younger generation,” Arif added, reports AFP.",Indonesia Sentences Frenchman to Death for Drug Smuggling,"May 21, 2019"
934,Bloomberg,"Perhaps nothing captures the growing anti-U.S. sentiment in China better than a song about the trade war that is going viral in Beijing: “If the perpetrator wants to fight, we will beat him out of his wits.” This privately-produced song has more than 100,000 views on WeChat and is just one of many signs of brewing anti-American sentiment on Chinese social media as trade talks falter. State media has carried commentaries urging unified resistance to foreign pressure, including an editorial from the nationalist Global Times calling the trade dispute a “ people’s war” and a threat to all of China. Even seafood hasn’t escaped sharper rhetoric. Guangdong province’s Communist Party Youth League issued a WeChat post calling for China to eat more tilapia – a farmed fish now subject to higher U.S. tariffs. The song, simply called “Trade War,” is set to the tune of an anti-Japanese song from the 1960s film “Tunnel War” – in which a Chinese town defends itself from invasion. It begins with a male chorus singing “Trade war! Trade War! Not afraid of the outrageous challenge! Not afraid of the outrageous challenge! A trade war is happening over the Pacific Ocean!” “I chose ‘Tunnel War’ because that is reminiscent of the similar situation that China is facing today,” the song’s producer and lyricist Zhao Liangtian told Bloomberg News on Monday. “Since the trade war broke out, I felt the urge to do something.” On Tuesday, Chinese state media continued the belligerent rhetoric against the U.S.",Trade War Fight Song Shows Growing Anti-U.S. Sentiment in China,"May 21, 2019"
935,Andy Kopsa,"Reenactments of the Khmer Rouge genocide are annual events in Cambodia. On the grounds of the famous killing fields of Choeung Ek, outside the capital of Phnom Penh, a troupe of young performers will take their positions on an open field. The loudspeakers will blare haunting music and words of hate. Actors carrying wooden machine guns will simulate the mass murder of civilians. Children aren’t spared and neither are the elderly. It is May 20, the National Day of Remembrance. The annual observance marks the day in 1975 when the communist regime of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge began the mass killings of the Cambodian genocide. Such national days of remembrance are often a key part of confronting and acknowledging a troubling past; Germany’s decision to create a day to remember the Holocaust, for example, has been seen as an important step forward. But Cambodia’s version is complicated by the purpose the day has served for the governments that followed the Khmer Rouge — and the questions it raises are profound: What does it mean when a government decrees that the past must be remembered in a certain way? And how do you memorialize something you can’t forget? Pol Pot — the nom de guerre of a man named Saloth Sar — had rapidly climbed the ranks of the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia’s “red communists,” in the 1960s, and became the leader of the guerrilla fighters who orchestrated the systematic take-over of the country in the 1970s. Starting in the northern provinces, the regime worked its way to Phnom Penh. In April of 1975, they seized the city and forced residents to evacuate. By late afternoon the wide boulevards of the city were emptied of cars and filled with a procession of soldiers and trucks loaded with concertina wire and weapons. Families fanned out from the city on foot, not knowing where they were meant to go. Many, falsely told they could return in a few days, left with only the clothing they wore. By that point, Cambodia had already been devastated by wars from within and without: the First Indochina War, the Vietnam War and their own civil war. A flood of refugees spilled into Thailand while others from the countryside came to Phnom Penh. Rice fields were decimated, livelihoods were lost and people went hungry. The Khmer Rouge stepped into the breach, espousing a vision of a communist utopia. The struggling rural farmer would get the same food, shelter and life as the city-dwelling doctor. It was an easy sell with horrific consequences. The mass killings began about a month after Phnom Penh fell. Pol Pot convinced a destroyed nation to join an agrarian revolution turned genocide; an estimated 1.7 to 2 million people were killed including ethnic minorities, Buddhists and Cham Muslims died under his regime. The official remembrance of those events began to take shape almost immediately after Cambodia was liberated from the Khmer Rouge in 1979, as the new government looked for ways to legitimize itself. The newly formed People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) began distancing itself from the regime — at least outwardly, as many of its own leaders had been officers in the Khmer Rouge too. The Day of Remembrance, first staged in 1984, was originally known as The National Day of Hatred Against the Genocidal Pol Pot-Ieng Sary-Khieu Samphan clique and the Sihanouk-Son Sann Reactionary Groups. Anthropologist Alex Hinton has written that the Day of Hate was a way for the PRK to keep anger toward the Khmer Rouge active so that they could put it to use for their own political purposes if needed. In his book Voices from S-21, historian David Chandler writes the PRK “worked hard to focus people’s anger onto the ‘genocidal clique’ that had governed Cambodia,” as the “new government based its legitimacy on the fact that it had come to power by toppling the Khmer Rouge [though] it was in no position to condemn the entire movement, since so many prominent PRK figures had been Khmer Rouge themselves.” In the 1980s and ‘90s, the Day of Hate was staged on a massive scale. Paper effigies of Pol Pot were burned and survivors told the true horror stories of their lives under the Khmer Rouge. These events were critical to the PRK leadership reinventing itself, eventually becoming the Cambodia People’s Party of today, the party of Prime Minster Hun Sen. While attendance wasn’t compulsory at the original days of anger, it was strongly encouraged and with the help of local authorities’ mass turnout was assured. After years of war and the Khmer Rouge, the people were left starving in a land littered with landmines and mass graves. The day of hate fell into place easily on this backdrop.",How Cambodia’s Day of Remembrance for Genocide Victims Has Always Been Complicated by Politics,"May 20, 2019"

940,Ciara Nugent,"Four months into the chaotic political stand-off between Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s regime and opposition leader Juan Guaidó’s attempted revolution, officials confirmed Thursday that representatives for both sides had travelled to Norway for talks aimed at resolving the country’s crisis. The Oslo talks, acknowledged by Maduro’s ambassador to the U.N., are the first real sign that his government is willing to engage in dialogue with Guaidó, the president of the opposition-held parliament, and his supporters. Guaidó told reporters the talks did not yet amount to “negotiations” but a form of “mediation.” But the news of possible progress came in the same week as a dramatic government crackdown on the opposition. Security forces blocked lawmakers from entering parliament on Tuesday, and intelligence agencies have placed fourteen opposition lawmakers––including the vice president of parliament–– under investigation for their role in a failed April 30 uprising against the government, which was dubbed a coup by Maduro. Meanwhile Guaidó said he had instructed his U.S. envoy to open relations with the U.S. military and set a meeting with the U.S. Southern Command, which oversees military operations in Latin America, for next week, raising fresh fears of American military involvement in the country. Tensions are rising even as a peaceful way out seems visible for the first time. Here’s what to know about the chaotic interaction between the two sides in Venezuela. Maduro’s government has grown increasingly authoritarian since he took over from his mentor, popular socialist leader Hugo Chávez, in 2014. A drop in global oil prices that year triggered the collapse of Venezuela’s economy, sparking years of severe humanitarian crisis and widespread social unrest. Maduro responded by detaining protesters and political opponents and stripping the opposition-controlled parliament of its powers. Guaidó and Maduro have been at loggerheads since January, when Guaidó claimed that Maduro’s second presidential term, won in 2018 elections the opposition considered rigged, was invalid and constituted a vacuum of power. As parliament leader, the opposition claims the constitution mandates Guaidó temporarily take over the presidency to organize fresh elections. The U.S. and 50 other mostly western countries have recognized Guaidó as president, while Maduro retains the backing of Russia, China and Turkey. Maduro also has the crucial support of the military, Venezuela’s largest institution, which exercises security functions and controls many state bodies.",Why Venezuela's Government and Opposition Are Finally Coming to the Negotiating Table,"May 17, 2019"
941,John Walcott,"The Trump Administration is turning up the heat on Iran, broadcasting a new plan to send as many as 120,000 U.S. forces to the Middle East to counter purported “identified, credible threats” from Iran. But in the world of the Pentagon, there are plans you present to politicians, and then there are real plans. And three U.S. military officials involved in planning and overseeing military forces in the region tell TIME that no actual, executable plan, or anything like it, exists for a large-scale troop deployment to the Gulf. “That requires knowing what contingency you’re addressing,” says one officer. “Is the target Iran’s own forces or is it a militia? Is the enemy in Iraq or Syria or someplace else? A car bomb or missiles or cyber? Is there credible evidence linking an attack to the Iranian government so that targets inside Iran are legitimate?” All three sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss the matter publicly, told TIME they had seen no such detailed data. National Security Advisor John Bolton recently requested a plan for sending a substantial number of additional U.S. ground and air forces to the Persian Gulf, according to the three officials. On May 9, Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented him and other top national security officials with a preliminary outline of plans to deploy as many as 120,000 more Americans to the region, according to the officials, who were briefed on the meeting, which was first reported by the New York Times. But deployments of even limited forces to deal with credible threats require what’s called a time-phased force and deployment list, or TPFDL. That list details what units are in position, what additional ones would be deployed or held in reserve, what equipment and supplies would be necessary, where the forces would embark and land, how they would move, and in what sequence. The data making up a TPFDL for a major deployment can take months to refine, and the smallest details matter. When the U.S. was preparing to invade Iraq in 2003, for example, then-defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld altered the data with the result that computers needed to keep track of arriving weaponry and supplies landed after the equipment they were supposed to track. Once the data are refined, generating the TPFDL can take days. The list is then used to coordinate the air and sea lift capabilities necessary to deploy large numbers of troops and the material needed to support them. “Available sealift determines how much can deploy on a single passage, which affects speed of deployment,” says Gen. Eric Shinseki (ret.), who was Army Chief of Staff during the 2003 Iraq invasion. Each trip takes 22 to 23 days from the U.S. to the Gulf and the same amount of time back, Shinseki says, requiring potentially months to build up a large force in the region, once a plan is in place. The Pentagon does maintain and update general plans for deploying troops anywhere around the globe — “probably including Canada,” says one of the officials. But existing plans prepared for possible confrontation with Iran by the U.S. Central Command, which runs combat missions in the region, do not call for the use of a major ground force to invade the country, said the three military officials, all of whom were briefed on them.",Exclusive: U.S. Military Officials Say There Is No Actual Plan to Confront Iran,"May 17, 2019"

The partnership, announced on May 10, became active on Wednesday. But it received a mixed reaction online, where users were quick to pan the U.S. for partnership with the fast food brand, which has been associated with rising obesity levels. “Can I have a McPassport please,” wrote one Facebook user. “Introducing the McVisa!” wrote another – in a comment that received 50 likes and “haha” reactions on Facebook.

943,Peter Frankopan,"“I say openly to President Xi and all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don’t make a deal.” Thus spake President Donald Trump this week in the new medium of modern diplomacy – Twitter. The trade war between the U.S. and China has entered a new phase, with tariffs raised from 10% to 25% on $200 billion of goods. The markets had not expected this news, with the tea leaves since the end of last year being widely seen to indicate that the US President was well on his way to winning a game of brinkmanship that would improve the terms on which the US trades with China. As is often the case with the Trump administration, there is method behind the madness. It is certainly right that U.S. businesses face barriers not only to entry but to investment, development and competition in China that Chinese businesses do not face in the U.S. Likewise, issues around the protection of intellectual property are imbalanced and in need of revision. And while many have pointed out that a trade deficit is not inherently bad in its own right, few would argue that trying to get Beijing to buy more from the US is a bad move. Even the idea of pulling the rug from under the Chinese delegation’s feet at the last minute, which included public accusations that the latter had been negotiating in bad faith and had attempted to go back on previous commitments is a tactic that many negotiators can recognize of using a position of strength to force the counter-party on to the back foot. “China is not afraid,” said Vice Premier Liu He, who is leading the Chinese side of the negotiations, “nor are the Chinese people,” in comments that were supplemented in Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, with the words, “as long as we keep our own house in order, the sky will not fall.” While it is tempting to think this is all about Trump, it is part of a much bigger and wider story. The last three decades have been a period of astonishing global transformation. New technologies have changed the way we communicate, learn and share. But it has also been a period of profound global economic re-distribution. The rate and pace of change has been jaw-dropping. In China alone, some 800 million people have been lifted from below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. At the same time, construction projects in the country were so extensive and numerous that some estimates conclude more concrete was used in China between 2011-13 alone than in the United States during the course of the entire 20th century. The story is not just about China. Seventeen of the twenty fastest growing cities in the world at the moment are located in India, including all of the top ten. By 2027, the aggregate GDP of cities will equal those of North America, with expectations that they will be 17% higher eight years later. A new world is being born – and has been for years.

944,TIME Staff,"I.M. Pei, the world-renowned architect famous for designing the glass pyramid entry to the Louvre in Paris, has died, according to the New York Times and other outlets. He was 102. Known for his groundbreaking architecture, his influential structures sparked both awe and controversy as he elevated himself to the top of his field. His other notable works include the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Ohio. Born in China in 1917, Pei moved to the United States in 1935 to study architecture. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, later, the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Shortly after graduating from Harvard, Pei was hired by William Zeckendorf to work for the firm Webb & Knapp, in 1948. He went on to build his own firm, I. M. Pei & Associates, which he set up in 1955. Though his early work included several high-rise projects, he later became known for his creative museum designs. In the late 1960s, he completed the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, the Everson Museum of Art in New York and the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa, before working on the Louvre, the National Gallery of Art and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Not one to opt for early retirement, Pei also accepted an offer to design the Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar in 2008. Although Pei reached icon status in his field, both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Museum of Islamic Art were challenges for him, since Pei reportedly didn’t love the rock music, and was previously unfamiliar with Islamic art. Pei — who had four children with wife Eileen Loo, who died in 2014 after 72 years of marriage — also outlived some of his own designs. His Sundrome of New York’s JFK International Airport was pulled down in 2011, and Hong Kong’s Sunning Plaza was demolished in 2013.","I.M.

The country’s largest annual shooting competition, the Feldschiessen, held between May 24 and 26, attracts an estimated 130,000 sharpshooters of all ages from all over Switzerland. It is not uncommon to see kids as young as 12 handling weapons with the steady-handed assurance of more experienced marksmen. But the Feldschiessen — or field shooting competition, in English — is not just a recreational pursuit. It is anchored in a deep sense of civic responsibility and national pride in this Alpine nation of 8.5 million. Mandatory military service for males, for instance, is considered the pinnacle of patriotic duty. Guns in Switzerland are seen as more than just a safeguard of neutrality and national security. More than any other Europeans, the Swiss pride themselves on their ability to manage their gun culture in a controlled and organized manner. But now that culture is facing an existential threat from abroad. On May 19, the Swiss will vote on whether to keep their cherished shooting traditions intact, or submit to stricter gun regulations required by the European Union. After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, when 130 people were killed mostly by gunfire, the E.U. restricted certain semi-automatic firearms and magazines, and made the purchase, licensing, and registration of weapons more onerous. While Switzerland doesn’t belong to the E.U., it is part of the bloc’s Schengen zone that can be visited without a visa or passport by citizens of 26 European nations — and so Brussels is urging the country to comply with its laws. If Switzerland votes to refuse, it might be excluded from the Schengen zone, along with the tourism revenue and police and judicial support membership brings. That’s why the government and most political parties here are urging voters to accept E.U.’s regulations in the nationwide ballot on Sunday. If approved by the electorate, the government argues on its website, the new law “will not change Swiss gun traditions,” including the ability to keep military weapons in soldiers’ homes, a custom dating back to WWII, when every man had to be armed and ready to defend his country at a moment’s notice.",Switzerland Loves Guns.

Cuba announced new rations on food and hygiene products on May 10, stoking fears of a worsening economic crisis. limited supply Cuba’s Interior Commerce Minister, Betsy Díaz Velázquez, said the country would start restricting the purchase of basics such as chicken, rice, beans and hygiene products like soap, to ensure “equal distribution” for all. Rationing had already begun in some parts of Cuba, and shoppers have complained for weeks of empty shelves and long lines. But the new policy will apply across the country and likely have a particularly intense effect on Cuba’s burgeoning private businesses, which often rely on state-run stores for supplies because of the government’s domination of imports and exports. from afar Those imports are at the heart of the problem.

The bearded, bespectacled activist is sometimes confused with his political opposite, the ISIS leader of the same name. (His Twitter page announces, Not that Baghdadi.) But the men at the door were there for a different kind of danger. The officers flashed their badges and got to the point: Baghdadi’s life, they told him, could be at risk. They urged him to come with them right away. Followed by a second team watching for tails, Baghdadi was driven by the officers to a safe location with an electronically shielded room where the agents told the longtime democracy activist what was going on.

The fight is about more than just a group of exiled dissidents standing up against one Middle Eastern tyrant. Some experts in national security view the unfolding battle as part of a larger, defining war of our time: the contest for control of information. “What’s happening in Saudi Arabia today is seen by an increasing number of governments around the world as a road map for how the future will look,” says Bill Marczak of Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity and human-rights investigative project at the University of Toronto. That helps explain why the Saudi threats have drawn the attention of international authorities. The U.N. official charged with investigating and reporting extrajudicial executions, Agnès Callamard, has called for urgent action to protect the safety of individuals she says are directly threatened by Riyadh. “I have sent appeals to two governments regarding information I had received of credible threats against individuals in their jurisdictions,” Callamard tells TIME, “asking them to take all necessary steps to protect them and their families.” Callamard says she wants “all governments” to be on the lookout for similar, unreported threats. In the U.S., House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff tells TIME his committee is investigating the latest Saudi threats and will “consider what actions the U.S. should take in response.” The new threats illuminate Khashoggi’s extraordinary legacy. He started his dissident effort hesitantly, a review of text messages and other communications made available to TIME reveals. By the fall of 2018, when he traveled to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to make arrangements for his upcoming marriage, Khashoggi was discreetly but deeply involved in projects involving a loose network of pro-democracy and human-rights activists around the globe, including Baghdadi and others. It was in Istanbul that the Saudi death squad lay in wait, but if Khashoggi’s horrific murder was intended to cow other activists, it had the opposite effect. “The attention that was given to Jamal’s case definitely reignited the hope for a lot of Arab dissidents to just be more active, in general,” said Mohamed Soltan, an Egyptian-American human-rights activist and a Khashoggi friend who spent nearly two years in a Cairo prison. “It gave people so much more courage to be more outspoken.” The dissidents’ projects have endeavored to reclaim social media—especially Twitter, the most influential public forum in the Saudi political universe—as an open space for political dissent. Authoritarians like the crown prince fight back with electronic surveillance and domination of social media. Experts at detecting spyware infections in mobile phones report “a new wave of suspicious occurrences among Saudi activists that are not easily explained other than by the presence of hacking or surveillance,” says Marczak, who works with Saudi dissidents.",'Saudi Arabia Wants to Stop My Work.'

950,Hillary Leung,"Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, one of the student leaders of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, was sent back to prison Thursday after losing an appeal against a contempt of court conviction. Wong, 22, was sentenced to three months in prison in January 2018 for defying a court order to leave a demonstration site during the 2014 rallies. Wong, then just a 17-year-old student, was at the forefront of the sit-ins that brought major roads in Hong Kong to a standstill for nearly three months as demonstrators called for greater political autonomy in the semi-autonomous Chinese enclave. After initially being held for six days, Wong was released on bail pending his appeal. Wong, who had sought to have the conviction overturned, now faces a reduced, two-month sentence to be served immediately, according to court documents. On Twitter, the activist confirmed that he will be “returning to jail for five additional weeks.” Wong was previously convicted of unlawful assembly and sentenced to six months in prison on a separate unlawful assembly charge. After spending two months, including his 21st birthday, in a prison cell, Wong was released when an appeals court threw out the sentence. Over 100 people have been convicted for their involvement in the 2014 protest movement, according to a local activist’s count. Most of the convictions were for non-violent offenses. Last month, eight Hong Kong activists were handed sentences of up to 16 months for their involvement in organizing the demonstrations, a verdict that some fear reflects a bid to quash dissent after the protests proved a formidable challenge to Beijing’s authority.",Hong Kong Activist Joshua Wong Sent Back to Prison After Losing Appeal,"May 16, 2019"
951,Hillary Leung,"Campaigners in support of Palestinians are calling for Airbnb users to deactivate their accounts to protest the company’s decision to allow rental listings for settlements in the occupied West Bank. In April, the company reversed its decision to delist the properties following pressure from Israel, Agence France-Press reports. Airbnb had previously announced that it would remove the listings. The Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy (PIPD) and Jewish Voice for Peace were among the organizations calling for a boycott. “Ultimately we would like Airbnb to reverse its decision but we know that won’t be easy,” Salem Barahmeh, executive director of PIPD, told AFP, adding that he hopes the pressure would stop international companies from being “complicit in supporting war crimes and Israeli settlements.” In January, Amnesty International denounced travel companies including Airbnb, Expedia and TripAdvisor for operating in Israeli settlements, which it said contributes to and profits from the settlements. Airbnb’s April statement said that while the company would not be removing its listings, it would be giving the profits to non-profit organizations. Pro-Palestinian campaigners argue that it still brings profits to the settlers. The protest coincides with the anniversary of the 1948 Palestinian exodus, also known as the Nakba or “the Catastrophe,” during which more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes during the Arab-Israeli War.

955,Tara Law,"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that she does “not understand” why the United States has failed to change its gun laws in the aftermath of mass shootings. Speaking with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, Ardern noted that even though her county has a strong hunting culture and had “pretty permissive gun legislation,” most New Zealanders agreed after the Christchurch attack it was necessary to “draw the line.” On April 10, less than a month after a white supremacist terrorist shot and killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, the country’s parliament voted 119 to one to pass gun control legislation that banned most of the country’s automatic and semiautomatic weapons. Ardern said while there is a “practical purpose and use for guns,” at the same time, “that does not mean you need access to military-style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles. You do not. And New Zealanders by and large absolutely agreed with that position.” She also compared New Zealand’s legislation to the laws passed in Australia in the aftermath of the 1996 Port Arthur shooting, in which a gunman murdered 35 people at a Tasmania tourist attraction. In both countries, Ardern said, single massacres were enough to galvanize the public to support gun control. “Australia experienced a massacre and changed their laws. New Zealand had its experience and changed its laws. To be honest with you, I do not understand the United States,” Ardern said. In 2019 alone, the United States has undergone 122 mass shootings according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as four or more people besides the shooter being killed or injured. Four of the five deadliest mass shootings in American history have taken place since 2012, including the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino shooting of Oct. 1, 2017, in which 59 people were killed and more than 500 were injured.

956,Mahita Gajanan,"President Donald Trump’s trade war with China could cost the average American family of four up to $2,300 a year, according to a report on the effect of tariffs on the U.S. economy and workers. The study, by the economic consulting firm Trade Partnership Worldwide, assesses how tariffs will affect American consumers and the economy. According to the report, an average American family of four would pay $2,300 more in goods and services each year if Trump imposes a 25% tariff on all goods from China, as he has repeatedly threatened. If tariff levels remain where they are today, the average American family is expected to pay about $770 in higher costs each year the tariffs remain in place, says Laura Baughman, a co-author of the study and president at Trade Partnerships Worldwide. The findings come as Trump and China have both escalated the trade dispute in recent days. As U.S. and Chinese negotiations met in Washington last week, Trump announced that he was raising tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China responded with a plan to increase tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. exports. Then, on Monday, the Trump Administration outlined plans to impose additional tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, providing a list of products that include apparel, children’s toys, crafting products, sports equipment and shoes. That amounts to tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports.  The U.S. imported almost $540 billion in goods from China in 2018, while exporting $120 billion. Meanwhile, the U.S. imported $18 billion in services from China in 2018, while exporting almost $59 billion, though services are not directly affected by tariffs. Researchers calculated the cost of the trade war on families by estimating the total value of the increased price of goods and services after the tariffs are implemented and dividing that by the average number of families of four. They found that costs will skyrocket if Trump follows through on his threat to extend the tariffs to other goods, including apparel, footwear and consumer electronics. The costs were calculated for one to three years after the tariffs take effect. But that just takes into account the increased cost of buying things produced in China. Baughman says the total economic costs on American families will be far higher––the result of a combination of job losses, slower economic growth and a drop in exports due to China’s retaliatory tariffs. “There’s a ripple effect to this because of tariffs,” she says. “If you look at the sectors, the big job losses are in services because it’s about people not going out to dinner, putting off surgery or not using Uber or the subway because they’re not going to the office anymore.” The tariffs Trump has already imposed are both widespread and steep enough that importers will have to pass on at least some of the increased costs to consumers. There will also be knock-on effects, says Baughman.","Trump's Trade War With China Could Cost the Average Family Up to $2,300 a Year, Report Estimates","May 14, 2019"
957,Billy Perrigo,"With WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange likely about to face two separate extradition requests — one already made by the United States on hacking charges, another likely from Sweden related to a recently reopened rape case — his future is less clear than ever. If Sweden makes a fresh extradition request, the decision over what to do with Assange — who’s currently sitting in a London prison — will fall to U.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid. In such an event, under U.K. law, Javid would have to weigh specific legal criteria to make his decision. They are: Those criteria, however, are broad and leave space for individual judgment. “The Secretary of State has to follow the law; it is highly likely that there will a legal challenge if he doesn’t,” says Katherine Tyler, a leading extradition lawyer at London law firm Kingsley Napley. The point of contention, Tyler predicts, is likely to be the relative seriousness of each offense. Both sides could argue that their case is more urgent than the other. “It’s hard to predict how the Secretary of State will weigh up the seriousness of each allegation. The accusation of rape, being an offense against the person, is a very different kind of allegation to the password cracking accusation which, in this context, will be said to be a political matter,” she says. Sweden has not yet re-issued a formal extradition request for Assange. But given the nature of the allegations there, some lawmakers are already pressuring Javid to bow to Sweden’s request, if it makes one. “Allegations of sexual violence in Sweden should clearly take precedence,” wrote opposition Labour Party lawmaker Dawn Butler in a letter to Javid on Monday. “The U.K. Government should send a clear message that we are committed to tackling sexual violence.” There’s the matter of timing as well. If Sweden issues another extradition request, it would come on a later date than the U.S. request, which was made public shortly after Assange was arrested in April. However, Sweden issued a previous request for Assange’s extradition back in 2010, before he took refuge in Ecuador’s embassy. In 2017, the Swedish case was closed and the extradition request nullified, with prosecutors saying Assange’s whereabouts made further investigation impossible. But if the matter came to the courts, both sides could reasonably argue their extradition request came first. Home Secretary Javid, a leading contender for beleaguered Prime Minister Theresa May’s job, has cultivated an image of a hardliner. He welcomed Assange’s arrest at the Ecuadorian embassy in London last month, and last year refused to seek assurances from the U.S. that two suspected ISIS members would not be executed if extradited — a violation of convention in the U.K., where the death penalty is illegal. (Capital punishment is not on the table for Assange, who faces U.S. charges of conspiring to gain access to a government computer with a maximum sentence of five years, though experts say the U.S. may unseal more serious charges at a later date.) Geopolitics may play a role as well. Assange’s arrest comes at a time of increased bilateral tensions between the U.K. and the U.S., with the Trump Administration frustrated with May’s resistance to block 5G wireless infrastructure made by Chinese telecom firm Huawei from the U.K. market. If anything is certain, it’s that Assange may not leave the U.K. any time soon. “Contested extradition hearings can take a long time,” says Tyler. “I would expect the U.S. request alone to take in the region of a year to 18 months; were there to be an additional request from Sweden, consideration of how to deal with this is likely to make the overall process longer still.”",Julian Assange Could Face Extradition Requests From 2 Countries.

958,Ciara Nugent,"The reporting for this project was supported by the Pulitzer Center It’s hard to grasp the scale of El Salvador’s problem with gender violence. In the Central American country of just six million people, one woman was the victim of a femicide — a man murdering of a woman or girl because of her gender — every 24 hours in 2018. That’s one of the worst rates of femicide in the world, according to the United Nations. Sixty-seven percent of Salvadoran women have suffered some form of violence in their lifetime, including sexual assault, intimate partner violence and abuse by family members,  a 2017 national survey found. But only 6% of victims had reported abuse to authorities. (In the U.S., more than half of domestic violence incidents are believed to be reported to police, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.) Advocates say many fear repercussions for speaking out, aren’t able to access public services to report, or simply don’t consider violent treatment unusual. “El Salvador is a country with so much gang violence, so much brutality, so many murders, that nobody pays attention to violence against women,” says Almudena Toral, a filmmaker who traveled with reporter Patricia Clarembaux to report on the situation for TIME and Univision. There were 51 murders for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2018, the second highest in Latin America after crisis-stricken Venezuela. “It’s invisible in this huge ocean of violence.” From September 2018, Toral and Clarembaux followed María, a woman seeking asylum in the U.S. after a lifetime of gender-based violence in El Salvador. When she was 12, a gang member forced her to become his girlfriend. Three years later, having had two of his children and faced constant abuse and death threats, María attempted suicide, nearly becoming a victim of a crime El Salvador calls “femicide suicide.” El Salvador is the only country in the world with a law against “femicide suicide” — the crime of driving a woman or girl to suicide by abusing them. The law, enacted in 2012 as part of broader legislation seeking to curb violence against women, is a striking recognition by the government of the psychological damage suffered by victims and the need to hold perpetrators accountable. According to government statistics, 51 of the 285 femicides that occurred in the first six months of 2018 were suicides. The majority of cases affect women and girls under 24. In 2018 El Salvador’s attorney general announced the creation of a new unit to oversee crimes related to violence against women, girls, LGBTQI people and other groups vulnerable to violence. Authorities do seem to be slowly managing to turn the tide. Total femicides fell 20% between 2017 and 2018, to 383. And in the first four months of 2019, 30% fewer women died by femicide than in the same period last year. But that still means that by April, 76 women and girls were killed just for being female. Impunity remains an obstacle in a country where prosecutors live in fear of retaliation from perpetrators of violence. According to the U.N., only a quarter of femicide cases make it to court and only 7% result in convictions. And, since the femicide-suicide law came in, only 60 cases have been investigated and only one has resulted in charges. “There are good laws, and good intentions from prosecutors,” Toral says. “But there’s also a lot of corruption, a failure to report, a lack of resources. You have to ask, in the end how much are laws worth on their own?”",Violence Against Women in El Salvador Is Driving Them to Suicide — Or to the U.S. Border,"May 14, 2019"
959,Alana Semuels,"For nearly a century, the St. Pierre Manufacturing Corp. has made steel products like horseshoes, tire chains and wire ropes in a facility in Worcester, Mass. Yet, despite the strong economy, St. Pierre, like many other American manufacturers, is struggling. Its problems stem from President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made goods. The ongoing trade war “makes it a heck of a lot harder to compete,” says Peter St. Pierre, the company’s vice president of finance and operations and a grandson of founder Henry St. Pierre. Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum more than a year ago, later adding them on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. On May 10, as negotiations on a wider deal with China faltered, he said some tariffs would increase to 25% from 10%. His rationale is twofold: dissuading Americans from buying Chinese exports is meant to put some teeth behind trade-deal talks, with the added benefit of helping domestic companies by pushing consumers to buy American. “The Tariffs can be completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea)” he wrote in a Twitter thread about China. “Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff,” he continued in a separate thread on Tuesday. Yet St. Pierre and its peers say that are hurt by the tariffs even though they do make their products in the United States, exposing one of the central challenges of the way the Trump Administration is waging its trade war. Though the debate over tariffs is practically an American institution, global trade today is a different beast than it was in the early 19th century, when tariffs on some imported materials helped jump-start the American textile industry. American manufacturers have been sourcing products and parts from around the world for decades, and today it is nearly impossible — not to mention extremely expensive — for companies to extract themselves from that global supply chain. “In the last 20 years, businesses have become much more strategic,” says Kara Reynolds, an economics professor at American University. “More and more often, they are looking at where they can find the highest quality and lowest-cost parts so that they can be competitive.” As a result, an escalating trade war could isolate American manufacturers, quarantining companies and consumers from the increasing prosperity that’s come with a globalized economy. The rest of the world meanwhile continues to trade unencumbered. The steel and aluminum tariffs have already hit American manufacturers across industries. Heavy-equipment makers like Caterpillar, beer sellers like Anheuser-Busch and automakers like General Motors all say costs have surged because of increased prices on those materials. (The Trump Administration lifted tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico on May 17, but the market is expected to remain tight.) Meanwhile, thousands of products, from seafood to electronics, are affected by the May 10 increase. “Almost no company isn’t going to import something from China,” said Michael J. Hicks, an economics professor at Indiana’s Ball State University. The push to “Buy American” is as old as the nation itself. George Washington boasted of wearing “homespun” clothes to his Inauguration as a dig at the British, says Dana Frank, a professor emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and author of Buy American: The Untold Story of Economic Nationalism. (Washington’s clothes were made by his slaves.) That rhetoric has resurfaced in moments of nativism — in the wake of rising anti-immigrant sentiment in the 1920s and 1930s, for example, Frank says. But in the aftermath of World War II, when the U.S. emerged as the strongest economy in the world, consumers and businesses alike concluded that protectionism might make it harder to sell overseas too. So they embraced free trade and the opportunity to send American products to countries whose own economies were in ruins. The world bought U.S.-made goods; manufacturers prospered; labor unions negotiated good deals for American workers. Global supply chains were established as early as the 1960s. By the time yet another “buy American” campaign peaked in the early 1990s, in part a response to Japanese-made cars having gained significant market share in the U.S., Frank says, “that train had already left the station.”",Trump Wants You to Buy American.

The observatory’s sensors registered carbon dioxide levels of 415 parts per million (ppm) on Saturday, meaning CO2 made up 415 of ever 1 million molecules of gas in the atmosphere. CO2 – which is emitted when we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas – is a greenhouse gas which traps heat in the earth’s atmosphere, contributing to the global temperature increases which drives climate change. The concentration of CO2 has been rising by an average of 2.5 ppm over the last decade. But the increase from 2018 to 2019 will likely be around 3ppm, Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps C02 program which runs the Manua Loa Observatory, said in a statement. “Every year it goes up like this we should be saying ‘No, this shouldn’t be happening. It’s not normal,” Keeling said. “This increase is just not sustainable in terms of energy use and in terms of what we are doing to the planet.” This is the first time in human history that the concentration of the gas has topped 415 ppm, meteorologist Eric Holthaus warned on Twitter. The last time the proportion of CO2 was this this high was during the Pliociene period between 5.3 and 2.6 million years ago. Back then, the Earth was a very different place, with a much warmer climate. Average sea levels are thought to have been around 50 ft higher than they are today and forests grew as far north as the Arctic, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University told NBC.

963,"Anna-Catherine Brigida / Tesoro, Guatemala","Tránsito Gutiérrez remembers her 16-year-old son telling her in April that there was no sign of rain. He had good reason to think so: the family, which lives in a small, remote subsistence farming community only accessible by a winding dirt road, had lost all of its maize and beans in 2017 and 2018 after an unusual drought. This year, experts predict similar conditions. Worried about another bad year, Juan de León Gutierrez decided his family could no longer rely on agriculture.  “What I want to do is leave,” he told his mom, who recalled the conversation with him in an interview with TIME at the family’s home. As she spoke, Juan’s younger siblings wandered in and out of the small house, which has adobe walls and a tin roof. The oldest, a 14-year-old boy, still had the frame of a child years younger, as does Juan in photos. Malnutrition often stunts the growth of children in their community of mainly indigenous Mayan Ch’orti’ in Guatemala’s Dry Corridor, a hot and arid area spanning parts of Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua that is home to more than 10.5 million people.  Juan spent most days toiling the fields with his father, tending the maize, beans, and coffee plants the family grew on their modest plot of land. His grandfather and great-grandfather had done the same. When the school year rolled around, he would often beg his mother to scrounge up the $130 needed to continue studying, a privilege his own parents never had. But this spring, Juan said he wanted to migrate to the U.S. to reunite with his 25-year-old brother in Miami, who has lived and worked there since 2011. She tried to convince him to stay, but eventually gave in, aware she could offer him little more. On April 4, with no clouds in sight, he left home with another friend and a coyote (a smuggler) who would guide them. Fifteen days later, the teenager was apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol near El Paso after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a statement from Guatemala’s Foreign Ministry. He was transferred to a local hospital after a doctor at a government shelter noticed he was sick. AP reported that he was released and hospitalized again a day later. Doctors detected an infection in his brain known as Pott’s puffy tumor that could have been caused by an untreated sinus infection or head trauma. What caused Juan’s infection is still unknown. Doctors operated to try to save his life. On April 30, de León Gutiérrez died. “He went seeking life, but found death,” says his father, Tanerjo de León. De León Gutiérrez is the third Guatemalan minor to die in U.S. custody in six months. In December, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin died from a bacterial infection hours after being taken in Border Patrol custody. Less than two weeks later, 8-year-old Felipe Gómez Alonzo died of flu complications after being apprehended by Border Patrol and transferred to a holding cell. The deaths sparked questions about the quality of medical care for migrant children in U.S. custody and the conditions in the facilities where they are held. After the deaths of Caal Maquin and Gómez Alonzo, Customs and Border Protection ordered mandatory medical checks for minors. Nevertheless, the Trump Administration continues to push Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to enact harsher policies. On May 5, President Donald Trump nominated immigration hardliner and former FBI agent Mark Morgan to lead ICE. The deaths have also highlighted the reasons Guatemalans are leaving — and what could be done to help them stay. From October 2018 to April 2019, more than 165,000 Guatemalans were apprehended at the U.S southern border, a record-high number of apprehensions and roughly 1 percent of the country’s population. Guatemalans are now the group most frequently apprehended at the border, surpassing Mexico, a country with a population more than 7 times larger than Guatemala’s. There are many reasons for leaving, and poverty, corruption, violence, food insecurity and lack of economic opportunities all play a role. In the Dry Corridor, in particular, climate change is a major driving force of migration. By 2050, climate change could displace as many as 140 million people in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, according to the World Bank. “Here we live [climate change] and every day we feel it more,” says Edwin Orellano, Municipal Monitor of the Secretariat of Food and Nutritional Security (SESAN), a Guatemalan government agency that coordinates responses to food insecurity.",‘He Went Seeking Life But Found Death.’ How a Guatemalan Teen Fleeing Climate Change Ended Up Dying in a U.S. Detention Center,"May 13, 2019"
964,Todd White and Randall Jensen / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — U.S. stocks sank, with contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding as much as 460 points, after China retaliated with higher tariffs on a range of American goods. Treasuries jumped with the yen on demand for haven assets. The S&P 500 headed for the biggest decline since March after China targeted some of the nation’s biggest exporters. Boeing Co. and Caterpillar Inc. each fell more than 3%, while Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. lost at least 1.8%. Soybeans plunged 2% and cotton prices sank more than 3%. The dollar erased gains and 10-year Treasury yields fell to the lowest level since late March. The yen also rose. Oil climbed as Saudi Arabia said two of its tankers were “sabotaged.” Risk assets had been under pressure all morning after President Donald Trump warned China not to retaliate after the latest round of American measures. The selling picked up when China said it will raise tariffs starting June 1. An unverified Twitter post purportedly by China’s Global Times suggested the possibility of selling some of Treasuries holdings. The escalation comes after talks ended last week in a stalemate, with no timeline for future discussions. The Stoxx Europe 600 index was dragged into the red as almost every industry sector retreated, extending declines as the European Union said it was finalizing a list of U.S. goods to target in the event Trump imposes levies on car imports. Investors are struggling to find positive catalysts for risk assets after the U.S. stepped up punitive tariffs on $200 billion in annual imports from China, and Trump started his Monday morning threatening that the trade standoff will “get worse” if there’s retaliation. While both economic superpowers have also worked hard since talks ended Friday to project calm and emphasize that they plan to continue negotiations, markets seem to sense fundamental divisions between the two sides. On Monday, American officials are expected to announce details of their plans to boost tariffs on all remaining imports from China — some $300 billion in trade. Chinese state media blamed the U.S. for a lack of progress in trade talks while emphasizing the Asian nation’s economic resilience. Elsewhere, Bitcoin climbed above $7,000 as the recent gains in cryptocurrencies extended over the weekend. Most base metals retreated as traders reassessed the demand outlook given the threats to global economic growth.

965,Bloomberg,"The emerging stalemate in U.S.-China trade negotiations reflects a breakdown in trust and widening differences that are unlikely to be resolved soon. President Donald Trump on Monday again accused China of backing out of a deal that was taking shape with U.S. officials, saying Beijing reneged on an agreement to enshrine a wide range of reforms in Chinese law. That dispute grew out of an earlier deadlock over how and when to remove existing American tariffs that provoked Beijing to threaten quit the talks, people briefed on the discussions said. “I say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don’t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “You had a great deal, almost completed, & you backed out!” Both the U.S. and China had tried to project calm since the latest round of discussions ended on Friday and said that they plan to continue negotiations in the hopes of avoiding a tumble in markets and broader economic damage. But that facade masks fundamental divisions, with U.S. officials increasingly convinced that hardliners in Beijing are winning the internal debate on reforms. As China considers how to respond to higher U.S. tariffs, Trump suggested that China would only be harming its own economy if the country responds with more punitive measures on American products. “China should not retaliate — will only get worse!” he tweeted. Meantime, Chinese state media blamed the U.S. for the impasse and talked up its economic resilience, with the People’s Daily saying in a front-page commentary that the U.S. should take full responsibility for the setbacks because it went back on its word and imposed more levies. The ongoing uncertainty means more turmoil for financial markets: Stocks in Asia fell along with U.S. and European equity futures, the yuan and Treasury yields. The latest breakdown has prompted an escalation in the tariff war between the world’s two largest economies that looks increasingly like the International Monetary Fund and others’ worst-case scenario for a global economy already forecast to grow this year at its slowest rate since the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.",Trump's China Trade Talks Head for Stalemate As Trust Fades,"May 13, 2019"
966,Alejandro de la Garza,"White House Chief Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow seemed to contradict President Donald Trump on Sunday, admitting that Trump’s increasing tariffs on Chinese goods will put an economic burden on American consumers and businesses. Kudlow sat for an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday where he said that both the U.S. and China will suffer consequences from the tariffs. “In fact, both sides will pay,” he said. In recent days, Trump has characterized his tariffs as being paid for largely by China, expressly saying that the economic rival will be the most affected. “The tariffs paid to the U.S.A. have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China,” the President said in a pair of tweets last week. The President additionally said that China primarily foots the bill for the tariffs in a press conference last week. “Our country can take in $120 billion a year in tariffs, paid for mostly by China, by the way, not by us,” Trump said. “A lot of people try to steer it in a different direction. Ultimately it’s paid for largely by China.” In the Fox News Sunday interview, Wallace pointedly questioned Kudlow on the facts of how tariffs work. “But Larry, that isn’t true,” Wallace said about the President’s assertions. “It’s not China that pays the tariffs, it’s the American importers, the American companies that pay what, in effect, is a tax increase and often passes it off to U.S. consumers.”",White House Economic Advisor Contradicts President Trump on Who Actually Pays for the Tariffs on China,"May 12, 2019"
967,Golnar Motevalli / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Iran’s parliament struck a blow for women’s rights by overwhelmingly voting to confer citizenship on children born to an Iranian mother and foreign father. Currently, children of “mixed marriages” are only eligible for citizenship if their Iranian parent is a man. If the decision is approved by the Guardian Council, a powerful body of senior clerics and judges, then the offspring of mixed marriages would be eligible for citizenship, regardless of whether their mother or father is the Iranian national. The parliamentary vote was reported Sunday by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Such a law would represent a significant development for women’s rights in Iran, with possible implications for the wider region, where many countries don’t give women the right to pass on citizenship to their children if the father is a foreign national. It would also give tens of thousands of children access to social and health care services. Iran’s vice president for women’s and family affairs said the current legislation, dating back to 1934, was written at a time “when women were considered chattel.” “Today, when women have gained dignity, respect and a high level of education and status in the country, on the basis of what logic are we depriving a woman the right to transfer the citizenship that’s in her blood on to her child?” Masoumeh Ebtekar said, according to IRNA.

969,Nick Wadhams and Ilya Arkhipov / Bloomberg,"U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo leaves for Moscow on Sunday, with President Donald Trump again calling for improved ties now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finished his investigation. Pompeo will meet U.S. diplomats at the American Embassy in Moscow on Monday before continuing to Sochi for talks with President Vladimir Putin and other senior officials. The secretary has 48 hours — the entire length of the trip — to cram in discussions of disputes between the two nations, involving Ukraine, Venezuela and Syria and other issues, along with continued accusations of election interference. With the Mueller inquiry wrapped up, Trump has returned to signaling his interest in improving U.S.-Russia ties, speaking with Putin for more than an hour last week and tweeting that there is “tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia.” The two leaders had kept their distance as Mueller’s probe into the 2016 U.S. election and allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia heated up. “Clearly since the Mueller report came out, Trump is feeling unconstrained about what he’s wanted all along — a new relationship with Moscow where all the bad issues get swept aside and the two leaders ‘get down to business,”’ said Andrew Weiss, the former director for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian Affairs on the National Security Council who’s now a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “What that means in practice is really fuzzy because the agenda largely consists of issues where the U.S. and Russia are at loggerheads,” Weiss said. Trump spoke with Putin briefly on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Argentina in December. That meeting rekindled criticism of their summit last July in Helsinki, where the American president appeared to take Putin’s side over the conclusions of his own intelligence agencies when asked about evidence Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Pompeo could use his trip to start laying the groundwork for a meeting between Trump and Putin on the sidelines of a Group of 20 forum in Japan set for late June. Such an encounter would still be fraught, especially since Trump has appeared reluctant to confront Putin on the meddling accusations, which the Mueller report reaffirmed. “The Mueller report confirmed accusations of Russian meddling,” said Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a Kremlin-founded think tank. “The report to some extent rehabilitates Trump but doesn’t rehabilitate Moscow at all.

970,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: A little over a month ago, Turkey held local elections. For the first time in more than twenty years, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lost the mayoralty of Istanbul, the city where Erdogan himself once presided as mayor. Erdogan took the loss hard and refused to accept the results. Earlier this week, Turkey’s Supreme Electoral Board annulled the results and ordered the race to be run again on June 23rd. Why It Matters: While this is not Erdogan’s first attempt to bend Turkish democracy to his will after nearly two decades in power, it is his most brazen. Facing party term limits, Erdogan pushed a referendum in 2017 to rewrite the country’s constitution to create the executive presidency he currently holds, one much less accountable to Turkey’s parliament. Critics decried that move, lamenting the erosion of Turkey’s democratic institutions; you’ll be hearing lots more about the state of Turkey’s democracy between now and June 23rd. The results of the March 31 election were extremely close, but the opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) pulled out the victory by a slim margin of 13,000 votes. This was despite Erdogan using his control of Turkish media to limit the exposure of opposition candidates and a concerted messaging effort by the AKP to convince voters that a vote for any non-AKP candidate was a vote for Turkey’s enemies. In the wake of the loss, Erdogan and his party accused foreign conspirators of appointing the people who worked at the polling stations to insure the AKP lost Istanbul’s mayoralty. The country’s electoral board annulled the election results for Istanbul’s mayor’s race based on the AKP’s claim that not all the people who were charged with overseeing election at the polls were civil servants, even though that’s common in Turkey. Interestingly, the Electoral Board did not order a rerun for district and provincial council election results which were overseen by the same people… but were races that the AKP and its coalition partner won. The reaction of international markets was swift—within 24 hours, Turkey’s currency plunged more than 3 percent to a 7-month low and the yield on government-issued bonds ticked upward. Europe was not pleased by the development, either—in a striking joint statement, the EU’s Foreign Affairs and Enlargement Commissioners stated that “the justification for this far-reaching decision, taken in a highly politicised context, should be made available for public scrutiny without delay. Ensuring a free, fair and transparent election process is essential to any democracy and is at the heart of the European Union’s relations with Turkey.” They are now calling for international observers to oversee the rerun—let’s just say they don’t have much confidence in Erdogan’s commitment to a democratic result that doesn’t go his way.

971,Megan Durisin / Bloomberg,"President Donald Trump said that the U.S. will boost its purchases of domestic farm products for humanitarian aid in an effort to offset lost demand from China as trade tensions flare between the nations. Trump said on Twitter on Friday that the U.S. will use its money from the tariffs to buy American agricultural products “in larger amounts than China ever did” and send it to “poor & starving countries” for humanitarian aid. The president indicated potential purchases of $15 billion from farmers. Soybean and grain futures held mostly steady after the announcements. “In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!” Trump said on Twitter. “Our farmers will do better, faster and starving nations can now be helped.” Soybean and grain futures plunged this week as U.S. trade talks faltered with China, the world’s top oilseed buyer, and the Asian nation vowed retaliation as the U.S. boosted tariffs on $200 billion in goods. On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean, corn and wheat futures for July delivery were little changed at 8 a.m. local time. In the 2017 fiscal year, the U.S. gave 3.12 million tons of foreign food aid valued at $3.62 million, according to a report from the U.S. Agency for International Development. Trump’s tweets didn’t provide details on which government agency might be involved in purchases from farmers or aid. “To buy humanitarian aid is not that simple,” Louise Gartner, owner of Spectrum Commodities in New Richmond, Ohio, said in a telephone interview. “I’m sure the market has seen those tweets, and they’re not thinking much of it.” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in April that he wasn’t aware of any additional aid under discussion for farmers. In 2018, the U.S. administration said it would deliver as much as $12 billion to farmers after Beijing slapped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products.

So the park manager took matters into his own hands, with the hopes of keeping dealers that might intimidate visitors away from the park entrance. “This method has purely practical reasoning behind it,” Cengiz Demirci told local radio station RBB, according to the Guardian. “It’s not that we’re legalizing the selling of drugs.” Demirci said that many of the drug dealers are migrants who cannot work, and suggested that the problem might be solved if the government gave them work permits instead, according to the Guardian.

974,Justin Worland,"Few presidents have bragged as much about the stock market as Donald Trump. From the early days of his Administration, Trump has sought to boost Wall Street and take credit for any gains in the Dow. Now, as the President considers what would be his most significant escalation in trade tensions with China, experts say that he may be emboldened by the strength of the stock market, jobs numbers and other economic indicators. “At least part of the story is that economic and market strength has reduced both sides incentives’ to compromise,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research note this week. Trump’s latest threat to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods first came May 5 via Twitter and rattled observers who had expected positive news after weeks of what seemed like encouraging reports from the White House. The Administration said tariffs on $200 billion in goods increased from 10% to 25% just after midnight Friday when significant progress wasn’t made in trade talks. The Chinese Commerce Ministry vowed to take “necessary countermeasures” to the increased duties, which came even as Chinese and American negotiators met in Washington Thursday. The view that Trump is relying on the strength of the U.S. economy to outlast China in a trade war is shared by a range of banks and analysts and comes in large part from Trump’s own public remarks. The President has frequently cited the U.S. economy as a reason the country can endure a trade war. The U.S. experienced nearly 3% GDP growth last year while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, for instance, has expanded more than 30% since Trump took office. News last week that the U.S. unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since 1969 only bolsters the view of a strong economy. “We could have made a quickie, but we’re in a very good position,” Trump said in April, one of several times he has touted the U.S. economy as leverage for a deal. “Our economy is way up. China is not way up.” Trump has also referenced the economy in behind-the-scenes conversations with aides, pointing to its strength as evidence that they were wrong to condemn his trade policy from the start, according to a Republican official with knowledge of trade conversations.",The Economy Is Doing Well.

975,Josh Meyer,"The CIA and foreign security services are warning friends and colleagues of Jamal Khashoggi that their efforts to continue the pro-democracy work of the slain Saudi journalist has made them and their families the targets of potential retaliation from Saudi Arabia, according to individuals appraised of the threats and security sources in two countries. Three of those who were given security briefings in recent weeks––democracy advocates Iyad El-Baghdadi of Oslo, Norway; Omar Abdulaziz of Montreal, Canada; and a person in the U.S. who asked not to be named––were working closely with Khashoggi on politically sensitive media and human rights projects at the time of his killing inside a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey last October. Based on the security briefings, the advocates say they have been targeted because they have become especially vocal and influential critics of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, accusing him of ordering Khashoggi’s murder as part of a broader crackdown on Saudi dissidents worldwide. The CIA was the source of the threat warning, according to an overseas intelligence official, Baghdadi and others involved with the briefings. A CIA spokesperson declined to comment, but the agency has a legal “duty to warn” potential victims of specific threats including murder, kidnapping and serious bodily harm, according to a 2015 directive signed by the Director of National Intelligence. After Khashoggi was killed, the CIA faced criticism for failing to warn him after reportedly learning that the Crown Prince, known as MBS, had issued an earlier order to capture the journalist, who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post. The CIA later assessed with “medium-to-high confidence” that the Crown Prince ordered his death. The nature of the new threat was not specified. Neither Baghdadi nor Abdulaziz were told that they or their families were in physical danger, either now or in the future, according to people familiar with briefings. But Baghdadi said he was instructed to take a wide range of precautions, including preventive measures to make it harder to hack their electronic devices in order to leak and weaponize the information against them. That tactic was used by Saudi Arabia against Abdulaziz, who is suing an Israeli security company, NSO Group, for selling Saudi Arabia the malware that compromised his cell phone, a breach documented by the University of Toronto watchdog Citizenlab. The advocates were also advised to avoid travel to a wide swath of countries in Europe and Asia where Saudi Arabia has particular influence, and to move family members out of at least one particular country, Malaysia. The three men whose warnings were confirmed to TIME all work to influence public opinion both about and within Saudi Arabia, an arena that MBS has aggressively sought to control. Palestinian-born Baghdadi is renowned for his activism in the Arab Spring. He was granted political asylum in 2015 to Norway, where he edits the website Arab Tyrant Manual and has been working with investigators hired by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who owns the Post, to probe Saudi Arabia’s suspected role in a breach of Bezos’ cell phone. (The investigators concluded it did.) Abdulaziz is a Saudi dissident who was granted asylum in Canada. He has so substantial a following on Twitter that a McKinsey & Company report concluded that in 2015 he was one of the three people driving the conversation about a Saudi policy on the platform, which carries great weight in the kingdom. In 2017 Abdulaziz and Khashoggi collaborated on an effort to secretly undermine the Saudi crown’s grip on Twitter.

978,Ian Bremmer,"Read Aatish Taseer’s “Can the World’s Largest Democracy Endure Another Five Years of a Modi Government?” To win a fresh mandate for himself and his party in India’s upcoming elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made extravagant promises and worrisome threats. He can fairly be accused of fanning flames of hostility toward India’s Muslim population of up to 200 million, and when terrorists killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary troops in the disputed province of Kashmir earlier this year, Modi ordered airstrikes into Pakistani territory, a dangerous escalation by one nuclear-armed power against another. His economic record is mixed. Although India has become the world’s fastest-growing large economy, in January a leaked government survey (after the Modi government refused to release the data) showed the unemployment rate hit a 45-year high (6.1%) in 2017. To create a governing majority following the announcement of national election results later this month, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will probably have to find coalition partners. That, in turn, would water down some of his second-term plans. Yet, India still needs change, and Modi remains the person most likely to deliver. He has improved relations with China, the U.S. and Japan, but it’s his domestic development agenda that has done the most to improve the lives and prospects of hundreds of millions of people. Consider what he’s already accomplished during five years in charge. First, he’s ensured that the government has more revenue to spend. Thanks to the Goods and Services Tax enacted in 2017, Modi has streamlined an enormously complex system of state and federal tax collection, broadening the tax base and sharply reducing the amount of money lost to fraud. That’s a historic accomplishment in a country with so many development needs. Modi has directed unprecedented amounts of money toward the country’s seemingly endless need for new infrastructure. Construction of roads, highways, public transport and airports have sharply increased the country’s long-term economic potential. Although the process remains unfinished, the government has also brought electricity to remote villages that have never had it, a boon for economic potential, public safety and basic quality of life. The BJP-led government has also expanded a biometric identification system, begun under the previous Congress Party–led government, that has already taken iris scans and fingerprints from well over a billion people to help citizens prove who they are so they can receive services. It has provided bank accounts for 300 million people who have never had them, creating new opportunities for these people to access credit and state subsidies. It also brings them into the formal economy to potentially make the government more responsive to their needs. The government says these measures have cut sharply into waste and fraud within India’s welfare system, allowing the state to provide more and better services at a much lower cost. Health care reform could help half a billion poor people afford treatment for cancer and heart disease. A program known as Ujjwala Yojana has helped women in the countryside gain access to cooking gas for the first time. The Swachh Bharat program has built tens of millions of toilets for hundreds of millions of people. Modi’s commitment to renewable energy is part of his plan to make India a leader on climate change. None of these projects are complete, but all of them will help the vast majority of India’s people lead safer, healthier, more productive and more prosperous lives.",Modi Is India's Best Hope for Economic Reform,"May 9, 2019"
979,Aatish Taseer,"Read Ian Bremmer’s “Modi Is India’s Best Hope for Economic Reform” Of the great democracies to fall to populism, India was the first. In 2014, Narendra Modi, then the longtime chief minister of the western state of Gujarat and leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was elected to power by the greatest mandate the country had seen in 30 years. India until then had been ruled primarily by one party–the Congress, the party of Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru–for 54 of the 67 years that the country had been free. Now, India is voting to determine if Modi and the BJP will continue to control its destiny. It is a massive seven-phase exercise spread over 5½ weeks in which the largest electorate on earth–some 900 million–goes to the polls. To understand the deeper promptings of this enormous expression of franchise–not just the politics, but the underlying cultural fissures–we need to go back to the first season of the Modi story. It is only then that we can see why the advent of Modi is at once an inevitability and a calamity for India. The country offers a unique glimpse into both the validity and the fantasy of populism. It forces us to reckon with how in India, as well as in societies as far apart as Turkey and Brazil, Britain and the U.S., populism has given voice to a sense of grievance among majorities that is too widespread to be ignored, while at the same time bringing into being a world that is neither more just, nor more appealing. The story starts at independence. In 1947, British India was split in two. Pakistan was founded as a homeland for Indian Muslims. But India, under the leadership of its Cambridge-educated Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, chose not to be symmetrically Hindu. The country had a substantial Muslim population (then around 35 million, now more than 172 million), and the ideology Nehru bequeathed to the newly independent nation was secularism. This secularism was more than merely a separation between religion and state; in India, it means the equal treatment of all religions by the state, although to many of its critics, that could translate into Orwell’s maxim of some being more equal than others. Indian Muslims were allowed to keep Shari’a-based family law, while Hindus were subject to the law of the land. Arcane practices–such as the man’s right to divorce a woman by repudiating her three times and paying a minuscule compensation–were allowed for Indian Muslims, while Hindus were bound by reformed family law and often found their places of worship taken over by the Indian state. (Modi made the so-called Triple Talaq instant divorce a punishable offense through an executive order in 2018.) Nehru’s political heirs, who ruled India for the great majority of those post-independence years, established a feudal dynasty, while outwardly proclaiming democratic norms and principles. India, under their rule, was clubbish, anglicized and fearful of the rabble at the gates. In May 2014 those gates were breached when the BJP, under Modi, won 282 of the 543 available seats in Parliament, reducing the Congress to 44 seats, a number so small that India’s oldest party no longer even had the right to lead the opposition.   Populists come in two stripes: those who are of the people they represent (Erdogan in Turkey, Bolsonaro in Brazil), and those who are merely exploiting the passions of those they are not actually part of (the champagne neo-fascists: the Brexiteers, Donald Trump, Imran Khan in Pakistan). Narendra Modi belongs very firmly to the first camp. He is the son of a tea seller, and his election was nothing short of a class revolt at the ballot box. It exposed what American historian Anne Applebaum has described as “unresolvable divisions between people who had previously not known that they disagreed with one another.” There had, of course, been political differences before, but what Modi’s election revealed was a cultural chasm. It was no longer about left, or right, but something more fundamental.",Can the World's Largest Democracy Endure Another Five Years of a Modi Government?,"May 9, 2019"
980,Amy Gunia,"It looks like Australia’s central bank could use a proofreader. Some seven months into its circulation, a new $50 bill (worth roughly US$35) was found to have a tiny typo on it. The bill — which was designed with enhanced anti-counterfeiting features — misspells “responsibility” as “responsibilty” in fine print on its face, according to CNN. The Melbourne-based Triple M radio station posted photos of the typo on its social media accounts. Despite the error, the bills can still be utilized. According to CNN, about 46 million of the bills are already in circulation. “These banknotes are legal tender and can continue to be used as normal.

Edgar Zambrano reportedly refused to get out of his car when it was approached by intelligence agents. The car was towed, with him inside, to Caracas’ notorious El Helicoide prison, the Guardian reports. Zambrano was reportedly on the scene when opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who declared himself the interim president of Venezuela in January, called on the military to revolt against Maduro. Mass protests ensued with supporters from both sides taking to the streets, but a large scale military defection failed to materialize. “Edgar Zambrano has been detained.

982,Amy Gunia,"U.S. officials are pausing efforts to recover the remains of American solders who went missing in the Korean War, citing a lack of cooperation from North Korea after a failed summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jung Un in late February. “We have reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan, coordinate, and conduct field operations in the DPRK during this fiscal year,” the Department of Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) said in a statement to NPR. The DPAA’s fiscal year ends at the end of September. North Korea had been actively working with the U.S. on recovery efforts since U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jung Un discussed the topic at their historic first summit in Singapore last year. A week after the summit, North Korea handed over 55 boxes of remains to the U.N. But since Trump and Kim’s second summit in Hanoi ended abruptly with no deal, DPAA officials say their North Korean counterparts have stopped communicating, according to NPR. The DPAA says they are now “assessing possible next steps in resuming communications,” for the 2020 fiscal year according to NPR.

983,Rachel E. Greenspan,"Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, born Monday, May 6, is entitled to be the Earl of Dumbarton. But when Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex finally announced the royal baby’s name on Wednesday, there was no honorary title in sight. Archie, who was first introduced to the public Wednesday, is technically supposed to take on his father’s earldom, according to Marlene Koenig, an author and expert on British and European royalty. If the palace confirms that Archie will not be known as an earl, it means one thing: The Duke and Duchess wanted it that way. “This is just their attitude that they want a normal life for their children,” Koenig tells TIME. If he’s to be known as just Archie, and not Archie, Earl of Dumbarton — which is his father’s subsidiary (honorary) title — it’s another signal that his parents are going to uphold the family’s privacy. Now the closest to the throne in the male line without a title, it’s likely that Archie, who is seventh in line to the crown, will never have royal engagements, duties or patronages, Koenig says. Even though Queen Elizabeth II is the matriarch and leader of the family, this wasn’t her decision. “The Queen might not like it, but she’s pretty fair about what her family wants to do,” Koenig says. “She understands that [Harry and Meghan] will want to have a much more normal life.” It’s not the first move for privacy. In April, after months of speculation on where the Duchess would give birth—popular guesses included Frimley Hospital in Surrey or a home-birth at Frogmore Cottage—the public learned the birth plan would be kept private. “Their Royal Highnesses have taken a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private,” the royal family said in a statement. “The Duke and Duchess look forward to sharing the exciting news with everyone once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.” Days later, the royal family has not shared with avid royal fans where Meghan chose to give birth. Katie Nicholl, the author of Harry and Meghan: Life, Loss and Love, says the lack of a royal title “speaks volumes for the future they have planned,” but is also in no way surprising. She went on to say that Duchess’ American nationality has, for its part, already made a positive impact on the monarchy. “The marriage in itself signals change in so many ways,” Nicholl tells TIME. “We’ve seen them re-write the royal script, and I don’t see that ending as they become parents.”","Royal Baby Archie May Not Have a Royal Title, After All.

984,Mahita Gajanan,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, shared the news Wednesday that they named their new royal baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, hours after introducing him to the public earlier in the day. Unlike his cousins, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis — the children of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge — Archie will not be a prince, and will likely be referred to as Master Archie as he grows up. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s choice in name marks a step away from royal tradition and symbolizes an effort by the royal family to become modern, says Cleveland Evans, a former president of the American Name Society and psychology professor at Bellevue University. Archie is the nickname for Archibald, a name that dates back to Middle Ages-era Scotland. Meaning “genuine” and “bold.” Archibald was an aristocratic name in Scotland, Evans says. It’s not exactly the same case with its diminutive, Archie, which is a wildly popular name in the United Kingdom, according to Evans. In 2017, Archie was no. 18 on the top 100 boys’ names in England and Wales, he says. Similar sounding names like Alfie, Charlie, Freddie and Teddy have also ranked in the top name choices on the list. “The choice definitely shows their personality, but also to a certain extent, the changes in the royal family as a whole, where things have become — especially since Princess Diana’s death — more open,” Evans says, referring to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. “They probably want to modernize it and want the royal family to be seen as regular people, which is why they’d choose a name like Archie, which at the moment is a regular, everyday British boy’s name.” Archie’s second name, Harrison, which is typically used as a last name or surname, is also a bold choice for the royal couple, according to Evans. “It’s highly unique to the royal family that they would use something that is basically a surname as part of the child’s given name,” he says. The name Harrison comes from an English surname that means “son of Harry.”",Here's the Meaning Behind the Royal Baby's Surprisingly Popular Name Archie Harrison,"May 8, 2019"
985,Feliz Solomon,"The two figures were first spotted by a photographer who arrived early on the scene, with a telephoto lens through the gates of a Yangon prison on May 7. One man’s signature thick-rimmed glasses confirmed it: The award-winning Reuters journalists whose arrest had become a global cause were finally free. In the 511 days since their arrest, Wa Lone, 33, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, had become two of the world’s most visible symbols of the fight to protect press freedom. Last year, TIME included them among the “Guardians” named Person of the Year for their role fighting the “war on truth.” In April, they were awarded a Pulitzer Prize for the very work that landed them in jail. There was little ambiguity about what happened to these two bright young reporters who dared to expose atrocities committed by their country’s notorious military. They were set up, convicted of possessing “official secrets” and sentenced to 7 years in prison after a trial broadly considered a farce. On Tuesday, they were freed by a pardon from Myanmar President Win Myint. “I’m really happy and excited to see my family and my colleagues,” Wa Lone said in brief remarks outside the prison gates. “I can’t wait to go to my newsroom.” Photos and videos of the reporters’ emotional reunion with their wives and young daughters went viral. One captured the first time Wa Lone ever held his infant daughter as a free man. His wife, Pan Ei Mon, discovered she was pregnant shortly after his arrest. Like most good news in Myanmar, it came with a caveat. Their case was a major test of the country’s quasi-civilian government, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, which it failed at every turn. Rights advocates say press freedom in the country is even worse than it was upon their arrest, and other journalists have already taken on board the chilling message that if they report critically on the military, the government won’t help them. “The military punished these journalists to intimidate others,” says Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division for Human Rights Watch. “They wanted to let everyone know that, ‘Hey, we can come after you, too.’” At every turn, the case set off alarm bells for other journalists. In what appears to have been a sting operation, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on the night of Dec. 12, 2017 after accepting an invitation to have dinner with police at a private restaurant in Yangon. They were in the midst of a damning investigation into a massacre of 10 Rohingya boys and men in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, where the military has been accused of genocide against the stateless Muslim minority. Police handed them some documents, and they left the restaurant. Before they could even examine the contents, they were arrested and held incommunicado for about a week. In the ensuing trial, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were charged with breaking a law called the “Official Secrets Act,” a colonial-era provision that criminalizes so much as intending to share anything authorities want to conceal. A police witness testified that officers were ordered to “trap” Wa Lone, and that the both of them were caught in a “set up.” Nonetheless, they were convicted on Sept. 3, 2018, and sentenced to seven years behind bars. It’s no wonder why authorities wanted to hide what these reporters knew about Rakhine. While they were still on trial, Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen J. Adler decided that the story of the massacre they had uncovered was too important not to publish. The rest of the world agreed with him; in April, Reuters’ body of work on the Rohingya crisis was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting. “We felt the world needed to see this story,” Adler told Washington Post columnist Jason Rezaian, who himself was jailed in Iran for 544 days and has been a vocal advocate for the Reuters journalists. “Our reporters in prison were fully supportive of the decision,” Adler said. “And this is what we do.”",The Release of Reuters Journalists in Myanmar Is a Victory for Press Freedom.

986,Megan McCluskey,"Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex announced their first child’s name on Wednesday, sharing the news that their son will be called Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor following a photo call. As for the new royal baby’s title, unlike Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis — the children of William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge — Harry and Meghan’s baby boy is not a prince. Unless Queen Elizabeth II issues a Letters Patent declaring otherwise (like she did for Will and Kate’s kids.) “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pleased to announce they have named their first born child: Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor,” the couple’s official Instagram account captioned a shot of Meghan introducing Archie to the queen on Wednesday. “This afternoon Their Royal Highnesses introduced Her Majesty The Queen to her eighth great-grandchild at Windsor Castle. The Duke of Edinburgh and The Duchess’ mother were also present for this special occasion.” The name Archie is certainly not a traditional choice for Harry and Meghan as it’s not the name of a past British monarch or even a past member of the British royal family. As of now, it’s unclear why Harry and Meghan chose the name Archie for their son. Leading up to the name announcement, Ladbrokes odds had Alexander at 4/1, Spencer at 5/1, James at 6/1, Arthur at 7/1 and Theodore at 8/1. Meghan gave birth to the baby boy, who weighs 7 pounds and 3 ounces, on Monday, the couple announced on their Instagram page. Prince Harry, speaking to cameras on the grounds of Windsor Castle on Monday, said “this little thing is absolutely to die for.” Royals fans have been speculating over the new royal baby name since Kensington Palace announced that Markle was pregnant with the couple’s first child on Oct. 15. “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019,” the palace said in a statement.

987,Charlie Campbell / Shanghai,"Luckin Coffee has Starbucks worried. The Xiamen-based upstart has opened 2,370 coffee shops across 28 Chinese cities since June 2017. And on Monday, it announced plans for a Nasdaq initial public offering (IPO) of around $17 a share—which, if successful, could value the company at $4 billion. It’s a clear challenge to the Seattle-headquartered global king of coffee, which entered China two decades ago and last year held over half of the domestic market, according to Euromonitor. But Starbucks’ China sales grew just 1% in the last quarter of 2018, down from 8% growth the year before. Analysts point to China’s slackening growth in general for the slowdown, yet few dispel the specter of Luckin looming over the green siren’s shoulder. Starbucks has responded by tackling Luckin head-on, rolling out previously overlooked services like delivery—a main pillar of Luckin’s business model—in the fall by partnering with Jack Ma’s e-commerce empire Alibaba. It’s no exaggeration to say that Starbucks is the main reason why coffee is fast supplanting tea as the beverage of choice for China’s harried urban residents. More than 3,700 Starbucks outlets have opened across the world’s number two economy, with a new store popping up every 15 hours or so. The firm aims to have 6,000 sites in China by 2023, and sees the world’s populous nation as a main avenue of growth given market saturation in the U.S. And so despite the impressive-looking IPO, Luckin may struggle to compete. It hopes to succeed by unleashing technology to boost convenience. In that way, it shouldn’t be thought of as a high-end coffee chain at all. After all, Ninety percent of Luckin outlets are little more than an austere counter with coffee machines in the corner of an office building lobby. Customers browse and select their beverage via an app, pay online, and then get alerted via smartphone when their order is ready. At the allotted time they can wander over to pick up their steaming cup of joe and get back to their desk before their boss notices their absence. It’s high-convenience, low-cost and zero frills. There’s virtually no waiting in line. Cash isn’t even accepted. Plus it’s about half the price of Starbucks. “Luckin is great as it’s super convenient during the workday,” says Shanghai office worker Xiao Wang, as she struggles to balance her iced latte, smartphone and portable charger in her grasp. But, adds Wang: “As for the coffee, it’s just so-so.” That’s the thing. Luckin is more about convenience than great coffee. It’s not bad, but there’s no arcane choice of far-flung beans, plush ambience or tony baristas. The food on offer treats bland as an art form and leaves no doubt that it’s a distinct afterthought. For Jeffrey Towson, a business professor at Peking University and private equity investor, “Luckin’s real competition is convenience stores like 7-Eleven rather than Starbucks.” What’s more, Luckin is burning through $130 million a year, and admits that more losses are likely in the future. The company reported a net loss of $241 million for 2018 with total revenue at $125 million. Its corporate structure is peculiar and revenue forecasts are speculative at best.",China's Luckin Coffee Is More 7-Eleven Than Starbucks — And That Could Be a Big Problem,"May 8, 2019"

During their appearance, Markle shared her joy at the newest addition to their family. “It’s magic.

990,Amir Vahdat and Jon Gambrell / AP,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran threatened Wednesday to resume higher enrichment of uranium in 60 days if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its 2015 nuclear deal a year after President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord, raising tensions as a U.S. aircraft carrier and a bomber wing deploy to confront unspecified threats from Tehran. In a televised address, President Hassan Rouhani also said that Iran would stop exporting excess uranium and heavy water from its nuclear program, two requirements of the deal. He did not elaborate on the degree to which Iran was prepared to enrich uranium, which at high levels of enrichment can be used in nuclear weapons. Rouhani said Iran wanted to negotiate new terms with remaining partners in the deal, but acknowledged that the situation was dire. “We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective,” Rouhani said. “This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.” The 2015 deal lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. After the U.S. withdrew from the accord it restored crippling sanctions on Iran, exacerbating a severe economic crisis. The Iranian rial, which traded at 32,000 to $1 at the time of the accord, traded Wednesday at 153,500. Iran notified Britain, Russia, China, the European Union, France and Germany of its decision earlier Wednesday. All were signatories to the nuclear deal and continue to support it. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was to meet Wednesday in Moscow with his Russian counterpart. “If the five countries join negotiations and help Iran to reach its benefits in the field of oil and banking, Iran will return to its commitments according to the nuclear deal,” Rouhani said. However, Rouhani warned of a “strong reaction” if European leaders instead sought to impose more sanctions on Iran via the U.N. Security Council.

991,Madeline Roache,"Jeremy Brooks, a 22 year-old American, was among the 41 people who died when a Russian plane burst into flames while making an emergency landing in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport on Sunday. The recent graduate of Colorado College was on his way to work as a fishing guide for Atlantic salmon in northwest Russia, according to his former employer. Brooks was reportedly the only U.S. citizen on the Murmansk bound Aeroflot plane, which had to turn back just 30 minutes after taking off from Moscow as a result of unspecified technical difficulties. Russian authorities said 37 passengers survived by escaping from the slides at the front of the plane as the rear was engulfed in flames. “[Brooks] was in the back of the plane, so he wasn’t able to make it out,” Valdez told the Sante Fe New Mexican news site. Crew members and passengers say the Russian-built Sukhoi Superjet-100 was struck by lightning after taking off, disconnecting communications with ground control, the BBC reported. But some aviation experts have questioned whether a lightning strike could severe the plane’s communications, given that modern jets are designed to withstand storms. Russian investigators are considering pilot error as a possible cause of the crash. The Russian news outlet, Kommersant Daily, quoting unnamed sources close to the investigation, says several factors are being scrutinized. Among them are why the pilots decided to fly into a storm front, which raised the level of risk, why they were in a hurry to land, though normal procedure is to circle over the airport first to burn up fuel, and why they appear to have exceeded the normal landing speed which, along with heavy fuel tanks, made the plane bounce off the tarmac. Valdez, Brooks’ former employer and owner of the The Reel Life fishing shop in Santa Fe, told the Albuquerque Journal, a New Mexico news site, that Brooks “had it all to offer the world. I never heard a bad complaint against him.” Brooks was the “most patient, knowledgeable and kind guide we could ever have had,” he said in another interview. The 22-year-old had studied environmental science and also loved philosophy, the The Santa Fe New Mexican reported. Jim Leonard, head of school at Santa Fe Preparatory School, who saw Brooks two weeks before his departure called him a “terrific kid,” and said that “his nature was one of such kindness.” In Moscow, Brooks had been working at – what he called – “the most prestigious fly fishing lodge in the world,” according to Mark Rossetti, a friend of Brooks. “It costs about $15,000 for a week of fishing, and to get the position that he got is unheard of,” Rossetti told the The Santa Fe New Mexican “That’s not an easy job to get. I think there’s only two or three Americans who have ever guided there.”","'The Most Amazing Man,' Friends Honor 22-Year-Old American Killed In Russian Plane Crash","May 7, 2019"

Burmese journalists Wa Lone, 33, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, smiled and waved as they were mobbed by reporters walking out of the Yangon’s infamous Insein Prison. Their release was part of a presidential pardon that saw more than 6,500 prisoners walk free. Their case captured global attention and heaped international pressure upon the Myanmar government, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Thousands signed an online petition, changed their social media profile pictures to an iconic image of the pair, and shared constant updates with the hashtag #FreeWaLoneKyawSoeOo. Since their arrest in December 2017, they have won numerous awards — most recently co-winning the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting — and were recognized in TIME’s 2018 Person of the Year issue as Guardians of Truth. Wa Lone thanked those who supported them during their imprisonment. “I can’t wait to go to my newsroom,” he said before departing to be reunited with his family. At Reuters’ newsrooms across the globe, colleagues were also eager to see their return. Aurindom Mukherjee, Social Media Editor at Reuters, Tweeted that the staff at Reuters Singapore headquarters burst into applause as they watched the reporters walk out of prison on television. “We are enormously pleased that Myanmar has released out courageous reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.

993,Amy Gunia,"New research suggests that China may have undertaken large-scale destruction of Islamic sites in its western Xinjiang province, where Muslim minorities such as Uighurs live under severely repressive rule. The Guardian and open-source journalism website Bellingcat used satellite imagery to examine 91 religious sites identified by people who used to live in the northwestern province, finding that 31 mosques and two major shrines showed significant structural damage between 2016 and 2018. Of those, 15 structures were “completely or almost completely razed.” Others had defining features like domes or minarets removed. Nine other buildings used as mosques that did not have obvious mosque-like features were also destroyed, according to the Guardian. The Imam Asim shrine, an important pilgrimage site for Uighurs, and the Kargilik Mosque, one of the largest mosques in the area, were among the buildings destroyed, according to the investigation. The Yutian Aitika mosque near Hotan, a large mosque dating back to the year 1200 where locals gathered for religious holidays, is also reportedly among those demolished. China faces increasing condemnation for its alleged persecution of Muslim minorities. The State Department estimates that between 800,000 to 2 million Turkic Muslims, including Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and others, are being held in what Beijing calls “re-education camps.” Others call them concentration camps.  U.S. officials have repeatedly denounced the practice. China has defended the detentions as a means of combatting terrorism, and has tried to pass the camps off as “vocational training” centers similar to “boarding schools.” Read More: ‘The Chinese Government Is at War With Faith.’ U.S. Official Denounces Religious Crackdown in China Some experts and former residents believe the Chinese government is destroying religious buildings in a further attempt to wipe out Islamic religious identity in China.","China Destroyed Mosques and Other Muslim Sites in Xinjiang, Report Says","May 7, 2019"

The Guardian reports that the draft law would make vaccinations mandatory for any child attending nurseries or schools, as well as teachers, educators and medical staff. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to US$2,800. If approved this year, the law would go into effect by March 1, 2022, and would require parents to provide proof of their children’s vaccination by mid-2020. The proposed measure comes amid a global resurgence of the respiratory illness that has been driven in part by anti-vaccination scare campaigns. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccination, known as MMR, has been a regular target of the “anti-vaxxer” movement, which peddles a widely discredited theory that the vaccine is linked to autism. The World Health Organization has named “vaccine hesitancy” a top 10 threat to global health. In 2018, 98 countries reported an uptick of measles cases, including in areas previously declared measles free. Measles is more contagious than Ebola, tuberculosis or influenza, according to UNICEF. In the U.S., measles cases have climbed to the highest level in 25 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Last month, a public health emergency was declared in New York City, where a large number in ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities remain unvaccinated. Officials have also ordered residents in pockets of the city to get vaccinated or face fines up to $1,000, as well as banning people diagnosed with measles from entering public places in an attempt to stop the outbreak.

995,Amy Gunia,"Two Reuters journalists imprisoned in Myanmar for reporting on a military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims have been released after spending more than 500 days behind bars. Reporters Wa Lone, 33, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, walked free Tuesday morning after a presidential pardon, according to Reuters. A post on the news agency’s Twitter account shows the Burmese journalists leaving Yangon’s infamous Insein Prison. The pair were freed as part of an amnesty of 6,250 prisoners by President Win Myint, according to Reuters. Authorities have historically released prisoners close to the date of the country’s new year, which began in mid-April. The men were reunited with their families shortly after leaving prison. Wa Lone’s wife, Pan Ei Moon, discovered she was pregnant after her husband was arrested. He has met his young daughter only a few times, when she visited him in jail. Kyaw Soe Oo has a three-year-old daughter. The two men were arrested in December 2017 and later sentenced to seven years in prison for possessing “state secrets” in what was widely believed to be a set-up. The journalists had been reporting on violence in the country’s western Rakhine State, where Myanmar’s state security forces have been accused of ethnic cleansing and possible genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority. Reuters’ investigation, published in February 2018, documented the slaughter and mass burial of 10 Rohingya men in the village of Inn Din. About 1.2 million Rohyinga were estimated to live in Myanmar before the country’s military launched a brutal crackdown on the mostly-stateless ethnic minority in response to attacks on border patrols by suspected Rohingya insurgents in August 2017. The violence drove more than 700,000 people across the border into southeast Bangladesh, where more than a million Rohingya now live. Survivors of the exodus described scenes of rape, arson and indiscriminate killing of civilians, and U.N. investigators have called for the country’s military leaders to face charges of genocide.",Myanmar Pardons Two Reuters Reporters Jailed for Exposing Massacre of Rohingya,"Updated: May 7, 2019 2:01 AM ET"
996,Megan McCluskey,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle welcomed their new baby boy into the world on May 6, Kensington Palace announced on Monday. It is the couple’s first child. Harry and Meghan married in May 2018, becoming the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Now, the question is where the new arrival will fit into the line of succession of the British royal family. The answer is seventh in line. The new baby bumps Prince Andrew, the second son of the Queen, into eighth place. But the youngster is behind his cousins Prince George and Princess Charlotte, by virtue of their father — Prince William — being older than Harry and second in line to the throne. The good news for the new baby is that its gender didn’t come into consideration in the line of succession, unlike in times gone by. In 2013, the U.K. Parliament passed a law allowing succession of siblings to be decided by age, rather than gender. The previous rules meant that an older sister would come further down the pecking order than her younger brother. The new baby also bumps Princess Eugenie, who got married last October, into tenth in line to the throne.

997,George Steer,"Meghan, Duchess of Sussex welcomed her first child with Prince Harry, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, on Monday. The world got its first glimpse at the child on Wednesday, soon before the royal family announced his name. Meghan Markle gave birth to the 7-pound, 3-ounce baby boy early on Monday morning, according to the Sussex Instagram account. As of Wednesday, just before the name announcement, royal fans in the U.K. were still betting on different royal baby names. The Duke and Duchess announced the name for baby Sussex on Instagram. Prince Harry told reporters Monday that he and Meghan were “thinking about names but, the baby is a little overdue so we’ve had a little bit of time to think about it.” The first photos of the family were released on Wednesday on their Instagram account as well, showing the new family of three glowing in Windsor Castle. U.K.-based betting and gambling company Ladbrokes said in a press release that before the name announcement, betting for the royal baby names odds had the top choice, Alexander, at 4/1. Spencer was close behind at 5/1. James was in third place with 6/1 odds and Arthur — which was the favorite on Monday following the baby’s birth — had gone down to 7/1. Theodore was further down at 8/1, but a spokesperson for Ladbrokes said in a press release Wednesday “punters clearly think the value lies with Theodore and we’ve been forced to slash the odds as a result,” as the name has made its way up in the betting process.  The odds were potentially on the side of family names as Philip, the name of Queen Elizabeth II’s husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, trails behind at 12/1 odds — a departure from its 6/1 odds at the time of birth. Nowhere to be found in the top names was Archie. According to Ladbrokes, only 100 pounds had been bet on Archie, and only 60 people had placed those bets. Had the royal baby been a girl, betting ended as follows: Ivy was at 7/4, Diana was at 6/1 and Grace was close behind at 8/1.","We've Got Ourselves an Archie.

Their Royal Highnesses’ son weighs 7lbs. 3oz.,” the royals announced on their official Instagram account. “The Duchess and baby are both healthy and well, and the couple thank members of the public for their shared excitement and support during this very special time in their lives.” The baby was born at 5:26 a.m. local time, the a palace said. Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, is with her daughter at the couple’s home at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, England. She is “overjoyed by the arrival of her first grandchild,” according to the palace. Not long after the news of the birth, Prince Harry made a statement to gathered journalists. He said that Meghan and the child were healthy and that he was “over the moon” with excitement. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have yet to release their new son’s name. But, unlike Prince George of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Prince Louis of Cambridge—the children of William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge—Harry and Meghan’s baby boy is not a prince. Unless Queen Elizabeth issues a Letters Patent declaring otherwise, Harry and Meghan’s son––and any future children – will likely be given the title of earl (or lady if they have a girl in the future.) Still, the baby’s name is likely to be traditional, royal experts say. The new royal baby is seventh in line to the throne, which gives the Duke and Duchess some more leeway in the naming process, but they’re not going to want to stray too far from royal tradition. “I think [Markle] understands and respects the traditional institution that she’s married into,” Katie Nicholl, a royal correspondent for Vanity Fair and the author of Harry and Meghan: Life, Loss, and Love, told TIME in a previous interview.",It's a Boy!

In his first public comments since introducing the harsh new penal code, which would have made actions like adultery and sex between two men punishable by death by stoning, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah acknowledged that the laws had raised “many questions and misperceptions,” according to the BBC. Despite moratorium, the Sultan defended the rules, saying they had “merit,” reports the BBC. The enactment of the laws in the predominantly Muslim Asian nation of about 450,000 people sparked international outrage.

1001,Ivan Levingston and Saud Abu Ramadan / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Israel and Gaza-based militants are digging in for extended fighting after a barrage of hundreds of rockets and retaliatory airstrikes boiled over into a second day, threatening to undo months of Egyptian-brokered efforts to reach a long-term truce. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he instructed the army to continue its “massive attacks” in Gaza and bolstered forces near the coastal strip. Militant groups, who want Israel to do more to alleviate the misery in blockaded Gaza, have threatened to send rockets deeper into Israeli territory as important dates on the calendar approach. Israel commemorates its memorial and independence days this week, and militants have vowed to ruin the May 18 Eurovision song contest in Tel Aviv. Canceling the competition — or holding it under rocket fire — could harm Israel’s effort to showcase itself as a top-tier tourist destination. “They thought that because it’s before the Memorial Day of Israel and the Independence Day of Israel and the Eurovision which is in a week or two in Israel, Israel will not retaliate, but it was a huge mistake,” former Israeli National Security Adviser Yaakov Amidror said on a press briefing. At least 10 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed since lower-level fighting on Friday escalated into intense fighting the following day. A Palestinian baby and her pregnant relative were among the dead, though the army denied responsibility and said the two were killed by rockets fired from Gaza that fell short. Rocket bombardments began Saturday morning and about 450 had been fired by Sunday afternoon. More than 100 rockets were intercepted by missile defense batteries, but several scored direct hits on homes, factories and cars. In return, Israeli aircraft hit roughly 220 targets in Gaza that the army said included military compounds and training camps, naval vessels and weapons facilities. The military also destroyed several tunnels dug by Islamic Jihad to infiltrate Israel, the army said. For more than a year, Hamas has been sponsoring weekly protests at the border designed to draw attention to the Palestinians’ plight and deflect popular anger over Gaza’s crushing poverty away from Hamas’s own failures and onto Israel. Gaza has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas wrested control of the territory in 2007, and sanctions imposed by the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, which is locked in a power struggle with Hamas, have intensified the strip’s distress.",Fighting Between Israel and Gaza Escalates Into Second Day of Airstrikes,"May 5, 2019"
1002,Justin Sink / Bloomberg,"President Donald Trump initiated a lengthy call with his Russian counterpart on Friday, in which Vladimir Putin urged sanctions relief for North Korea and warned against interference in Venezuela, the Russian embassy in Washington said. The leaders’ call lasted for 1.5 hours, according to a post on the embassy’s Facebook page, and the pair discussed a “shared commitment to step up dialogue in various areas, including on issues of strategic stability.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday the leaders spoke for more than an hour. Trump tweeted about the chat for a second time on Saturday, saying there was “tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia.” On Friday, Trump told reporters at the White House that Putin had assured him Moscow isn’t seeking to “get involved” in the crisis in Venezuela, despite assertions by the U.S. president’s top national security advisers that the Kremlin is offering critical support to Nicolas Maduro’s regime. “He is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela other than he’d like to see something positive happen for Venezuela,” Trump said of Putin. “And I feel the same way.” The conversation, which Trump went on to describe as “very positive,” appeared to be another example of Trump taking Putin’s claims at face value despite contrary evidence from his own government. Sanders said on Friday that Trump simply was “relaying what President Putin said to him. That’s it.” The White House national security adviser, John Bolton, and U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo both said earlier this week that the Kremlin talked Maduro out of leaving Venezuela after U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido attempted to end his regime on May 30 by calling for a military uprising. In a video message posted Saturday on Twitter, Pompeo said that during an April visit to Cucuta, Colombia, on the Venezuelan border, he’d seen “first hand the misery that Maduro’s created, with the Russians’ and Cubans’ help.”",Russia Says President Trump Initiated Long Phone Call With Putin,"May 4, 2019"
1003,Jihye Lee / Bloomberg,"President Donald Trump brushed off news of a possible weapons test by North Korea, vowing that leader Kim Jong Un “will do nothing to interfere” and that a denuclearization deal with the U.S. “will happen.” Saturday’s tweet, posted while Trump was in a motorcade to the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, was the president’s first response to news overnight that Pyongyang had fired numerous short-range projectiles off its eastern coast on Saturday, according to South Korean authorities. The move was seen as Kim’s latest and most provocative signal of frustration over talks with Trump following the pair’s failed summit in Vietnam in February. The significance of the test was difficult to assess as South Korea revised its account of the nature and scale of the weapons discharged from the eastern port of Wonsan just after 9 a.m. Saturday local time. After first calling them “missiles,” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff later changed its description to “projectiles,” saying greater clarity would require more analysis. The details are key since Trump has cited Kim’s self-imposed freeze on missile and nuclear weapons tests to support his decision to continue negotiations with the North Korean leader. South Korea’s descriptions of the incident suggested shorter-range rockets or artillery that would be less likely for the U.S. to interpret as a violation of Kim’s pledge to refrain from testing. “We are aware of North Korea’s actions tonight. We will continue to monitor as necessary,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. National Security Adviser John Bolton briefed the president about the launch, according to a senior administration official, who asked for anonymity to discuss the matter. The weapons were fired from the Hodo Peninsula, which has been the site of past live-fire artillery exercises, and traveled 70 to 200 kilometers (45 to 125 miles), the joint chiefs said earlier Saturday. The Yonhap News Agency later reported that the weapons fired were “not missiles,” citing unidentified lawmakers briefed by intelligence officials. “Missiles are projectiles, but South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff might be using ‘projectile’ to imply an unguided rocket, like one of North Korea’s older rocket artillery systems,” said Ankit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists. “This could also be a politicized attempt to make the word ‘missile’ not so prominent, in case that creates the kind of news cycle that Trump doesn’t want.”",President Trump: North Korea's Kim Jong-Un Won't 'Break His Promise' Amid Possible Weapons Test,"May 4, 2019"
1004,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: Self-proclaimed “interim president” Juan Guaido gambled this week to try to force the ouster of de facto Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, calling on the Venezuelan people to join him in mass protests and military officials to defect to his side. People showed up to protest—both for and against Maduro—but the military defections Guaido hoped for never quite materialized. Why It Matters: When it comes to politics, timing is everything. Guaido had real momentum in January when he announced that Maduro’s electoral win was rigged and illegitimate (correct on both counts), and that Venezuela’s constitution empowered the head of the country’s parliament (read: him) to serve as president until free and fair elections could be held. The US backed Guaido immediately, a diplomatic victory which opened the door for other countries to follow suit—more than 50 countries now recognize Guaido as the country’s rightful leader. But none of those countries were willing to do much beyond sanctions and humanitarian aid. In fact, the one country that seemed committed to sending in military assistance of any kind was Russia, which had invested heavily in the Maduro regime. That effectively meant that while Guaido was an international cause celebre, Maduro was the one who controlled the country’s military and security forces on the ground. And without control of those forces, Guaido was just another Venezuelan opposition leader. Guaido has thus spent the last three months trying to peel military supporters away from Maduro. At the beginning of this week, it seemed like he may have actually pulled it off—in a video featuring Leopoldo Lopez, the opposition leader and Guaido’s political mentor who had been under house arrest for the last two years—Guaido announced that the final phase of “Operation Liberty” had commenced, and called for the Venezuelan people to join him in protests to force the ouster of Maduro once and for all. Lopez was released by dissident military officials that had switched loyalties to Guaido, a sign that Guaido was gaining traction among the country’s security apparatus. Combined with the strong rhetoric from US National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, there was genuine hope that this was the beginning of the end for Maduro. But three key officials that the opposition hoped would switch to their side—the country’s defense minister, the chief judge of the Supreme Court and the head of Maduro’s presidential guard—remained loyal to Maduro. Maduro thus ends the week in a much stronger position than when he started it, and Guaido and Venezuela’s opposition are now on the backfoot. What Happens Next: Guaido just suffered his most significant defeat since storming onto the world stage a few months ago, and it’s not clear where he goes from here. Guaido needs to keep both the Venezuelan public as well as the international community engaged and on his side as developments in the country unfold, but the failed attempt to force matters to a head significantly hampers his ability to do both. Guaido managed to cobble together support from certain members of the National Guard and Venezuela’s Secret Service, but was unable to show that he flipped any members of the armed forces with any operational relevance or with significant troops under their command. It’s still unclear whether Guaido had bad intelligence, supposed-defectors got cold feet, or if Guaido just hoped that a daring gambit would swing things in his favor. But now Maduro is emboldened. What he does with that remains to be seen—he could go after Guaido and try to get him arrested or exiled, but that runs the risk of drawing the ire of the international community and reviving support for Guaido. His smartest move might be to just let Guaido spin his wheels and wait for fractures in the country’s opposition to emerge as they argue over next steps.",The Quick Read About… Venezuela’s Faltering Revolution,"May 3, 2019"

The vessel, Freewinds, is scheduled to arrive at its homeport in Curaçao on Saturday morning, Dr. Izzy Gerstenbluth, the national epidemiologist for the island of 160,000 people, tells TIME. Freewinds set sail from St. Lucia on Thursday night, St. Lucia officials say. St. Lucia officials refused to allow the ship’s crew or passengers to disembark when the ship arrived at the island on Tuesday because the country had received reports that a female crew member was diagnosed with measles, the St. Lucia health department said in a statement. At the request of the ship’s doctor, the island provided the vessel with 100 measles vaccines. Although the vessel was placed under quarantine, St. Lucia officials said that the ship was permitted to leave at any time. Gerstenbluth says that Curaçao will consider permitting people who are immune to the disease to disembark in Curaçao, which includes people who are vaccinated or have previously contracted the illness. The infected passenger may have been contagious until Tuesday, Gerstenbluth says, and passengers without immunity will need to be monitored for three weeks––until May 21. The ship’s doctor is compiling medical records for everyone aboard the ship, and Curaçao and other health agencies will evaluate the evidence when the vessel arrives on the island tomorrow. “Tomorrow we will carry out our own assessment, because people might say they’ve been vaccinated just to get off board,” Gerstenbluth says. Gerstenbluth says that while he does not consider measles to be an especially serious illness, Curaçao will take steps to ensure that the virus does not spread internationally. “This is more about our commitment to the international community to contain this,” Gerstenbluth says. “We are very keen on trying to limit the spread of the disease.”",The Scientology Cruise Ship Quarantined for Measles Has Set Sail.

1006,Madeline Roache,"The discovery of a beluga whale in Norwegian waters that may or may not be working for the Russian navy has captured worldwide attention. Norwegian fisherman spotted the marine mammal on Monday wearing a GoPro camera harness with a label on the inside, written in English, “Equipment of St. Petersburg.” The find alarmed Norwegian officials and led to speculation that the mammal may have been trained to spy for Russia. There is “great reason to believe” the whale was being used by the Russian navy, Martin Niuw from the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research, told the Norwegian broadcaster NRT. There is not yet conclusive evidence about where the whale is from, but that explanation for the whale’s origin is “entirely plausible,” says Gervase Phillips, a history lecturer who studies the military use of animals at Manchester Metropolitan University. The Russian defense ministry has denied having a program that uses marine mammals, the Guardian reported. That hasn’t stopped locals from joking that the whale has since “defected” to Norway; it is refusing to stray more than a few miles from the northern harbor where it was discovered. If the whale is indeed a Russian spy, as speculated in headlines around the world, it would not be the first marine mammal drafted into military service. Here’s a history of whales, dolphins and other creatures that have been trained and deployed by militaries in Russia and around the world. In the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet authorities reportedly trained beluga wales, dolphins, sea lions and fur seals to search for underwater mines and other objects. Lev Mukhametov, a leading researcher on ecology and evolution at the Russian Academy of Sciences told Gazeta, a popular online Russian new site, that he saw how bottlenose dolphins were used during Soviet times to “guard” the entrance to the bay of Sevastopol, the city in Crimea that was home to the Soviet Black Sea fleet. If a diver passed underwater “through a protected area” then dolphins would “signal” to a coastal station using echolocation––high frequency clicking sounds, Mukhametov said.",A Beluga Whale Is Allegedly a Russian Spy.

1007,Justin Worland,"The threat in French President Emmanuel Macron’s remarks last week was easy to miss. But if he follows through, its effects wouldn’t be. More than 40 minutes into a meandering press conference, Macron reiterated his goal to put fighting climate change at the center of his government’s policies as well as those of the European Union, calling for a “carbon tax on borders” for the bloc. “The success of this transition goes through our European commitment, our capacity to defend at the European level the need to achieve a carbon price,” he said, according to a translation. Macron did not get into specifics, but such a measure would likely mean a carbon tax in E.U. member countries coupled with a fee on imports from non-E.U. countries that don’t have their own carbon tax or another form of carbon pricing. That would borrow a trick from President Donald Trump, who has revived the use of tariffs to punish foreign countries. But instead of using the import fee to try to gain competitive advantage in certain industries the E.U. would be using it to fight climate change, which Trump repeatedly called “a hoax” while campaigning for president. If the European Union were to follow through on the plan, American products would instantly become less competitive globally. There are other risks for U.S. manufacturers too. Since 2005, the European Union has experimented with a carbon pricing scheme while many American businesses have been unencumbered by similar restrictions. If E.U. standards get tougher, U.S. manufacturers risk falling behind their counterparts in other countries, which have already been pushed toward cleaner processes domestically. Some warn that the transition to a greener global economy could end up leaving the U.S. behind. “This market is going to be the dominant market of the world for the rest of this century,” says John Kerry, the former U.S. Secretary of State. “If in the United States is not a commanding position in it our economy will suffer tremendously.” There are a variety of ways Macron’s policy could be structured, but it would almost certainly leave U.S. companies vulnerable. The U.S. is the only country that is not committed to implementing the Paris Agreement, one measure that could be used to determine which countries would face a tax on imports. More than 40 countries, including China, have some national form of carbon pricing, another potential tax determinant.",Europe May Use Trump's Favorite Economic Weapon to Punish His Inaction on Climate Change,"May 3, 2019"
1008,Natalie Lung and Ken Wang / Bloomberg,"A Chinese mother says she was misled into thinking she was donating to Stanford University, after paying $6.5 million to an adviser at the center of the U.S. college admissions scandal. The mother of Yusi Zhao, identified only as Mrs. Zhao, said she donated the money to William Singer’s foundation on April 21, 2017, at his request almost a month after her daughter received an offer from the university, according to a statement provided on Friday by her lawyer Vincent Law, a Hong Kong-based partner at Mayer Brown. The university entrance scandal, in which wealthy parents got their children into elite schools by cheating, has spread far and wide since U.S. prosecutors exposed the brazen national scheme by bringing charges against parents and ringleader Singer, who pleaded guilty to racketeering, money laundering, fraud and obstruction of justice. The scandal has embroiled high schools, test administrators, guidance counselors and students — and now a wealthy mother in China. Yusi Zhao is also a victim, her mother said in the statement. The purpose of the donation was “for the salaries of academic staff, scholarships, athletics programs and helping those students who otherwise will not be able to afford to attend Stanford,” she said in the statement. The contribution is in the same nature as those that many affluent parents have been doing openly to prestigious universities, Mrs. Zhao said, adding that she isn’t familiar with the admission process for colleges in the U.S. “Mrs. Zhao has come to realize she has been misled, her generosity has been taken advantage of, and her daughter has fallen victim to the scam,” the lawyer said in the statement. Mrs. Zhao was introduced to Singer through a third party, according to the statement, after which she learned of his charity foundation, which “was represented to her as a substantial and legitimate non-profit foundation for supporting education.” Singer presented Yusi Zhao as a competitive sailor, the New York Times reported. Stanford rescinded her admission and she is no longer a student there, the newspaper said. In a video that was shared across Chinese social media, she offers advice about getting into prestigious U.S. universities, saying that she “tested into Stanford through my own hard work,” according to the Times. Zhao Tao, chairman of Shandong Buchang Pharmaceuticals Co., said in a statement on the company’s website on Friday that the issue regarding his daughter’s studies in the U.S. is a family matter and will not affect normal business operations.",Chinese Mother Who Paid $6.5 Million to Get Daughter into Stanford Says She Thought Money Was a Donation,"May 3, 2019"
1009,Hillary Leung,"For weeks, officials in Thailand have been collecting water from sources across the country’s 76 provinces between the auspicious hours of 11:52 am and 12:38 pm every Saturday. This weekend, the sacred fluid — stored in traditional vases in the lavish Grand Palace at the center of the capital Bangkok — will be used to “purify” King Maha Vajiralongkorn, or Rama X, as he ascends the throne in a coronation ceremony that is considered Thailand’s most important event of the year — and perhaps the century. The last time the country crowned a new king was in 1950, so for most Thais this will be the first coronation of their lifetimes. King Maha Vajiralongkorn inherits the throne from his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who during his 70-year reign was widely revered and seen as a unifying force in the country. Bhumibol died in October 2016, marking the start of a year-long mourning period across Thailand. Vajiralongkorn, the King’s only son, took the throne in December, but the formal succession was delayed as he asked for more time to grieve. It is unclear what kind of influence the new King Vajiralongkorn will wield over Thailand’s future. The country has long been politically divided, and its first elections since a 2014 military coup were held in late March in the lead-up to his coronation. The military-backed party won, entrenching the army’s lasting grip on power, though the palace retains ultimate authority. Since the army took power, Thailand has tightened its control over political dissent and clamped down on free speech. There has also been a sharp rise in criminal defamation cases, particularly lèse majesté; Thailand has one of the world’s strictest laws outlawing insults to the crown. The elaborate three-day ceremony, which is estimated to cost the Thai government $31 million, combines Buddhist and Hindu Brahmin rituals. The crowning will take place at the Grand Palace on Saturday, May 4. It will include several ceremonial rites such as the seating of the king on an octagonal throne as eight people, including members of the royal family and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, pour the sacred water into his hands. On Sunday, the newly crowned king will greet the public in a 4.3-mile long royal procession; elevated on a gilded palanquin, he will be carried by soldiers from the Grand Palace and around the historic old quarter of the country’s capital. Military men in traditional garb will march in step, some taking to the streets on horseback, before a light and sound show, and a drone display, take the evening away. The festivities do not end there — Monday has been declared a public holiday, and the king plans to greet the public from the balcony of the Grand Palace before meeting Thai and foreign dignitaries. Vajiralongkorn leads a very private life, rarely makes public appearances and spends much of his time abroad. The 66-year-old studied in the U.K. and Australia, and later served as a career officer in the Thai military where he trained with western forces, according to Agence France-Presse. He has a passion for flying and enjoys piloting his Boeing 737 aircraft in Bavaria, where he also owns a number of lavish residences. The new king isn’t entirely without controversy. In 2016, a video surfaced of the royal walking through a shopping mall in Germany wearing a crop top and revealing his tattoos. The clip was taken by a Thai citizen who recognized the king, and prompted Facebook to block users in Thailand from viewing it after pressure from the conservative kingdom’s authorities. He also famously owned a poodle, Foo-Foo, to which he was so endeared that he appointed him as an Air Chief Marshall. U.S. diplomatic cables dated 2009 and published by WikiLeaks described Vajiralongkorn as “long known for violent and unpredictable mood swings.”",Thailand Is Crowning a New King for the First Time Since 1950.

A spokesman said the pair got engaged in the beach town of Mahia on the country’s North Island but declined to give further comments, after reporters noticed Ardern wearing a ring on her middle finger on Friday, according to the AP. Gayford is a host on a television fishing show called Fish of the Day and is their daughter’s main caregiver. Ardern, 38, met Gayford, 41, at a restaurant awards event in 2012, according to the New Zealand news website Stuff. The pair have a child, Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford, who was born in June 2018.

1011,Hillary Leung,"The Vietnamese woman accused of killing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s estranged half-brother has been released from prison, bringing an inconclusive close to the shocking case of a brazenly public assassination that captured the world’s attention a little more than two years ago. Doan Thi Huong, 28, left the Malaysia jail Friday, her lawyer confirmed to TIME, and will be flown home in the evening. Huong was sentenced in early April to three years and four months in prison after she accepted a lesser charge of “voluntarily causing injury,” and her early release was expected. The release comes just less than two months after Siti Aisyah, the Indonesian woman who was also tried in the case, was unexpectedly freed. “We were all taken by surprise at Aisyah’s release,” Hisyam Teh Po Teik, the lawyer representing Hoang, said. Finding the sudden decision unfair, Teh issued a request to the attorney general for the charge to be dropped for his client too, but it was turned down. “We made a second representation after that, which was when he [the attorney general] finally conceded, likely because of the criticism that he faced for the earlier refusal,” Teh said. On Feb. 13, 2017, Kim Jong Nam was waiting for a flight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia when two women approached him. One grabbed him from behind while the other pressed her hand to his face, CCTV footage showed. It was later revealed that he was exposed to the toxic VX nerve agent, a synthetic chemical weapon so lethal that just a fraction of a drop can fatally disrupt the nervous system. Shortly after, Kim began to feel ill and eventually died en route to the hospital. He was 45, and was the presumed heir to the hermit state until he fell out of favor and moved to Macau after a 2001 incident during which he was seized by Japanese authorities in a Tokyo airport for traveling on a forged passport. Still, there is speculation that Kim Jong Un felt threatened by the older half-sibling, who criticized the regime from afar. Huong and Aisyah, both apprehended in the days after being captured on security cameras, pleaded not guilty. They said that they thought they were executing a prank for a TV show and did not know who the man was or that they were carrying out a hit. Malaysian authorities charged the two with murder, and also named four North Korean men as suspects, though none have been charged.",The Vietnamese Woman in Kim Jong Nam's Murder Case Has Been Freed From Jail,"May 3, 2019"
1012,Vivian Nereim and Donna Abu-Nasr / Bloomberg,"Saudi Arabian authorities on Thursday temporarily released at least four women’s rights activists whose arrests, on charges of undermining state security, had provoked an international outcry and added to criticism of the kingdom’s human rights record. The detainees who were freed pending trial included Hatoon Al Fassi, a historian; researcher Abeer Namankani; and Amal Al Harbi, according to Mohammed al-Turki, who works in the office of Faraj al-Oqla, a lawyer who represents the women. They “are now at home with their families,” Al-Turki said, pointing out that further court proceedings await the women after the holy month of Ramadan. “They are in good health,” he added. “We saw them. They’re in good spirits.” Loujain Al-Hathloul, 29, the best known of the female detainees, remains in custody. Three more women who had been in custody with them were temporarily released in March. Their trial is expected to resume after Ramadan. It wasn’t clear why the women were released or under what conditions, and the government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. It could be a gesture of leniency before Ramadan. Sending the women home after months of detention — even temporarily — could also be a sign that the kingdom is trying to bring an end to a case that stirred controversy at home and abroad as it also deals with the fallout from the murder of the columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and continuing criticism of the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. The women had become a symbol of a political crackdown led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, even as he opens up the economy and loosens social restrictions. Their arrests, beginning in May 2018, precipitated a diplomatic crisis with Canada that’s yet to be fully resolved. Some of the women had fought for years to end Saudi Arabia’s ban on women driving — lifted soon after their arrests — and spoke out against the country’s guardianship system, which requires women to get permission from a male relative to travel or marry.",Saudi Arabia Temporarily Releases Four Detained Women's Rights Activists,"May 3, 2019"

MarineTraffic.com lists the vessel in port at St. Lucia as the Freewinds. A ship with that name is owned by a Panamanian company linked to the Church of Scientology. NBC News also reported that a St. Lucia coast guard official confirmed that the quarantined vessel belonged to the church. The Church of Scientology did not respond to TIME’s requests for comment. St. Lucia is providing the ship with 100 doses of measles vaccine at the request of the ship’s doctor, St. Lucia’s Department of Health and Wellness said in a statement. The ship’s doctor is currently monitoring the condition of the ship’s crew and passengers. “Given the highly infectious nature of Measles, along with the possibility that other persons onboard the vessel may have been in contact with and are now possibly infectious due to this disease, a decision was made not to allow persons to disembark. This decision to [quarantine] the ship is in keeping with the health laws of St. Lucia,” the St. Lucia health department said. Neither the passengers nor the ship’s crew are permitted to disembark, officials say. St. Lucia learned about the crew member’s condition from a International Health Regulation focal point official in the Dutch Caribbean and then verified the diagnosis through other health agencies, the St. Lucia health department said. The ship is permitted to leave the port if it chooses to, Merlene Fredericks-James, St. Lucia’s chief medical officer, said in a statement. Scientology does not have an official position on vaccines, Rev. John Carmichael, the president of the Church of Scientology in New York, said in an interview with Beliefnet. However, the church emphasizes the “harmful effects of drugs, toxins and other chemicals that lodge in the body and create a biochemical barrier to spiritual well-being,” according to its website.

1014,Olivia B. Waxman,"When the Anti-Defamation League announced on Tuesday that anti-Semitic assaults had doubled in the U.S. from 2017 to 2018, the news was shocking but, sadly, not entirely surprising: a shooting left one dead at a California synagogue last Sunday, just days before Thursday’s observance of Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day. One effect of that sobering shift is being felt in New York City at a museum located a 10-minute walk from the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. Its full name declares it “The Museum of Jewish Heritage — A Living Memorial to the Holocaust” and it was built with six sides to represent the six million Jewish people who died in the Holocaust. Even so, when it opened in 1997, its founders decided to put an emphasis on Jewish heritage in order to differentiate it from the recently opened the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. But in the last year, the museum’s board has considered modifying its name, in order to give the Holocaust more prominent placement. While the museum hasn’t officially changed its name yet, its new emphasis is already clear: starting May 8, it will host the largest-ever traveling exhibit on Auschwitz, Nazi Germany’s biggest killing center. The exhibition Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away opens on the anniversary of the 1945 surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II. It features more than 600 original objects, including major loans from the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum that had never been seen outside of Poland before the exhibition firm Musealia first produced the show in Madrid from December 2017 to February 2019. Though it was just one of the half-dozen Nazi camps that scholars identify as “killing centers,” there’s a reason Auschwitz is the focus of this new phase of the museum’s life. “Auschwitz has become the focus of the history of the Holocaust,” says the exhibit’s chief curator, Robert Jan van Pelt, an architectural historian who is considered by many as the preeminent scholar of Auschwitz. One key to its role in Holocaust education is that from 1942 to 1944, Auschwitz became the largest of those killing centers. Of the approximately 1.3 million people who were deported to Auschwitz, 1.1 million of those were Jewish people, and of those 1.1 million Jewish people, 1 million were murdered or died there. But, crucially, enough of those who were sent there survived to speak of what they had seen — and in the years since, that has made all the difference. “It’s the only extermination camp with modern crematoria equipped with gas chambers, which created an efficient factory of death,” says van Pelt, “but it also encompassed a slave labor camp, from which there were actually enough survivors to give a substantial body of testimony after the war.” About 200,000 Auschwitz prisoners left the camp, including survivors sent to other camps as well as those liberated from Auschwitz when the Soviet Army rescued an estimated 7,000 prisoners on Jan. 27, 1945.",Why Auschwitz Plays Such a Central Role in Holocaust Remembrance,"May 2, 2019"
1015,Madeline Roache,"More Jews were killed in anti-Semitic violence around the world in 2018 than during any other year in decades, according to a report released Wednesday by the Kantor Center at Tel Aviv University. The result has been a “sense of emergency” among Jews in many countries, resulting from concerns over both their security and their “place” in society, said Moshe Kantor, the president of the European Jewish Congress, during an address Wednesday. “Anti-Semitism has progressed to the point of calling into question the very continuation of Jewish life in Europe,” he said. The report noted that most of the dramatic increase in deaths was the result of a single event: October’s mass shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue, which left 11 worshipers dead. The countries included in the report with the highest number of cases of anti-Semitic violence include the U.S. (with over 100 cases), the United Kingdom (68 cases) and France and Germany (35 cases each.) The situation is at its worst in Western European countries — particularly in Germany, where the the Kantor Center recorded a 70% increase in violent anti-Semitism. In France, nine out of 10 Jewish students said they experienced anti-Semitism at least once during their studies. In the U.K., physical assaults were down by 17%, but there were a total of 1,652 documented anti-Semitic incidents, a 16% rise from 2017. The Kantor Center refers to a recent report by the European Union (E.U.) Fundamental Rights Agency showing that 38% of Jews in the E.U. said they have considered leaving Europe because they fear for their safety. Anti-Semitism was considered the biggest social or political problem by 85% of respondents in their E.U. countries. The report found that college campuses in America are becoming “increasingly hostile for Jewish students who support Israel.” It cites a 2018 survey that revealed 238 incidents of harassment, vandalism and assault targeting Jewish students on 118 campuses across the U.S. In New York, city police noted a 22% rise in violent anti-Semitic attacks, according to the report. A different report released in 2018 by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) recorded a total of 1,879 attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions across the U.S. That marked a 5% decrease from the 1,986 incidents reported in 2017, but was the third-highest number on record since the ADL started tracking such data in the 1970s. The situation is “particularly volatile” in the U.S., Michael Berkowitz, professor of Modern Jewish History at University College London, tells TIME. “The combination of a gun culture and conspiracy theories, the extreme right-wing and white supremacy, has created a dangerous situation for Jews,” says Berkowitz, who was not involved in creating either report.","Surge in Anti-Semitic Attacks Has Caused a 'Sense of Emergency' Among Jews Worldwide, New Report Says","May 2, 2019"
1016,Katherine Pomerantz,"The May 13, 2019, International cover of TIME examines South Africa as “the world’s most unequal country.” Depicting a topic as expansive as inequality in a single frame is a challenge, especially since unequal experiences are often lived adjacently, but separately. Photographer Johnny Miller has successfully achieved a method of visualizing inequality—by using a drone to spotlight from above how rich and poor can inhabit spaces that are right next to each other, but so different. Miller’s drone work from South Africa proved to be the perfect fit for Aryn Baker’s cover story, providing a shockingly honest look at inequality in a way that is not visible from the ground. The cover image shows two neighborhoods outside of Johannesburg, with wealthy Primrose on the left and the informal settlement of Makause on the right. Miller calls his visualization of inequality “Unequal Scenes,” and the project has expanded beyond South Africa, featuring bird’s-eye scenes of inequality from Baltimore, Mumbai, Mexico City, Nairobi and more. About the project Miller says, “‘Unequal Scenes’ started in 2016 in Cape Town. I had studied the post-apartheid city (coursework at the University of Cape Town) during my master’s studies and was interested in how a drone could see the divides in the city a new way. South Africa was so ruthlessly and effectively segregated during apartheid, I just had an idea that by seeing it from the air it would help make that hit home. That the architecture itself is a dividing factor.”   “Unequal Scenes” has become almost a full-time undertaking for Miller. He’s planning to visit different parts of the world and hopes to grow the project by involving students, activists, other photographers––anyone interested in seeing the world from a different perspective.

1018,Aryn Baker,"On April 15, TIME met with President Cyril Ramaphosa at his official residence, three weeks before the May 8 election. A longtime antiapartheid activist and high-ranking official of the ANC, the 66-year-old became Deputy President in 2014 and South Africa’s fifth President in February 2018 after Jacob Zuma resigned amid allegations of corruption and “state -capture”—when private companies dictate government policy. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  TIME: You worked closely with Nelson Mandela when South Africa had its first democratic elections in 1994. Twenty-five years on, what are you doing as President to build on his vision? Cyril Ramaphosa: Nelson Mandela laid the foundation for South Africa to be what it is today. Before he became President, months after his release from prison [in 1990], Nelson Mandela took his time to go through the country, just to see how our people were living. He came back and he said our people were living under great hardships, and he was determined to make a great effort at changing the horror that he had seen. He introduced what you could call a quasi-social welfare system that has reduced the harsh impact of poverty on our people. Much of what we are doing [in the African National Congress] is carrying on Mandela’s legacy. South Africa must emerge out of this widespread poverty. We must increase our people’s capabilities, both economically and educationally so that we can create an economy that will be able to sustain the livelihoods of these 57 million people. The ANC has had 25 years to reduce poverty, yet last year the World Bank declared that South Africa is the most unequal society in the world. What is to blame for that? That inequality has its roots in our past. For instance, on education, the apartheid regime made sure that it spent almost five to six times more on a white child than it did on a black child. Economically, black people were prevented from owning businesses in the so-called white areas. They were prevented from getting into professions. So when we got into power, we had to deal with three things: inequality, poverty and unemployment. Poverty to a large extent has been reduced, we have reduced unemployment, we have almost more than doubled the size of the economy. But inequality has remained extremely stubborn. That [is because of] an economy that is not growing fast enough. We’ve also made some mistakes. Like what? Like, for instance, apartheid -designed that black people would live far away from the economic centers of our country. I was born literally 5 km from -Johannesburg, but then we were [-forcibly] moved 30 km out. People spend more than 40% of their income on transport to come to the economic centers. Those are some of the things that we didn’t pay close attention to, because instead of densifying our cities to bring poorer people into the cities, we continued to build houses. And we’ve built 4.3 million houses farther and farther away from the cities. That exacerbated our poverty.",The President of South Africa on Finding That 'Mandela Magic' to Fix the Country,"May 2, 2019"
1019,Billy Perrigo,"Eight days after the April 21 bombings in Sri Lanka left at least 253 dead, the government announced that all face coverings would be banned in public, saying the move would help the search for those involved. The bombings, carried out by alleged Islamist militants who targeted churches and high-end hotels, were the most fatal violence the country has suffered since its civil war ended in 2009. Although the ban did not specifically mention Islamic veils, critics have denounced the measure for stirring suspicions against Muslims, who make up 9.7% of Sri Lanka’s diverse population. After ISIS on April 23 claimed responsibility for the attacks, there were reports of mobs roaming the streets and beatings of Muslim residents. Nearly 1,000 mostly Muslim refugees fled or were forced out of their homes in the week following the bombings, according to Human Rights Watch. No deaths have so far been reported, but in that climate, Muslim community leaders say, the ban on face coverings was ill-conceived–especially given that they had already agreed to a voluntary suspension of veil wearing. The face-covering ban hasn’t been the only decision to draw scrutiny of Sri Lanka’s response to the Easter Sunday attacks. For nine days after the attacks, the government blocked social-media services including Facebook and WhatsApp in an attempt to stop the spread of misinformation; it’s unclear whether that made a difference. Meanwhile, some of those behind the plot are still believed to be at large. A shoot-out on April 26 left 15 people dead, including three suspected suicide bombers and six children, according to authorities. The Sri Lankan government has been heavily criticized for its failure to prevent the attacks despite receiving advance warnings from Indian intelligence agencies. The country has a long history of ethnic tension, and in recent years Buddhist nationalists (who are part of the Sinhalese majority) have attacked both Muslims and Christians. With presidential elections due to be held by the end of 2019, whether their government can protect the country from future violence–without widening religious fault lines–is on the minds of many Sri Lankans.

1020,Karl Vick,"In the predawn hours of April 30, the contest for control of Venezuela once again appeared to be coming to a head. Juan Guaidó, the young reformer who claims the mantle of President, announced from inside a military base in the capital, Caracas, that he was taking charge. And nearby stood evidence that the security forces were finally falling in line: fellow opposition leader Leopoldo López, freed from house arrest, his guards apparently having defected. “At this moment, I am with the main military units of our armed forces, starting the final phase of Operation Liberty,” Guaidó said. He called on Venezuelans to gather in the streets to take power from Nicolás Maduro, who has sat in the presidential palace since 2013 but whose presidency has been deemed null and void by much of the international community. By day’s end, however, the uprising was anything but final–and the only thing clear was how much has changed in Latin American politics in the 21st century. From 1900 to 2006, power changed hands in the region 162 times via military coup, typically announced from the studio of a state broadcaster. In a striking number of cases–at least 41, by the count of a Harvard study–the force behind the coup was the U.S., which maintained a proprietary hold over the hemisphere it regarded as its realm. This time the picture is as diffuse as the forces holding the situation in stalemate. Washington clearly has an appetite for toppling Maduro, as tweets from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence made clear. But Uncle Sam could credibly claim to be one of a crowd. Some 50 nations recognize Guaidó’s claim to the presidency, and support also came in tweets from the governments of Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay and others. It was Chile that opened a diplomatic residence to López, free from house arrest but not safe in a divided and dangerous Caracas. He later moved to the Spanish embassy. Just as in February, when Guaidó traveled to Venezuela’s border with Colombia in hopes of riding blockaded aid trucks to victory, things did not go as planned. Geoff Ramsey, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, told TIME the day showed that “neither the regime nor the opposition is as strong as they thought they were.” Neither is Washington. As Maduro’s security forces resisted and Guaidó’s call to action fizzled, top Trump Administration officials were reduced to accusing Maduro loyalists of backing out of promises to defect. So the standoff resumed. Maduro remains deeply unpopular, tied as he is to the near total collapse of the economy, which has driven 3.7 million Venezuelans to leave the oil-rich country. That exodus into the neighboring nations has galvanized the region to overthrow Maduro–but nonviolently. Yet despite U.S. economic sanctions, Maduro still has funds to buy the loyalty of senior military officers. And Guaidó isn’t the only one with international backers. Maduro has the support of Cuba, China and, most of all, Russia, drawn both by oil and ambition. And ordinary Venezuelans fear the plainclothes thugs loyal to Maduro known as colectivos, notorious for firing into crowds and targeting protesters.","In Venezuela, Uncle Sam Roots From the Sidelines","May 2, 2019"

Some intelligence officers suspect the U.S. Army veteran and Hong Kong native compromised CIA sources in China, leading to the collapse of the agency’s network there, reports the Washington Post. Several CIA agents were killed as China pushed the agency out of the country. “Lee sold out his country, conspired to become a spy for a foreign government, and then repeatedly lied to investigators about his conduct,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, reports the Post. Lee, 54, left the CIA in 2007 after 13 years of service. He was approached by Chinese intelligence officers in 2010 while living in Hong Kong, according to a Department of Justice press release. In exchange for information he had gained while working as a CIA case officer, the Chinese officers offered him $100,000 and said they would take care of him “for life.” Lee received multiple requests for information between May 2010 and at least 2011 and deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars into his bank account between May 2010 and December 2013, according to the DoJ. The FBI became suspicious of Lee after receiving information from an informant in China, according to the Post. They got him to return to the U.S. in 2012 by offering him the chance to re-join the CIA. When law enforcement searched his Honolulu hotel room, they found a thumb drive containing a document detailing a secret CIA operation and notebooks with the real names and phone numbers of operatives and details about secret facilities written in them, according to the Post. The CIA interviewed Lee multiple times during 2012, during which he did not disclose that he had received requests from Chinese intelligence agents. In 2013, the FBI also interviewed him multiple times. During one he admitted that he had received tasks from China. He also denied knowledge of the thumb drive and document found in his hotel room, before later admitting that he created the document but had not passed it on. In further interviews, Lee changed his story several times. “By knowingly aiding a foreign government, Mr. Lee put our country’s national security at serious risk and also threatened the safety and personal security of innocent people, namely his former intelligence colleagues,” said John Brown, Assistant Director for Counterintelligence for FBI, according to the Department of Justice.",Former CIA Officer Pleads Guilty to Conspiring to Spy for China,"May 2, 2019"
1024,Mahita Gajanan,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said military intervention in Venezuela “is possible,” to support opposition leader Juan Guaidó’s attempts at an uprising against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government. Clashes between anti-government protestors and Venezuelan security forces broke out Tuesday following a call from Guaidó for a mutiny. The demonstrations included one moment when several armored vehicles hit at least two people while driving into a group of opposition protestors, the Associated Press reports. Video footage of the unrest showed protestors running from armored vehicles, defending themselves with rocks and homemade bombs. Maduro said Tuesday that attempted “coup” by Guaidó was defeated and that the country will never surrender to “imperialist forces” in an address on state television. “Now you can see Venezuela largely in peace,” he said. Pompeo, who previously claimed that Maduro was ready to fly to Cuba after the military uprising but decided to stay in Venezuela after being persuaded by Russia to remain, said Wednesday that military intervention could happen in light of the uprising. “Military action is possible. If that’s what’s required, that’s what the United States will do,” he told Fox Business Network. Maduro has denied Pompeo’s claim that the Venezuelan president was ready to leave to Cuba. “How crazy can things get?

1025,John Walcott,"President Donald Trump did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a favor last week, delaying the start of negotiations on a tricky trade decision, potentially pushing it past that country’s elections in July, three officials briefed on the talks tell TIME. Trump has said repeatedly that he values his relationship with Abe, and his decision to ignore the advice of Special Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that the two negotiate on Japanese auto exports and U.S. agricultural products during their meeting last week is a reflection of that personal touch. Still, Trump has not let go of his threat to impose a 25% tariff on Japanese autos if the country doesn’t open its market to more U.S. beef and other agricultural products. The delay could end up postponing the decision until after elections this summer for the upper house of the Diet, Japan’s parliament, but the Trump Administration’s public line is that they are moving ahead. During the April 26 meeting with Abe, Trump said that he hopes the trade talks will “go quickly” and suggested that his Administration aims to negotiate an autos-for-agriculture deal with Japan by the time he visits Tokyo in late May to meet the new Emperor Naruhito, who will succeed his father Akihito. However, officials from both countries tell TIME that although Lighthizer pressed for a quick agreement from Japan to eliminate its steep tariffs on U.S. farm products, negotiators have made little or no progress on framing such a deal. The White House declined to comment. Read More: Japan Has Big Plans for a U.S. Summit. But Trump Just Wants to Talk Cars and Military Costs. Although the House of Councillors has little power, Japan’s farm lobby has a great deal, and making any concession on beef and other products without getting something in return would weaken Abe and his Liberal Democratic Party, especially if elections for the more powerful lower house of the Diet are also scheduled for July.","Trump Gave the Japanese Prime Minister a Break on Trade, For Now","May 1, 2019"
1026,TIME Staff,"A freelance reporter missing in Tanzania, a newspaper editor facing censorship in South Sudan and two journalists detained in Nicaragua are all among those on this month’s list of the 10 Most Urgent threats to press freedom. The list — released monthly by the One Free Press Coalition, which was founded by a dozen news organizations, including TIME, with the goal of defending journalists under attack — identifies 10 of the most severe examples of threats to press freedom around the world. Last year, TIME named The Guardians the 2018 Person of the Year, recognizing four journalists and one news organization for their work in the face of threats. One of those journalists, Jamal Khashoggi, remains on the 10 Most Urgent list for the month of May. At the TIME 100 Summit last week, senior White House adviser Jared Kushner said he does not “dispute” the conclusion by U.S. intelligence officials that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman ordered Khashoggi’s death. Kushner said he spoke to bin Salman after Khashoggi’s death and urged him to “be as transparent as possible.” In April, the U.S. State Department barred 16 Saudis from the country for their roles in Khashoggi’s killing, but the Trump Administration has not publicly held bin Salman responsible, leading to calls for greater accountability. Read about the journalists on the May list below, included in no specific order: Azory Gwanda, a freelance journalist working in rural Tanzania, has been missing since November 21, 2017. Before his disappearance, Gwanda had been investigating mysterious killings in his community. The Tanzanian government has so far failed to launch a credible investigation into his case. Following their investigation into a security force massacre of Rohingya men and boys in western Rakhine State, the pair were convicted under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years each in prison, even though a policeman testified that they had been entrapped. The Myanmar Supreme Court recently upheld their convictions. In December, Nicaraguan police raided TV station 100% Noticias and arrested station director Miguel Mora and Lucía Pineda, its news director. Both journalists are being held on charges of “inciting hate and violence” and have been denied consistent access to legal services.",These Are the 10 'Most Urgent' Cases of Threats to Press Freedom Around the World,"May 1, 2019"
1027,W.J. Hennigan,"The call for help came from half a world away to a windowless room at a remote airbase in South Dakota. An American military advisor was calling from eastern Syria, asking the team at Ellsworth Air Force Base to deploy a drone to hunt down a small group of ISIS gunmen harassing the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the U.S.-backed force fighting in the region. In a series of hit-and-run attacks, the ISIS gunmen had turned the SDF’s makeshift outpost into a shooting gallery, injuring several Syrian troops and putting the U.S. advisors at-risk before melting into the nearby civilian population. Within minutes, the operators directed a MQ-9 Reaper drone “on-station” in the eastern town of Baghouz to wait for the gunmen to return. But when they appeared, the operators held fire. Rather than launch an airstrike, the operators watched the suspects mount another attack, speed away in a tan vehicle, and then drive to a low-slung building with a thatch-roof on the outskirts of town. There, the drone operators quietly surveilled the suspected terrorists from above. For two days, the operators watched as the militants brought in more vehicles and weapons. They watched as other people came and went, and gathered intelligence on the visitors. But when the gunmen started preparing for another attack, the operators were cleared to strike. The drone launched two missiles — first one, then another — which obliterated the building destroying the weapons cache and killing the fighters believed to be inside. “After that, there weren’t any other attacks in the area,” says an Air Force intelligence analyst, who, like others spoke to TIME on the condition of anonymity due to security concerns. The airstrike described here occurred in November, but similar events have become routine in recent months, indicative of a new phase of the U.S.-led effort against ISIS. While the high-tempo, street-by-street fight against the militant organization is over, it has been replaced by a deliberative hunt for ISIS leaders, underground cell commanders and other so-called high-value individuals. Indeed, ISIS leadership ranks have proven resilient despite the five years of war. The group, analysts say, has been quick to adapt to new circumstances. No longer capable of seizing and holding territory, the surviving foot soldiers have instead gone back to its guerrilla roots, carrying out ambushes, bombings and assassinations. “ISIS has morphed into a less pressing force, but it has not completely gone away,” said Col. Julian Cheater, 432nd Wing commander, who oversees Air Force drone operations. “While caliphate has been defeated, we still need to work with our ground partners to make sure that the remaining embers don’t flare up again.”",The Most-Wanted ISIS Leader Is Still Alive.

1028,Ciara Nugent,"Clashes broke out in Caracas between anti-government protesters and Venezuelan security forces Tuesday after Juan Guaidó, the leader of Venezuela’s opposition-held parliament, called for a military uprising against Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian regime. In a video live-streamed on Twitter early Tuesday, Guaidó was seen standing at La Carlota airbase in Caracas, flanked by a few dozen troops who apparently defected from the government and Leopoldo López, an opposition politician. Lopez had been in prison or under house arrest since 2014, after he led a series of protests against the government. He said that members of the military had freed him on Guaidó’s orders. Maduro’s information minister called the defections “a coup” by “a small group of military traitors” and said the government was putting it down. The Associated Press reported that troops loyal to Maduro fired tear gas from inside the airbase on to a nearby highway overpass, where Lopez was addressing a crowd of civilians soon after Guaidó’s announcement. Clashes continued around the city Tuesday, with photos and footage showing military loyal to the government exchanging tear gas canisters with protesters. In one clip, an armored car appears to plow into a crowd of protesters on a highway, knocking some to the ground. This new push from Guaidó is an attempt to convince the top military brass to join the opposition to Maduro’s government, Diego Moya-Ocampos, a Venezuela expert at risk analysts IHS Markit, tells TIME. “It was an effort to catch Maduro’s security forces by surprise and try to activate a spark to escalate protest beyond the capacity of Maduro’s forces to contain them,” he said. “And at the same time secure the support of those members of the armed forces who are increasingly discontent with Maduro over shortages of food, basic goods, electricity and water.”",Clashes in Caracas After Venezuelan Opposition Leader Calls for Military Uprising,"Updated: April 30, 2019 3:02 PM ET"
1029,Hillary Leung,"Japan is set to usher in a new imperial era come May 1: Crown Prince Naruhito will take the throne, ushering in the Reiwa Era and becoming the 126th emperor of Japan. The Japanese monarchy is said to be the world’s oldest, but Japan is just one of roughly a dozen countries in Asia with monarchs as their head of state. In some, the monarchs play a solely ceremonial role, while in others, such as Brunei, they possess considerable political power. Given all the attention over his succession, Naruhito is probably the best known scion of an Asian royal house—along with Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn, whose three-day coronation ceremony begins on May 4. Here are some other Asian royals you may be less familiar with. Prince Azim, 36, is the second son of the tiny nation’s Sultan. Described by Forbes as a “paparazzi favorite”, the prince is well known for hosting A-list parties with celebrity guests the likes of Janet Jackson and Pamela Anderson. In 2007, he reportedly hired a private jet to fly an almost $4 million necklace to Mariah Carey. The prince is also involved in the film business, having produced a number of pictures under the name Azim Bolkiah. On IMDb, he is credited for his work in six movies including You’re Not You, a 2014 film that stars Hilary Swank and saw a sellout premier at the Tokyo International Film Festival. The 27-year-old Prince Abdul Mateen is the fourth son of the Sultan of Brunei. Leading a less extravagant (though still opulent) life than his older half-brother, the prince graduated from the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in 2016, where his Facebook page states he studied international diplomacy. Prior to that, he served as a lieutenant in the Brunei armed services and graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the U.K., according to an interview he did with GQ Thailand in 2016. The Prince’s active lifestyle is evident on his Instagram page, where he has 1.1 million followers. He plays water polo competitively, is an equestrian and also does martial arts. “The moment I feel my fitness level dropping, it makes me feel funny, so being active and staying in shape is very important to me,” he told GQ Thailand. Prince Jigme became king after his father, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, abdicated the throne in 2006. The 39-year-old studied at boarding school Phillips Andover Academy in Massachusetts before obtaining a degree in political science from Oxford University. He and his wife hosted the U.K.’s Duke and Duchess of Cambridge when they visited Bhutan in April 2016.","New Japanese and Thai Monarchs Are In the Spotlight, But Here Are Some of Asia's Other Royals","April 30, 2019"

Baristas are spelling it out in foam atop lattes, while a seal at an aquarium southeast of Tokyo has apparently learned to write it. Reiwa fever has swept Japan, as the country prepares to welcome its 126th emperor—the current Crown Prince Naruhito—who will usher in the era on May 1. His father, Emperor Akihito, abdicates the throne on Apr. 30. After heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, Akihito, 85, has hinted for some time that he wanted to step down for health and age reasons. “I am worried that it may become more difficult for me to carry out my duties as the symbol of the state,” he said in 2016 in a rare televised address. Japan’s monarchs are expected to serve until death, but parliament passed special legislation to allow Akihito to step down. Here’s what you need to know as Japan’s Heisei (achieving peace) era ends and the Reiwa (beautiful harmony) era begins. Kōtaishi Naruhito Shinnō, more commonly known as Crown Prince Naruhito, was born February 23, 1960 as Akihito’s oldest son. He grew up with his siblings and parents in Tokyo’s moat-protected Imperial Palace. After earning a history degree at Gakushuin University, where he wrote a thesis on medieval water transport, the prince became the first Japanese royal to study overseas when he spent two years at Merton College, Oxford. The book he wrote chronicling his time there, The Thames and I: A Memoir of Two Years at Oxford, has just been re-issued in English. The prince’s interest in water management extends beyond academia. Since 2007, he has served as honorary president of the U.N. Secretary General’s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation, and he has spoken frequently on the topic at international conferences. “He has been actively involved in international environmental issues in recent years,” Hideya Kawanishi, associate professor at Nagoya University and an author of several books on Japan’s emperors, tells TIME.

This week in Japan, a new set of royals is coming to the world stage. On Wednesday, 59-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito will take over the “Chrysanthemum Throne” from his father, 85-year-old Emperor Akihito, who decided to step down due to his health and age. Naruhito’s wife, Princess Masako, will be by his side as the country’s next Empress. Although the new royals are believed to be more modern than their predecessors, soon-to-be Emperor Naruhito steps into an imperial system that has been in place for thousands of years and is steeped in history. The monarchy — despite its lack of social media accounts — plays an important symbolic role in Japanese culture. Here are five things you need to know. When Emperor Akihito steps down this week, he will be the first Japanese emperor to do so in more than 200 years. A 1889 law required monarchs to reign until their death to avoid power struggles between current and retired emperors, but an exception is being made for the elderly emperor, who has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer. He hinted in 2016 that it might be time for him to retire. “I am worried that it may become more difficult for me to carry out my duties as the symbol of the state,” he said in a rare televised address. After several months of discussions and expert consultations, Japan’s parliament passed special legislation in June 2017, to allow him to step down.

1032,Ciara Nugent,"Spain goes to the polls Sunday for its third general election in four years, as socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez tries to break the political deadlock that has gripped his country and left him unable to govern.  Over the last five years, the rise of new political forces – including the far-right – and a constitutional crisis over Catalan leaders‘ attempt to secede unilaterally from Spain, have transformed the political landscape, upending the two-party system in which the leftwing Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) and rightwing Popular Party (PP) have ruled since the 1980s. With some 30% of voters still undecided, Spain’s political future has rarely been so uncertain. Here’s what to know about the Spanish elections: Since 2014, several newly relevant parties –leftist Podemos (We Can), centre-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) and, most recently, far-right Vox – have surged in support by capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction over slow economic recovery, corruption scandals and the Catalan secessionist movement. Their rise has fragmented the vote, making it increasingly difficult for any one party to win enough seats in congress to govern effectively. The current Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, got the job partly as a result of this unstable situation. In May 2018, his PSOE filed a no-confidence motion in then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, after a court found Rajoy’s party had benefited from an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. The socialists passed the no-confidence motion – the first in the democratic era – with the help of Podemos and small regional parties, ousting Rajoy and allowing Sanchez to take over. But Sánchez was forced to call fresh elections in February, when his minority socialist government failed to get enough votes from the other parties to pass a budget for 2019. “Since the party system broke down, Spain has been in a political deadlock,” Ilke Toygur, an analyst at Spanish think tank the Elcano Royal Institute, tells TIME. “We’re again seeing really fierce battles between parties for ground on the right and on the left. And we might still end up in a deadlock.” Polls suggest Sánchez’s PSOE will be the largest party in congress and their support currently stands at around 29%, according to an aggregated poll. Sánchez is avowedly liberal, and has emphasized his commitment to feminism since taking office, when he appointed the world’s most female cabinet, with 10 of 16 positions going to women. He has centered his campaign on economic justice, promising to raise the minimum wage and overhaul the way pensions are allocated. Alluding to his unusual entry into office, he has called on Spaniards to make the election “an enormous no-confidence motion against inequality, corruption and exasperation [with] the current way of doing politics.”",Spain Is Going to the Polls for the Third Time in Four Years.

In an interview with Gayle King CBS This Morning on Friday, Kimberly Endicott told the story of how she was kidnapped alongside her tour guide, Jean-Paul Mirenge, in Queen Elizabeth National Park in southwestern Uganda on April 2. The pair were rescued by Ugandan authorities on April 7, according to the Associated Press. Endicott said that she was able to realize a dream during the trip -– seeing gorillas. On her first day of in Uganda, two of the apes even came up to and touched her. “All of the guides said, ‘You are very lucky,'” Endicott said. On the third day of her trip, however, Endicott’s vacation took a dark turn. Endicott was driving through the park with Mierenge and an elderly Canadian couple when four men walked out of the bushes. Endicott said that because they were carrying guns, she initially believed that the men were park rangers. However, she quickly realized that they were “ragtag” and not wearing uniforms. “They make us get out of the vehicle. They make us sit on the ground. And that’s where things go very, I don’t know how to describe it. There’s really not a word to describe what that felt like,” she said. “Pure fear? But that almost doesn’t do it justice.” The men forced Mirenge and Endicott to run out into the park with them, leaving behind the Canadian couple and the vehicle. Endicott said that she became more afraid when she noticed that her captor was shaking, and wondered if he was on drugs. She later decided that she needed to “humanize” herself to her captors. Although she was never assaulted during the ordeal, she said she was in fear the entire time.",'There’s No Place to Run.' American Tourist Describes Kidnapping in Uganda,"April 26, 2019"
1034,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: Last week, Russia’s parliament approved a law that might allow the country to cordon off its internet from the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented “sovereign” internet. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to sign it in short order. Why It Matters: It matters because if Russia is able to pull this off (a very big if), it will be the most tangible step yet towards fracturing the web. It could also be a harbinger of things to come in other countries. This law will regulate how internet traffic moves through critical infrastructure for the internet. By November internet service providers will have to adopt new routing and filtering technology and grant regulators the authority to directly monitor and censor content it deems objectionable. But the real groundbreaker is the intent to create a national domain name system (DNS) by 2021, probably as a back-up to the existing global system that translates domain names into numerical addresses. If Russia builds a workable version and switches it on, traffic would not enter or leave Russia’s borders. In effect, it means turning on a standalone Russian internet, disconnected from the rest of the world. No country has ever tried to build its own internet architecture before. Even China, the world leader when it comes to internet censorship, has built its “Great Firewall” on the existing global DNS—it filters traffic, but is still part of the same worldwide addressing system. The authors of Russia’s law say it will make the internet in Russia more resilient against outside attacks, but its main effect is to vastly expand the government’s control of the internet and its underlying infrastructure. The national DNS probably isn’t meant for daily use but instead for government-defined emergencies. Of course, an emergency for the Kremlin could be widespread protests against the government like the country experienced in 2011-2012, which prompted the first online censorship laws. What Happens Next: That’s the trillion-dollar question. Putin will sign the legislation into law, but it’s far from clear that creating a standalone internet is technologically possible or financially wise. Russia attempted to disconnect from the global internet in 2015 in a test case, but foreign data still managed to trickle in. And successfully pulling this off will require billions of rubles in investments by Moscow or the telecom industry, not counting any losses to the economy if testing the system causes service outages. Regardless, plenty of emerging markets will be watching the Russian test case closely. If Moscow pulls this off, other governments could be tempted to follow suit.",The Quick Read About… Russia’s New Internet Law,"April 26, 2019"
1035,Madeline Roache,"When the Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev came to Paris to tour with the Kirov ballet company in 1961, he was “like a wild animal out of a cage,” says Oleg Ivenko, the 26-year-old Ukrainian dancer and actor who plays Nureyev in the new movie The White Crow, out April 26 in the United States. “He got a taste of freedom and another world.” And once he got that taste, there was no going back — literally. Nureyev defected to the West in June of 1961, at the height of the Cold War, an act considered treason in the Soviet Union. The defection made international news and thrust the Russian dancer, whose talent drew millions of new fans to the theater, into the public eye for the next 30 years. In April 1965, a TIME cover story profiled Nureyev, noting that he “stands out as one of the most electrifying male dancers of all time.” He was ballet’s first pop icon and transformed the role of men in the art form, says Tamara Rojo, the Director and Principal Dancer at the English National Ballet (ENB). The White Crow — which was a childhood nickname for Nureyev, because he was unusual — charts Nureyev’s story from his life of poverty in the Russian city of Ufa to his historic escape to France. It’s based on Julie Kavanagh’s 2007 biography of the dancer, with a script by British playwright David Hare and directed by Ralph Fiennes. Kavanagh, a journalist who also trained as a dancer, researched the dancer’s life for over a decade, prising open USSR records and interviewing dozens of those who were close to him. As TIME wrote in 1965 of his entry into the West, Nureyev’s story “could not have been more compelling if it had been choreographed by Alfred Hitchcock.” But how much of the movie version matches the real research? Here’s more on the man widely regarded as the best male dancer of his generation. In the movie, even before the defection, officers from Russia’s state security service, the KGB, follow Nureyev around Paris and repeatedly warn him against staying out late, as well as spending time with Clara Saint — the 21-year-old daughter of a wealthy Chilean artist — and other French creatives. As Kavanaugh writes in her book, Nureyev was in fact unpopular with Soviet authorities even before he decided to leave. His overt admiration for the West, coming at the height of the Cold War, alarmed them and was seen as a betrayal to the motherland’s communist ideals. He drew particular attention because ballet was a key propaganda tool used by the Soviet authorities to display its cultural supremacy to the West. Soviet dancers could be dropped from foreign excursions at any time for the “wrong” behavior, writes Kavanagh, and the KGB did have officers in Paris minding the ballet dancers on that 1961 trip — though it’s hard to say whether the level of surveillance in the movie matches exactly the real-life version of events. Nureyev’s defection was doubly humiliating because it came just two months after the Soviet Union outshone the West by sending the first person into space, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. In losing Nureyev, the Soviet Union also lost some of the international prestige it had just worked so hard to acquire. Much of the Western media seized on the defection as an ideological blow to the Soviets, a Cold War humiliation and a triumph for democracy.",The True Story Behind the Rudolf Nureyev Movie The White Crow,"April 26, 2019"
1036,Hillary Leung,"North Korean officials billed the U.S. $2 million for the medical care of comatose American Otto Warmbier before allowing him to be flown home from Pyongyang, the Washington Post reports. President Donald Trump said the U.S. never paid North Korea for Warmbier’s return in a tweet Friday morning. “No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else,” he said. According to the Post, State Department envoy Joseph Yun, who was in Pyongyang to take Warmbier home in June 2017 following news of his poor health condition, was instructed by North Korean officials to sign the agreement. Yun reportedly did so upon direction from Trump via then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The bill then went to the Treasury Department, the Post says, citing two unnamed people familiar with the situation. It is unclear whether the bill was ever paid. University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier, at the time 21, arrived in North Korea in late December 2015 on an organized tour of the state. After spending five days there, he was arrested at Pyongyang airport for allegedly stealing a propaganda poster from the hotel he and his group were staying at. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for what authorities considered a “hostile act.” North Korean officials said Warmbier suffered a brain injury after contracting botulism, a form of poisoning, while in detention. Upon news that the American had been in a coma for more than a year, Yu and a U.S. delegation arrived in Pyongyang to take him home. Warmbier died six days later in a Ohio hospital on June 19, 2017, after having suffered what doctors said was “severe injury to all regions of the brain.” Trump defended Kim over Warmbier’s mistreatment and death, saying he did not believe Kim knew about his condition and that prisons are “rough places” in which “bad things happen.” Fred Warmbier, Otto’s father, said he was never told about the hospital bill, according to the Post, and that it sounded like a “ransom” for his son.",President Trump Denies Paying North Korea's $2 Million Bill for Otto Warmbier's Release,"Updated: April 26, 2019 9:51 AM ET"

There they’ll find a sprawling 190,000 square foot facility where visitors can wander through three stories of exhibits on events that have shaped the history of Hong Kong and China, from the Opium Wars to the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during World War II. But there’s one event that cannot be found on display: the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre. To find out about that, visitors need to get back on the the subway and go two stops further into Kowloon and the city’s blue-collar Mongkok district. From there, it’s a short walk through markets with stalls hawking cheap clothing and electronic goods to an unmarked doorway of a nondescript commercial building lodged between a gas station and a noodle shop. Inside is the world’s only museum dedicated to the events of June 4, 1989. The door to the June 4 Museum was easy to find on Friday afternoon, when it celebrated its re-opening in a new location after a three-year closure. About 20 pro-Beijing protestors attempted to block the entrance, with police repeatedly asking them to step aside. Their screams, blasted through megaphones, could be heard from the museum on the tenth floor of the building, where—in a space the size of a one-room apartment—an exhibition details the history of the 1989 student-led democracy movement that was crushed by Chinese military force. Video footage of tanks rolling into Tiananmen Square, guns firing and an injured protestor receiving CPR plays on a loop on the far wall. “They’re trying to stop us from opening. No idea which organization they are from, but certainly its an agency of the Chinese Communist Party,” says Kennis T., a member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, which runs the museum. He declined to give his last name for fear of safety. The museum almost did not make its planned opening date. Less than three weeks ago, vandals broke into the property and threw salt water into its electric sockets. Luckily, precious exhibit items—like a bullet-riddled helmet worn by a student protestor on the night of the crackdown, which killed what is believed to be thousands of people—had not yet been moved into the new space. After the incident, 24/7 security was put in place. “It must be politically motivated,” Albert Ho, chair of the Hong Kong Alliance, tells TIME. There must have been a plan, he says “to destroy exhibition material so as to delay the opening of the museum.”","Despite Harassment, Vandalism and Protests, the World's Only Tiananmen Museum Just Reopened in Hong Kong","April 26, 2019"

In 2012, the London Book Fair partnered with the all-powerful Chinese state agency responsible for regulating publications and the Internet—the General Administration for Press and Publication. In protest, the author smeared an X across his face in red paint. He then attempted to hand a copy of a book he had written, its cover also marked with a red X, to the head of the agency, who was attending the fair. The book was about one of China’s most taboo topics—the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square. Ma had reason to be angry: his books have been banned in his homeland for the last 30 years, and he has not been allowed to return to China for the last few years as the country’s President, Xi Jinping, has initiated a widespread crackdown on dissent. The author was born in the Chinese city of Qingdao in 1953. He started his career on a more traditional path, at a petrochemical plant in Beijing, before deciding to become a photojournalist. In the 1980s, he began hanging out in the Chinese capital’s underground literary and art scene and took up painting again—a childhood love that was interrupted by the Cultural Revolution. He also started writing. His first book, 1988’s Stick Out Your Tongue, inspired by his travels in Tibet, caught the attention of the country’s censors, and all copies were destroyed. Since then, none of his books have been allowed to be published in China. His latest work is, without a doubt, a political statement. China Dream—a phrase borrowed directly from Xi who commonly uses it to describe a “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”—is a scathing, dystopian novel that follows a fictional Chinese provincial leader as he works to replace people’s dreams with government propaganda.

1039,Massimo Calabresi,"The Serbian journalist Dejan Anastasijevic, who documented his country’s descent into revanchist nationalism under strongman Slobodan Milosevic, died Wednesday in Belgrade after a long illness. A friend, colleague and intellectual guide for a generation of journalists covering the violent conflicts in the Balkans after the end of the Cold War, Anastasijevic was 57. Anastasijevic documented Milosevic’s land grabs in Croatia and Bosnia in the early 1990s, reporting on Serb militia members’ war crimes against Muslim and Croat civilians for the Serbian news outlets Vreme, Tanjug and B92. Anastasijevic became TIME Magazine’s Belgrade-based correspondent in 1996. As an ethnic Albanian separatist movement rose in the Serbian province of Kosovo in the late 1990s, and Serbian forces cracked down on insurgents and civilians alike, he became a key voice in the international coverage of that crisis. Respected for the objectivity of his reporting, the clarity of his analysis and the power of his writing, Anastasijevic developed and maintained sources on all sides of the multi-party fighting over the years, from officers deep inside the Serbian security apparatus to members of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. He was also targeted for his reporting. During the U.S.-led bombing of Belgrade during the war in Kosovo, threats from Serbian security forces drove Anastasijevic and his family from Serbia to seek temporary safety in Vienna, Austria. He returned after the war to his apartment in downtown Belgrade. Later, his home was attacked with a hand grenade. When Milosevic was put on trial for war crimes and genocide in The Hague in the early 2000s, Anastasijevic testified against him. “The consequences of his policies,” Anastasijevic wrote soon afterwards for TIME, “were all too visible, in Sarajevo, in Srebrenica and in Vukovar. Almost 11 years ago, I walked the town’s muddy streets, stepping over corpses, as Serb militia members led away helpless civilians to what would be their mass grave. A year later, as part of a similar land grab in eastern Bosnia, the same men were happily torching Muslim homes and murdering their owners. The fighters were drunk with bloodlust and slivovitz, but they were also led by the invisible hand of Milosevic’s secret police, who organized, armed and supplied them. It was the link between Milosevic and these crimes that my testimony was intended to help prove.” Compassionate with the victims of oppression and generous with novice and veteran colleagues alike, Anastasijevic was calm in the face of extraordinary danger, resolute in pursuit of the facts, and convivial after deadline.

1040,Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to clean up his signature Belt and Road infrastructure program amid criticism the policy is indebting poorer nations and making them dependent on Beijing.“We need to maintain that all cooperation is conducted under the sun and work together to combat corruption with zero tolerance,” Xi said in an address to the annual Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing on Friday. He vowed that China will negotiate and sign high-standard free trade agreements with more countries, strengthen cooperation in customs, taxation, auditing and supervision, and establish a cooperation mechanism for jointly building the Belt and Road tax collection and management system. “We need to pursue high-standard cooperation,” he said. “We will adopt widely-accepted rules and standards, and encourage participating companies to follow general international rules and standards in product development, operations procurement, tendering and bidding.” Some 5,000 attendees from across the globe were in the audience for Xi’s address. Chinese officials have already pledged this week to improve funding arrangements for projects along the Belt and Road network, in response to increasing wariness that the initiative saddles developing countries with loans they can’t repay. Xi unveiled the plan to rebuild ancient trading routes across Eurasia in 2013, calling it the “project of the century.” China’s government has since poured billions into investments from Africa to the South Pacific. The president champions it as a means to spur development, goodwill and economic integration. At least seven countries that have agreed to Belt and Road projects have suspended, scaled back or terminated them, or experienced backlash for their involvement in the program. Earlier this month, China struck a deal with Malaysia to resume the East Coast Rail Link project for 44 billion ringgit ($10.7 billion) — down from 65.5 billion ringgit — after deciding to terminate it in January as the Southeast Asian country struggles to narrow its budget deficit. To address some of the concerns, Beijing is taking a range of steps to exert more control over the program, officials and participants said. They include a more muted publicity drive, clearer rules for state-owned enterprises, restricted use of the Belt and Road brand, and building overseas auditing and anti-corruption mechanisms, according to officials and participants who have spoken to Bloomberg. The People’s Bank of China will “build an open, market-oriented financing and investment system,” Governor Yi Gang said in brief remarks on Thursday.

1041,Lily Rothman,"Warning: This post contains spoilers for Game of Thrones Despite her protestations that she didn’t even want to be a knight, Game of Thrones fans knew better. By the time Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) was knighted by Ser Jaime in the series’ final season, the scene was a hailed as a milestone moment for the beloved character. The fact that the episode was titled “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” was just one more reason to feel Brienne was finally getting the recognition she deserves. For Joëlle Rollo-Koster — a professor of medieval history at the University of Rhode Island who was herself knighted by the French government as a Chevalier of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques — the moment held another layer of meaning: Brienne has long drawn comparisons to Joan of Arc, and now there’s even more complexity to the relationship between the fictional character and the real 15th century Frenchwoman, who defied the conventions of her time, led an army to victory and was killed for her transgressions. But first, that knighting ceremony. Game of Thrones is known to often draw inspiration from medieval European history, so how did Brienne’s big moment compare to what we know about the real thing? Rollo-Koster points to the Arthurian romances written by Chrétien de Troyes in the 12th century as perhaps the earliest source for a narrative description of dubbing someone a knight — a word related to the French adouber, a verb meaning to give someone weapons. The scholar Jean Flori traced a turning point to that body of work, citing the year 1180 as the moment when the word switched from meaning principally “to arm a knight” to meaning “to make someone a knight.” One of the stranger elements of the dubbing ceremony is something the French called colée. “The colée is a slap on the face,” Rollo-Koster says. “I explain it to my students as, number one, you need to resist that slap. If you’re a knight on your knees and somebody punches you and you are not able to resist, that shows you don’t have much strength. There’s that macho strength element, but there is also a memory element: Here, I’m slapping you, let it be the last time somebody slaps you on the face.” Over time, that ceremony evolved from a literal blow or slap to what has been described as “a gentle stroke with the flat of the sword on the side of the neck, or on either shoulder as well.” That movement — might have gotten a nod on Game of Thrones  with Jaime’s brush on Brienne’s shoulder though it’s hard to say for sure — evolved into the sword-tapping familiar from dubbing ceremonies in pop culture. But, says Rollo-Koster, “if it was a true medieval ceremony in the 11th or 12th century, [Brienne] would have been smacked in the face.”",The Real History of Medieval Knights Makes Brienne's Big Game of Thrones Moment Even More Meaningful,"April 25, 2019"

1043,Billy Perrigo/Clacton-on-Sea,"When the sun shines on the town of Clacton-on-Sea on the east coast of England, its seafront plays host to sunbathers, kids feeding coins into arcade machines and shopkeepers hawking beach balls on the sandswept promenade. But the sky on April 23 was overcast, and it hung over a different sort of crowd. A few hundred people gathered at Clacton’s pier, many bearing pro-Brexit signs and wearing Union Jack pins. As Nigel Farage, the man they had come to see, stepped up on stage, the local politician who introduced him told the crowd what they already knew: “He is the Godfather of Brexit.” Farage is the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, a political movement dedicated to bringing the country out of the European Union — a goal the party helped realize in the “Brexit” referendum of June 2016. It was the victory Farage had spent decades dreaming of, and after the result came through, he stepped down. “My political ambition,” he said in July 2016, “has been achieved.” But now, Farage is back and touring the Brexit heartland in search of another political upset. On May 23, along with every member state in the E.U, the U.K. will hold elections for the European Parliament — a vote it never intended to hold as the formal exit from the E.U. was initially scheduled for March 29. But as that deadline approached, Prime Minister Theresa May could not convince a majority of lawmakers to ratify the exit deal she had struck with the E.U., and she decided to ask for a delay. Now, Brexit has been pushed back to October 31 — and the U.K. must, by law, vote in E.U. elections next month. That was enough to reel the Brexit Godfather back into British politics. He kept a low public profile after stepping down as UKIP leader in 2016, and left the party altogether in December, criticizing the party’s pivot to an anti-Islam platform as it struggled for a new constituency after the main parties pledged to deliver Brexit. In April, he launched a new political movement called The Brexit Party. Within a week, the party was polling in first place, ahead of May’s Conservatives and the official opposition Labour Party, with 27 percent of voters polled by YouGov saying they would vote for Farage’s Brexit Party. His message was again one of insurgent anger. “We have openly and willfully been betrayed by our government,” Farage told the crowd in Clacton, where there were more than two “leave” voters for every “remain” one in the 2016 referendum. “I haven’t come out of semi-retirement to muck about,” he said. “Of course we’re going to win.” The victory would be mostly symbolic, as any elected lawmakers would stand down once Brexit finally happens. But it could still have major repercussions. For May, who has been fending off calls to resign for months, a poor performance in E.U. elections would give extra ammunition to those calling for her to go. For her Conservative Party, it threatens to echo the impact that Farage had on policy as the leader of UKIP in the early 2010s: putting pressure on the Conservatives by stealing right-leaning voters, incentivizing them to adopt more hardline policies. And for the country, it could add yet another wrinkle in the stuttering political process to bring the U.K. out of the E.U. Just like three years ago, Farage has the opportunity to reshape politics from the outside. If his playbook from 2016 is anything to go by, that’s where he prefers. He has never been elected to the U.K. Parliament despite seven attempts, and although he has been an elected Member of the European Parliament since 1999, other MEPs have criticized him for rarely turning up.",The ‘Brexit Godfather’ Thought He Was Out.

1044,Olga Tanas and Youkyung Lee / Bloomberg,"Kim Jong Un sought Vladimir Putin’s help in resolving a nuclear stalemate with the U.S., asking the Russian leader at their first summit to convey his views to Donald Trump. “Chairman Kim Jong Un himself asked us to inform the American side about his position,” Putin told reporters after more than three hours of talks on a university campus in the Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok. “There are no secrets here. We will discuss this with the Americans and our Chinese partners,” said Putin, who is heading to Beijing later Thursday. While Russia extended the invitation to Kim almost a year ago, the North Korean leader only accepted after his second summit with Trump broke down in February without agreements on relief from United Nations sanctions that are choking his economy or steps toward Kim’s disarmament. Since then, North Korea has complained that intermediaries to Trump — ranging from U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to the South Korean government — aren’t getting his message across. “I had candid and meaningful talks with Putin on developing friendly relations between North Korea and Russia,” Kim said at a reception with his Russian counterpart after the meetings. For Putin, hosting Kim gives him a chance to remain a player in a security dispute shaped mainly by the U.S. and China. The Russian trip advances Kim’s efforts to break his country’s isolation. After ruling for six years without leaving home, he’s visited five nations since his rapprochement with Trump, including China, Russia, Singapore, Vietnam and a short hop over the South Korean border. Kim, who kept Putin waiting almost a year for the summit, was also more than 30 minutes behind the Russian president’s arrival at the venue. That was an unusual turnabout for Putin, who’s notorious for keeping world leaders waiting for meetings. “We welcome your efforts to develop inter-Korean dialogue and to normalize North Korean and American relations,” Putin told Kim. Neither side released details of what was discussed at the meetings, which appeared cordial. Putin said he shares the U.S. desire to see full denuclearization, but added that North Korea would need security guarantees, most likely international, to protect its sovereignty. He said a return to six-party talks, an arrangement that included Russia and Japan, as well as China, the U.S. and the two Koreas, could be useful for that.",Kim Jong Un Asks Putin for Help With President Trump at North Korean Leader's Summit in Russia,"April 25, 2019"
1045,Amy Gunia,"For many years, Sri Lanka’s bloody civil war kept tourists at bay. When the 26-year conflict between the Tamil ethnic minority and the government ended in 2009, tourists flocked to the island nation’s tropical beaches, highland tea country and wildlife safaris. Hotels proliferated, among them the Shangri-La in the capital Colombo. On Easter Sunday, the Shangri-La was one of several hotels targeted by suicide bombers in attacks that killed 359 people, and wounded 500 more. Suddenly, the nation’s hard-won peace evaporated, and civilians were once again plunged into the grip of terror. The violence, believed to be carried out by a domestic Islamist militant group, was the deadliest to hit Sri Lanka since the civil war ended a decade ago. With the world’s gaze once again attuned to Sri Lanka for the wrong reasons, Sunday’s blasts served as a grim reminder of nation’s past as the birthplace of modern-day suicide bombing. Here’s what to know about the scourge of bombings that has afflicted the country of 22.5 million where the suicide vest was invented. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE), more commonly known as the Tamil Tigers, didn’t create the phenomenon of suicide bombing, but they did institutionalize the tactic during their guerrilla warfare against the Sri Lankan government forces from 1983 to 2009. The Tigers, seeking an autonomous state for an ethnic group that makes up about 15% of the population, first used suicide tactics in an attack on the Sri Lankan army in 1987. That explosion echoed the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon. But according to experts, the Tiger’s frequent attacks thereafter may have marked a turning point, after which suicide attacks became a widespread weapon used by extremists around the globe. “Tamil Tigers were mainly responsible for developing suicide bombings as a terrorist weapon and it was emulated by terrorist groups in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries,” Riaz Hassan, emeritus professor of sociology at Flinders University in Australia, and an expert on suicide missions, told TIME. Foreshadowing the strategy of jihadis to come, Velupillai Prabhakaran, the Tigers’ founder and leader, created a culture that glorified martyrdom and encouraged suicide bombings.

1046,Hillary Leung,"Around 169 million children missed out on the measles vaccine over an eight-year period, a shortfall in protective coverage that has paved the way for a disease that is sweeping the world, the U.N. Children’s Fund said Thursday. UNICEF said in a report that 169 million children did not receive the first dose of the measles vaccine between 2010 and 2017, a number that equates with about 21.1 million kids annually. This vaccination gap “created a pathway” for the outbreaks raging throughout the globe, including in the U.S., Europe, the Philippines and Tunisia, the report added. “The ground for the global measles outbreaks we are witnessing today was laid years ago,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children.”  Measles, a respiratory illness, is more contagious than Ebola, tuberculosis or influenza. Vaccination can mean the difference between life and death, according to UNICEF. Two doses of the vaccine will protect children against the disease, while the World Health Organization says 95% vaccine coverage will grant a community herd immunity. Yet due to poor infrastructure, conflict and “mistrust and complacency,” global measles vaccine coverage has plummeted, UNICEF says, driving up the number of cases. In the first three months of 2019, over 110,000 measles cases were reported worldwide – up nearly 300% from the same period last year UNICEF said Thursday the global coverage of the first dose of the vaccine was 85% in 2017, while coverage for the second dose stood at 67%.","More Than 20 Million Children Worldwide Miss Out on the Measles Vaccine Annually, UNICEF Reports","April 25, 2019"

Leaks of Cabinet meetings have become the new normal in May’s government, as splits over Brexit and the question of who will succeed the prime minister have seen ministers trying to advance themselves and do down rivals.

The Tuesday afternoon meeting of the NSC should have been confidential. On the table was whether to impose a full ban on the Chinese telecoms giant over security concerns — just as the U.S. has done — or to compromise by allowing Huawei to be involved in non-sensitive elements of 5G technology. The leaks, within hours, forced May’s de facto deputy David Lidington to answer questions on Huawei in Parliament on Wednesday.

1050,Mahita Gajanan,"Calls for peace in Northern Ireland have begun anew after a journalist was killed during rioting in Derry on April 18 amid a recent rise of violence in the region. Lyra McKee, 29, was shot dead in Derry, Northern Ireland (also called Londonderry) during rioting in the city. She was likely struck by a bullet aimed at officers by a masked gunman, police say. A group named the New IRA admitted responsibility for her death. The same group is also thought to have been responsible for a car bomb in the city in January. McKee’s killing is a reminder of the unease that remains in the region since the conflict over Northern Ireland’s constitutional status and other issues, known as the Troubles, came to an end with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. About 3,700 people died in the three decades of violent sectarian conflict during the Troubles which was fueled by and exacerbated tensions between Northern Ireland’s Catholic and Protestant communities. Derry, where the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre — during which British soldiers shot dead 13 people — was a hotbed for fighting.  “Lyra was only a kid when [the agreement] was signed, and was one of that generation that didn’t have direct experience of the political violence and militarization,” says Conor Patterson, the director of the chamber of commerce and trade in Newry, Northern Ireland. “The awful event of her murder exposes the random, chaotic nature of this.” The Good Friday Agreement brought a sense of equilibrium to Northern Ireland, according to Patterson. A dissolution of the hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, once heavily militarized, allowed the region’s economy to thrive, while people were freed to move as they pleased. Both the open border and a motorway that connects Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland have become symbols of the region’s hard-won peace. Still, despite the peace deal, tensions have long simmered between Northern Ireland’s political and religious communities, making the area volatile and ripe for the re-emergence of conflict. The leftover animosity stems in part from a lack of any real reconciliation between Protestants and Catholics beyond the official agreement, according to Roger Mac Ginty, a professor at Durham University focused on peace and conflict. He says local political parties that stoke identity-based conflicts are to blame for the situation. “Identity-based political parties would put themselves out of business if they took reconciliation seriously. So they have worked to thwart any reconciliation initiatives,” he tells TIME via email. “In this atmosphere, violent actors are left with space to operate.” In the aftermath of McKee’s death, police in Northern Ireland said they suspected the dissident republican New IRA group is responsible.

While addressing the U.K. parliament on Tuesday, Thunberg called out the government for not acting quickly enough to stop the effects of climate change. “We probably don’t even have a future anymore,” she said. “That future was sold so that a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money.

A 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that greenhouse gas emissions would have to be lowered to net zero by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5ºC (35ºF), an international goal under the Paris Agreement on climate change. Thunberg noted the urgency of cutting emissions in her speech, and criticized the U.K. for its use of fossil fuels. and support for the expansion . “The fact that we are speaking of “lowering” instead of “stopping” emissions is perhaps the greatest force behind the continuing business as usual,” she said.

Security Council, the U.S. succeeded in altering the language of a resolution on sexual violence, removing language perceived as code for abortion, Reuters reports. The resolution, which aimed to reduce sexual violence in conflict and the use of rape as a weapon of war, passed Tuesday after member states agreed to remove passages the U.S. reportedly found objectionable. According to a U.N. statement, lengthy negotiations ensued after members struggled to agree on the wording of reproductive and sexual health provisions for women. The since-deleted language referred to U.N. organizations and donors supplying “sexual and reproductive health” assistance to survivors of sexual conflict, reports Reuters. After the German-drafted proposal was adopted, French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said, “It is intolerable and incomprehensible that the Security Council is incapable of acknowledging that women and girls who suffered from sexual violence in conflict – and who obviously didn’t choose to become pregnant – should have the right to terminate their pregnancy.” U.K. Minister Tariq Ahmad also expressed regret over the removed language. Before voting, the council heard testimony from Iraqi Yazidi Nobel Laureate Nadia Murad, who was held as an ISIS sex slave, a Congolese doctor who works with rape victims, a Libyan rights activist and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who has represented women who were enslaved and trafficked by ISIS.

The activists were convicted on charges of public nuisance and incitement two weeks ago, a verdict that some perceived as underscoring eroding political freedoms in the semi-autonomous Chinese enclave under pressure from Beijing. Law professor Benny Tai and retired sociology professor Chan Kin-man, co-founders of the “Occupy Central” protest that immobilized the city’s financial district five years ago, were both sentenced to 16 months, according to court documents. Reverend Chu Yiu-ming was also given 16 months, but his sentence was suspended for two years. Two others received eight-month sentences, and two more had their sentences suspended. Another activist was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service, and a ninth defendant’s sentencing was postponed for health reasons. The activists had faced up to seven years in prison, but many, including the defendants, had argued the charges were politically motivated. Joshua Wong, the student protest leader who served six-months in 2017, told TIME, “Political prisoners have become the norm [in Hong Kong].” Outside the courthouse, the defendants were met by supporters toting yellow umbrellas, which became a symbol of the 2014 protests after they were used to deflect police tear gas and pepper spray. The demonstrations came to be known as the “Umbrella Movement.” The non-violent street demonstrations began with the “Occupy Central” campaign that called for a brief sit-in to press for democratic reforms, including the direct election of Hong Kong’s leader.

Ressa, who was included in TIME’s 2019 list of the most influential people, attended Tuesday’s gala in New York City with her sister. “Its a completely chaotic time where technology has helped make facts disputable, eroded truth, and crippled trust.” While Ressa has been an award-winning journalist for decades, she rose to international prominence over the past year as a beacon for the free press in the Southeast Asian country.

In November of 2018, the Philippine government charged Ressa and the website with tax evasion, which Ressa alleged was merely an effort to intimidate her. She has since been arrested twice in recent months — in February on charges of “cyber libel” related to an article published by Rappler in May 2012 and in March over accusations that Rappler violated laws prohibiting foreign ownership of media companies.

1056,Rachel E. Greenspan,"2019 TIME 100 honoree Fred Swaniker urged everyone in the room to keep doing “hard things” in a powerful toast at the 2019 TIME 100 Gala in New York on Tuesday evening. “All of us who are privileged enough to be healthy, to be alive, to have education and to have influence, our role is not to do small things and to solve small problems,” Swaniker said. “The only way that we can justify privilege is by solving the world’s biggest problems, and by doing hard things.” Swaniker seeks to educate and inspire the youth of Africa, who make up 60% of the continent’s population, with three educational initiatives. He said Tuesday that the message of doing hard things is a constant within all of them. Swaniker is a co-founder and trustee of the African Leadership Academy, an organization which works “to develop the future Nelson Mandela, the next Wangari Maathai and the African Bill Gates,” the organization’s website states. Swaniker’s other programs, African Leadership Network and African Leadership University, are working toward developing 3 million ethical and entrepreneurial leaders in the coming decades. An MBA recipient from Stanford Business School, Swaniker has been recognized as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum. “Fred has the passion, understanding and ability to take this great continent forward, through its young people,” Mo Ibrahim, the founder of Celtel International and chair of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, wrote of Swaniker for the TIME 100 issue. “I am filled with hope knowing that he is there to help the next generation of African leaders to blossom.” Read the full text of Swaniker’s tribute at the Gala below: Write to Rachel E.

1057,Tara Law,"Jared Kushner said that he does not “dispute” American intelligence’s conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman was behind the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but argued that it’s most important to prioritize American foreign policy interests. Speaking at the TIME 100 Summit on Tuesday, the senior White House advisor called Khashoggi’s death an “absolutely terrible tragedy” but said his own responsibility is advancing American interests. Kushner, who has been angling for an Arab-Israeli peace agreement throughout his time at the White House, has fostered a close relationship with the Saudi Crown Prince. In December, Chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Elijah Cummings said that Kushner had used WhatsApp to communicate with bin Salman and other foreign officials, in what could be a possible breach of federal law. Kushner said Tuesday that when he spoke to bin Salman after Khashoggi’s death, he urged him to “be as transparent as possible.” “And obviously, we have to make sure there is accountability for what happened,” Kushner said. Pressed if he thought bin Salman had taken his advice, Kushner responded, “Well, we’ll find out.” During Tuesday’s summit, Kushner also touched on the Saudi’s participation in the war in Yemen, arguing that Saudi Arabia is trying to “defend themselves.” About 85,000 children are believed to have died as a result of starvation in Yemen between April 2015 and October 2018, according to analysis by Save the Children. Kushner defended the Trump administration’s decision to continue military assistance to Saudi Arabia, saying that the U.S. needs to be a “dependable supplier.”",Jared Kushner Does Not 'Dispute' Saudis Behind Jamal Khashoggi's Death,"April 23, 2019"
1058,Justin Worland,"People around the world need to take urgent action to protect the planet and all of its living in habitants, famed conservationist Jane Goodall told the TIME 100 Summit Tuesday. “We have to get together and take action now,” Goodall said. “When hundreds, thousands, millions, and hopefully billions of us make ethical choices then we start moving toward a better world.” Goodall, 85, has played a key role on the front lines of the conservation movement for decades. Her research gave the world new insight into primates, including discoveries such as how chimpanzees use tools in their everyday lives. She pioneered new ways of researching animals, including by living with them and using names to identify them. “The way that I did this study was absolutely contrary to scientific norms at the time,” she said. “We were able to persuade science gradually to come out of this narrow reductionist way of thinking.” She gained global notoriety for that work in the 1960s following the release of a documentary about her work. Since then has served as ambassador for wildlife and the conservation cause receiving numerous honors and launching multiple initiatives, including the Jane Goodall Institute, a global conservation group. More recently, she has called for action on climate change and stressed how saving wildlife will also help address global warming. “You can’t save chimpanzees without saving the forest, which means you save all the biodiversity in that forest, which is so important and you save an environment which is so vital to us,” she said. Goodall also had a message for the forces in society that have stopped the world from addressing global warming. “Deniers of climate change, I want them to go to the Antarctic where the sea ice is melting faster than ever before and dump them in the middle of it,” she said to laughter and applause. Goodall received a standing ovation at the TIME 100 Summit, just one indicator of the broad generation of environmentalists she has inspired. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio wrote about her for this year’s TIME 100 issue, calling her a friend and inspiration. “Anyone who has heard her speak, or heard her story, has been mesmerized by her life’s work,” he wrote.",Jane Goodall Calls for Billions of People To 'Make Ethical Choices' To Save the Planet,"April 23, 2019"
1059,Rachel E. Greenspan,"A couple of iconic gorillas were camera-ready when their human friend snapped a photo. The two gorillas in question, Ndakazi and Ndeze at Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have gone viral after the park shared their picture earlier this week. According to the park’s caption, a lot of people couldn’t believe the perfectly captured moment was real. If you’re a fan of the instant classic moment for these animals, park officials said in an Instagram post that the animals’ poses were completely genuine. “These gorilla gals are always acting cheeky so this was the perfect shot of their true personalities,” Monday’s caption says. The photo has almost 50,000 likes on Instagram, including from celebrities like Chrissy Metz. Both Ndakazi and Ndeze live at the Senkwekwe Center, the park’s sanctuary for orphaned mammals, since they were infants. Senkwekwe is a UNESCO World Heritage site and currently houses 22 gorillas, according to its website. Virunga’s deputy director Innocent Mburanumwe told BBC News that it’s likely the animals had learned to imitate the physicality of their caretakers. Because they each lost their mothers when they were only a few months old, caretakers like these are almost like parents to them, Mburanumwe explained. Though it’s common for primates to walk upright for “short bursts of time” as these two gorillas did, it’s important to remember that it is “never permitted to approach a gorilla in the wild” for safety purposes, the post warns.

1060,Billy Perrigo,"President Donald Trump is to travel to the U.K. on a state visit this June, Buckingham Palace confirmed on Tuesday. Trump will travel to the U.K. with the First Lady for three days from June 3 to 5, in what will be their second visit since Trump’s Presidency began. Their first visit, in July 2018, was repeatedly delayed and finally downgraded from a state visit to a “working visit” after lawmakers threatened to walk out of any address he made to parliament and protesters threatened to disrupt any official activities. It still remains to be confirmed whether this time Trump will engage in the traditional activities of a U.K. state visit, such as being taken to Buckingham Palace in a horse-drawn carriage, that he missed out on the first time around. It is also not guaranteed that he will address the U.K. Parliament, where he has many detractors. “An address by a foreign leader to both Houses of Parliament is not an automatic right; it is an earned honor,” John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons said in 2017. “I would not wish to issue an invitation to President Trump.” Trump’s visit in 2018 was met by large crowds of protesters in the streets of London and other cities around the U.K., as well as at his golf course in Scotland. The disturbance was so heavy that many analysts speculated Trump chose to spend as little time in the capital as possible. He did, however, meet the Queen and British Prime Minister Theresa May. A White House spokesperson said: “This state visit will reaffirm the steadfast and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition to meeting the Queen, the president will participate in a bilateral meeting with prime minister Theresa May.” May’s office confirmed on Tuesday that Trump’s visit would include commemorations marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the day in 1944 when the allied forces, including U.S. and U.K. soldiers, landed on French beaches to begin the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany. Trump will attend a military parade in the southern port city of Portsmouth to celebrate the anniversary, involving a flypast of at least 26 RAF warplanes.",President Trump To Make First U.K. State Visit in June,"April 23, 2019"
1061,Billy Perrigo,"The terrorist group ISIS has claimed responsibility for the bomb attacks on churches and hotels in Sri Lanka that killed at least 321 people on Easter Sunday, but provided no evidence. In a bulletin posted by its Aamaq news agency, ISIS said: “The perpetrators of the attack that targeted nationals of the countries of the coalitions and Christians in Sri Lanka before yesterday are fighters from the Islamic State,” according to a translation by the Associated Press. The news came on Tuesday as the Sri Lankan minister of defense Ruwan Wijewardene said the attacks were in retaliation for last month’s terrorist attack against Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which 50 people were killed. He did not immediately offer any evidence. “The preliminary investigations have revealed that what happened in Sri Lanka was in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch,” he told the Sri Lankan parliament. Later on Tuesday, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe warned more explosives were “out there,” acknowledging his security services had failed to act on an advance warning that a terror attack was being planned. He said some security officials would lose their jobs as a result. Wickremesinghe said that an attack at a fourth church had failed. Sri Lanka first blamed a local Islamic extremist group called National Thowheeth Jama’ath for the attack, but officials said it had received help from an international terrorist organization, according to the New York Times. Sri Lanka has implemented an “emergency law” giving police powers to detain suspects without a warrant, and 40 people have now been arrested in connection to the attacks. ISIS has now lost all the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria following an offensive by Syrian opposition forces in March, but terror experts warn it is still a threat. “ISIS very likely will continue to pursue external attacks … against regional and Western adversaries,” the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, warned in a January report.

1062,Himal Kotelawala / Colombo,"Balkan Fernando was at his home in Kochchikade, a suburb north of Sri Lanka’s capital, when he heard the first bomb go off around 8:45 a.m. He sprinted toward the deafening sound that had come from nearby St. Anthony’s Shrine and found members of the country’s Christian minority evacuating their Easter service amid a scene of carnal wreckage. “It must’ve been at the end of mass, during the holy communion,” he tells TIME. “I ran to the church as soon as I heard it. I was inside about two minutes after the blast. There was a lot of flesh scattered everywhere. I must’ve seen about 25 bodies in there.” Liyanage Rasika, who sells vegetables in a lane near the church, says ambulances did not arrive for about 20 minutes. “We helped take the bodies to the hospital in three-wheelers and vehicles from the neighborhood,” he says. He recalls churchgoers rushing out of the building, soaked in blood. “There was blood all over them. Many were dead inside.” The explosion at St. Anthony’s was not the only blast to rock the South Asian Island this past Easter Sunday. Luxury hotels and two other Christian churches were among the targets of coordinated suicide bombings that killed 310 people and wounded another 500. The deadly attacks shattered the of peace on the island nation of 21 million. Sunday’s violence was the deadliest to hit Sri Lanka since the 2009 end of the civil war between government forces and the separatist Liberation of Tamil Tigers Elam in the country’s north and east. But even during the 26-year Tamil insurgency, notorious for its suicide attacks, there were never so many civilian casualties reported on a single day. The attackers’ motivation — beyond inflicting maximum carnage — remains unclear. But government officials have said the suicide bombers were Sri Lankan nationals who carried out the attacks with the help of international militants, and a Syrian national is in police custody in connection with the attacks. Authorities are eager to pin the atrocities on little-known radical Islamist organization National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ), but neither it nor any other organization has claimed responsibility.",Sri Lanka Struggles to Come to Terms With the Implications of the Easter Sunday Bombings,"April 23, 2019"

Huong Khe district, located in Ha Tinh province about 150 miles south of the capital Hanoi, experienced the record-breaking heat on Saturday, according to a forecaster with French meteorological agency Meteo France. The area normally averages in the 80s this time of year. Temperatures in popular tourist destinations Da Nang and Hue also rose to about 100ºF, and in the south, Ho Chi Minh City blistered Monday in 95ºF, according to the Post. The record highs are particularly noteworthy given their occurrence in April, months before most parts of Vietnam experience the summer burn. “It is unbreathable outside in this heat,” Phuong Hoang, who was in Hue during the weekend, told the Post. “It is so hard to carry on your day in this.” According to the World Meteorological Organization, 2015 to 2018 were the four warmest years on record, a continuing sign of long-term climate change globally. In January, a record-breaking scorcher in Australia saw temperatures climb to 120ºF in some areas. Last summer, Japan also recorded a new high of 106ºF during a deadly heat wave. Climate change concerns have prompted large-scale demonstrations around the world in recent months, with protesters demanding leaders take urgent action.

At least 359 people died and 500 others were injured when multiple bombs exploded in churches and hotels in and around Colombo, the capital of the South Asian island country, officials said. The terrorist attack, believed to be carried out by an Islamist militant group, was the deadliest violence to hit Sri Lanka since the civil war ended a decade ago, according to the Associated Press. At least four Americans were among the dead, a State Department spokesperson told TIME on Monday. Officials have identified about 30 other victims who hailed from other nations, including India, China and Denmark, according to the AP.

1065,Justin Worland,"Scientists have long predicted that warmer temperatures caused by climate change will have the biggest impact on the world’s poorest, most vulnerable people. New research now indicates that’s already happened over the last several decades. A study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science found that in most poor countries, higher temperatures are more than 90% likely to have resulted in decreased economic output, compared to a world without global warming. Meanwhile, the effect has been less dramatic in wealthier nations—with some even potentially benefiting from higher temperatures. “We’re not arguing that global warming created inequality,” says Noah S. Diffenbaugh, the author of the study and a professor at Stanford University who studies climate change. But “global warming has put a drag on improvement.” The countries most likely to have lost out economically as a result of warmer temperatures have done the least to contribute to the problem, he adds. The new study builds on past research. A 2015 study in the journal Nature projected that the average income in the poorest countries will decline 75% by 2100 compared to a world without warming, while some of the richest countries could experience gains in income. And a landmark report released last fall from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN’s climate science body, showed that if global temperatures rise more than 1.5°C by the end of the century, poor countries will likely face critical challenges, including the destruction of entire communities and millions of premature deaths. “They will suffer the most, they will suffer disproportionately, as they are already,” said Mary Robinson, a former U.N. Special Envoy on Climate Change and a previous president of Ireland, told TIME after the launch of the IPCC report. Even before any of that research was published, climate policymakers have tried to address the problem of the poorest countries facing the worst effects of rising temperatures—for which they are least responsible. Early attempts at addressing global warming on the international stage included different expectations for emissions reduction based on each country’s level of development. Poorest countries received more leeway while the richest bore extra responsibility. But in some ways, that approach backfired in the U.S., and by extension the rest of the world, as it helped feed the popular conservative narrative that Washington is overpaying for climate change mitigation, while poorer countries are getting away with doing less. That Republican talking point has had real effects. Hardline distinctions between requirements for rich and poor countries have been softened in recent years, in favor of a lighter version of what climate change policymakers refer to as “common but differentiated responsibilities.” That principle, embedded in climate agreements dating back to 1992, including the landmark Paris Agreement, suggests that richer countries should bear a greater burden in addressing climate change, but remains vague about what that means for concrete policy. Many of the world’s developing countries have called foul. “This problem is created somewhere else,” Abdur Rouf Talukder, Bangladesh’s Finance Secretary, told TIME earlier this month. “We are spending more on adaptation because we have to live.”",Climate Change Has Already Increased Global Inequality.

1066,Finlay Young,"Published in partnership with ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom based in New York. Katie Meyler, the CEO and founder of More Than Me, has resigned six months after a ProPublica investigation revealed her charity missed opportunities to prevent the rapes of girls in its care by a senior staff member, Macintosh Johnson, with whom Meyler once had an intimate relationship. Meyler, who founded the charity in 2009 to save vulnerable girls from sexual exploitation, had been on a leave of absence pending the results of three separate inquiries by the charity and the Liberian government into ProPublica’s report, which concluded that Meyler and charity officials gave Johnson significant power over vulnerable students, were not transparent about the extent of his abuse and failed to make sure that all of his potential victims were tested after it came to light that he had AIDS when he died. The findings of these inquiries have yet to be made public, but Meyler announced her departure Friday evening on Facebook: “Over the past few months, false allegations have been circulating around the horrific mistreatment of girls in our program. Some of the false allegations suggest I knew or should have known what was happening to these girls. That’s simply not true,” Meyler wrote. “Here’s the truth: I first learned about these crimes in June 2014 and immediately ensured the perpetrator was reported to the Liberian authorities; he was in jail four days after I learned of his abuse. I cooperated fully with the police investigation and did everything I could to protect our students. “However, I recognize that my public role as CEO has become a distraction from the critical mission and incredible and proven work of our team which is why I recently made the difficult decision to resign.” After the publication of ProPublica’s story and documentary film, More Than Me for the first time apologized, admitting in a statement that it had failed girls in its care and acknowledging, “Our leadership should have recognized the signs earlier.”",More Than Me Founder and CEO Katie Meyler Resigns,"April 22, 2019"
1067,Mahita Gajanan,"Sri Lankan officials have said the Islamist militant group National Thowheeth Jama’ath is responsible for Easter Sunday bombing attacks in the island nation that killed at least 290 people and injured 500 more. Rajitha Senaratne, the country’s health minister, said the seven suicide bombers who carried out the attacks were Sri Lankan citizens affiliated with the domestic group, but that authorities suspect foreign ties as well. “There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded,” Senaratne said in a news conference. The group has not claimed responsibility for the bombings so far. Here’s what to know about the suspected group behind the attacks. Very little is known about National Thowheeth Jama’ath, according to Alan Keenan, a senior Sri Lanka analyst with the International Crisis Group. Prior to Sunday’s attacks, the group was mainly linked with the vandalization of Buddhist statues in Sri Lanka in December, he tells TIME. Until Monday, when the Sri Lankan government named the group, Keenan had never heard of it as an official organization. Keenan says it’s possible the group splintered off from the political organization “Sri Lanka Thowheeth Jama’ath,” which carries hardline views and anti-Buddhist sentiments. Keenan also notes that many organizations in Sri Lanka use the name “Thowheeth Jama’ath,” making it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the group. The name roughly translates to “a group in the name of oneness of God.”","What to Know About National Thowheeth Jama'ath, the Group Suspected in the Sri Lanka Easter Attacks","April 22, 2019"
1068,John Walcott,"President Donald Trump’s decision Monday to end six-month waivers from U.S. sanctions for five countries that have continued buying Iranian oil — the latest turn of the screw in his Administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran — was met with predictable outrage from Tehran. But some U.S. State Department, Defense and intelligence officials and outside experts warn that the move could backfire by causing ripple effects in countries like China, Turkey and Iraq. In response to the sanctions, Greece, Italy and, Taiwan had stopped buying Iranian oil, but China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey have continued to import Iranian oil. The economic pressure has reduced Iranian oil exports from more than 2.5 million barrels a day to less than 1 million, discouraged foreign investment, and sent the value of Iran’s currency plummeting and inflation soaring. Announcing the move in a press briefing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the decision to end the waivers was “dramatically escalating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our national security objectives while maintaining well-supplied global oil markets”. The Administration’s objective, Pompeo said, include prompt Iran to renegotiate the international agreement halting its pursuit of nuclear weapons, halt its ballistic missile tests, and end its support for terrorist groups, which U.S. officials say include Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas, Houthi militias in Yemen, and authoritarian regimes in Syria and Venezuela. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the move, and Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country and others would ensure that “the global oil market does not go out of balance.” Some U.S. and foreign officials and outside experts, however, argue that the escalating attack on Iran’s economy is unlikely to prompt Iran to halt its support for terrorist organizations; force the country’s clerical rulers to renegotiate the deal halting their efforts to develop nuclear weapons; weaken its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its elite Quds Force; or turn everyday Iranians against the Islamic regime. “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there,” says Aaron David Miller, a Mideast expert and vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “And what is the Trump Administration strategy toward Iran? Even if it’s regime change or forcing Iran to retrench in the region, this recent move will accomplish neither goal.

The 10-year project at the Bien Hoa Airport outside Ho Chi Minh City, considered the country’s most contaminated remaining site, kicked off with an opening ceremony Saturday. The airport is the latest site slated for rehabilitation by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defense after the cleanup of Da Nang airbase was completed last November, Agence France-Presse reports. Bien Hoa was one of the main depots for storing Agent Orange during the war, and was only partially cleaned at the end of the conflict more than four decades ago. U.S. forces sprayed more than 80 million liters of the toxic defoliant over Southern Vietnam to destroy jungle and reveal the enemy hide outs. The substance contained the highly toxic chemical dioxin, which contaminated the soil and sediment, and has been linked to severe birth defects, cancers and mental and physical disabilities. Vietnam says that 3 million people were exposed to Agent Orange, while the Vietnamese Red Cross says local studies show that as many as one million people now have disabilities or other health problems associated with the compound, including around 100,000 children. According to the USAID, Bien Hoa is the “largest remaining hotspot of dioxin contamination” in Vietnam. The dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa is thought to be four times higher than at Da Nang.

1071,Madeline Roache,"In January 2018 floods, the sea wall that Australia built to protect the residents of Yam Island collapsed. Residents of the island — just over 1 square mile — which lies off the coast of mainland Australia, waded through the floodwaters as quickly as they could, grabbing whatever belongings they could. But the force of the ocean water dragged most of their bags away. Houses were destroyed, making 16 people homeless. Floods are common in this part of the world, but they have grown worse. Vonda Malone, the mayor of the Torres Shire Council, says climate change is having a “devastating” effect on locals. “Communities are being submerged.” The Torres Strait Islands are among the most vulnerable regions to climate change in Australia. Sea levels continue to rise, making tides more destructive, coastal erosion faster and droughts more severe. Buildings, roads and even cemeteries have been washed away.  More than 200 Islands make up the Torres Strait, a body of water separating the Australia’s far northern Cape York Peninsula and the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. The Torres Shire council governs the Thursday Island group – the administrative hub of the Torres Strait – while the greater region sits within Torres Island Regional Council’s jurisdiction, governed by mayor Fred Gela. The Islanders are one of Australia’s two distinct indigenous cultural groups, the other being the aboriginal people. About 4,000 Islanders live on the 18 habitable Islands, and 42,000 members of the Islander community live outside the area, mostly in the north of Queensland. The Torres Strait Islander people speak traditional languages: Meriam Mir, mostly spoken in the Eastern Islands, and Kala Lagaw Ya, which is more prevalent in the Western Central and Inner Islands. The community have lived on the Islands for an estimated 2,500 years.  Fast-rising sea levels are not just a concern for the Islanders—they’re a global threat. NASA  estimates that sea levels will rise between 30 inches and 60 inches by the end of the century. Eight of the world’s 10 largest cities are located by a coast, including Tokyo, Mumbai and New York City. Almost 40 percent of Americans live in relatively high-population-density coastal areas, where rising sea levels are causing flooding and the erosion of the shoreline. But in the Torres Strait Islands sea levels are rising by 0.2 inches each year — double the worldwide average, according to the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA). A 20-inch rise could increase the chance of flooding on the Australian mainland by 300 times, according to the Australian Department of Environment and Energy.  Malone, a native of Thursday Island — the central hub of the Torres Strait Islands — was elected in October 2016, becoming the region’s first indigenous, female mayor. She says the Australian government applies “sweeping national policies” rather than considering the “unique needs” of these remote islands, threatened by an encroaching ocean. “Politicians need to work more closely with Islanders to recognize and accommodate for our differences,” says Malone, who has worked in government for more than two decades. There are vast health, social and economic inequalities between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, including shorter life expectancy, higher rates of infant mortality, greater rates of mental health disorders, and lower levels of education and employment. Access to clean water is one of the “gravest” concerns for islanders, says Malone. Wells are increasingly unusable because rising sea levels have led to the contamination of ground-water. “The Torres Strait authorities have been advocating for more support from the government for over 20 years to make our communities more resilient against climate change. But we still need more resources,” Malone says. Especially at risk are the approximately 1,500 people living on the northwestern islands of Boigu and Saibai, and the central islands of Masig, Poruma, Warraber and Yam.

The blasts took place in the capital Colombo, a town north of the capital and a town on the island nation’s east coast, targeting churches, hotels and a housing development. In the wake of the tragedy, leaders around the world offered an outpouring of support to the people of Sri Lanka. President Donald Trump offered a message of support to Sri Lanka Sunday morning over Twitter. “The United States offers heartfelt condolences to the great people of Sri Lanka,” the President tweeted. “We stand ready to help!” The President’s message was a correction of an earlier tweet, which stated that the explosions had “killed at least 138 million people and badly injured 600 more.” Other leaders around the world also offered condemnations of the attacks and expressions of support. Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, denounced the attacks and offered a message to Sri Lanka in a recorded statement on Sunday. “To the beautiful people of Sri Lanka, Australia sends its heartfelt sympathies and our prayers and our support and our offer to do whatever we can to support you in this terrible time of need.” “Canada strongly condemns the heinous attacks on Christians at churches and hotels,” wrote Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “Our hearts and thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those killed and all those injured.” UK Prime Minister Theresa May also condemned the horrific attacks. “The acts of violence against churches and hotels in Sri Lanka are truly appalling, and my deepest sympathies go out to all of those affected at this tragic time,” she wrote. “We must stand together to make sure that no one should ever have to practice their faith in fear.”",World Leaders Respond to the Easter Sunday Bombings in Sri Lanka That Killed at Least 200 People,"April 21, 2019"

1076,Ian Bremmer,"What Happens This Week: Ukrainians head to the polls this weekend to choose between a comedian who plays a Ukrainian president on TV and a chocolate baron who plays a Ukrainian president in real life. No joke. Why It Matters: Because it’s Ukraine. For better or worse, Ukraine is the bridge that unites—or divides, depending on your perspective—Russia with the West. A decade ago, Ukraine was making moves toward joining the EU without sacrificing its substantial trade and interpersonal ties to Russia. Then Moscow’s 2014 landgrab of Crimea and sponsorship of a war in the Donbas valley resulted in a frozen conflict that remains in place to this day. Unsurprisingly, both candidates have been fiercely critical of Moscow on the campaign trail, though not exactly in the same way (see below). But before Russia, there’s domestic politics to consider—Ukraine’s politicians never cleaned up the systemic corruption that fueled the 2014 Maidan Revolution that ousted Ukraine’s Kremlin-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych. His eventual successor (and current presidential candidate) Petro Poroshenko came to power promising to navigate the country through what was then a rising conflict in the east and revive the country’s economic fortunes. He’s had difficulty convincing Ukraine’s voters he’s been successful on all those fronts—Russia remains a direct security threat (even if the conflict has cooled and now is largely stuck in place), Ukraine’s economy is struggling, and no top-tier government officials have been convicted on corruption charges. In the eyes of many Ukrainians, the billionaire Poroshenko is a remnant of the very system the 2014 Revolution was meant to break. Enter: Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a true political outsider whose political experience comes from his TV show “Servant of the People,” in which he plays a school teacher whose outburst against corruption becomes an internet sensation and thrusts him into the country’s presidency. Zelenskiy named his political party after the show and he hit the campaign trail, where his charisma and media experience have made him a political force to be reckoned with. Zelenskiy has also opted to go heavy on the anti-corruption rhetoric while going light on specific policy proposals, allowing him to be many things to many Ukrainians fed up with the country’s politics. That does not mean he is without controversy—his political opponents accuse him of being financially-backed by a Ukrainian oligarch at odds with Poroshenko, and who happens to own the TV station that Zelenskiy’s show runs on. He also says he will end Ukraine’s conflict with Russia through direct dialogue (“I am ready to do a deal with the devil so that not one more person dies”); critics are skeptical on that count. Nevertheless, Zelenskiy won the first round of Ukrainian presidential elections decisively, taking 30.2 percent of the vote to Poroshenko’s 15.9 percent. The last three weeks have been filled with personal attacks between the two men as the campaign approaches the finish line. What Happens Next: Ukraine is set to elect Zelenskiy as Ukraine’s next president this weekend; a poll released last week had Zelenskiy at 61 percent, while Poroshenko clocked in at 24 percent. Zelenskiy has been stocking his team with genuine economic and political reformers, a sign that he has ambitious plans to follow through with his headline promise of “change.” But here’s the thing—Ukraine has parliamentary elections scheduled for this fall, and any genuine reforms will require legislative backing. So the success of Zelenskiy’s reform drive will depend in large part on the outcome of those elections. Speaking of…",The Quick Read About… Ukraine’s Run-Off Presidential Elections,"April 19, 2019"
1078,Eltaf Najafizada / Bloomberg,"Fresh from a sold-out concert tour of the U.K. and Sweden, Afghanistan’s first female conductor is convinced music can help deliver peace to her war-torn country. If only the Taliban would listen. At just 22, Negin Khpelwak has already stared down threats and intimidation from her conservative relatives, who wished she would take on any career but music. Now, like many of her fellow citizens, she is watching peace talks between the U.S. and the Taliban with growing alarm. “We can bring freedom, peace and honor to Afghanistan,” said Khpelwak, who leads the country’s the first all-female Zohra Orchestra who’ve played classical Western and Afghan music at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Women can’t go back to the dark days — they can break our instruments, they can ban the music, but they never take it from our hearts.” The Taliban, who control or contest half the country, banned all forms of music during their brutal regime that ran from 1996 to 2001. Even now, when the orchestra played its last concert in Kabul in February, most of the 700 guests had to pass through as many as 10 security check points protected by armed guards and dogs. The U.S. reached a draft peace agreement with the insurgent group in January that may eventually lead to a withdrawal of foreign troops and a Taliban pledge not to allow terrorists to use the country. Talks aimed at bringing an end to 18 years of war were scheduled to begin again over the weekend, but appear to have been stalled. After being initially excluded from the U.S.-led talks, the Afghan delegation was set to include 52 women, up from just a handful in earlier sessions. The country’s key demands in the dialogue include preserving the current government system under “Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,” holding elections and retaining the current constitution. U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is leading the negotiations. He’s hoping to finalize a deal this year before presidential elections slated for September. Afghan women have repeatedly voiced concerns about the lack of female representation at the peace talks, particularly given what is at stake. Women have won hard-fought gains in politics, business and education since 2001, pushing back against the country’s male-dominated society. Last year about 400 female candidates contested in 68 seats reserved for women in the parliament, while hundreds of women run small businesses and teach at schools, and more than 3.5 million girls are now in education.","'We Won't Be Silenced,' Afghan Female Musicians Tell Taliban","April 19, 2019"
1079,Amy Gunia,"The Royal Thai Navy plans to remove a house built on a platform 12 miles off the coast of Phuket according to the Bangkok Post. American Chad Elwartowski and his Thai partner Supranee Thepdet, also known as Nadia Summergirl, were reportedly living in the house, built by Ocean Builders, to promote the concept of “seasteading.” “Seasteading is the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea, called seasteads, outside the territory claimed by any government,” says the company on its website. In a promotional video posted to YouTube in March, Elwartowski toasts his partner with champagne on the roof of their ocean dwelling. He says 20 more floating homes are planned so others can join them in a libertarian-style community that they believe will be beyond legal jurisdictions. Governments “have a monopoly on land but they don’t have a monopoly at sea,” Elwartowski says in the video. “We’re looking forward to freedom-loving people to come join us out on the open ocean.” In an earlier video, he says international waters are “where there are no laws other than the law of the sea.” But Thai authorities have a different view. They have filed a compliant, accusing the couple of breaching a section of the country’s criminal code that relates to threatening the sovereignty of a state, and erosion of a state’s independence, according to the Post.

1080,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Journalists around the world are seeing increased fear and violence in their line of work as media freedom faces further decline, according to data published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) on Thursday. The 2019 World Press Freedom Index categorizes the media climate in more than three-fourths of the 180 countries and territories studied as “problematic”, “difficult” or “very serious.” Just 8% have a media climate considered “good”. The U.S., Venezuela, Brazil, Iran and China saw their rankings drop. Of those five, China — which a separate report by RSF said is ramping up its interference and spread of propaganda not just locally, but in international media — is ranked lowest at 177, while the U.S.’ fall of three spots to 48 is notable as it marks the first time the country’s media climate has been labelled “problematic” in the index. RSF made reference to the attack on Maryland paper Capital Gazette last June, when a man opened fire at the publication’s offices, killing five members of staff. “This happened in a democracy, not in a country with a reputation of suppressing freedom of thought,” Cédric Alviani, the East-Asia Bureau Director of RSF, told TIME, explaining the shooting as one of the most significant events threatening press freedom in the past 12 months. Also in the Americas, Venezuela slipped four places to 148. Under the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, news outlets and social media platforms are regularly blocked, and critics arrested. Maduro has also consistently denied the existence of a humanitarian crisis in the country, blocking off the delivery of foreign aid until this week. In February, six U.S. journalists were deported after he said he “did not like” the questions they asked. “Democracy is in great danger,” RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire said. “Halting this cycle of fear and intimidation is a matter of the utmost urgency of all people.” At number 172, Saudi Arabia is the richest country in the bottom 10 of the list, falling three places from last year. In October 2018, Washington Post columnist and longtime critic of the regime, Jamal Khashoggi, was killed in the Saudi Arabia embassy in Istanbul, igniting global concern over further deteriorating press freedom in the conservative country. “Political leaders consistently denigrate and insult the work of journalists, assuming that media is just pushing an agenda whenever they hear something they don’t like,” Alviani said.","'An Intense Climate of Fear Has Been Triggered.'

1081,Madeline Roache,"The massive fire that engulfed Paris’ landmark Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday, causing the monument’s iconic spire to collapse, highlighted the difficulty in protecting historical buildings from fire. The cathedral is just one of many famous historical sites around the world that have been damaged by fire and required repair and restoration work to be returned to their former glory. Notre Dame sustained “colossal damage,” Cathedral spokesman Andre Finot told reporters. Firefighters are still surveying the full extent of the damage.  Many other historical buildings were able to re-open their doors after being successfully restored. With the work of skilled architects and builders, some sites were reconstructed in such a way that it is nearly impossible to tell the difference between original features and their replicas.  Duncan Wilson, Chief Executive of Historic England — a governmental body that protects historical sites — tells TIME that, despite the pain of seeing a beloved landmark burn, these disasters can present opportunities of their own. Building restorations, he says, can create jobs, strengthen the craftwork industries, and inject modern day creativity in architecture. Here’s a look at other historical structures that were ravaged by fire, only to be rebuilt: In 1992, a fire broke out in Windsor Castle, an official residence of Queen Elizabeth II and the largest inhabited castle in the world. The blaze damaged more than 100 rooms in the gothic estate. Wilson said that out of the destruction came an opportunity, as it helped “to encourage the development of craft skills and a first class restoration of 19th century interiors that had been degraded.” The Grace Cathedral – the third largest in the U.S. – burnt down in 1906 after a fire erupted in the city following one of the most significant earthquakes in history.",Notre Dame Isn't the First Historic Building to Be Rebuilt After Burning Down.

1082,Mahita Gajanan,"Firefighters took swift action after flames engulfed Paris’ Notre Dame cathedral and focused their efforts on preventing the fire from reaching its famed bell towers in order to save the entire structure, fire officials said Wednesday. “The two towers are pillars which keep the entire building up,” a Paris Fire Brigade official said during a press conference about two days after a fire spread in the cathedral. “The second you lose the war of the belfry, you lose the entire cathedral. It would have been a domino effect from there on out.” First responders to the fire said the flames could have had a much worse effect had they not acted quickly and put in place equipment to prevent a collapse. Firefighters managed to save the main structure of the building, the towers and most of the relics and artworks stored in the cathedral in the nine hours it took to contain the fire, officials said. The cathedral’s noted rose windows are “in good condition,” through its stone supports are at risk, Gabriel Plus, a spokesman for the fire brigade said. Now, experts and firefighters inside the Notre Dame are assessing what needs to be removed to avoid further damage and surveying the building for any remaining hot spots.  Fire officials did not have immediate information on reconstruction efforts, though they said the cathedral’s scaffolding and vaulted ceiling have been deformed through extensive heat damage. Support beams have been put in place to avoid further collapse of the structures, they said. As experts assess the extent of the damage, France’s government has issued a challenge to rebuild the Notre Dame’s spire, which collapsed in the fire. Prime Minister Edourad Philippe invited architects around the world to send in designs and ideas on how the spire should be rebuilt.

In an interview with TIME, the Liverpool striker spoke frankly for the first time about the importance of women’s equality. “I think we need to change the way we treat women in our culture,” Salah said. “It’s not optional.” He said seeing how women were treated “in my culture and in the Middle East” had changed the way he thought about gender relations. “I support the woman more than I did before, because I feel like she deserves more than what they give her now, at the moment.” After leading his country to the FIFA World Cup in 2018 for the first time in 28 years, Salah has become an icon in Egypt and across the region. In the interview, he said soccer fans in the Middle East “feel like I’m their son.” Salah, 26, admitted there was a “little bit of pressure” that came with being a role model, but also that it made him “proud” and pushed him to be a better soccer player. “To be the first Egyptian in [this] situation and no one has done this before … it’s something different,” he said. His favorite way to unwind after a game, he said, is spending time with his 5-year-old daughter, and being one of the top players in world football hasn’t changed his lifestyle. “I just live my life normal,” he said. “Most of the time I stay at home, I don’t like to go out.” Salah was named in the 2019 TIME 100 list of the world’s most influential people, and appears on one of the issue’s six covers.

He knew that forging a connection with each of the six honorees gracing the April 29 cover was the way to capture each subject’s essence in a portrait.  Dukovic learned that actor Sandra Oh loves ballet, so he made sure to bring up the discipline with her before they began shooting in Los Angeles, Calif. He also prepared to photograph Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, in Washington, D.C.; at the shoot, he spoke with her about the environmental work of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.  This is one piece of how the award-winning photographer makes his art. “I want to find a visual approach that celebrates [the subject] and captures their energy,” Dukovic tells TIME. It’s that energy, Dukovic says, that allowed him to capture the essence of the TIME 100, the annual list of artists, activists, leaders and visionaries who have impacted the world. This year’s edition has six covers, featuring Oh, Pelosi, Mohamed Salah, Taylor Swift, Gayle King and Dwayne Johnson.  To photograph soccer player Salah in Liverpool, England, Dukovic incorporated the athlete’s physicality into the shoot. Against a terra cotta backdrop, Dukovic worked to figure out the most efficient way to capture Salah kicking a soccer ball. “There’s a lot to think about in terms of the framing and how you really prepare the shot before you get him to do it,” he says. Some connections Dukovic made with his subjects, like King, were completely coincidental. King, born in Maryland, spent part of her childhood in Turkey, Dukovic’s home country. Connecting over that during the New York shoot was “pretty fantastic,” Dukovic says. Dukovic collaborated with TIME photo editor Dilys Ng to plan the photo shoots, which were all based on colorful mood boards. Using examples from previous shoots, Ng and Dukovic chose a color family for each subject, while connecting the covers with the same gradient effect. Although the color schemes, outfits, makeup and hair were all researched and planned in advance, much of each shoot was dependent on what happened in the moment. “Anything that’s pre-planned might change on set,” Ng explains.",The Story Behind the 2019 TIME 100 Covers,"April 17, 2019"
1085,YINAN ZHAO AND ENDA CURRAN / BLOOMBERG,"China’s economy rebounded through the first quarter, offering the government room for maneuver as trade negotiations with the U.S. enter a crucial stage. Gross domestic product rose 6.4 percent in the first three months from a year earlier — matching last quarter’s pace and beating economists’ estimates. Factory output in March jumped 8.5 percent from a year earlier, much higher than forecast. Retail sales expanded 8.7 percent while investment was up 6.3 percent in the year to date. The numbers are a reversal from as recently as January when key readings were pointing to a pronounced downturn. U.S. officials had previously touted such weakness as leverage in their push for a trade agreement. “President Trump and other U.S. officials spent much of the last year saying that China’s slowdown was making Beijing desperate for a deal,” said Michael Hirson, Practice Head, China and Northeast Asia at Eurasia Group and a former U.S. Treasury Department official. “Now that China’s growth is recovering, Trump and team will be getting more questions from pundits and the media about whether his leverage is slipping away.” While the better data isn’t likely to radically alter the course of negotiations that are already in their late stages, at the very least they will change the atmosphere, Hirson said. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who in January described China’s economy as “very weak,” on Tuesday said the negotiations are making “very good progress.” The exchange of tit for tat tariffs last year between the world’s two-biggest economies on roughly $360 billion worth of each others goods had dragged on global growth and hammered sentiment before both governments agreed a truce.

1086,Ciara Nugent,"Less than a day after French President Emmanuel Macron made a call for donations to help rebuild the landmark Notre Dame cathedral which was severely damaged in a blaze on Monday night, nearly $1 billion has been received in pledges. Experts say that restoring Notre-Dame, which took a century to build after construction started in 1160, will take years, or even decades. The director of UNESCO, the U.N.’s culture agency, told the Associated Press that work to protect the 12th Century stone and wood structure from water damage should start immediately, saying “the first 24, 48 hours” will be crucial to the building’s future. Stephane Bern, presidential cultural heritage envoy, told France Info that about €880 million (about $995 million) had been raised as of Wednesday, the AP reports. The bulk of the money has been promised by France’s wealthiest individuals and companies. François-Henri Pinault, the 56 year-old C.E.O. of Paris-based luxury goods group Kering, which owns brands like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, said Tuesday morning that his family would give around $113 million. The largest pledge came from Bernard Arnault, 70, whose family owns the luxury conglomerate LVMH. The Arnault family and LVMH will give $226 million to “show their solidarity at a this time of national tragedy,” the company said in a statement. LMVH, which owns Louis Vuitton, also offered the French state the use of its “creative, architectural and financial specialists” to assist in fundraising and reconstruction efforts. More pledges have rolled in following announcements by Pinault and Arnault. Patrick Poyanné, CEO of French energy company Total, said his firm would donate €100 million (about $113 million) for reconstruction efforts. The French cosmetics company L’Oreal pledged €200 million ($226 million) along with the Bettencourt-Schueller foundation and the Bettencourt Meyers family, which founded both organizations. The Walt Disney Company pledged to donate $5 million to aid in reconstruction efforts on Wednesday. Fundraising campaigns of all sizes have sprung up online.

1087,Mahita Gajanan,"A fire that engulfed the roof of Paris’s Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday put more than the famed landmark itself at risk — an important collection of artwork and Christian relics stored in and around Notre Dame also faced danger from the flames. Many of the most vital works of art and artifacts were saved from the Notre Dame fire, French Culture Minister Franck Riester said, according to the Associated Press. That includes the crown of thorns — believed by some to have been worn by Jesus during his crucifixion — and the tunic of St. Louis. Some works will be moved to the Louvre, where they are expected to be repaired or restored, if necessary. Firefighters and other emergency responders formed a human chain to save the crown of thorns and other relics from the Notre Dame fire, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said. Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of Paris’s fire brigade, joined the chain and entered the building to save what holy relics he could, according to local media. The cause of the blaze remains unclear; Notre Dame has been undergoing an extensive restoration process. Here are the works of art and artifacts that were saved, lost or destroyed in the Notre Dame fire: Among the most treasured artifacts that were saved include the Holy Crown of Thorns, a wreath of thorns believed to have been placed on Jesus Christ’s head during his crucifixion, and the tunic of St. Louis, believed to have belonged to Louis IX, who was king of France from 1226-1270. Notre Dame’s famed bell towers also survived the fire. Also thought to be safe is Notre Dame’s grand organ. Paris Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire said the organ, which has about 8,000 pipes and dates back to the 1730s, was still intact following the fire. However, Culture Minister Riester said during a news conference Tuesday that the organ was “quite affected” by the fire. While the instrument may be intact, it’s unclear whether it sustained water damage as the blaze was extinguished. The rose windows — three large stained glass windows for which Notre Dame is famous — appear to have survived the fire as well. The Archbishop of Paris told local news outlet BFM TV that the rose windows remain intact. Riester said Tuesday that the windows are faring well. “The large rose windows don’t appear to have suffered catastrophic damage,” he said.",The Notre Dame Fire Put Priceless Art and Artifacts at Risk.

1088,Vivienne Walt,"In the stunned aftermath of the Notre-Dame blaze on Monday night, French firefighters and experts ventured into the devastated cathedral on Tuesday morning to survey what remained. They finally declared — to the relief of millions — that the structure of the 859-year cathedral had been saved, and that firefighters had rescued some of the most precious relics and stashed them in Paris’s City Hall, even while the world watched aghast at flames leaping from the Medieval icon. French President Emmanuel Macron in a televised address on Tuesday night, said he would like the cathedral to be rebuilt in five years, and that he would organize an international donors’ conference in Paris. Offers of help to fund the rebuilding poured in on Tuesday, including from Apple and by day’s end, pledges had reached about $670 million. However, those who have for years tracked the declining condition of the cathedral wondered whether the fire might have been far less severe had they launched major renovations years ago — an option that the cash-strapped Notre-Dame had been unable to do. Notre-Dame began a €150-million ($170 million) construction project last year, in an effort to restore and upgrade the wooden roof and spire, which was considered to be the most urgently needed work. “It was a question of starting too late,” says Michel Picaud, head of the non-profit organization Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, which launched a fundraising effort across the U.S. in 2017 to pay for the work. “There was fire proofing everywhere, but it was not enough, after what we saw,” he told TIME on Tuesday morning. “The restoration of the cathedral had been taking place all along the years, since the 19th century. But it would have been better had we started this program much earlier.” There was a sense of disbelief among Parisians on Tuesday morning that Notre-Dame had been so vulnerable to devastation, after withstanding nearly a millennium of epic upheavals, including the French Revolution, and — in just the past century alone — two world wars and the Nazi occupation of Paris. Picaud said he had been in the cathedral all day Monday, and then raced back later from his home when the fire began. He stood in the vast square outside the famous bell towers until 2 a.m., along with hundreds of Parisians, watching horrified as firefighters battled for hours to get the blaze under control. With the cathedral now cordoned off to allow the firefighters to continue their work, Picaud has not been able to enter since. It was in the upper roof portion, where construction was ongoing, that the fire appears to have started. Some experts speculated to French journalists on Tuesday morning that the initial cause might have been a spark from a welder’s torch, although there is no proof for their theory. A large portion of the cathedral’s exterior is under scaffolding. French television reported that the fire appeared to smolder for a while before turning into a blaze. French officials ruled out any criminal act. Two-thirds of the roof collapsed in the fire, in the process also destroying some of the centuries-old statues of saints that were perched on the spire, Picaud said. Part of the nave and the choir are also gone.","We Tried to Save Notre Dame Too Late, Says Champion of Cathedral Restoration","April 16, 2019"

But for Venezuelans inside the country, just finding out what’s going on around them has become a struggle. As Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian government has overseen Venezuela’s collapse into unprecedented economic and humanitarian crisis since 2014, it has tried to restrict citizens’ access to information. Most television is state-run, and authorities ban the few independent TV and radio stations from covering Venezuela’s crisis as it unfolds: in widespread power outages, food and medicine shortages, and protests led by the opposition. Unable to afford the paper to print on, newspapers and magazines have all but disappeared. As a result, the Internet is the last place Venezuelans can turn for non-government sanctioned information. It’s also the opposition’s only way to organize — and that means it has become a key battleground in the fight for control of Venezuela. Authorities regularly block news outlets and social media or arrest critics who speak out online, while underfunded web infrastructure has slowed connection speeds to near unusable levels. But a network of activists and former journalists are fighting back. Creating underground news services on WhatsApp, and teaching the less tech-savvy to navigate restrictions, they are keeping information flowing around the country. “Most Venezuelans are in the dark, starving for information,” says Andrés Azpúrua, director of Internet freedom watchdog VE Sin Filtro (Venezuela Without Filter). “People are working really hard to get [it] to them.” Venezuela’s Internet freedom has been weakening for several years, with the country finally dropping from “partly free” to “not free” in annual reports by global democracy monitor Freedom House in 2017 – the year widespread protests broke out amid worsening living conditions caused by a drop in the global oil price and economic mismanagement. But Azpúrua says censorship has “accelerated rapidly” since January this year, when Juan Guaidó, the leader of Venezuela’s opposition-held parliament, staked a claim on the presidency. Guaidó argued that Maduro’s second term, won in rigged elections in 2018, was invalid, and that the constitution mandated he take charge temporarily. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans rallied in the streets to show support for his claim, while the U.S. and 50 other mostly Western countries have recognized Guaidó as president. Maduro retains the backing of key allies Russia, China and Turkey and, crucially, of the Venezuelan military. Venezuela is now subject to frequent information blackouts — periods of prolonged and widespread censorship that tend to occur precisely when the eyes of the world’s media are drawn to Venezuela. On the weekend of February 22, for example, as Guaidó supporters faced off with the military in an attempt to bring aid into Venezuela from Colombia, the dominant state-run internet service provider blocked Youtube and other streaming websites along with a number of domestic and foreign news outlets, according to VE Sin Filtro. Several online-only news broadcasters, which became a popular alternative to heavily censored television news during the 2017 protests, were blocked during the border face-off and have been inaccessible on most Internet service providers since. Almost every time Guaidó livestreams a speech on Instagram, Youtube or Periscope, the site will go down precisely when he starts, Azpúrua says. Authorities used to block sites with simple DNS (Domain Name System) blocking; under orders from the government, Internet service providers stopped connecting users to requested sites. As more and more people began to use VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to encrypt web traffic and stop it being intercepted, the government got more sophisticated, Azpúrua says, and started blocking VPN services too. “They haven’t won the war. But they’re definitely gaining ground.”",'Venezuelans Are Starving for Information.' The Battle to Get News in a Country in Chaos,"April 16, 2019"

1092,Amy Gunia,"Indonesian expatriate Ainun Najib was at home in Singapore with the flu when his countrymen went to the polls to cast their votes in Indonesia’s 2014 presidential election. It had been a vitriolic campaign between political outsider Joko Widodo, commonly known as Jokowi, and former general Prabowo Subainto. With a sick day from his tech job, he for once had time to follow the news unfolding 1,300 kilometers away. But he was not happy with what he saw. As the vote count rolled in, both contenders declared victory. To Indonesians like Najib, it was a deeply frustrating outcome. “After so many months of this nation being polarized, each side was so hostile, I just wanted to get this over with,” Najib tells TIME. “That’s what I was really, really hoping to see, and instead I was seeing prolonged conflict.” So Najib and several friends sprang to action. They set up a group called Kawal Pemilu, or Guard the Election, to independently verify the vote count. They put out a call on Facebook for volunteers to help, and had 700 recruits within a matter of hours. Using a combination of raw data released by the election commission and cross-checked data from polling stations, the team began publishing updated vote counts every 10 minutes. Their work was a hit with Indonesians who were seeking clarity on the results. The organization provided quick updates, pacifying Indonesians who had to wait two weeks for the country’s electoral commission to announce the official winner. The extensive data published by Kawal Pemilu was also the first time that social media and technology played an important role in monitoring the election process. “It was an effort to give transparency, to shed some light on what was really the result of the election because a lot of confusion and doubt had been spread,” said Najib. That effort appears to have worked. Since the 2014 election, Kawal Pemilu has been approached by several local election officials thanking them for their work. “The public scrutiny and the public transparency has allowed them to say no to people who attempted to either bribe them or coerce them into changing the results. Because they say ‘Hey its pointless, even if i change it for you, its all out there, it’s already published by Kawal Pemilu,'” Najib says.","Social Media Gets a Bad Rap in Elections, But Activists In Indonesia Are Using It to Boost Transparency","Updated: April 17, 2019 2:04 AM ET | Originally published: April 16, 2019"
1093,Amy Gunia / Hong Kong,"More than 1,000 posts related to the Tiananmen Square Massacre that were removed from the Internet by Chinese censors were made public on Monday. The database contains images of 1,256 posts that were deleted from Sina Weibo, a popular micro-blogging site with more than 400 million users, between 2012 and 2018. Researchers at the University of Hong Kong collected the posts as part of a project called Weiboscope, which tracks censorship on several Chinese social media networks. “Over the years we found Chinese netizens consistently continued to post about the Tiananmen Square crackdown in early June,” Dr. King-wa Fu, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong, who leads the project, told TIME. Nearly thirty years after the crackdown on student-led pro-democracy protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, it remains one of the most censored topics on the Chinese Internet. China’s censorship apparatus, dubbed the Great Firewall, and a army of censors thought to be in the millions, block all mentions of the event. Related words and topics are also banned, and authorities have even blocked references to the date — June 4, 1989 — that Chinese tanks rolled into Beijing’s Tiananmen Squares and left what is believed to be hundreds if not thousands of protesters dead. But Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese enclave, lies outside the Firewall, and researchers here were able to archive many posts before they were deleted.

1095,Olivia B. Waxman,"The full extent of the damage caused by the fire that broke out at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday can’t yet be known. The fire destroyed a majority of the original roof and Parisians who live nearby were evacuated during the day out of fear that the building might collapse entirely, but the towers were saved, no casualties have been reported so far and President Emmanuel Macron has promised to rebuild. The disaster may be the worst that the cathedral has experienced since the French Revolution, says Laurent Ferri, Curator of the pre-1800 Collections in the Rare Division and Manuscript Collections at Cornell University and a former curator at the French National Archives.  The devastation of one of the world’s most recognizable landmarks is always a shock, but the damage to Notre Dame has been particularly heartbreaking for the French and for people around the world, considering the building’s important role in the nation’s patrimony. “It’s not just a building,” Ferri says, “but a place that is extremely important in terms of collective memory and identity.” About one thousand workers labored to build the cathedral on the small island of Île de la Cité in the Seine River between 1163 and 1345, replacing an earlier church, as TIME explained in 1955: From an architectural standpoint, “it really helps launch the revolution we call Gothic Architecture,” says Stephen Murray, an expert on the building and Professor of Medieval Art History Emeritus at Columbia University. “The king of France wanted to build a magnificent cathedral to show that Paris was the political and economic capital of France,” says Ferri. “There was a strong alliance between church and state, and this idea that France was first among the Christian realms, so the largest and most magnificent cathedral would have to be in Paris.” In the intervening centuries, Notre Dame has also been where France has welcomed, and bid farewell to, its leaders and icons. Napoleon I was made emperor there in 1804. Pope Pius X beatified Joan of Arc there in 1909. And it’s the site of memorial services for French Presidents, such as the ceremony for Charles de Gaulle in 1970 and François Mitterrand in 1996.",Notre Dame Cathedral's History Has Always Been One of Destruction and Restoration,"April 16, 2019"

Heitz said interviews have begun with around 15 workers from the five companies that were working at the site as part of a renovation project. The Paris police have mobilized around 50 investigators, he added. According to the Associated Press (AP), assessments are being made to see if it is safe to enter the blackened structure, after the cathedral’s roof and spire collapsed Monday evening. Two police men and a firefighter have been reported injured. The French Interior Ministry said earlier on Twitter that over 400 firefighters had been mobilized to battle the blaze. They managed to save much of the landmark’s structure – including its two iconic 226 ft bell towers. The cathedral’s 18th-Century organ, one of the world’s most famous musical instruments, is intact, according to the AP.

1100,James Regan / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — France’s Yellow Vest protesters took to the streets for a 22nd straight Saturday, leading to clashes with police in the southwestern city of Toulouse, while the capital remained calm. Police used tear gas and water cannon in Toulouse to keep demonstrators out of the center of the city, French television showed. Parts of Paris and some regional cities were declared off limits to protesters following an eruption of violence last month, when anarchists sacked and burned stores and restaurants on the Champs-Elysees. Around 31,000 Yellow Vests turned out across France, including about 5,000 in Paris, according to Interior Ministry figures cited by AFP, up from about 22,300 last Saturday. The Yellow Vests have protested every Saturday since Nov. 17, with demands ranging from lower taxes and improved spending power to better public services, although numbers have declined since the movement began. French President Emmanuel Macron responded in part by holding a 10-week debate with citizens across the country on how to tackle France’s problems. In the coming days he’s due to set out his conclusions, designed to take the heat out of the protests. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Monday, after he was presented with a study outlining the findings of the debate, that the “clear message is that taxes must fall and fall fast.” For Laurence Boone, chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the key is for the government to spend more effectively and to prioritize equal opportunities in society. “Maybe public spending can decrease a bit, but most of all it’s not necessarily well targeted,” she told Le Monde newspaper in an interview published on Saturday. She added that while the middle classes felt they paid a lot of tax, their spending power had barely increased in the last decade.",France’s 'Yellow Vest' Protesters Take to the Streets for the 22nd Straight Weekend,"April 13, 2019"

While Kim hailed his relationship with Trump, he also said the U.S. has been making unilateral demands and should abandon that approach. “In any case we will wait with patience for the U.S. courageous decision by the end of this year but it will clearly be tough to get such a good opportunity like the last time,” Kim said in a speech at North Korea’s rubber-stamp legislature, according to the KCNA report. Kim’s remarks suggest an attempt to breathe new life into the stalled negotiations. While Trump said on Thursday that the door for dialog remains open and a summit “could happen,” he also rejected calls to revive economic projects between North and South Korea. In a leadership shuffle announced Friday, Kim consolidated his power and granted new legitimacy to officials involved in the talks. “They want to see the U.S. make the next move — that the steps that they took, such as returning war remains and shutting down missile sites, are even more grounds to demand the U.S. to relieve sanctions,” said Kim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Korean National Diplomatic Academy. “However, the U.S. has taken a more hard-line stance since the Hanoi summit.” Trump offered a positive outlook in his Saturday tweet: “North Korea has tremendous potential for extraordinary growth, economic success and riches under the leadership of Chairman Kim.”",President Trump Suggests Third Summit With Kim Jong Un Saying Relations Remain 'Very Good',"April 13, 2019"
1102,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: There’s been no shortage of drama in North Africa these last couple weeks following the ousters of longtime rulers in both Algeria and Sudan. But the other story you need to be paying close attention to is the current push being made by General Khalifa Haftar to capture the Libyan capital of Tripoli. As Libya knows all too well, getting rid of a brutal leader is only the beginning—the real question is what comes next, and this week’s developments in Libya provide a glimpse. Why It Matters: Libya has Africa’s largest proven oil reserves and is also a player in the natural gas market. That alone would be enough to make people pay attention to the country’s political situation. But Libya’s story is much more complicated—and instructive—than its impact on energy markets. It’s been nearly a decade since Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was deposed, and after an initial burst of optimism from both Libyans and the international community—not to mention legislative elections held in the wake of Gaddafi’s ouster—the political situation in Libya has gone from bad to worse. Libya was in no shape to transition to a functioning democracy so abruptly, and the last decade or so has made that all too clear. Making matters worse, the country’s descent into chaos and lack of governance also made it the de facto “gateway” into Europe during the continent’s migration crisis a few years back. Currently, the western half of the country is being “led” by a UN-backed government based out of Tripoli, but it has struggled to actually assert control over the city as its been carved up by warring militias. This stands in stark contrast to the eastern half of the country, which is ruled by Haftar, who strategically sidelined and co-opted various local militias to his own cause. Haftar used to be a close ally of Gaddafi before the two had a falling out in the 1980s; Haftar fled the country, and lived in Virginia for nearly 20 years (spending some of that time employed by the CIA) before returning to Libya to help in Gaddafi’s overthrow. From the remnants of Libya’s army, he cobbled together a fighting force now known as the Libyan National Army, strategically adding personnel and equipment (some of which came from foreign powers looking to curry favor) as the force grew—no one knows the exact number of people or weapons in his command at present. Amidst all the chaos, an ISIS branch sprung up in the country as well. France, which has historical ties to the county in addition to substantial oil interests, stepped up to help Haftar in his fight against ISIS, which ended up conferring him a certain amount of international legitimacy. After Haftar declared victory over ISIS in Libya in 2017, the international community has been talking about a political resolution to Libya’s current civil war, but seemed to accept that Haftar would be a major political player in Libya’s future and began orienting itself in that direction. It helps that Haftar is an avowed opponent of Islamic extremism, too. Last week, the UN Secretary General was in Tripoli for preparations for an upcoming peace summit ahead of elections slated for the end of this year. That’s when Haftar made his move, to everyone’s shock. Part of the purpose of the conference was to establish a constitutional framework for those upcoming elections. Collective wisdom was that Haftar would wait and capture the country through the ballot box. He seems to have opted to do so via violence instead. That UN conference has now been postponed indefinitely.",The Quick Read About… What's Happening in Libya,"April 12, 2019"
1103,Simon Shuster,"Sudan’s Omar al-Bashir may have been ousted by a popular revolution on Thursday, but his Russian allies are continuing their operations in the country, three Russian contractors in Sudan told TIME after the uprising. The mining contractors have worked in Sudan on-and-off since last year, under a wide-ranging cooperation deal that al-Bashir struck with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Nov. 2017. The Sudanese dictator characterized the deal at the time as giving Russia the “keys to Africa” in exchange for Russian “protection from aggressive U.S. actions” in the region. Putin accepted the arrangement, which involved supplies of Russian weapons and private military contractors to Sudan, as well as a variety of mining ventures. As TIME reported on April 4, Putin’s alliance with al-Bashir fit into a widening campaign of Russian influence across the developing world, where the Kremlin has moved to build a ragtag network of dictatorships over the past few years. The contractors told TIME on Friday that these mining ventures are, for the most part, continuing apace despite the turmoil in Sudan. “Of course the situation is a bit more unsettled now,” says a senior engineer at a Russian mining company, Broker Expert, that has been active in Sudan since last year. “There are new people in power. But so far it looks like we are moving ahead as planned,” the engineer said, asking not to be named as he was not authorized to speak with the media. To call the situation “unsettled” was an understatement. In a televised statement on Thursday, the Sudanese Defense Minister announced that al-Bashir had been detained by the military, declared martial law throughout the country and said a council of generals would rule Sudan during a two-year “transition period.” Activists and opposition leaders in Sudan have pledged to carry on the revolution at least until civilian rule is established. But even under the current military leadership, Russia’s days in the country are numbered, says Khalid Omer Yousif, the acting head of the Sudanese Congress Party, which has opposed the regime in Sudan. The transitional authorities “have signaled that their strategy is based on normalization of the relationship with the Saudis and the Americans,” he says in a phone interview. “So the Russians have no chance right now. They lost their ally.” Al-Bashir managed the relationship with Russia personally. He visited Putin twice in the past two years, despite an arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court, which indicted al-Bashir in 2009 for war crimes and genocide against his own people. Putin was glad to welcome him during both visits, the first time in his residence in Sochi and the second time in the Kremlin. But since al-Bashir’s downfall on Thursday after 30 years in power, the Russian authorities have avoided publicly taking sides in the ongoing struggle for power. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Moscow urged all political and military forces in Sudan to act “extremely responsibly in the aim of stabilizing the situation as soon as possible and not allowing any further escalation.” Speaking to Russian news agencies, the spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, added that Russian citizens should avoid traveling to Sudan until further notice due to the “challenging security situation” in the country.","It's Business as Usual for Russians in Sudan, Despite Bashir's Fall","April 12, 2019"
1104,Abhishyant Kidangoor,"Standing right next to a bullet-ridden red brick wall in the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial in the north Indian city of Amritsar is a signboard with a caption that reads: “The wall has its own historical significance as it has 36 bullets marks which can be easily seen.” Those 36 bullets were among the 1,650 fired by British troops into an unarmed crowd, without warning, on April 13, 1919. The events of that day would come to be known as the Amritsar or Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The massacre came amid years of conflict between Britain and India, which was then held under colonial rule. During the First World War, Indian troops and resources had been widely utilized by the British, who promised that India’s sacrifices would lead to greater self-rule. But when the war ended in 1918, that pledge did not turn into real change. In fact, in early 1919 the British passed legislation, the Rowlatt Act, that enabled them to incarcerate anyone suspected of plotting the overthrow of British control — prompting independence leader Mahatma Gandhi to call for nationwide strikes. Tensions were high, and it was under these circumstances that Colonel Reginald Dyer was given charge of the city of Amritsar, in Punjab. Dyer quickly imposed tight restrictions on public gatherings. However, when people came to gather at the Jallianwala Bagh, a public garden, on April 13, few knew about the ban. It was the day of Baisakhi, a Sikh festival, for which people from neighboring towns were visiting the holy city. Pilgrims as well as some peaceful protestors were among the many in the garden when Colonel Dyer and his troops surrounded it, sealed the exit and started firing. While British estimates said 379 people were killed in the incident, unofficial Indian records placed the death toll in the thousands. A century later, as India commemorates the anniversary of the massacre — which has been called one of the most brutal acts by the British Empire — long-standing demands for a formal apology by the United Kingdom have been brought back into the spotlight. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter Indian political leaders, members of the British-Indian diaspora as well as descendants of victims have repeatedly raised the request. Following a debate in the House of Commons on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May called the incident “a shameful scar on British Indian history,” but did not issue an apology as demanded by some in Parliament, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Both Queen Elizabeth II and former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron have also visited the memorial — in 1997 and 2013 respectively — and condemned the incident, but likewise stopped short of issuing an apology.","A Century After a Massacre in India During British Colonial Rule, the U.K. Faces Demands for an Apology","April 12, 2019"
1105,Wilder Davies,"Two Reuters journalists who are currently serving seven-year prison sentences in Myanmar are to be awarded a prize for press freedom by the U.N.’s cultural organization. The 2019 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano Press Freedom Prize, which honors the defense and promotion of press freedom, is being awarded to Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo as a tribute to their courage and commitment to freedom of expression, according to a press release from UNESCO. The two journalists had been working on stories about a military crackdown and alleged human rights violations in Rakhine state in Myanmar when they were arrested. They were also named as TIME’s Person of the Year, along with three other journalists and a news organization, last December. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were first detained by authorities on Dec. 12, 2017, on the grounds of possessing classified state documents by the Myanmar government. The arrest has been largely condemned as a set-up by police in retaliation for their investigation of the massacre of Rohingya people in Rakhine State at the hands of Myanmar military forces. The two men had been invited to dinner in the former capital of Yangon by police forces, where they were presented documents and immediately detained. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were detained for 265 days before they were sentenced to seven years in prison for violation of the Official Secrets Act, an archaic law dating back to the colonial era. Their investigation was published by Reuters while they were awaiting trial in February 2018, and included graphic photography and detailed accounts providing evidence that state security forces were implicated in carrying out extrajudicial killings of 10 Rohingya at the village of Inn Din. The Myanmar government has been accused of ethnic cleansing and genocide of Rohingya Muslims by the U.N. and various human rights organizations since 2016.  Particular scrutiny has been placed on State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, a former Nobel Peace Prize winner who since been condemned for her inaction regarding the Rohingya crisis and for the withering of press freedom that has occurred under her leadership.  The UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize was created in 1997 and is awarded to a laureate who is “nominated by an international jury of experts,” UNESCO spokesperson George Papagiannis tells TIME. It is awarded to an individual or organization who has “made a notable contribution to the defense and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world, especially if risks have been involved,” he adds.  In the press release, president of the jury Wojciech Tochman explained the decision to honor Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, stating the choice “pays a tribute to their courage, resistance and commitment to freedom of expression,” and that the men “symbolize their country’s emergence after decades of isolation.” The award will be presented on UNESCO’s celebration of World Press Freedom Day in Addis Ababa on May 2.  According to Papagiannis, the organization hopes to present the award to family members of the imprisoned journalists in their absence.",Reuters Journalists Jailed in Myanmar to Receive U.N.

1106,Tessa Berenson,"Wikileaks is at the center of major questions in Robert Mueller’s investigation, including whether anyone involved in Donald Trump’s presidential campaign assisted the organization in releasing hacked materials. But the charge in the one-count indictment against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange unsealed on Thursday shortly after his arrest doesn’t speak to those questions or broader First Amendment issues. In an indictment dated March 6, 2018, the United States charges Assange with one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. The indictment alleges “that in March 2010, Assange engaged in a conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army, to assist Manning in cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network, a U.S. government network used for classified documents and communications.” Conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, is the “meat and potatoes” in the world of computer crime, says Paul Rosenzweig, who teaches at the George Washington University School of Law and was deputy assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. “Almost everybody that you see who’s charged with a computer fraud of some sort gets a charge that’s somewhere like this.” This fits with the typical prosecutorial strategy of charging someone with a smaller, more easily provable crime in what could be a larger criminal context. “The conspiracy component of it can be pretty easy to prove, that there had to be some degree of coordination of efforts and action,” says Thomas Holt, a professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University who is an expert in computer hacking. “So conspiracy is a way to… treat it as low-hanging fruit where you can at least demonstrate through email and other communications that they were working in some degree in concert to produce an outcome.” Limiting the indictment against Assange to this one, narrower charge and not charging him with espionage leaves aside any First Amendment questions that could have been raised about Wikileaks publishing classified material. “There has been a lot of speculation that the U.S. would indict Assange merely for distributing classified material,” former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti wrote on Twitter. “You have heard a lot of concern about that, and it is justified. Many legitimate press publications in the U.S. distribute classified material at times.” But this indictment does not charge Assange with a crime related merely to the publication of the material. Rosenzweig offers this analogy: If a journalist has sources offering classified documents, the journalist can publish those documents and this indictment against Assange has no bearing on that. But if a source tells a journalist there are documents behind a locked door, and the journalist offers to help pick the lock, that’s when it becomes a crime. “You as a journalist have become engaged in a criminal enterprise in a way that’s different from normal journalist behavior,” Rosenzweig says of that scenario. This is where relevance to Mueller’s Russia investigation comes in. In 2016, hackers that the U.S. government believes to have been directed by the Russian government hacked the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta. Batches of the hacked emails were released by Wikileaks. Mueller indicted Russian intelligence officers for crimes related to this operation, but he did not charge Assange. There are two key relevant questions in Mueller’s investigation. The first is how the hacked material made its way from Russia’s Internet Research Agency to Wikileaks, and whether Trump advisor Roger Stone or anyone else associated with the campaign was in that chain of custody. The second, related question is whether Stone or anyone else in the campaign assisted in targeting the hacking or selecting and timing the release of hacked material. (Stone has been charged with lying to Congress and obstructing an investigation into his communications with Assange. Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen also testified that he was present for a July 2016 phone call during which Stone informed Trump that Assange was planning to publish hacked Democratic emails.)",Why the Charge Against Julian Assange Makes No Mention of Espionage or 2016 Russian Hacking,"April 11, 2019"
1107,Marie Le Conte,"Before his country voted to leave the European Union on that fateful day of June 23, 2016, Ralf Little had little interest in what happened in Westminster, the political heart of the U.K. Now, the British actor and footballer says, his eyes have been opened. “Imagine waking up on a transatlantic flight to discover that the plane is not being flown, as you thought, by a quiet, competent pilot. In fact, while you were asleep it was taken over by a gang of giggling, clammy-handed ten-year-olds, hopped up on Haribo.” The Brexit vote was a wake-up call for many Britons. For some, it was a victory, and a sign that the political elite could no longer ignore certain parts of the population. For others, it was a shock and a realization that perhaps they did not know their fellow countrymen as well as they thought. But the referendum was only the beginning. It has now been nearly three years since former Prime Minister David Cameron gambled, lost and resigned, and Brexit mania shows no sign of loosening its grip on the national conversation. Indeed, the process is actually getting longer. For months, the deadline for Brexit was March 29, exactly two years after Britain triggered the mechanism to formally quit the E.U. That date was then changed to Apr. 12, then — late on Wednesday night — to Oct. 31.  In the months and years since the vote, Britain has discovered the split down its middle cuts deeper than it first appeared. While the question on the referendum ballot paper was straightforward – “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?” – it paved the way for dozens of other existential queries. What is Britain’s place in the world? What should it be? Have we talked about its imperial past enough, or too much? Is immigration a problem, or a lack of integration, or both or neither? Is there too much of a gap between cities and towns? Can it be mended? If so, who should make the first step? Were Leave voters more xenophobic than Remain voters were elitist? And where does Ireland fit into all this? These questions have been debated in newspaper columns, on television shows, and in pubs, coffee shops, at Christmas dinners and everywhere else. Parents have fallen out with their children, siblings screamed at each other, relationships have been tested and friendships broken down. “I have taken quite a hard line position on how we should go about Brexit and wound up some of my closest friends and family,” says political commentator and author Isabel Oakeshott. “I am constantly being mocked, jeered and barracked on live TV and radio. It’s very exposing, and nobody’s idea of fun.” Even though they lost, the so-called “Remainers” are at least clear on what they would like to see next; the U.K. to stay in the E.U. after all, either through Parliament overturning the vote or through a second referendum. The “Brexiteers,” on the other hand, have had to reconcile the different visions voters had for casting their ballot to leave. There were Singapore-style Brexiteers, yearning for their country to go out into the world and become an open, buccaneering nation; those who wanted the country to shut its borders and turn in on itself; those hoping that recouped contributions to the E.U. could fund more schools and hospitals and turn Britain towards a protectionist left; and so on",The Neverending Nightmare of Life in Brexit Britain,"April 11, 2019"
1108,Suyin Haynes,"In a victory for women’s rights in South Korea, the country’s top court ordered the government to decriminalize abortion Thursday, reforming a 66-year-long widespread ban on the procedure. South Korea’s current laws governing abortion are some of the strictest in the developed world, criminalizing the practice in most cases, and only allowing for exceptions in cases of rape, incest or if a woman’s or girl’s health is endangered by the pregnancy. In these instances, abortions must be performed within the 24 hours and are subject to spousal consent. Women who terminate pregnancies can face fines of up to KRW 2 million ($1,850) or one year in jail, and medical professionals assisting with abortions can face prison terms of up to two years if convicted. Thursday’s ruling by South Korea’s Constitutional Court was related to an appeal by a doctor who was prosecuted for carrying out 70 abortions between 2013 and 2017, the Associated Press reports. The court ruling ordered South Korea’s National Assembly to create legislation easing the current regulations by the end of 2020, calling the current abortion law incompatible with the constitution. Women’s rights activists and campaigners rallied outside the court in scenes of jubilation when the ruling was announced, after demonstrations had taken place to protest the ban on March 30. The case has polarized debate in South Korea in recent weeks, with anti-abortion activists carrying placards featuring fetuses also rallying outside the court. “Abortions will always happen, regardless of the law. This judgment means that they should be carried out safely and legally, and that women and girls are treated with compassion and respect for their human rights and their reproductive autonomy,” said Roseann Rife, Amnesty International’s East Asia Research Director, in a statement responding to the ruling. “Their dignity must be front and centre in any new legal framework on abortion.” Write to Suyin Haynes at suyin.haynes@time.com.",South Korea's Top Court Orders Government to End 66-Year-Old Abortion Ban,"April 11, 2019"
1109,Pico Iyer,"Every morning, my Japanese wife Hiroko gets out of bed before dawn and boils hot water to make tea for her father. It hardly matters that he died six years ago. The household altar on which she also lays out his favorite snacks sits next to the boom box on which she’ll soon be blasting out Green Day’s “21st Century Breakdown.” When she gets a day off from the Paul Smith store where she sells semipunk English fashions, she travels two hours–each way–by train to talk to her grandmother, who left this earth in 1979. Hiroko still remembers how whenever she kicked a chair as a little girl, her father told her to apologize. The chair had a soul and heart too, he reminded her. What had it done to harm her? Some of this may sound strange to the fashion-mad kids in Tokyo’s Harajuku district. The ancient capitals around which Hiroko and I live, Nara and Kyoto, take Japan’s traditions more seriously than do the rebuilt cities of modern Japan. And Hiroko in her autumn years is certainly more diligent about honoring old customs than she might have been in her springtime years. Yet the fact remains: on arriving in Kyoto in 1987, from midtown Manhattan, I was struck most by the trendy girls in fishnet stockings, the ubiquitous burger joints, the sound of pinball racketing through fluorescent shopping arcades. After 32 years around my adopted home, I’m most startled by the resilience of everything that’s old. Geopolitically, this hasn’t been a blessing. Japan regularly finishes close to the bottom in all of Asia–far behind North Korea, Cambodia and Indonesia–when it comes to English-language proficiency. At Princeton, where I’m teaching this month, the classrooms are full of students from Shanghai and Mumbai and Singapore; I have yet to encounter a single one from Japan. As the number of international visitors to Japan has surged, from 5 million in 2003 to 31 million last year–the number may reach 40 million with the Tokyo Olympics next year–the country is eager to make foreigners feel at home. Yet what draws us visitors to the island nation is not how familiar it feels but how distinct. Many might say, in fact, that Japan has not strayed far from the hermit kingdom it remained for more than 200 years, when any citizen trying to leave the islands was executed. In recent years it’s found that marketing its past is almost its only way of fashioning a future, economically. After urbanist Richard Florida at the University of Toronto measured 45 countries for their closeness to tradition, modern-seeming Japan came out No. 1. Culturally, this makes for an evergreen advantage: the birthplace of sushi and manga and ramen is in no danger of being mistaken for anywhere else. In an age of global migration, the continuity of Japan has become selling point as well as affliction. I look at the calendar in my neighborhood in suburban Nara, and almost every event seems to speak for an agrarian, long-ago Japan that hovers around us as vividly as my late father-in-law does. Bonfires to propitiate the gods in the hope of a good harvest. A lantern festival illuminating the sacred forest around one of the country’s most revered Shinto shrines. A ceremonial cutting of the antlers of some of the roughly 1,200 wild deer that roam, untethered, through the city’s downtown. Japan’s retrograde treatment of women, of anyone who acts differently–of people as dark-skinned as I am–has left it increasingly out of sync with the global order; but I urge my friends to visit because even McDonald’s will be serving moon-viewing burgers to go with the harvest moon this September. This month my neighbors are streaming out into temple gardens to bawl drunken songs under the frothing cherry blossoms. On May Day, a new imperial era arrives as Crown Prince Naruhito ascends the Chrysanthemum Throne. But changing constantly on the surface seems almost a way in Japan of ensuring that nothing changes very much deep down. Next month, and next year, Hiroko in her leather jacket will still be urging our daughter, on her days off, to make the long trip from her smoothie shop to pour fresh water on her great-grandmother’s grave.

1110,Ian Bremmer,"“We’re very well along,” says President Trump about U.S.-China trade talks. “Significant work remains,” caution his spokespeople. Negotiators representing the world’s two largest economies have worked hard for months to resolve long-standing conflicts over market access, protection of intellectual property, and other issues that led Trump last year to order billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese goods. The two remaining outstanding goals appear to be U.S. willingness to quickly lift tariffs and Chinese willingness to allow the U.S. to verify that China is keeping its promises, but optimism is in the air that a deal will soon be done. For good and for ill, there are significant similarities between this agreement and the 2015 nuclear deal the Obama Administration struck with Iran. Both involve lengthy, complex negotiations among teams of both technical experts and seasoned diplomats. As with the Iran deal, the U.S.-China agreement will be greeted with extraordinary fanfare. And, perhaps most important, these are both deals agreed to by the representatives of governments that deeply distrust each other. That’s why a U.S.-China trade pact, like the Iran nuclear deal, is unlikely to last very long. One of Iran’s bitterest complaints is that the Obama Administration left many sanctions in place even after the nuclear deal was signed. Trump may well do the same with China, and the threat that Trump will abruptly tweet out new threats will hang over future relations. China, like Iran, will allow for some sort of verification process to prove it’s keeping its end of the deal, but the President may not always be satisfied with the result, particularly if U.S. and Chinese officials interpret the agreement differently, because of their economic interests and essential mistrust of each other. A further similarity: other governments will be left with the mess when the deal breaks down. A series of reports issued earlier this month underscore just how many interested parties there are. The Asian Development Bank says trade disputes between Washington and Beijing create the most important current risk for Asia’s regional economy. The International Monetary Fund notes that today’s global supply chains leave South Korea and Japan, as well as Germany, Italy, the U.K. and France, especially vulnerable to an economic slowdown triggered by tariffs. The World Trade Organization warns that tit-for-tat tariffs, like those at play in the U.S.-China trade war, threaten global jobs, growth and economic stability. Donald Trump wants a deal. He needs a major political win to open his campaign for re-election, and there are few other foreign policy achievements he can credibly claim. Chinese President Xi Jinping wants a deal too. He’s managing a long-term slowdown of China’s economy and needs to avoid criticism at home that the “new era” of Chinese power he has proclaimed has forced his country and its economy into an unwelcome international spotlight. The negotiators representing the two governments want an agreement that will satisfy the political needs of their Presidents while resolving enough problems in U.S.-China trade relations to give the deal a chance to stand the test of time. But mistrust extends well beyond the men at the top. China and the U.S. will compete for domination in coming years across the political, economic, security and technology arenas. A signed agreement can make an important difference to limit this competition. It can also be destroyed more quickly than it was constructed. Just ask Iran. Contact us at editors@time.com.

1111,Joseph Hincks,"The continuing reign of King Bibi is all but guaranteed. Benjamin Netanyahu was on track to a record fifth term as Israel’s Prime Minister on April 10 after challenger Benny Gantz conceded defeat in what at first appeared to be a close contest. Both Netanyahu’s Likud and Gantz’s Blue and White parties won 35 seats in balloting a day earlier. What made the difference–a telling one–was the surge by the right-wing and religious parties that Netanyahu calls “natural partners” in a coalition that will hold a Knesset majority. The outcome continues the transformation of Israel from a state dominated in its early decades by its leftist founding Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to the country poised to see Netanyahu surpass him as its longest-serving Prime Minister. The election, framed as a referendum on Netanyahu’s leadership, was prefaced by Israel’s Attorney General confirming in February that he would indict the incumbent on bribery, fraud and breach-of-trust charges, pending hearings. Fighting for his political life, Netanyahu rallied against Israel’s media and judiciary on the campaign trail. He was accused of incitement against the country’s Arab voters, just as he had been during the 2015 vote. The charges did not hurt him with his base. In the final days, Netanyahu consolidated his right-wing support with a promise to embark on “the next phase to extend Israeli sovereignty” by annexing major Jewish settlements in the West Bank–fulfilling a long-held ambition of Israelis who see the occupied Palestinian territory as part of biblical Israel. Analysts suggest Netanyahu might now offer annexation up in a quid pro quo deal if right-wing parties agree to offer him immunity against indictment. Such a move would formalize the death of the two-state solution that envisioned a Palestinian state alongside Israel and was undone by the second intifadeh, or Palestinian uprising. Annexation would be “devastating,” says Nimrod Novik, a former foreign policy adviser to Israel’s late Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Novik said it would fatally undermine the West Bank–based Palestinian Authority (PA), which wants to achieve its vision of statehood by political means instead of armed struggle, while precipitating “a very sharp rise in recruiting for Hamas,” the faction that advocates armed resistance and terrorist attacks. Saeb Erekat, secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said Israelis had voted “no to peace and yes to the occupation.” Netanyahu benefited from a White House that makes no pretense of neutrality. U.S. President Donald Trump has moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and, on election eve, named Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a terrorist group, a move that Netanyahu said he’d requested. “The fact that Bibi won, I think we’ll see some pretty good action in terms of peace,” Trump said April 10, alluding to his promised “deal of the century.” The plan, which may finally be unveiled in coming weeks, is expected to offer economic incentives at the expense of Palestinian territorial claims. That approach abandons the central premise of the 1993 Oslo Accords–under which Palestinians would renounce violence in exchange for a state of their own–in favor of continued Israeli control over Palestinians. PA President Mahmoud Abbas has vowed to reject such a deal, amid fading hopes for a breakthrough. Netanyahu’s win “diminishes to a bare minimum the prospects of a two-state reality, let alone a two-state solution in the foreseeable future,” says Gilead Sher, who served as chief of staff to former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the last liberal politician Israel voted to lead it, two decades ago.",Netanyahu Gets His Chance to Enter History Books as Israel’s Longest-Ever Leader,"April 11, 2019"
1112,John Walcott,"President Donald Trump will face a difficult, potentially dangerous, decision when he meets with South Korean president Moon Jae-In at the White House today, three U.S. officials familiar with the matter tell TIME. The U.S. intelligence community has advised the White House that Moon will ask Trump to ease some of the economic sanctions imposed on North Korea for its rogue nuclear and missile programs, the officials say. If Trump says Yes, that could help restart diplomatic talks that have stalled since his failed Hanoi summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last February. But even a modest concession on sanctions could solidify Pyongyang’s status as a nuclear weapons power, leaving U.S. allies in northeast Asia vulnerable and potentially launching a regional arms race. Trump could avoid that outcome by saying No to Moon’s request. But that risks a return to the saber rattling, or worse, that marked the early days of Trump’s tenure, when fears of war with North Korea spiked. Kim recently signaled his readiness to return to confrontation, despite Trump’s public assertions that the two leaders are good friends. The Catch-22 is the result of bad diplomacy by both Trump and Kim, the U.S. officials say. Trump continues to believe that a combination of personal diplomacy and economic pressure will eventually get Kim to abandon his nuclear arsenal, the officials say. Trump is still ignoring the unanimous assessment of intelligence, defense and State Department officials that Kim never will. Kim, for his part, remains wedded to the idea that Trump will accept an agreement that implicitly concedes North Korea’s nuclear status in exchange for a formal end to the Korean War after 66 years. Trump, Kim is betting, cares more about claiming credit for a diplomatic win than actually solving the problem of a nuclear North Korea. Kim may be right. Even without a deal, Trump has taken a few small steps in Moon’s direction, including last month calling off two major joint military exercises with U.S. and South Korean forces. Trump also has claimed that he has eliminated the nuclear threat from Pyongyang. That claim that has fallen on deaf ears in Tokyo, Seoul, and U.S. forces in Northeast Asia, all of whom lie within range of a potential missile strike from North Korea.",President Trump Faces Tough Decision on North Korea at White House Today,"April 11, 2019"
1113,Billy Perrigo/London,"The founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange was found guilty of skipping bail in the U.K. on Thursday, and faces likely extradition to the U.S., after a dramatic day that began with his arrest at the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he had been under diplomatic protections since 2012. U.K. police confirmed on Thursday that he was arrested “on behalf of the United States authorities” as well as on U.K. charges of “failing to surrender without reasonable excuse.” The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia said that he faces up to five years in prison on charges of “conspiracy to commit computer intrusion” related to the 2010 leak of hundreds of thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables. Ecuador withdrew Assange’s asylum on Thursday morning, inviting police officers with a warrant for his arrest into the Central London embassy. Assange first barged past officers shouting “this is unlawful, I’m not leaving,” according to prosecutors, before being handcuffed and bundled into a police van. Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno cited Assange’s bad behavior in the embassy as one reason for allowing U.K. police to arrest Assange. At trial later that afternoon, a U.K. district judge found Assange guilty of skipping bail — a charge for which he had been wanted since 2012 — calling him “a narcissist who cannot see beyond his own selfish interest.” Assange could be sentenced to up to a year in prison in the U.K. but may be extradited to the U.S. before serving time. “Papers for the extradition proceedings have to be circled within 65 days,” Assange’s barrister Liam Walker told TIME. Assange, 47, received diplomatic asylum from Ecuador after breaching bail in the U.K. during an investigation into sexual assault allegations in Sweden. Sweden has since rescinded its arrest warrant for Assange, though the case is not closed. The WikiLeaks founder shot to prominence in 2010 when his site published a cache of leaks from the U.S. military provided by former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, including videos showing U.S. troops allegedly killing civilians. Assange has argued that he could be arrested by the U.S. if he were arrested in the U.K. or extradited to Sweden. U.S. prosecutors allege that that Assange helped Manning crack a password to access a government network on Department of Defense computers.

1114,Vivienne Walt/Brussels,"The decision came as a surprise. When the Nobel Committee awarded its annual Peace Prize in 2012, the betting markets had predicted a laureate involved with the Arab Spring. Almost no one expected the prize to go to a fusty institution that had transformed a continent of war to one of peace–the European Union. “War is as old as Europe,” explained Herman Van Rompuy, the first European Council president, accepting the award in Oslo in December that year. “Our continent bears the scars of spears and swords, cannons and guns, trenches and tanks, and more.” Today, Europe calls to mind bureaucracy. Instead of gunfire and the rattle of tank tracks, the soundtrack to the E.U. is the quiet rustling of papers in the hallways of its capital, Brussels. After the traumas of genocide and upheaval, Europe now embraces compromise. “For this,” Van Rompuy said, “boring politics is only a small price to pay.” But they’re not so boring lately. One of the world’s most extraordinary experiments in governance–a union throwing together what is now 28 countries with wildly different cultures, to fight around a negotiating table rather than on the battlefield–is under siege from within. In the decades after the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957, which created the E.U.’s predecessor, glorious blandness came to define Europe. Over time, countries surrendered segments of their governance to a faceless entity that diffuses authority across a handful of confoundingly named institutions: the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament and the European Commission. In his Nobel Peace Prize speech, Van Rompuy referred to the E.U.’s secret weapon as “binding our interests so tightly that war becomes materially impossible.” Those interests range from the common euro currency in 19 countries to frictionless trade and the free movement of people to live and work across the 28 member states. And in the Parliament in Brussels, 751 representatives forge common policies that affect more than 500 million people, on everything from trade and agriculture to technology and the environment. In Brussels, lawmakers make countless decisions about the cars Europeans drive, the food they eat and the pets they own. It’s an opaque system that most Europeans either struggle to understand or display little interest in trying. Until now there’s been only tepid attention paid to elections for the European Parliament, which take place every five years; in 2014, fewer than 43% of voters even bothered to go to the polls. This time, the stakes are higher. As the campaign ramps up ahead of parliamentary elections May 23–26, the first Europe-wide vote since an unprecedented wave of migration roiled the continent, Europeans sense they can no longer take their union for granted. Far-right nationalists have banded together in an effort to consolidate their power across the union. Politicians once sidelined as fringe extremists have moved into the mainstream, even if many are still in the opposition. And they are increasingly confident about their chances in May. “With every election in the last three years, in Sweden, Italy, Hungary, Austria, [it is] like dominoes, bing, bing, bing,” Marine Le Pen says, sitting in her office recently in the French Parliament in Paris.",How Nationalists Are Joining Together to Tear Europe Apart,"April 11, 2019"
1115,Ciara Nugent,"Britain today is consumed by its relationship with Europe. Almost three years after 52% of U.K. voters opted to leave the European Union, lawmakers and the public are still struggling to decide what they want their future ties to the bloc to look like, forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to repeatedly ask other E.U. leaders for an extension of the exit date. On April 10, they set a new deadline of October 31. “Please do not waste this time,” European Council president Donald Tusk warned. Many Brits want a Brexit deal that keeps them close to the E.U., allowing deep trade links, free migration and shared regulations. Others would prefer, if no satisfactory plan emerges, to crash out of the bloc with no deal in place, and instead forge a new national identity outside of Europe. Others still, millions of them, are calling for an new referendum. But Brexit is far from the first time Britain has questioned whether it really belongs with the continent that surrounds it. For centuries, from the Roman invasion to the joining of the E.U.’s predecessor in 1973, Britain has alternated between moving closer to and pulling away from Europe. TIME spoke to British historian Jeremy Black, a Professor at Exeter University and author of Britain and Europe: A Short History, about five key chapters in the history of that relationship, and what they might reveal about the U.K.’s current existential crisis. Britain’s first major contact with the continent across the sea came around 55-54 BC, when Julius Caesar arrived and began incorporating much of modern-day England and Wales into the sprawling Roman empire. A century later, in 43 AD, a full-scale invasion followed. From then, for almost 400 years, southern Britain was ruled from Rome. (However, the invaders never managed to tame unruly Scotland, and in 128 AD Emperor Hadrian built at 73-mile coast-to-coast wall on the northwest edge of its territory to keep the northerners out.) Black says that during this period indigenous pagan religions began to be “amalgamated” with Roman cults, while elites forged cultural ties with Rome. Meanwhile, trade with the rest of the Roman-ruled continent “developed greatly.” Crucially, Roman traders traveling to Europe spread the story of Jesus. Though Christianity remained a marginal faith in Britain for hundreds of years, once it took hold, the religion — and the question of how it should be practiced — would become the defining factor in Britain’s relationship with Europe, tying them together for centuries after the end of Roman rule in around 410 AD. By the beginning of the 1500s, England had been looking to the Pope for religious authority for almost 1,000 years, ever since church rulers had in the 600s opted to follow the rules and regulations of Roman Catholicism, rather than those preached by Irish monks. The Reformation — “Britain’s greatest-ever break with Europe,” Black says — would change that. In Western Europe, German monk Martin Luther was speaking out about the corruption and excess he perceived in the Catholic Church. By the mid-1520s, his ideas had sparked fierce debate among academics in England. Some were beginning to see papal authority as an affront to English sovereignty. Around the same time, King Henry VIII had his own grievance with the church: Pope Clement VII had refused to annul his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, which he needed in order to marry his mistress, Anne Boleyn. Henry decided to break with Rome and Catholicism, forging ahead with his divorce, founding the Christian Church of England in 1534 and dissolving monasteries across the country. “The Reformation was highly divisive,” Black says. “Minorities who remained Catholic objected to the Reformation, of course, and Protestants objected to Catholics having, as they saw it, a loyalty to a foreign jurisdiction.”","It's Complicated: From the Roman Empire to Brexit, Britain Has Always Struggled to Define Its Relationship With Europe","April 11, 2019"

People seen acting inappropriately in pictures and videos have been warned that they could also face charges of committing obscene acts in public.

The warnings over photo sharing come just days after organizers of the annual Songkran party on Bangkok’s Khao San Road announced that the celebrations were being canceled this year to make way for the coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn. The party at the famed tourist strip normally draws large throngs of travelers and locals alike, with establishments providing provide vats of water and an assortment of water guns and buckets for their use. Although many people commemorate the festival with water fights, Songkran, has a more subdued, spiritual side with devout Thais visiting temples to pour water over Buddha statues, and over the hands of the elderly, as a ritual of blessing and purification. Siriwat Dipho, the deputy commander of the police’s Technology Crime Suppression Division, told the Bangkok Post that pictures of scantily-clad party-goers were not in keeping with “good Songkran tradition.” Officers are also enforcing laws to curb traffic violations, including drink driving, which claims annually hundreds of lives during the festive period. In 2018, there were 418 traffic-related deaths during Songkran, up from 390 in 2017, according to the country’s Road Safety Center.

1117,Youkyung Lee / Bloomberg,"Kim Jong Un urged a “severe blow” to those sanctioning North Korea and called on ruling party officials to continue “self-reliance,” signaling his determination to hold the line in talks with U.S. President Donald Trump. Kim made the remarks Wednesday during a meeting with top leaders of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Thursday. He was quoted as telling officials that the country should strike at those who thought they could make it surrender with sanctions, without elaborating. The meeting comes as Trump prepares to host South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House in an effort to rescue nuclear talks that have sputtered since the U.S. leader walked out of a summit with Kim on Feb. 28. The negotiations broke down after North Korea made demands for sanctions relief that the U.S. side believed exceeded the regime’s disarmament offers. The allies want to discourage Kim from any actions that could provoke Trump and return the two sides to the familiar cycle of threats and counter-threats. North Korea is planning to celebrate the birth of its founder — Kim’s grandfather Kim Il Sung — on Monday, an occasion that the regime has sometimes marked with shows of military might. A top North Korean diplomat told reporters in Pyongyang last month that Kim would decide “in a short period of time” whether to continue his freeze on nuclear bomb and missile tests.

1118,Manal al-Sharif,"Manal al-Sharif co-founded the Women2Drive movement in Saudi Arabia in 2011, campaigning for the right of women to drive in the kingdom. In June 2018, the Saudi monarchy eventually lifted a long-term ban on women driving. Al-Sharif, 39, has lived in Sydney, Australia with her four-year-old son for the past two years, and has been unable to return to her homeland after the arrest of fellow women’s rights activists in the country last year. Her 13-year-old son still lives in the Kingdom with his grandmother; al-Sharif has not seen him for over a year. From April 10, al-Sharif is driving across the United States in partnership with Human Rights Foundation to raise awareness of ongoing human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Shortly before she embarked on this journey, al-Sharif spoke with TIME about the future of women’s rights in her home country.  Originally, I was planning to go back to Saudi Arabia when the ban on women driving was lifted. I wanted to drive coast-to-coast with my eldest son, to celebrate. If you are a Saudi and you marry a non-Saudi, you need a special permission from the government to marry. I was never granted that permission and so my son is not recognized by the Saudi government. That means they will not issue him a visa to enter the country. So my younger son lives with me in Australia and can’t go back home with me. I have two sons who have never met, who I have never held in my arms at the same time. The only way to be with one is to leave the other. I was so hopeful with the lifting of the ban. It was a huge step for us because we’ve been fighting this fight for so long. It’s part of something bigger in the guardianship system, where only a woman’s male relatives can make important life decisions for her. It acknowledges that women are independent adults, who do not rely on the permission of men. Despite my plans to return when the ban was lifted in June 2018, I couldn’t after 11 other activists were arrested. When the women were sent to jail in May 2018, it was a very clear sign from the government that these were not real reforms. Put simply: it’s a war on women. The only charges the women in jail today are facing are contacting foreign organizations. Those foreign organizations are human rights organizations. The way they have been tortured, put in solitary confinement and have been subject to a smear campaign and character assassination by the pro-government media shows how scared the authorities are of these women, and how powerful and effective they are. These women were hunted down and taken from their homes. Women living abroad were flown back to Saudi Arabia and literally kidnapped — women like Loujain al-Hathloul, a vocal advocate for women’s rights who was abducted while driving in the United Arab Emirates in March 2018. She was brought back to Saudi Arabia on a private jet, where she is still in jail. The activists were put in a secret prison, where they were tortured and sexually assaulted. This information has even been confirmed by their families. Although in late March, some of the activists were temporarily released, the brutal way these women were treated shows that this government is not supportive of women’s rights or reforms.  The government doesn’t understand that they need us. Activists are the most patriotic people, because they are fighting for a better country; they are not traitors.  What happened the last two years is a huge crackdown on activists, especially peaceful activists who used social media. Social media was the place where where we could talk, where we could discuss — it was our virtual parliament. As a citizen of Saudi Arabia, you live in one of the richest countries in the world, but you don’t own your own life, you don’t own your own decisions.  There were a lot of red flags on the outside, like with the war in Yemen and the brutal Qatar embargo, but then the war moved inside Saudi Arabia. It started as a war against people who joined terrorist groups, but it has now morphed into a war targeting activists and the social media influencers — many of whom are in jail today. There have been huge efforts from the government to propagate its agenda on social media and to influence the discourse in an unprecedented way. The Saudi regime now has a kind of power over their citizens in a way that they didn’t even dream of ten years ago. It is really painful for us to see. The same tools we use to push for social change are being used to undermine us and put our lives in danger.",We Finally Won the Right to Drive in Saudi Arabia.

1119,Kyung-eun Lee,"The place Jiyoung had an abortion was the last place on Earth she would have chosen to do it – if only she had had a choice. “Another woman had just undergone surgery before me in the same chair – it was soaked in blood,” recalls Jiyoung, who asked to use a pseudonym because of abortions being illegal and the stigma she would likely face if she went public. “I didn’t complain. I knew this was the only place I could get it done.” This harrowing scene is one that women and girls in South Korea face every day. Research by Pai Chai University estimated that up to half a million women and girls have illegal abortions each year in South Korea, while the government estimate around 50,000 were carried out in 2017. Abortion has been illegal under almost all circumstances for more than 66 years, and having an abortion is a criminal offense. This prevents accurate official data from being collected. More egregiously, the criminalization places women and girls in danger. Denied basic healthcare, they are left with no choice but to risk their physical and mental health with clandestine and unsafe abortions. But this could be about to change. On March 30, more than a thousand women braved a fierce gale and freezing conditions in Seoul to demand that the South Korean government end the country’s draconian ban on abortions. Now, women and girls across South Korea are calling on the government to swiftly reform the Criminal Act to guarantee access to safe and legal abortion services. Under current laws, women who terminate a pregnancy can face fines of up to KRW 2 million ($1,850) or one year in jail. Medical professionals who assist with abortions can face prison terms of up to two years if convicted. The only exceptions are in cases of rape, incest, specific diseases or genetic disorders, or if a woman’s or girl’s health is endangered by the pregnancy. Even in these limited instances, a woman must have the consent of her spouse to get an abortion. The criminalization of abortions in South Korea has led to discrimination and stigmatization for generations of women and girls. These laws leave women in one of Asia’s most “developed” countries being treated like second-class citizens.","For 66 Years, Women in South Korea Have Been Fined or Jailed for Having Abortions.

1120,Raisa Bruner,"When royal baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was born this spring, the new royal — child of the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, and the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry — was instantly ushered into a rarefied world of elite celebrity. And that’s just the immediate family. Thanks to Markle’s showbiz roots as an actress on Suits and a friend of many high-profile activists and stars, as well as Prince Harry’s position as one of the world’s most famous names since birth, both Archie’s mom and dad have their fair share of impressive and often well-known friends. So while we don’t yet know just who Prince Harry and Markle will choose as godparents for their first royal baby, we do know some of the options on the table, from the famous guest list at their royal wedding last spring to their closest confidantes over their year of marriage. The royals tend to select a bunch of godparents for each child; Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, children of the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, each have five or more godparents who were announced at their christening ceremonies. (They range from childhood friends of the parents to relatives to long-time professional aides.) Neither Prince Harry nor Meghan Markle are godparents to their niece and nephews, however. Harry is a godparent to about a half-dozen of the children of his closest friends, including Florence van Cutsem and Zalie Warren, while Markle is godmother to her friends’ children Remi and Ryan Litt, all of whom appeared at their wedding as bridesmaids and page boys in the British tradition. Not only did the famous tennis star help host and organize Markle’s big baby shower bash in Manhattan in February, but she also has a noted history with Markle, attending her wedding and mentioning that they have a supportive texting relationship. (“We have known each other for a long time, but we really kind of are relying on each other right a lot recently,” she said back in September.) As a mother to her own daughter Olympia and wife of Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, Williams would make for a high-profile godmother — not to mention she brings nothing less than the world’s best tennis skills to the table, in the case that little Archie chooses to try out the sport. Another set of wedding guests, the popular actor and international human rights lawyer reside in the U.K. as well and are known to socialize with the royal couple. (Amal also went to the New York baby shower.) The two are already parents of twins, leading George to joke at one point that he already has “enough s–t to deal with — literally!” when asked about godparent rumors. But if they do get the additional responsibility, the Clooneys would be sure to teach young Archie how they balance their love of the good life (see: George’s Lake Como home and successful tequila brand) with their longstanding commitments to activism in the name of global justice. We know Oprah attended Markle and Prince Harry’s royal wedding last May, and the beloved media mogul even took the time to hang out with Doria Ragland, Markle’s California-based mom, with whom she shared fruit and practiced yoga. Not only would Winfrey be an excellent source of wisdom, as we all know thanks to her longstanding status in the U.S. as everyone’s benevolent spiritual guru, but she would apparently also make for a source of fresh fruit. (Plus, she has great book recommendations.) This Canadian pair — Jessica is a stylist and TV personality, while Ben is a TV host and the son of the country’s former prime minister — are high up on the “likely” list for godparent status; Markle and Mulroney have been close for years since Markle was still an actress on Suits and Prince Harry was visiting Canada for the Invictus Games. With the Mulroneys in royal baby Archie’s life, the fashion police could stand down forever. (And they would always be welcome in Canada.) There would be a few perks to being actress Priyanka Chopra’s godchild: for one, she’s married to singer Nick Jonas, whose famous Jonas Brothers boy band has just re-launched their career with a chart-topping album. (Assuming they continue on with a long and fruitful next few decades as a group, á la the Backstreet Boys, young Archie could have some very highly sought-after backstage access to future tours.) But more importantly, Chopra has proved herself as long-time UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador who shares in Markle’s feminist beliefs. Prince Harry is already a godparent to his royal cousin Zara Tindall’s newest daughter Lena Elizabeth, so it would only make sense for him to return the favor. Tindall, the daughter of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips, is the Queen’s eldest granddaughter. She would be a trusted insider confidante for the new royal, and could help teach him or her the ropes about being part of the high-profile family. Plus, Tindall is a celebrated equestrian, even making Olympic appearances for the U.K.—and could help train up the young Sussex in the equine skills department.",Here's a List of Meghan Markle's Baby's Potential Godparents and What They Could Bring to the Table,"Updated: June 20, 2019 12:49 PM ET | Originally published: April 10, 2019"

Orlando Moore, 40, and Portia Ravenelle, 52, are believed to have died after their car crashed in the early hours of March 27 when they were on their way to the airport to fly back home to the U.S., Dominican Republic national police chief spokesman Col. Frank Félix Durán Mejia said. The couple had arrived in the Dominican Republic for a vacation on March 24 and stayed until March 27, when they were expected to be back in the U.S. The car was found at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea, and could not be recovered, according to Duran Mejia. A preliminary investigation found that several fisherman discovered a woman at the site of the crash near the Las Americas highway in the city of Santo Domingo East in grave condition without any documents. She was taken to a hospital by ambulance. After spending six days in intensive care, the woman, believed to be Ravenelle, died on April 4, authorities said. Police found the body of the man believed to be Moore on March 31 in an advanced state of decomposition, about 21 kilometers (13 miles) from where the vehicle was located.

1122,Amy Gunia,"Fewer people faced death penalty executions worldwide in 2018 than at any point in the past decade, according to a new report by advocacy group Amnesty International. Across 20 countries, at least 690 executions were known to have taken place last year, a 31% decrease from the 993 recorded in 2017, the annual report released Wednesday said. The drop is mainly due to an amendment of Iran’s drug laws, which saw executions reduced by 50%, from 507 in 2017 to 253 in 2018. Iraq, Pakistan and Somalia also carried out fewer executions. “This is a hopeful indication that it’s only a matter of time before this cruel punishment is consigned to history, where it belongs,” Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said in a statement. Even factoring in the decrease however, Iran is still one of the world’s leading executioners. According to Amnesty, more than half of the known executions were carried out in Iran and Saudi Arabia. China, where the numbers are classified but estimates suggest thousands of people are put to death each year, is believed to be the world’s top executioner. Despite the overall decline, several countries increased their use of capital punishment in 2018, including Belarus, Japan, Singapore, South Sudan and the United States. Japan and Singapore both reported their highest number of executions in a decade. In the U.S., the number grew marginally for the second consecutive year, to 25 in 2018.

1123,Amy Gunia,"Airbnb has backpedaled on its plan to delist rentals in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, announcing Tuesday that it will instead donate proceeds from such bookings to humanitarian organizations, according to Reuters. Last November, the vacations rentals giant courted controversy with a decision to remove about 200 properties in the contested territory as critics questioned the ethics of doing business in an area at the heart of the Israel-Palestine conflict. But the company’s delisting move prompted legal action and backlash from hosts and potential hosts in the U.S. and Israel. Airbnb says that it has settled all lawsuits related to the issue, and under the settlement terms, will not be moving forward with the delisting of properties. “We understand the complexity of the issue that was addressed in our previous policy announcement, and we will continue to allow listings throughout all of the West Bank,” the company said in a statement. “Airbnb will take no profits from this activity in the region,” it added, saying that money from the listings will be donated to non-profit organizations that help people across the world. Israeli and Palestinian officials did not offer an immediate reaction to the announcement, but Airbnb’s shift comes just days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to extend Israeli control over parts of the occupied West Bank if re-elected. There are approximately 600,000 Israelis living in the West Bank, but settlement activities have intensified in recent months. The U.N., which calls the settlements a “flagrant violation” of international law and “a presumptive war crime,” released a statement recently laying out fears that the increased activity is paving the way for Israeli annexation of the West Bank.

Officials said the relatively new F-35A was on a training mission with three other jets of the same model when contact was lost, according to Japan’s national broadcaster NHK. Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya said the jet, which flew from the Misawa Air Base in Aomori Prefecture, lost radar contact just before 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. The plane was around 85 miles east of the coast. Just before the crash, the pilot contacted the other jets in an attempt to cancel the mission, according to officials. Patrol aircrafts and ships were deployed to search for the missing F-35A after the disappearance. On Wednesday, search teams recovered debris from the jet, including parts of the tail, but Japanese and U.S. forces are continuing to look for the missing pilot. The F-35 was developed by the U.S. and eight other countries. According to NHK, the jet’s stealth capabilities make it particularly difficult to detect. Officials said there was no known problem with the aircraft before contact was lost, but the 12 other F-35As have been grounded at the Misawa Air Base in the wake of the crash. The incident is not the first time an F-35 has crashed. Last September, a F-35B, the Marine Corps version of the aircraft, downed near Beaufort, South Carolina, forcing the pilot to eject from the cockpit. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Defense grounded the entire fleet of F-35 jets after a fire broke out at a Florida air base. With a price tag of $90 to $115 million per aircraft, the single-seater F-35 fighter jet has been dubbed the single most expensive weapons system ever built.",A Japanese F-35 Fighter Jet Has Crashed Into the Pacific Ocean,"April 10, 2019"
1125,Madeline Roache,"A 24-year-old cyber criminal, who blackmailed computer users worldwide has been jailed for six years for his role with what U.K. investigators described as one of most sophisticated cyber crime groups they have ever investigated. An investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA), the UK’s agency to stop serious organized crime, found that Zain Qaiser, was member of an international, Russian-speaking crime group that made huge profits from victims in more than 20 countries. Qaiser, a computer science student from London, received at least $900,00 from the group for his role. The crime agency worked with its partners in the US, Canada and Europe in this “extremely long-running, complex cyber-crime investigation.” The F.B.I. and the U.S. Secret Service also arrested people in relation to the campaign. Nigel Leary, NCA Senior Investigating Officer, said: “This was one of the most sophisticated, serious and organized cyber crime groups the National Crime Agency has ever investigated.”  Under the guise of fake identities and made-up companies, Qaiser managed to buy huge amounts of advertising traffic from pornographic websites. Users who clicked on his ads became targets for the malware. They were redirected to another website, containing highly-sophisticated malware strains including the infamous Angler Exploit Kit (AEK) – thought to have been created by one of Qaiser’s Russian-speaking associates.  One type of malware used, called ‘reveton’ would lock a user’s browser. Once locked, the infected device would display a message pretending to be from law enforcement or a government agency, which claimed an offense had been committed and the victim had to pay a fine of between $300-$1,000 to unlock their device. The message hit millions of computers worldwide.  Qaiser also blackmailed users through virtual and crypto-currency money laundering. Some online ad agencies that sold Qaiser the advertising traffic realized what he was doing and tried to stop him. But Qaiser then blackmailed them, telling one company director: “I’ll first kill your server, then send child porn spam abuses.” The companies lost at least £500,000 in revenue losses and mitigation costs. The student’s work is believed to have started in September 2012 when he was 17 years-old and lasted until he was put in custody in December 2018. The NCA found that he spent the money on gambling, luxury hotels and a Rolex watch. Leary said this investigation shows that cyber-criminals can’t “operate from behind a veil of anonymity.” The NCA has the “tenacity and specialist skills to catch them and bring them to justice.”",Hacker From Russian Crime Group Jailed In Multi-Million Dollar Global Blackmail Conspiracy,"April 9, 2019"
1126,Joseph Hincks,"Dozens of people have been reported killed and scores more injured in clashes on the edge of Libya’s coastal capital Tripoli after warlord Khalifa Haftar ordered his troops to take the city from the U.N.-backed government April 4. The offensive by the military chief Haftar, who has U.S. citizenship, has pushed Libya to the brink of civil war. The Tripoli based-government announced on April 7 it was launching a counter-offensive it called Operation Volcano of Anger. On April 8, an airstrike the U.N. blamed on Haftar’s self-styled National Libyan Army (NLA) shut down Tripoli’s only functioning airport. The Health Ministry of the Tripoli-based government said at least 27 people, including civilians, have been killed since the offensive began. The media office of Hafter’s army said 22 of their troops had been killed in the same period. The U.N. has called in vain for a truce and international powers have evacuated their personnel. The escalating violence—audaciously launched during the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ visit to Tripoli—comes less than two weeks before a planned conference aimed at reconciling Libya’s numerous armed factions and paving the way for democratic elections in the country, which has been riven by political instability and violence since the 2011 killing of Muammar Gaddafi.  Here’s what to know about the conflict: Described by CNN as the “ultimate pragmatist,” the 75-year-old was an officer in the coup that brought Gaddafi to power in 1969 but fell out with the dictator in the late 1980s. He exiled himself in the U.S., where he took citizenship, but returned to Libya in time to participate in the NATO-backed civil war in 2011 that ended Gaddafi’s 42-year reign.  He rose to prominence in Libya again in 2014, when he railed against the failure of the then-mandated General National Congress (GNC) to guard against the rise of insurgent groups and began a military campaign against Islamist militias called Operation Dignity. From its stronghold in the country’s east, his LNA—which incorporates a band of loosely-aligned militias—eventually expelled Islamist militias from Libya’s second city Benghazi and its surrounds. Early this year, the LNA swept Libya’s southern oil fields, and now virtually surrounds Tripoli on the Mediterranean coast. Haftar has cast himself as a national protector and his offensive in terms of security. The LNA vowed to “cleanse” Libya of “terrorist groups” before its troops advanced on Tripoli from the south and west. But his opponents fear he is attempting to return Libya to authoritarian rule similar to Gaddafi’s or that overseen by Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, reportedly one of his principal international backers.",Libya Is on the Brink of Civil War and a U.S. Citizen Is Responsible.

1127,Billy Perrigo,"Facing potentially existential crises in the spread of targeted misinformation, hate speech and violent content on Facebook, the company’s executives have in recent days been calling for new and wide-ranging rules to govern social media companies. “I believe we need new regulation,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed published March 30 in The Washington Post. “People shouldn’t have to rely on individual companies addressing these issues by themselves.” Zuckerberg’s stance is a reversal from years past, when Facebook’s motto was “move fast and break things” — a time when social media companies used freedom of speech as a shield against calls for them to remove unsavory content, and when “disruption” was considered a mark of Silicon Valley success. Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites built their businesses on the principle that users, not websites, would be legally responsible for illegal postings. Thanks in part to such protections, for example, Facebook faced no immediate legal ramifications after a mass shooter used the site to live-stream a massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand in March. Now, that is starting to change. The Facebook CEO’s op-ed was widely interpreted as an effort to get ahead of a regulatory process that some consider inevitable in the wake of the Christchurch shooting — alongside Facebook’s other recent high-profile calamities, like Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. But what Zuckerberg and others did not expect is the speed at which lawmakers around the world are turning against social media firms. Australian officials have already moved to hold executives like Zuckerberg responsible for violent content on their sites; some in New Zealand wish to follow their lead. On Monday, the United Kingdom’s government went even further, releasing a vast and detailed proposal for new internet laws that would dramatically reshape the ways in which social media companies like Facebook operate. While the proposal remains preliminary and could be derailed by Brexit, the plan is the most drastic reimagining of internet laws to be suggested by a Western government, and could provide a template for other countries looking to police social media companies. The proposal, which was anticipated even before the Christchurch shooting, aims to tackle “online harms,” and suggests giving the U.K. government sweeping powers to fine tech companies for hosting content like violent videos, misinformation, child exploitation and more. As with Australia’s rules, social media executives like Zuckerberg could even be held personally responsible if their platforms fail to fall into line. “The era of self-regulation for online companies is over,” said U.K. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright while announcing the plans. Indeed, the sense that such firms are failing to get a grasp on their societal impact has led to a growing consensus across the world that they must be better regulated. “Disinformation is clearly harmful to democracy and society as a whole,” said Damian Collins, a U.K. lawmaker who has called on the government to regulate social media. “The social media companies must have a responsibility to act against accounts and groups that are consistently and maliciously sharing known sources of disinformation.” But some activists are criticizing the plans, saying they smack of Orwellian authoritarianism. “This is an unprecedented attack on freedom of speech that will see internet giants monitoring the communications of billions and censoring lawful speech,” said Silkie Carlo, the director of civil liberties non-profit Big Brother Watch, in a statement to TIME. Under the plans, the U.K. would set up an independent social media regulator — funded by a tax on social media companies — which would have the jurisdiction to decide the kinds of content considered permissible. Currently, social media companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have their own self-designed codes of conduct. Facebook, for example, has a detailed set of guidelines for policing hate speech on its platform, which has led to controversies — a leaked presentation for training moderators describes the difference between the statements “Keep the horny migrant teenagers away from our daughters” (allowed on Facebook) and “Muslim migrants ought to be killed” (not allowed). Social media companies have been criticized for their varied interpretations of their own rules, with users frequently complaining that such companies often fail to remove content that clearly appears to violate their terms of service.",The U.K. May Change the Rules That Turned Facebook Into an Empire.

1128,Alyssa Ayres,"Hotel Mumbai, the thriller recounting the siege of the Taj Hotel by terrorists in 2008, offers a dramatic story as well as a foreign policy lesson. The film opens with a scene of young men at sea on a rubber raft, heading to shore. A disembodied voice gives them instructions for their mission, in Punjabi, transmitted through headsets. Once on land, they begin their terror. For two hours, Hotel Mumbai — now showing nationally in the United States — conveys the shock, horror, and heartbreak of their chilling three-day massacre across Mumbai, which left more than 160 people dead. They fire indiscriminately into crowds, execute others at point-blank range, and hold innocent people hostage. Through the stories of the hotel staff who rescue guests from the attack, the film portrays the humanity of heroism. But it also delivers a message: More than a decade on, justice for this brazen attack remains denied. The terrorist group responsible has remained at large in Pakistan. At a time when Pakistan-based terrorism has once again escalated tensions between India and Pakistan, this message could not be more timely. Hotel Mumbai is not a documentary, but its narration of real-life events hews closely to documented facts. The director, Anthony Maras, drew inspiration from an Australian documentary, Surviving Mumbai, that featured interviews with survivors of the three-day onslaught that began on November 26, 2008. Maras and his team carried out additional interviews with survivors, and consulted the trial transcript of Muhammad Ajmal Kasab, the sole surviving terrorist from the attack. (Kasab stood trial in India, was convicted, and later executed, for his crimes.) Those trial documents included transcripts of satellite calls between the terrorists — the young men who reached Mumbai by raft — and their handlers, calls intercepted by the Indian government. The film’s dialogue between the terrorists and the step-by-step directives of their telephonic masters has a chilling quality as a result. For nearly the entire film, the terrorists are depicted by their first names, without any other background explanation. Only in the credits does the audience learn that the men who came by sea were members of a known terrorist organization, the Lashkar-e-Taiba. That group, founded and headquartered in Pakistan, has been active in the region — with a primary focus on India — since the 1990s. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, it was placed on the U.N. Security Council’s list of terrorist groups with linkages to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. In December 2001 the United States designated it a terrorist organization and Pakistan nominally banned the group in January 2002. In mid-2008, the United States added Hafiz Saeed, founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, to terrorism lists as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist.” The U.N. similarly added his name to sanctions lists. By 2012, the United States sought specific “information that brings [him] to justice,” and issued a “Rewards for Justice” offer of $10 million.  The sanctions and the reward offer have had no significant effect. Saeed has been in and out of house arrest over the past decade, though in recent years he has felt little pressure to play things low-key. He has appeared regularly in public, leading large rallies covered by the press, and in last summer’s national elections in Pakistan, his group attempted to register a political party. When Pakistan’s election commission rejected that effort, he then campaigned publicly for another party’s platform. Videos of his fiery public speeches are readily available online. And that’s just Saeed. Seven members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba have been under trial in Pakistan since 2009 for their roles in planning and executing the Mumbai attacks. The alleged mastermind, Zaki ur-Rehman Lakhvi, was released on bail in 2015. A news report last year suggested that he was seen collecting funds for the organization from wheat farmers. Six others remain detained with no progress in their trials. In other words, the terrorist organization responsible for the Mumbai attacks was known, and under international sanction, well before the attacks. And after the attacks, despite further sanctions, the same group has continued seemingly unfettered. After the February 14 suicide attack in Indian Kashmir perpetrated by another Pakistan-based terrorist group, the Pakistani government has again renewed its “crackdown” on designated terrorists, including reports that the Lashkar-e-Taiba is among those targeted. But if past serves as any guide, the crackdown will quietly end before too long. Hotel Mumbai brings this story — common knowledge in India, but little known in the United States — to vivid life, and makes it hard to forget the chaos and suffering the Lashkar-e-Taiba inflicted on Mumbai. In the attacks of 2008, 166 people died, including six Americans. As long as Pakistan fails to adequately tackle these terrorist groups, a horror like this could happen again. Hotel Mumbai provides a potent reminder of their danger, one that U.S. foreign policy cannot afford to forget.

1129,Hillary Leung,"Nepal is dispatching government-appointed climbers Wednesday to remeasure the height of Mount Everest, amid rumors that the peak shrunk after a massive 2015 earthquake, Agence France-Presse reports. The four climbers, commissioned by the country’s Survey Department, will scale the world’s tallest mountain following two years of preparations, including collecting readings from the ground and training for extreme conditions. Everest has an official height of 29,029 feet. The figure was recorded by an Indian survey in 1954 and remains the accepted figure, but a powerful 7.8-magnitude earthquake that rocked the country four years ago shifted the mountain southwest by more than an inch, and has created doubt that the peak still stands at that height. “We are sending a team because there were questions regarding the height of Everest after the earthquake,” the expedition’s co-ordinator, Susheel Dangol, told AFP. The department hopes the expedition, which will be the first time Nepal conducts its own survey of the mountain, puts the speculation to rest. Nepal and China have long feuded over the mountain’s height, which China asserts is about 13 feet shorter than the 1954 estimation. In 1999, an American team gave the peak another 6.6 feet, leading the U.S. National Geographic Society to list the elevation at 29,035 feet. Khim Lal Gautam, the expedition’s leader and chief surveyor, acknowledged the dangers of the coming trip. Climbers face risks of ice falls, storms and avalanches, and in 2015, authorities closed off a treacherous stretch after a deadly avalanche killed 16. Some 290 people have died on Everest in more than a century of summiting attempts, according to the Himalayan Database. “It will not be easy to work in that terrain, but we are confident our mission will be successful,” he said.",Nepalese Climbers Are Remeasuring Mount Everest Following Doubts About Its Height,"April 9, 2019"
1130,Amy Gunia,"A former top-ranking New Zealand naval official has gone on trial this week in Auckland for allegedly placing a hidden camera in the bathroom of the country’s embassy in Washington D.C. Alfred Keating, 59, a commodore in the New Zealand navy, was working as a defense attache in the U.S. when a spy-cam was discovered in a unisex bathroom in July 2017, reports the Guardian. Before he resigned, Keating was one of his country’s most senior naval officials. Keating is accused of making intimate recordings with the motion sensor camera that was found after it fell out of a radiator. A man initially found the camera on the floor, and not knowing what it was, placed it on top of the heating device before another man spotted it and handed it over to security, reports the New Zealand Herald. The camera, which reportedly was linked to Keating through DNA found on the memory card, was sent back to New Zealand for further investigation. Henry Steele, the case’s prosecutor, said that 700 deleted files and 20 existing files were found on the camera, including a video of a hand in a blue latex glove activating the device, according to the Herald. Steele also said that CCTV footage captured a man entering the bathroom around the time the camera was placed there, and that Keating’s laptop showed searches for Brickhouse Security, the camera’s manufacturer, and for instructions on how to “set up” the gadget, the Herald reports.

Given Keating’s position, he was under diplomatic immunity while stationed in the U.S., so he is being tried in his home country. The trial, which is expected to last about two weeks, comes amid an upsurge of spy-cam crimes across the globe, including the recent discovery of the activities of hundreds of hotel guests being live-streamed in South Korea, and the arrest of a tourist in Sydney for allegedly secretly filming his hostel roommate in the shower.",Former New Zealand Official on Trial Over Spy-Cam Found in D.C.

1131,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"Nine Hong Kong activists behind the pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 were convicted Tuesday on public nuisance and incitement charges, a verdict that some fear portends a creeping erosion of freedom of expression in the semi-autonomous Chinese enclave. Those found guilty include law professor Benny Tai, retired sociology professor Chan Kin-man and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming. According to court documents, Tai, Chan and Chu conspired to encourage “unlawful obstruction of public places and roads.” But the three, known as the “Occupy trio” for co-founding the non-violent Occupy Central protest that evolved into a large-scale movement immobilizing the city’s financial district for nearly three months, had pleaded not guilty to public nuisance and other charges. The other six activists were convicted of varying charges for their involvement in the 2014 campaign, which called for greater democracy and direct elections in the Chinese-controlled city.  Chan said that despite the verdict, his “soul is still.” “I still believe in the power of love and peace,” Chan told local news outlet Hong Kong Free Press. “And I have no regrets for what I have done.” Joshua Wong, the student protest leader who became the face of the movement and who was himself sentenced to six months in prison in 2017, told TIME that the verdict indicates China’s intolerance of the democratic challenge. “It shows that no matter the age, whether the activists are young or more senior leaders like the ones convicted today, the Chinese government wants to target them all,” he says.",Leaders of Hong Kong's Pro-Democracy Movement Convicted of Public Nuisance,"April 9, 2019"
1132,Joseph Hincks,"Before he became a bestselling novelist, before he embarrassed Egypt’s former prime minister on live television, before he heard military prosecutors were suing him, Dr. Alaa al Aswany was in the business of fixing teeth. When he started out, Aswany’s dental practice had afforded him the ability to write without being financially beholden to the state. As his star rose he couldn’t bring himself to drop a profession that kept him engaged with everyday Egyptians. “When you become successful, there is a risk you can get disconnected from real life,” Aswany, now 61, told TIME recently by phone from Cornell University in New York, where he was scheduled to deliver a series of lectures. “I didn’t do that. I was always with the people.”  After he wrote the The Yacoubian Building—the Arab world’s best-selling novel for five years running after its publication in 2002—Aswany pared back appointments to one or two per week. Although they became less frequent as he spent more time working overseas, the author’s Cairo clinic remains open. Aswany performed his most recent surgery there last July, he says, a porcelain bridge.  But returning to Cairo has become risky. One of Egypt’s most renowned authors, Aswany hasn’t appeared on television or written “a line” in the country since strongman President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2014, he says. He published his 2018 novel The Republic, As If—an elegy for Egypt’s 2011 revolution—in Lebanon because no local publishing house dared put it out. That did not stop Egyptian lawmakers slamming the writer for its contents last year. And this March, Aswany learned through an article in Egyptian newspaper Egypt Today that he was being sued at the military General Prosecution Office in a lawsuit that called for his trial over accusations he had insulted ‘the president, the Armed Forces, and judicial institutions.’ The lawsuit referenced a series of columns Aswany had written for Germany’s state broadcaster Deutsche Welle, including one that criticized the appointment of military generals to public office. “This is disturbing,” he says of the charge, because Egypt’s military courts have “full authority to do anything.” Censorship and the muzzling of critical press was a facet of Egyptian life under Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year authoritarian rule as well as under his successor Mohamed Morsi, but crackdowns on free expression have worsened under Sisi, media watchdogs say. Reporters Without Borders ranks Egypt 161st out of 180 countries on its press freedom index and says at least 31 journalists and media assistants are in jail there unjustly. Aswany’s case is the latest example of the Sisi regime “using all tools at its disposal to silence independent media and civil society,” Rebecca Vincent, UK Bureau Director at Reporters Without Borders (RSF) says. Those tools include a new media regulation law that imposes crippling financial burdens on independent websites and classifies blogs and social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers as media outlets, liable to be shut down by authorities. Regulators have blocked more than 500 websites since the summer of 2017 and under cybercrime laws passed last year, even visiting a banned website is punishable by a year in prison.  Literary figures and artists have also been targeted by Sisi’s regime. Only two weeks before Aswany learned of the charges against him, a military court upheld a five year-prison sentence handed down to a publisher and bookseller for “divulging military secrets” after he distributed a translation of a banned book written by an Israeli writer. Last summer a military court sentenced poet Galal El-Behairy to three years’ imprisonment for “insulting the military” and “spreading false news” in a collection of poetry called The Finest Women on Earth, according to international writers’ association PEN International. And this March, Amr Waked, an award winning Egyptian actor living in Barcelona said a military court had sentenced him to eight years in prison for “disseminating false news and insulting state institutions.” These cases are part of a broader pattern of trying civilians in military courts. Human Rights Watch says that since 2014, some 15,000 civilians have been referred to Egypt’s military courts, which along with the country’s criminal courts have issued 2,500 initial death sentences.",Egypt's Alaa al Aswany Learns the Cost of Writing Against the Regime,"April 8, 2019"
1133,Ciara Nugent,"Two years before he became mayor of London in 2016, Sadiq Khan ran the capital’s famous marathon. He’d been healthy his whole life, but while training for the race, he found he had trouble breathing. He went to the doctor, who diagnosed him with adult onset asthma. It was bad news in a city like London, he says, where air pollution has been known to trigger or worsen the disease, sending four people to hospital everyday. Though you might not think of toxic air while walking down London’s tree-lined streets on a clear spring day, the capital has breached the legal annual air pollution limit every year since 2010 — normally within the first few days of January. “Looking around, everything looks hunky dory,” Khan tells TIME in early April. “But the city I love is making people sick.” More than 2 million Londoners live in areas with illegal air pollution, with levels of nitrogen dioxide often twice or even three times higher than the safe limits set by the European Union. Recent research suggests children growing up in the inner city are developing smaller lungs as a result, while mounting evidence links air pollution to everything from heart disease to cancer to psychotic episodes in teenagers. Some 9,400 people lives are cut short every year a result of the capital’s toxic air, according to official estimates; worldwide, the figure is 6.5 million per year, according to the World Health Organization. Since his election three years ago, Khan has made London a key battleground in the global fight against air pollution. The politician, a member of the U.K.’s opposition Labour Party, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on electric buses, creating car charging points and bike lanes, and installing thousands of air pollution sensors across the city. Khan’s flagship policy, the world’s first “ultra-low emission zone” or “ULEZ” came into force on Monday. London drivers already have to pay $15 a day to enter the city center, under a congestion charge introduced in 2003 to relieve traffic. The ULEZ adds a further $16 dollars a day for older and dirtier cars. The combined $31 daily charge has upset some; taxi drivers have protested and some trade unions have labeled it “a tax on the poor” who can’t afford to buy cleaner vehicles. But Khan says the problem is too urgent to ignore. He sees himself as the heir to the 20th Century British politicians who took bold steps to pass the U.K.’s 1956 Clean Air Act after London suffered frequent deadly smog clouds dubbed “Pea Soupers.” “They were told they couldn’t do drastic things like move factories out of town,” Khan says. “But they were brave. And we’ve been reaping the benefits for decades.” Air quality is a perfect example, Khan argues, of how cities can use their autonomy to make big changes faster than national governments. That’s particularly true at a time when the U.K. parliament has been preoccupied with negotiating Britain’s upcoming departure from the E.U., known as Brexit. “The rest of the country has been paralyzed, but we can be more nimble,” he says. He regularly trades solutions to urban problems with other city mayors, he says, including Anne Hidalgo in Paris, Eric Garcetti in Los Angeles, and Bill De Blasio in New York; De Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo are introducing the U.S.’ first congestion zone in Manhattan. “I’m a big believer in [stealing] other people’s ideas,” Khan says.  London’s current air pollution problem took root a few decades after The Clean Air Act. In the 1990s, European governments fell in love with diesel, encouraging drivers to buy diesel cars with tax breaks and buying huge fleets of diesel buses. “It was well intentioned, but pretty stupid,” says Simon Birkett, founder of campaign group Clean Air London. “They thought if more people used diesel engines, which burn fuel more efficiently, we’d produce less carbon dioxide.” But authorities didn’t anticipate how difficult it would be to get rid of the nitrogen oxides that diesel gives off. Meanwhile, weak regulations allowed automakers to produce cars that emit more pollutants than expected. The popularity of diesel cars — which still make up 40% of cars on U.K. roads  compared to just 4% in the U.S. according to figures from 2014 — is the main reason Europe’s air quality is far lower than that of the U.S. In London, the legacy of diesel is exacerbated, Birkett says, by the fact that, in contrast to the planned grid systems of American cities, many streets and pathways were established in medieval times and have snaked and twisted over hundreds of years into a “dreadfully, narrow, chaotic road lay-out.” That increases bottle-necks and means vehicles are often left at a standstill, pumping the exhaust into pedestrians’ lungs. The use of gas cookers and illegal wood stoves by the public also make the problem worse.  Khan says the cumulative effect has caused “a public health emergency” – but it’s one that’s hard to see. “If people that died from air pollution were covered in green spots, it would be very easy for everyone to understand,” says Gary Fuller, a scientist at King’s College London’s Air Quality Network, which monitors pollution around the city, and the author of a book on the threat of air pollution titled The Invisible Killer. “But when people’s lives are shortened, by air pollution, they die of the things that people die of anyway: respiratory diseases, heart disease, strokes.” One of the most visible deaths linked to air pollution was that of nine year-old Ella Kissi-Debra in 2013. Ella had been active and healthy, her mother, Rosamund says. She played soccer and talked constantly about wanting to be a pilot. But she developed severe asthma just before her seventh birthday and died two years later. The family had lived meters from the notoriously polluted South Circular road in Southeast London and, after Ella’s death, Rosamund began to suspect pollution could have contributed to her health issues. “My daughter looked as if she’d been smoking. She was only nine,” she says.",'The City I Love Is Making People Sick.' London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Making Polluters Pay,"April 8, 2019"
1134,Amy Gunia,"Moon Jae-in plans to ask the U.S. to ease sanctions on North Korea when he meets President Donald Trump at the White House this week, say unnamed South Korean officials cited by The Korea Times. The South Korean president is visiting Washington D.C. for a summit on North Korean nuclear diplomacy, where the two leaders are expected to discuss how to achieve the denuclearization of the north and peace on the Korean Peninsula. “Moon plans to embrace the risk of personal diplomacy by asking Trump to grant reciprocal measures after Seoul and Washington laid out the necessary groundwork via working-level discussions,” a South Korean official told the Korea Times. Although it remains to be seen which sanctions Moon might ask the U.S. to revoke first, officials said he is likely to focus on those that impact the country’s citizens. “It’s likely President Moon may raise the lessening of sanctions that affect the lives of the North Korean people,” an official said, according to the Korea Times. Moon, who made TIME’s shortlist for person of the year in 2018, has played an active role in peace talks with Seoul’s northern neighbor.

The family then contacted park rangers, who organized a search party. The rangers failed to find the body on the first day of the search. But following the arrest of four alleged accomplices on April 3, the rangers resumed their efforts with additional information provided to them by the suspected poachers.

President Paul Kagame pardoned 367 people “convicted for the offenses of abortion, complicity in abortion and infanticide,” the Prime Minister’s cabinet announced on Thursday. Women’s access to abortion has long been restricted in Rwanda. Abortion in cases of rape, incest, forced marriage or the health of the woman or fetus has only been legal since 2012, although a court and two doctors are needed to sign off on the procedure. The Rwandan government revised its legal code in fall 2018 to remove the requirement for a court and additional doctor’s permission, according to The East African, though the new provision has not yet been put into force by a ministerial order. Advocates for women’s rights welcomed the pardons. The group SPECTRA: Young Feminists Activism, which advocates for women’s rights in Rwanda, tweeted, “We happily welcome the Presidential pardon of the 367 women & girls who were in prison for abortion or related charges.

1139,Suyin Haynes,"When Gadi Habumugisha was 2 years old, he was forced to flee his home in Rwanda with his older sister. It was April 1994, and violence was escalating after the death of the president, as ethnic tensions erupted. Crossing the border to seek safety in refugee camps in the neighboring Congo, the pair were eventually orphaned by the killings.  April 7 marks 25 years since the Rwandan genocide. Over the course of 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people were killed — most of them members of the minority Tutsi ethnic group killed by the majority Hutu population. Gadi and his sister’s new lives in Rwanda began at the end of 1994 after the genocide ended, when they returned with the Red Cross to their homeland and came to the Imbabazi Orphanage in the country’s north. Run by Rosamond Carr, an American humanitarian who had lived in Rwanda since 1949, the orphanage was a sanctuary for children who had lost their families as a result of that traumatic summer. For Gadi, and two other boys, Mussa Uwitonze and Bizimana Jean, the orphanage also became the place where, years later, they first picked up cameras at a photography workshop run by Through the Eyes of Children, an organization founded in 2000 by photographer American David Jiranek. All three boys seized the chance to tell their own stories by taking pictures. It marked the beginning of a lifelong passion for photography. Now all in their late twenties, the three men are spreading that passion to other vulnerable children, taking on the leadership of Through the Eyes of Children by teaching photography workshops in Rwanda and around the world. Working initially with 19 “camera kids,” the photography workshops for vulnerable children in Rwanda started in 2000, teaching them the basics of lighting, composition and stop-motion among other photography techniques. The photographs made by workshop participants have been exhibited at the U.S. Embassy in Rwanda’s capital Kigali, the United Nations headquarters in New York and at Holocaust museums around the world. “When you give a child a chance to tell their story from their perspective, it tells them they matter, and that their story matters,” says Joanne McKinney, project director at Through the Eyes of Children.  Documenting scenes of everyday life in the country, the extraordinarily large collection of photographs track the healing and rebuilding of Rwanda in the years after the genocide. “For us orphans, we were able to express ourselves and the world could see our photos, our country and the children of it,” says Mussa Uwitonze, now 28 years old and the father of two girls. The photographs from the workshops did more than show life in Rwanda to international audiences. Proceeds from sales of the images to buyers around the world fed back into Imbabazi, paying for the children’s clothing, food and education. Many of the original Camera Kids have gone on to pursue careers in photography for media, events and non-profit organizations in Rwanda.  Almost 20 years on from their first workshop, and 25 years on from the genocide, Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana are embarking on their own journey, telling their story through different means. They are both the subjects and storytellers of a forthcoming documentary, entitled Camera Kids, in partnership with American filmmaker Beth Murphy, Director of Films for the Groundtruth Project, an international non-profit media organization supporting storytelling and freedom of expression in the United States and developing countries around the world. The three men have all worked as professional photographers and now lead the Through the Eyes of Children photography workshops. But a few years ago, they realized they were still troubled by lingering questions about their past. “We all had so many questions since our time at the orphanage,” says Mussa. “Who are these people who participated in the genocide? What were they thinking when they were killing people? We decided that it was our time, as photographers and storytellers, to find out the answers from the real people who participated in the genocide.”","They Were Orphaned by the Rwandan Genocide. 25 Years Later, They’re Interviewing the Perpetrators","April 6, 2019"
1140,Ian Bremmer,"What Happened This Week: Following Russia’s recent decision to send 100 or so “advisors” (read: soldiers) alongside military equipment to prop up the Maduro regime in Venezuela, White House officials have repeatedly warned Moscow to stop interfering in Venezuela’s ongoing political crisis. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo kept up the drumbeat this week, declaring in a speech that “the Russians have got to leave Venezuela.” The last time anyone checked, they were still there. Why It Matters: This is not the first time Moscow has sent a contingent of “advisors” abroad—back in 2015, Moscow dispatched a group of personnel to prop up Bashar Assad in Syria. That decision meant that any resolution to the Syria conflict would ultimately run through Moscow. And it did. Washington has no desire to see the same thing happen in Venezuela. The worry is that as Washington and Moscow pursue their respective geopolitical aims in Venezuela, bombastic rhetoric could tip into actual violence. For Washington, Venezuela is currently the only issue where it’s leading a global response to a pressing international issue… and other countries are actually following its lead. Its support of interim president and head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly Juan Guaido was quick and decisive, opening the door for more than 50 countries to support Venezuela’s parallel government. (It also helps that Guaido is the first legitimate alternative to Maduro that Venezuela’s fractured opposition has been willing to rally around.) Aside from the points scored for leading the international charge, Venezuela has important domestic implications for US politics as well—the largest number of Venezuelans living in the US reside in the swing state of Florida, and Venezuela is a proxy issue for Cuban-American voters as well. More broadly, Venezuela has been repeatedly held up by Trump as proof of the failures of socialism, a political ideology he frequently tags his Democratic opponents with. And while the Mueller investigation is complete and Trump has claimed exoneration, any story that involves Russia remains a politically sensitive topic for his administration. Finally, Venezuela still has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, so what happens in the country’s politics has a real impact on global energy markets, yet one more thing keeping the US closely engaged. For Russia, its continued presence in Venezuela falls broadly along two lines, the economic and the geopolitical. On the economic front, Russia has spent decades investing in Venezuela and Venezuelan oil—Venezuela’s economic desperation allowed Russian oil giant Rosneft to snap up prime assets (like half of Citgo) on the cheap. But now oil prices have dropped dramatically, Maduro is proving to be a political liability, and a significant amount of Russia’s oil revenues are dependent on Venezuela’s shoddy oil infrastructure. Yet Russia can’t just cut its losses and move on—Moscow is owed more than $6 billion from Caracas; state-champion Rosneft is owed $3 billion or so. Russia needs to make sure it gets that money, whether from Maduro or whoever follows him. On the geopolitical front, Putin has spent the better part of two decades cultivating a relationship with Venezuela’s leadership in order to ensure good relations with a geopolitically significant country (both in terms of energy production and in proximity to the US). The current political crisis is also an opportunity for Russia to show its ability to project force on the other side of the globe—the mark of a true global power—as well as to demonstrate to other embattled global leaders that Russia takes its long-standing alliances seriously.

1141,Andrew Mayeda / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Senior U.S. Treasury official David Malpass was appointed president of the World Bank Group, placing a loyalist of President Donald Trump at the helm of the development lender. Malpass was unanimously selected to serve a five-year term from April 9, the World Bank’s executive board said in a statement on Friday. Trump nominated Malpass in February, choosing a loyal supporter who had been sharply critical of China and called for a shakeup of the global economic order. Critics including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz questioned the selection, pointing to Malpass’s doubts about international cooperation. But no other countries proposed any candidates to challenge Malpass, making his selection by the board all but assured. Before his nomination, Malpass portrayed the World Bank as too big, inefficient and reluctant to cut funding for developing countries that grow into dynamic emerging markets. He pushed the bank to lend less to China, arguing the world’s second-biggest economy has the financial resources to support itself. Since being nominated, Malpass has adopted a gentler tone, noting he was America’s lead negotiator on a package of reforms under which the bank will receive a $13 billion capital increase. Under the plan, the bank will focus more lending on lower-income countries. Malpass succeeds Jim Yong Kim, who stepped down Feb. 1 to join an investment firm. Kristalina Georgieva, chief executive officer of the bank, has been acting as the interim president. The position of World Bank president has historically gone to an American, while a European has led its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund.

The woman was identified by Reuters as Kimberley Sue Endecott, 35. Los Angeles TV stations quoted friends and neighbors, who identified her as Kimberly Sue Endicott, from Costa Mesa, Calif. The Uganda Police Force said she was on a sightseeing tour around Uganda’s Queen Elizabeth National Park on Tuesday evening, along with a senior guide and an elderly tourist couple when they were ambushed by four gun-wielding men. Police said she and the guide, identified as Jean-Paul Mirenge Remezo, were taken. The two others raised the alarm. The Queen Elizabeth National Park is generally regarded as a safe tourist destination. It’s the most-visited national park in Uganda, with safaris offering the opportunity to see tree-climbing lions, herds of buffalo, elephants and hippos. But the park also shares a porous, forested border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, where rebel groups are known to be active. Kidnappings of tourists are rare in Uganda, says Indigo Ellis, lead Congo analyst at global risk consultancy, Verisk Maplecroft. “But they’re becoming more popular.” Here’s what to know. The speed at which the $500,000 ransom was demanded – using the American victim’s cell phone, according to police – indicates that the crime has an economic motive, says Ellis. “Kidnappings are becoming more and more popular as a way of eking out as much financial gain as possible from the tourism sector,” she says. The trend is driven by poverty in the region. In North Kivu, the province of Congo bordering the Queen Elizabeth National Park, GDP per capita has barely risen since the 1980s.",An American Tourist Has Been Kidnapped and Held for Ransom in Uganda.

1143,Iain Marlow / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — India’s statement that its air force shot down one of Pakistan’s U.S.-built F-16 aircraft during a military flareup in late February appears untrue, according to a report by Washington, D.C.-based Foreign Policy magazine, which cited two U.S. defense officials it didn’t identify. A U.S. count of Pakistan’s F-16 jets revealed none to be missing, the U.S. officials told Foreign Policy, undercutting India’s position that its air force shot down a Pakistan Air Force jet in a clash that also led to the loss of a Soviet-era Indian Air Force MiG-21 Bison. The aerial clash over Kashmir followed an Indian air strike on what New Delhi said was a terrorist training facility inside Pakistani territory. Islamabad has said consistently that it did not lose an F-16, that it had deployed JF-17 jets jointly built with China against India and that it had destroyed two Indian aircraft, as opposed to the one downed jet India has confirmed. “No Pakistani F16 was hit by Indian airforce,” a statement from Pakistan’s military released Monday reads. “Truth always prevails,” Pakistan’s army spokesman Asif Ghafoor said in a tweet on Friday. “Time for India to speak truth about false claims and actual losses on their side.” Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar did not immediately respond to a phone call and text messages for comment on Friday. In a previous statement in early March, Kumar had said “there are eye-witness accounts and electronic evidence that Pakistan deployed F-16 aircraft and that one F-16 was shot down” by an Indian pilot.

1144,Amy Gunia,"S.’s sexuality was a closely guarded secret even before Brunei this week enacted the final phase of its draconian new penal code, which includes death by stoning for people found guilty of gay sex or adultery. Homosexuality has long been outlawed in the tiny, Muslim-majority Southeast Asian nation. But with the enhanced penalties, the question for S. is no longer whether his government will crack down, but when. “Sooner or later they will enforce the law, either it’s now or slowly creeping,” S. says. TIME is not printing his full name out of concern for his safety. In Brunei, an oil-rich fiefdom ruled since 1967 by multi-billionaire Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, a small LGBTQ community persists underground. Despite the legal risks, discrimination and stigma, some people, like S., used to venture onto to dating apps like Asia Free Chat and Grindr. But since the new Shariah-inspired penal code went into effect Wednesday, S. says he and others he knows have quit online dating altogether and face a deepening climate of fear. “I felt like even chat rooms are filled with… hidden people and I’m scared they might just take me away once I get caught by them,” he says. He worries that if he were to meet someone for a date after chatting online, he could wind up face-to-face with “a government spy,” instead. In addition to penalizing gay sex with death by stoning, Brunei now prescribes the punishment for extramarital sex, abortion and blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed. Lesbian sex, which was previously punishable with imprisonment and a fine, can now prompt 40 lashes. These harsh new laws encountered swift, global backlash. The United Nations has condemned the punishments, as have foreign governments and LGBT activists in the region. Western celebrities, including George Clooney, Ellen DeGeneres and Elton John, called for a boycott of the luxury hotels owned by Brunei’s well heeled leader – including the Beverley Hills Hotel.","This Is What It's Like to Be Gay in Brunei, Where Homosexuality Is Now Punishable by Being Stoned to Death","April 5, 2019"

Ecuador’s government did not respond to calls made after office hours. WikiLeaks cited the unidentified person as saying the planned expulsion is a response to the organization’s recent tweet linking to a website that alleged money laundering and corruption during Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno’s time as United Nations special envoy for the disabled in Geneva. Foreign Minister Jose Valencia said last month that the government was “very surprised” by that and other actions by Assange and his lawyers. The website in question also linked to emails and phone screen captures tying Moreno to the corruption scandal. Moreno, speaking in a nationwide broadcast Feb. 27, denied any wrongdoing. Ecuador last year introduced rules governing Assange’s life in its London embassy.

1146,Peter Blumberg / Bloomberg,"Boeing Co., Ethiopian Airlines and aircraft-part maker Rosemount Aerospace Inc. were sued in the U.S. over a plane crash last month that killed 157 people and intensified concern about the safety of 737 Max passenger jets. The suit filed Thursday in Chicago federal court on behalf of an American citizen who was on the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight March 10 joins a growing pile of complaints against Boeing, as well as a criminal investigation, following two crashes of 737 Max planes in five months that have killed 346 people. The family of Samya Stumo alleged that Boeing, Ethiopian Air and Rosemount Aerospace were negligent by allowing a faulty flight-control system for its 737 Max 8 aircraft. The suit also cites a similar malfunction in the Lion Air flight of a 737 Max 8 jet that crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 that killed 189. Earlier on Thursday, the Ethiopian transport minister called on Boeing to review the 737 Max flight-control system before allowing planes to be used, after a preliminary government report showing the doomed jetliner couldn’t recover from an uncommanded and persistent nose dive shortly after takeoff. Samya Stumo, 24, was the niece of consumer activist Ralph Nader, who became famous in the 1960s for skewering the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the regulator’s shortcomings in policing serious safety problems in the auto industry. Boeing, the leading U.S. aerospace manufacturer, and its principal regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, have come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks over claims their relationship is too cozy. The FAA is responsible for regulating aviation in the U.S. and operating the nation’s air traffic control system. The chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee said this week that whistleblowers have come forward to report that FAA safety inspectors, including those involved with approvals for the 737 Max, lacked proper training and certifications. Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said those claims prompted him to investigate potential connections between training and certification shortcomings and the FAA’s evaluation of the airliner. The Senate panel’s probe is the latest in a string of investigations by U.S. officials and lawmakers into how the FAA cleared the 737 Max as safe to fly. The Transportation Department’s inspector general is reviewing the FAA’s process for approving the airworthiness of new jets and aiding a Justice Department criminal probe.",Family of American Killed in Ethiopian Air Crash Sue Boeing Over Flight Control System,"April 4, 2019"
1147,"Todd Shields, Nizar Manek and Alan Levin / Bloomberg","Pilots commanding a doomed Ethiopian Airlines jet were hit with a cascade of malfunctions and alarms seconds after the Boeing Co. 737 Max took off from Addis Ababa on March 10, according to a preliminary report released Thursday. Most critically, the plane’s automatic anti-stall system that was also linked to a previous 737 Max crash months earlier began pushing the nose of the jetliner down less than two minutes into the flight due to a malfunctioning sensor. The crew was able to climb as high as 13,400 feet and request permission to return to the airport after temporarily disabling part of the system. But the pilots struggled to control the plane, which entered a steep dive reaching speeds of 575 miles per hour before crashing into a field, killing all 157 people on board. Boeing should review the flight-control system to ensure the plane’s safety, Ethiopian Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges said at a news conference in the capital of Addis Ababa on Thursday to announce the report. Aviation authorities should verify the issues have been adequately addressed “before the release of the aircraft to operations.” The comments underscored the need for a software update that Boeing already has under way for the anti-stall system that can push down the plane’s nose. That so-called MCAS feature had been suspected in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 about six minutes after takeoff on March 10. The disaster came less than five months after a 737 Max operated by Lion Air plane plunged into the Java Sea and killed 189 people after MCAS was activated. The model is now grounded worldwide as investigators probe its airworthiness and how it gained permission to fly. Dagmawit said the pilots followed proper procedures issued by Boeing and U.S. aviation authorities after the Lion Air crash, though details in the report raised questions about whether they followed all the steps. Boeing blamed the accident on “a chain of events” and acknowledged its responsibility in at least one of those chain links. “As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment,” Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. “It’s our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it.”","Boeing 737 MAX Crashed After System Forced Its Nose Down 'Uncommanded,' Ethiopia Says","Updated: April 4, 2019 10:43 AM ET"
1148,Madeline Roache,"When the U.S., Canada and 10 western European nations came together in 1949 to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, they had a clear goal. “Keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down,” said Lord Hastings Lionel Ismay, NATO’s first Secretary General. The military alliance was intended to rebuild Europe from the rubble of World War II and to act as a buffer against Soviet aggression.  But the collapse of the Soviet Union made NATO’s purpose less clear. In fact, in 1990, as the Cold War drew to a close, President Mikhail Gorbachev proposed the Soviet Union join NATO. At the time, Gorbachev was negotiating German reunification with the then U.S. Secretary of State James Baker. “You say that NATO is not directed against us,” he said, referring to the rival Warsaw Pact, an alliance between the Soviet Union and Communist countries in Eastern Europe, “that it is simply a security structure that is adapting to new realities. Therefore, we propose to join NATO.”  Baker reportedly dismissed the proposal as a “dream” but it has been floated several times since. Giving Russia membership would have required NATO, which turned 70 on Thursday, to fundamentally redefine itself. Nevertheless, in the three decades since the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO has had to find a new raison d’être. As NATO foreign ministers met in Washington to mark the anniversary, they faced questions about its future. Here’s what to know about the relationship between Russia and NATO. In 1991 Boris Yeltsin, the first president of the new Russian state, wrote to NATO, reiterating Gorbachev’s proposal. He echoed calls made by former Warsaw Pact countries like Hungary to join the Western alliance, and called NATO membership a “long-term political aim” of Russia.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union though, NATO began to redefine its purpose. Vesko Garcevic, a former Montenegro ambassador to NATO, says the new mission became to ensure the democratization of newly post-communist republics, which the alliance considered crucial to guaranteeing a stable Europe. After joining NATO, most of the countries then became E.U. members. “It was no longer not just about security. It was also political. That’s why the alliance has survived for so many years,” he says.  In 1994, Russia officially signed up to the NATO Partnership for Peace, a program aimed at building trust between NATO and other European and former Soviet countries. President Bill Clinton described it in January 1994 as a “track that will lead to NATO membership.”  Russian President Vladimir Putin told filmmaker Oliver Stone in a 2017 interview that he discussed the option with Clinton during the American president’s visit to Moscow in 2000. And when then-Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen met with Putin in the early 2000s, he says he got the impression Russia was pro-Western and open to joining the transatlantic alliance.",Breaking Down the Complicated Relationship Between Russia and NATO,"April 4, 2019"
1149,Simon Shuster,"Even in the worst of times, Russia had been a reliable friend to the Sudan of Omar al-Bashir. It continued selling him weapons during the atrocities his regime carried out in the Darfur region from 2003 to 2007. And when the International Criminal Court indicted al-Bashir in 2009 for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, issuing a warrant for his arrest, Russia went its own way. Instead of detaining al-Bashir when the Sudanese leader landed in Sochi in 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin received him at his official residence and put the meeting on state television. As it turned out, Russia’s enduring friendship was about to pay off. The outlaw President had arrived with an offer: “Sudan,” he told Putin, “can be Russia’s key to Africa.” What he wanted in return was “protection from aggressive U.S. actions” in the region, said al-Bashir. The evidence shows Putin took him up on it. The leaders’ talks opened the gates to a flood of Russian ventures in Sudan, from political consulting to mining and military aid, according to documents obtained by TIME. As Russian geologists began drilling for gold near the banks of the Nile River last year, the Russian armed forces drafted plans to use Sudan’s ports and air bases as military outposts. Sudan is just the start. Over the past few years, the Kremlin has once again been scouring the world in search of influence. In troubled countries overlooked since the Cold War, Russia has been forging new alliances, rekindling old ones and, wherever possible, filling the void left by an inward-looking West. Across Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, TIME tracked the Kremlin effort through months of interviews with local officials, Russian operatives and other players, as well as by vetting documents provided by the Dossier Center, a private investigative unit funded by Mikhail Khodorvsky, an exiled Russian businessman and critic of Putin. The Russian campaign reaches from major conflict zones such as Venezuela, Libya and Syria to the more obscure corners of Africa and, as al-Bashir hoped, to Sudan. What comes through is a newfound Russian willingness, even an eagerness, to involve itself in wars and cultivate regimes anywhere Moscow sees a chance to assert itself. But unlike the Cold War, when the communist East competed with the capitalist West as equals, the new contest is being waged in an altered world. Trump’s America no longer projects interest in foreign affairs, democratic ideals or even alliances. And China, with an economy eight times the size of Russia’s, has replaced it as the major alternative to the West. Yet Putin has managed to keep Russia in the global picture–punching far above its weight through a combination of opportunism, bluster and common cause with isolated despots to whom Moscow offers weapons, protection and respect. “We are not out to rule the world or impose some ideology on other countries, be it communism or capitalism,” says Senator Andrei Klimov, a fixture in Moscow’s foreign policy circles. “We are merely out to defend our interests. And we will do that wherever they arise.” That became clear as recently as March 23, when two planeloads of Russian troops and military cargo landed in Venezuela to shore up the embattled dictator Nicolás Maduro. The deployment was meant as a challenge to the U.S., which recognizes the legitimacy of Maduro’s rival Juan Guaidó. It got Trump’s attention. “Russia has to get out,” he told reporters in the Oval Office four days later, adding that “all options are open” for ensuring a Russian withdrawal. But Maduro has survived U.S. sanctions thanks in part to Russian cash and political cover. In Syria, Russia rescued the dictatorship of Bashar Assad with a military campaign that forced the U.S. to abandon its hopes of ousting him–while boosting Assad’s only other friend in the world, Iran. And in the complex war for control of Libya, various factions have sought the Kremlin’s support, often in exchange for access to oil fields and other resources that the U.S. also covets.",How Putin Built a Ragtag Empire of Tyrants and Failing States,"April 4, 2019"
1150,Ian Bremmer,"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the strongman of Turkish politics and a former mayor of Istanbul, has lost Istanbul. In the March 31 municipal elections, he and his party also lost Ankara, the country’s capital, and several other sizable cities. Erdogan was rebuked thanks to a sharp economic slowdown brought on by mismanagement. His party, which has won every national election in Turkey since 2002, now faces a less certain future, and he may be forced to turn to the hated International Monetary Fund for assistance. It’s not that Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) has collapsed. In fact, its overall vote share in cities across the country suffered only a marginal decline. With its ultranationalist ally, the MHP, the AKP still won more than 51% of the vote nationwide, a fall of just 2% from its performance in last June’s elections. Erdogan remains in command of the strong presidential system he created via referendum in 2017. But the opposition CHP now controls cities responsible for more than 60% of Turkey’s gross domestic product, and Erdogan’s losses are made more embarrassing by the built-in advantages he has and by the way he campaigned. First, Turkey’s media is controlled almost entirely by the government, which for the past three years has jailed more journalists than any other country. Despite Erdogan’s power to shape the news the public consumes, half the voting population opposes the President and his party. Second, Erdogan did his best to frame this election as a fight for Turkey’s survival against an opposition alliance he claims is controlled by subversives, foreigners and terrorists. He promoted conspiracy theories that Americans and Europeans have sabotaged Turkey’s economy. He stoked controversy on the campaign trail by repeatedly showing video footage of the Christchurch, New Zealand, terrorist attack in which 50 Muslims were murdered inside two mosques. When the governments of Australia and New Zealand protested, Erdogan railed against the fact that troops from those nations were sent to fight the Ottoman Empire during World War I. He has continued to antagonize the U.S., in part because he accuses Washington of harboring Fethullah Gulen, a political rival who Erdogan claims has repeatedly conspired to bring down his government. Donald Trump, like Barack Obama, has refused to extradite Gulen to Turkey from his home in Pennsylvania for lack of evidence that Gulen has done anything more than oppose Erdogan’s government. Erdogan’s accomplishments are real. He presided over a period of sharp economic growth in the first decade of this century, in part by empowering politicians and business leaders in the country’s heartland to challenge the stranglehold that the major cities–Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir–held over political and economic life. He also beat back threats from the military, which has a long history of undermining elected governments to protect its political and commercial privileges. The July 2016 coup that nearly brought down his government gave Erdogan a powerful argument that his conspiracy theories were not just fantasies. In recent years his bid to accumulate more power and to repress dissent has brought comparisons to Vladimir Putin. Voters in Turkey have again reminded their government, and the world, that Turkey is not Russia. For now, competitive multiparty democracy will continue in their country whether President Erdogan likes it or not.

1151,Billy Perrigo,"India’s 2019 general-election campaign kicks off on April 11 with the world’s largest exercise in democracy: more than 900 million eligible voters, 1 million polling stations and seven phases spread across five weeks. The drama culminates on May 23, when Indians find out if they’re in for another five years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or whether the opposition Congress Party, which ruled India for decades after independence, has staged a comeback. Modi came to power in 2014 promising to supercharge India’s economy. But he has struggled with surging unemployment and implemented unpopular measures that hurt small businesses. The BJP was accused in January of suppressing a report showing joblessness at a 45-year high. Lately, Modi has pivoted to a national-security platform, capitalizing on tensions with Pakistan over a suicide attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. Amid tit-for-tat airstrikes, Modi’s approach appealed to desires for national pride and strength. Modi’s first term also made ideology a consequential battleground: Should India be a secular country, as enshrined in its 1950 constitution, or a Hindu nation, as the BJP believes? In the past few years, nationalist sentiment has fueled a rise in divisive political language as well as violence directed at Muslims, who make up 14% of India’s population. While Congress and an alliance of secularist regional parties hope to reverse those trends, most polls still point to a BJP victory. More than any before, this election will play out online, with an estimated 39% of Indians owning smartphones. But as 4G coverage has swept India in the years since Modi’s rise, it’s also brought dangers. On April 1, Facebook said it had removed 702 pages, groups and accounts over “coordinated inauthentic behavior” in support of the BJP and Congress, and TIME has found that BJP supporters used WhatsApp chats to spread fake news.

Songkran, Thailand’s new year, is celebrated from Apr. 13 to 15 with what is known as the world’s biggest water fight. Traditionally, revelers splash water over each other to confer blessings and symbolize a fresh start, the custom being a welcome respite from the heat during the hottest month of the year. In the tourist mecca of Khaosan Road, businesses normally provide vats of water and an assortment of water guns and receptacles for the annual celebrations, but with the coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn set for next month, the world-famous party has been called off. “We are located right in the middle of areas involved, so if we organize the usual Songkran festival, it could be chaotic,” Piyabutr Jiwaramonaikun, chairman of the Khaosan Road Business Association, told Reuters. In preparation for the coronation, authorities have been busy hurrying refurbishments near and along Khaosan Road, including repainting buildings and rebuilding pavements. “There will be fewer people this year for Songkran, but the coronation is a major event for the Thai people and we all must make sacrifices,” Piyabutr said. King Maha Vajiralongkorn was set to become Thailand’s new monarch following the death of his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016.

A poll in the Asahi newspaper, cited by the Guardian, found that 45% of respondents “felt unhappy” about the long vacation, compared to 35% who said they “felt happy.” Last year, Japanese lawmakers approved a bill to designate April 30, May 1 and May 2 as national holidays to mark the accession of Crown Prince Naruhito. Since April 29, Showa Day, is already a public holiday, and May 3 to 6 is the country’s traditional “Golden Week” holiday period—spanning Constitution memorial Day, the so-called Citizen’s Holiday and Children’s Day—the new holidays mean that Japan’s workers are in for a 10-day break, inclusive of a weekend. But the extended vacation time has many in the financial sector worried about possible market disruption and the increased volatility of stocks and currency that may result. One trader told Reuters that it was “horrifying” that companies will not be able to trade for six business days. Meanwhile, contract workers, who are paid by the hour or day, say they fear the resultant loss in income. Parents are also anxious that they won’t be able to keep their children occupied, with day-care centers and nurseries shut during the break. It isn’t all doom and gloom, however. The Guardian reports that amid these concerns, the travel industry is seeing a significant increase in bookings for overseas trips, signaling that some Japanese, at least, are keen to take advantage of the holiday.

Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, is said to have been born in the county, which is near Mount Paektu, the highest point on the Korean Peninsula. The younger dictator visited the area before major developments in recent years, leading some to wonder if a major development may be coming.

1155,Hillary Leung,"Japan’s Foreign Ministry says that Reiwa, the name of the country’s new imperial era, means “beautiful harmony” and not “command” or “order” as many have suggested. “We felt the need to let the world know that nobody (in the government) thinks like that,” Hiroatsu Satake, a foreign ministry official, told the Japan Times after a controversy broke out over the name announced earlier this week. Social media users were quick to point out that while the second character could be translated as “peace,” the first, rei, had the opposite connotation, suggesting strict command or control. Militarism is a sensitive topic in Japan, which passed reforms in 2015 to expand the role of its defense forces despite vehement protests inside and outside the legislature. “If you look up [rei] in dictionaries, I believe a meaning like this does show up, but it has multiple other meanings too,” Satake told the Times, referring to the lesser known interpretation of rei as “good” or “beautiful.” The names of imperial eras, called gengo, are widely used in Japan and feature on currency and official documents. The country’s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said earlier that the name Reiwa was inspired by the 7th century poetry collection Manyoshu, where rei appears in the word reigetsu—an auspicious month—in a poem that describes an early spring breeze.

1156,Abhishyant Kidangoor,"In a recently released trailer for PM Narendra Modi, a biopic of the Indian prime minister, actor Vivek Oberoi, playing the Indian leader, stares angrily into the camera and declares: “I am warning Pakistan: if you dare raise your hand against us again, we will chop it off.”  That would be inflammatory at the best of times, but this comes just weeks after tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors escalated to alarming levels, following a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir on Feb. 14 that killed 40 Indian military personnel. It was purportedly carried out by the same Pakistan-based terrorist outfit responsible for a 2016 attack on an Indian Army brigade that killed 17.  The 2016 attack (and a subsequent retaliatory operation by India) was the subject of its own Bollywood release on Jan. 11, Uri: The Surgical Strike, which also featured a fictionalized portrayal of Modi. Such films, coming so soon before India’s general election begins on Apr. 11, have drawn fire from opposition politicians, who say they are little more than propaganda. While PM Narendra Modi, which releases on Apr. 5, has no reported financial ties to Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Oberoi is a staunch Modi supporter, and BJP leaders also attended promotional events for the film. “They are doing hagiographical portrayals of real-life characters without looking at the subtler nuances of politics,” Namrata Joshi, a film critic with Indian newspaper The Hindu, tells TIME. Uri, the highest grossing Bollywood film so far in 2019, certainly sparked a wave of jingoism across the country. “How’s the josh?”—a popular exhortation from the film (josh means passion or zeal)—went viral on social media and has been uttered by Modi and other senior ministers at public events. References to the film were also made in the wake of the Kashmir attack, when the cinematic image of Modi as a strong patriarch, able to take on India’s enemies, found resonance among the many who called for stern action against Pakistan. There have been films attacking Modi’s political enemies as well. The Accidental Prime Minister, released on the same day as Uri, was a damning depiction of the 2004 to 2014 tenure of India’s former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh of the Indian National Congress. It also took a dig at Modi’s primary political rival, current Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who was portrayed as confused and lacking confidence. Unsurprisingly, the film was enthusiastically talked-up by the BJP. Experts say such films can play a role in changing public perception among India’s large numbers of illiterate adults, who are voracious consumers of television and movies.

1157,Angelina Rascouet / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Pilots on the Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed last month followed protocol set by planemaker Boeing Co. to manually disable an automated anti-stall system as they tried to save the Boeing Co. 737 Max jet, a person familiar with the situation said. The Manuevering Characteristics Augmentation System turned itself on numerous times during the short flight, the person said. MCAS, which is programmed to push down a plane’s nose to help prevent aerodynamic stalls in some situations, is a focus of concern by regulators and lawmakers after 346 people died in crashes of Boeing’s newest version of the 737 flown by Ethiopian and Lion Air less than five months apart. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the pilots on the deadly flight initially followed the emergency procedures laid out by Boeing, cutting power to electric motors driven by the automated system. The newspaper said pilots turned electric power back on after cranking a manual wheel that turned the same movable surfaces on the plane’s tail that MCAs had affected. A Boeing representative in Singapore said she wasn’t able to comment, adding that the accident is under investigation and questions should be directed to the investigators in charge. An Ethiopian transport ministry spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment. A preliminary report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash is nearing release but the exact timing is uncertain. The two disasters have rocked the credibility of Boeing as well as U.S. regulators who approved the new plane. Regulators around the world grounded the 737 Max, Boeing’s fastest-selling plane ever, before the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority followed suit.

1158,Rachel E. Greenspan,"Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex gave birth to royal baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, a boy, on Monday, May 6. The boy was born at 7 pounds, 3 ounces at 5:26 a.m. local time, according to a press release. But the anticipation over what the Duchess will choose as her first royal baby name has been in full swing since she announced her pregnancy in October. Whether the Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex will name their royal baby with something conventional by royal standards or something different is up for debate. Following his son’s birth, Prince Harry told reporters on Monday that he and the Duchess are thrilled. “This little thing is absolutely to die for,” he said. “I’m just over the moon.” The Sussex family made its first appearance together Wednesday, and announced his name soon after. Though it’s been widely believed that Meghan and Prince Harry are going against convention in their marriage, any notion that their approach to their royal duties breaks tradition is basically false, according to Victoria Arbiter, a royal expert and commentator for CNN. The royal couple doesn’t tend to stray as far from tradition as people may think, she says. “They haven’t broken any rules, but they’re certainly doing things their way,” Arbiter tells TIME. Still, the naming of this royal child is, in essence, less consequential than the naming of royals who are higher on the line of succession. Meghan Markle’s baby is the seventh heir to the throne, providing a bit more “leniency” to the naming process, Arbiter explains. The child won’t have an HRH affixed to its name — it will not be called a “prince” — the naming process for Meghan and Harry had even more space for creativity. As the stakes are a bit lower than they are for HRH-affixed royal names, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex was free to call the royal baby something untraditional, according to royal expert, Vanity Fair royal correspondent and the author of Harry and Meghan: Life, Loss, and Love, Katie Nicholl. “There’s a lot of speculation that Meghan’s going to want to go for something quite untraditional, possibly an American name or a modern name. It’s possible,” Nicholl tells TIME. Though the name Archie was not popular in gambling, according to Ladbrokes, a U.K.-based betting firm, it’s a widely popular boy’s name in Britain, earning no. 18 on the 2017 top 100 boys’ names in England and Wales. It was always likely that Prince Harry would yearn to follow tradition, Nicholl said, because all the other royal children have pretty traditional names, too.",Did Meghan Markle Have to Go With a Traditional Royal Baby Name?

1159,Rachel E. Greenspan,"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry had their royal baby, a son, on Monday, May 6. But it’s unclear how much time the Duke of Sussex plans to take for paternity leave. It’s customary for royal fathers to take up to two weeks off from work after their new baby is born, according to Katie Nicholl, a royal expert and correspondent for Vanity Fair. But the amount of time they spend at home varies. How much time will Prince Harry take for paternity leave now that the Duchess of Sussex gave birth? Here’s everything we know — and what the experts predict. The United Kingdom has a nationwide standard paternity leave that provides one or two weeks of paid time off for new fathers. This differs based on employer and terms of employment, and fathers must meet a minimum weekly salary requirement to be eligible for paid paternity leave. Royal fathers are no different, Nicholl says. Like most men in the U.K., it’s customary for royal fathers to take the traditional two weeks off from work after a royal baby is born. “It is quite normal for royal fathers to take paternity leave,” Nicholl tells TIME. “Certainly with the modern royals, it is just very much something they do.” Prince William took paternity leave of varying degrees after each of his three children were born. Following the births of his first two children, Prince George of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge took two to three weeks away from his duties to spend time with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and their children, though he returned to work only a couple days after the birth of his third child, Prince Louis. The custom has been around throughout many royal generations before now, Nicholl says. Prince Charles and his siblings, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, took some time for paternity leave, too. “It’s not just this generation. It’s the generation before,” Nicholl explains.",Will Prince Harry Take Paternity Leave? Here's What We Know,"Updated: May 6, 2019 1:07 PM ET | Originally published: April 3, 2019"
1160,Hillary Leung,"Hong Kong has put forward a controversial extradition bill that would allow the transfer of fugitives to China to stand trial, stoking fears that the city’s freedoms and legal protections could be compromised by Beijing. The proposal was presented to the legislative council Wednesday and the new law is expected to be passed later this year, Reuters reports. Critics fear that the extradition agreement could be used by Beijing as a pretext to target political activists and journalists in the semi-autonomous enclave. The financial hub, which came under Chinese sovereignty in a 1997 handover, continues to operate a separate, British-style legal system from the mainland. Currently, there is no extradition agreement with China, where the conviction rate is 98% or higher. The proposal would also add Macau and Taiwan to the agreement. On Sunday, thousands of people took to the streets in Hong Kong to demonstrate against the proposed amendment. But Chief Executive Carrie Lam defended the proposal and refused to make changes before submitting it to parliament. Politicians pushing the amendment say it was prompted by a murder case in February 2018 that saw Taiwanese authorities unable to prosecute a man accused of killing his girlfriend before fleeing to Hong Kong. The extradition law, the supporters say, will close a legal loophole.",Hong Kong Advances Extradition Law to Allow Suspects to Be Sent to Mainland China for Trial,"April 3, 2019"
1161,Amy Gunia,"Despite international condemnation, Brunei enacted new Islamic criminal laws Wednesday, including harsh anti-LGBT measures that make gay sex punishable by stoning to death. The implementation of the draconian penal code is part of the predominantly Muslim country’s rollout of Sharia law. The country’s sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, first announced that the Southeast Asian nation of about 450,000 people would practice Sharia law in October, 2013. The first phase, which related to crimes punishable by fines or imprisonment, was enacted in 2014. The latter phases, which cover offenses punishable by amputation or death, were delayed amid global censure. But this week, Brunei defied critics and enacted legislation that allows ruthless punishments, some of which apply to children and non-Muslim foreigners. As Brunei’s new laws take effect, here’s what to know: Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei, but it was previously punishable with prison time. The new legislation mandates death by stoning for gay sex and a number of other acts, including rape, adultery, sodomy, extramarital sex and insulting the Prophet Muhammed. The new penal code also punishes lesbian sex through whipping and theft with amputation, and criminalizes teaching children about any religion except Islam. Though the impact of the new penal code on the LGBT community has garnered worldwide attention, other Bruneians will also be affected by the ruthless penalties. Women’s rights in particular will also suffer, as the code “introduces public flogging as a punishment for abortion, for example, which again would disproportionately affect [women] who are already vulnerable,” Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for U.N. rights chief Michelle Bachelet told VOA News.",Homosexuality and Adultery Are Now Punishable With Death by Stoning in Brunei.

1162,Hillary Leung,"The head of the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) said Tuesday that hundreds of children of Islamic State fighters should be reunited with their families and repatriated from the caliphate’s last holdout to their countries of origin, Agence France-Presse reports. The children are among some 73,000 people currently housed in the Al-Hol refugee camp after U.S.-backed forces cleared out the last ISIS stronghold in Syria last month. The United Nations estimates that 92% of those displaced into the camp are women and children. There are “certainly hundreds, maybe more” children without their parents at the camp, according to Peter Maurer, president of the ICRC. “Our priority is to proactively look to bring kids back to their country of origin where there are hopefully still family if they are unaccompanied,” Maurer said, according to AFP. After the identities of children are verified, the ICRC said it will notify governments in the children’s country of origin and try to determine whether there are relatives willing to take in the minors. “I have seen the dire conditions and witnessed the efforts to manage the tens of thousands of people pouring into the camp,” Maurer, who spent five days in Syria last month, wrote in a statement. “The needs are huge and the camp is overwhelmed.” “Dozens of children have died because of the cold and conditions in Al-Hol in the last weeks,” he added. Last month, U.S.-backed forces declared victory over the Islamic State group in Syria, marking the end of a five-year campaign against the militants, who at one point had ruled a third of both Iraq and Syria.",The Red Cross Wants to Send Hundreds of Children of Islamic State Fighters Home,"April 3, 2019"
1163,"Joseph Hincks / Mishmeret, Israel","The pastoral village of Mishmeret in central Israel, with a population around 1,000, seems an unlikely warzone. Birdsong is louder than traffic, and the cyprus-lined streets mostly lead to farmhouses growing tomatoes, habanero peppers, and flowers for export overseas. But on March 28, British-Israeli Robert Wolf ducked under a blue tarp cordoning off the remains of his family home, a pile of collapsed wood and broken concrete, and surveyed the damage wrought by a rocket that crashed through his roof March 25, some 75 miles from where it was fired in southern Gaza. “This is a quiet place. Normally you don’t hear of anything happening here,” Wolf, 60, tells TIME after the attack. But three days ago “our whole lives changed.” Had his son not fallen asleep on the couch with the window open enabling him to hear an early morning warning siren, Wolf says, he would have lost not only his home but the six members of his family who along with him were injured in the blast. It’s a fear that hangs over many in Israel, which lives “under genuine, incredible existential threat” from Hezbollah, Iran, Hamas and other militant groups, according to Yohanan Plesner, President of the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI), an independent research center based in Jerusalem. As Israelis prepare to vote on April 9 in the most closely-watched election in years, the rocket that hit Wolf’s home has raised fresh questions over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s handling of Gaza, and cast doubt on the “Mr. Security” image he has long cultivated.  Cross-border tensions have been ticking up over the past year, but the rocket that collapsed Wolf’s central Israel home on March 25 marked a new escalation, striking only 11 days after two others flew towards Tel Aviv for the first time since 2014. In response to the Mishmeret attack, the military closed border crossings, sent two brigades to southern Israel, and prepared to call up thousands of reservists, raising fears of a land incursion. The last such conflict, in 2014, left about 2,200 Palestinians dead, more than half of them civilians. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians, according to the U.N. Saturday also marked one year since the start of the “March of the Return” protests, at which thousands of Palestinians have gathered weekly at the frontier between Gaza and Israel to protest dire living conditions and call for the right to return to ancestral homelands. Israel says the demonstrations are cover for Hamas terrorist attacks and its soldiers have killed around 200 Palestinians and shot 6,000 unarmed demonstrators since the border demonstrations began. The anniversary march on Saturday, attended by 40,000 people, had been seen as a potential flashpoint for further escalation but the IDF said Hamas exercised “restraint not seen in the past year.” Still, IDF soldiers fatally shot four demonstrators, and hours after Israel re-opened Gaza’s borders Sunday, five more rockets were fired from the Strip. No Palestinian group has claimed responsibility for the rockets, but Israeli tanks later shelled Hamas positions. Israelis are watching events in Gaza unfold just as Israel’s election campaign approaches its final stages. Netanyahu, who has been in power for three consecutive terms since 2009 and also led Israel from 1996-1999, is hoping to surpass Israel’s founder David Ben-Gurion as the longest serving prime minister in the country’s history. But he is facing serious headwinds. In late February, Israel’s Attorney General said he would indict the prime minister on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges, pending hearings. Netanyahu has also risked the support of moderate Israelis by fostering a deal between his far-right coalition partners and the extreme right Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, so as to boost both’s chances of passing the 3.5% of the vote threshold required to enter the Knesset. The move prompted rare criticism from AIPAC, America’s largest pro-Israel lobbying body, which called Otzma Yehudit “racist and reprehensible.” “There are so many things to be disgusted by”, says Yossi Mekelberg, an Israeli politics expert at London-based think-tank Chatham House, “it’s really whether the electorate has reached a point where enough is enough.” In 2015, Netanyahu swept to victory on the back of a campaign focused on security, and rallied his base by stoking fears of Arab Israelis voting “in droves” for the opposition. (Arabs make up about a fifth of Israel’s total population.) While his 2019 campaign has also drawn accusations of incitement against Israel’s Arab minority, repeating the same trick on security presents a challenge—this time, he is up against an emblem of the defense establishment.",Netanyahu Is Running for Re-Election as ‘Mr. Security.’ But His Strategy in Gaza Might Be His Achilles Heel,"April 2, 2019"

1166,Ciara Nugent,"The U.K. is now “very likely” to crash out of the European Union without a deal, the E.U.’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Tuesday morning, hours after the country’s parliament voted down every available option for moving forward with Brexit. Speaking to European lawmakers in Brussels, Barnier said a no-deal Brexit, in which the U.K. leaves with no agreements in place over its relationship with the bloc, was becoming “day after day, more likely,” as lawmakers fail to agree on an alternative to the deal negotiated by British Prime Minister Theresa May, which they have now rejected three times. On Monday night parliament voted down four options proposed by lawmakers for how to move forward, ranging from the idea of retaining key elements of E.U. membership, to holding a new referendum. One of the options failed by just three votes. “This is a serious crisis and no-one can be pleased with what is happening in the U.K. currently,” Barnier said. Last month the E.U. granted the U.K. an extension on its original March 29 leaving date, postponing Brexit until April 12. If no deal is reached by then, or no new extension is granted, the U.K. will automatically leave with no deal. Economists say a no-deal Brexit would have disastrous effects for the British economy, potentially causing more damage than the 2008 financial crisis. It could also lead to shortages of goods including food and medicine. Barnier said the only ways British lawmakers can avoid a no-deal Brexit are by approving May’s deal or a variant of it that is acceptable to the E.U. – in which case the U.K. would leave on May 22 – or by offering a “strong justification” for a longer extension. The E.U. negotiator suggested the only possible justification for granting a longer extension would be if the U.K. wanted to hold a new referendum on Brexit, or to hold snap elections to replace May, noting that the extension would not be a chance to return to negotiations with the E.U. “To be clear, during any long extension there will be no renegotiation of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, no, never,” he said.","The U.K. Is Now 'Very Likely' to Leave the E.U.

First Prime Minister of Greece to visit the North Macedonia. A truly historic day,” wrote Zaev on Twitter beneath a photo of the two leaders embracing outside a government building. For three-decades, Greece had objected to its neighbor’s use of “Macedonia,” because a northern Greek province has the same name. But last January, Tsipras agreed to end the long-standing dispute in a landmark move, signaling the countries’ new era of detente. In last summer’s Prespes agreement, Greece pledged to finally lift its vetoes on the Balkan state’s bids to join the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in exchange for the name change. With the name issue resolved, the neighbors are also discussing boosting economic ties. Tsipras is joined by ten ministers and more than two dozen Greek business leaders, who will attend a business forum with him in the afternoon. Ahead of the visit Zaev told AFP there would be new Greek investments worth more than 500 million Euros in North Macedonia.

But like other countries’ attempts to regulate the scourge of disinformation spread online, the bill has prompted free speech concerns, especially within the context of the Singapore’s highly controlled media environment. The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill aims to “prevent the communication of false statements of fact” and “enable measures to be taken to counteract the effects of such communication,” according to the draft. Under the new legislation, the government can demand that online platforms take down misinformation or publish “corrections” next to information flagged as false. Parties failing to comply can face fines of up to $1 million Singapore dollars (approximately $740,000) and 10 years in prison. The bill comes just days after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg called for global regulators to establish worldwide standards for online content. Internet giants Facebook and Google did not welcome Singapore’s proposal, however. Simon Milner, Facebook’s Asia-Pacific Vice President of Public Policy, voiced concern that the law would “grant broad powers to the Singapore executive branch” and “proactively push a government notification to users,” according to Reuters.

Durazo’s press office confirmed the statements. Durazo’s past isn’t unusual.

1171,Melissa Locker,"There was an unfortunate series of events on Blue Planet Live over the weekend when a reporter was helping to save some baby sea turtles, only to have one eaten by a seagull on live television. BBC presenter Liz Bonnin was drawing needed attention to the plight of endangered sea turtles by taking part in sea turtle release on Heron Island, Australia, as part of Sunday night’s episode. Bonnin and wildlife worker Janine Ferguson released six baby green turtles, so they could crawl across the sand to the sea. As the tiny turtles struggled, Bonnin spoke of how important it is to protect the “precious individuals” from predators in the hopes that they make it to the ocean to help rebuild the declining sea turtle populations. As she discussed the risk of predation, a seagull swooped in to prove her point. It appeared behind her and snatched one of the hatchlings, much to the horror of viewers watching at home, who took to Twitter to express their dismay: The BBC provided the following statement about the regrettable, if natural, event: David Godfrey, Executive Director of the nonprofit Sea Turtle Conservancy, thinks the “unfortunate event” highlights a larger issue involving sea turtles and people who want to help them. Resorts and tourist organizations have been “allowing tourists to release turtles for a fee or a photo op,” but do so in a way that Godfrey believes can harm the very critters they are hoping to save. “When hatchlings emerge naturally from a nest they almost always do that at night for a reason-they are less visible to predators,“ he said in an interview with TIME. Unfortunately, many of these tourist events happen in the daytime, when the turtles are vulnerable, so tourists can take photos of their good deed. “The fact that these hatchlings were released in the day is where the mistake was made,” Godfrey said. “If the bird hadn’t gotten the hatchling, then a predatory fish waiting just offshore would have.” That said, Godfrey hopes the fact that this story is going viral will “get the message out about these amazing animals” and encourage viewers to “feel compassion for their survival.”  “We should be thinking of whether these staged hatchling releases should be happening at all and if they should happen during the night,” Godfrey said. “If you’re a tourist traveling to these places, you should not participate in [sea turtles] releases happening during the day.”  Contact us at editors@time.com.",An Expert Weighs in On the Baby Sea Turtle Who Was Eaten On Live TV,"April 1, 2019"
1172,Raisa Bruner,"On Friday, President Donald Trump announced he was cutting aid to the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. On Sunday morning, Fox News reported the policy update in a conversation on popular show Fox & Friends, underlined by a banner graphic that read “Trump cuts U.S. aid to 3 Mexican countries.” Of course for the news station, Mexico is one country, not three, and is not affected by Trump’s change. Naturally, the internet had a field day lambasting the channel for their incorrect chyron headline. A few hours later, the show’s co-host Ed Henry followed up the snafu with an on-air apology. “We had an inaccurate graphic onscreen while taking about this very story. We just want to be clear, the funding is being cut off to the three Central American countries. We apologize for the error — it never should’ve happened,” he said. For some, however, the correction was already too little too late. “Just a reminder that these are the same folks who assert their superiority by belittling the intelligence and good faith of others,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted with a screenshot of the inaccurate headline. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, who is in the running to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020, had another take: “Amazingly, the chyron is not the most foolish thing about this picture,” he said. “To get ahead of a potential refugee crisis caused by great suffering in Central America, it would make sense to use our resources to help reduce that suffering.” Trump’s policy change stems from his belief that the three Central American countries are contributing to what he calls a “migrant caravan.” “If we’re going to give these countries hundreds of millions of dollars, we would like them to do more,” his current White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told CNN.

1173,Madeline Roache,"Liberal candidate Zuzana Caputova won Slovakia’s presidential election on Saturday, becoming the central European country’s first ever female president. Despite having almost no political experience, the 45-year old lawyer and anti-corruption campaigner won 58.4 percent of the vote in the second-round vote, defeating the European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic. The political newcomer soared to popularity in just a few months with a campaign that focused on a struggle for justice. The president is mostly a ceremonial role in the country of 5.4 million, as Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini is responsible for overseeing the government. But when Caputova takes office in June, she will have important blocking powers, will be the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and will have power to appoint top judges. Caputova was born to a working-class family in the town of Pezinok in what was then central Czechoslovakia. The divorced mother of two daughters rose to prominence and was nicknamed the “Erin Brockovich” of Slovakia after leading a successful case against a toxic landfill that was planned in her hometown in 2016. Her 14-year-long case against the wealthy land developer involved organizing protests, filing lawsuits and writing petitions to the European Union. The campaign earned her a prestigious Goldman Environmental prize in 2016. She recently became vice-chair of Progressive Slovakia, a party so new that it has not yet run in the parliamentary elections. Caputova built her campaign on a vow to fight corruption, by stripping the police and prosecutors of their political influence. Last year’s murder of the investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancee Martina Kusnirova has put the issue of political corruption at the forefront of public discussion. And Caputova said Kuciak’s murder was the reason she decided to run for president. Kuciak, who had worked to expose corruption among the political elite was shot and killed in February 2018. Five people were charged with the murder, including a millionaire with alleged links to the center-left political party, Smer. Kuciak’s death sparked anti-government protests attracting tens of thousands of people, which eventually forced Prime Minister and Smer leader Robert Fico to step down. The party is still the largest in the national parliament, however, and Pellegrini is its prime minister.

1174,TIME Staff,"Amid growing concern about the number of journalists imprisoned or killed on the job around the world, TIME partnered with a dozen leading new organizations last month to launch the One Free Press Coalition, aimed at standing up for journalists who are threatened for pursuing the truth. TIME named The Guardians the 2018 Person of the Year, recognizing four journalists and one news organization for their work in the face of threats. And in March, the One Free Press Coalition released its first-ever 10 Most Urgent list, identifying 10 journalists around the world who are facing injustice, incarceration and other threats in connection with their work. The list will be updated on the first of every month. Read about the cases on the April list below, included in no specific order: In March 2017, La Jornada correspondent Miroslava Breach Velducea was murdered in the state of Chihuahua in connection to her reporting on links between politicians and organized crime. Prior to her death, she had received threats on at least three occasions for her reporting. Currently there is one suspect in custody, and the next hearing is expected to take place in a few months. National Bureau of Investigation officers arrested Ressa at Rappler on February 13 over a cyber libel case filed against her by the Justice Department. She was released the next day, but Rappler faces separate retaliatory tax charges. On March 28, authorities in the Philippines issued arrest warrants against Rappler editors and executives, including Ressa, for violating laws barring foreign ownership of media. CPJ and First Look Media are partners in a legal defense fund for journalists, of which Ressa and Rappler are the first recipients. After a one-day trial, Tran Thi Nga was sentenced to nine years in prison on charges of “spreading propaganda against the state.” She produced a number of videos critical of authorities on topics like toxic environmental spills and government corruption. Award-winning Kyrgyz journalist Azimjon Askarov has spent nearly nine years in prison on trumped-up charges for his reporting on human rights violations. Despite international condemnation, Kyrgyz authorities have upheld his sentence.",Read About 10 Journalists Now Facing the 'Most Urgent' Threats to Press Freedom Around the World,"April 1, 2019"
1175,Amnesty International,"To mark International Transgender Day of Visibility, Amnesty International asked two activists from the Dominican Republic and Pakistan to share stories of the struggles they have faced. Nairovi Castillo is executive director of the Community of Dominican Trans and Transvestite Sex Workers (COTRAVETD), an organization she co-founded in 2004. Mehlab Jameel, 26, is a researcher and community educator who helped draft Pakistan’s landmark 2018 Transgender Persons Act — one of the most progressive laws of its kind in the world. The discussion between them is a mark of how solidarity can bring immense comfort and strength in challenging circumstances. Nairovi: I had a terrible childhood. I realized that I was a woman when I was still young, but my family never accepted it. When I was 13, they threw me out because of my sexual orientation. I started sleeping rough on the streets of Santo Domingo and taking psychoactive substances. The transitioning process to become a trans woman was very hard for me. Mehlab: I was born in a small town in the Punjab province, and spent most of my life there until life became impossible and I moved to a metropolis to pursue higher education. Today, I work for a community-led organization HOPE (Have Only Positive Expectations) that advocates for the rights of gender and sexual minorities in Pakistan. A typical day for me involves thwarting the gender binary, defying patriarchy, plotting to overthrow capitalism and drinking lots of chai. You know, the usual things – nothing extraordinary. Nairovi Castillo: The most difficult thing was gaining social acceptance. People called me a “faggot” for dressing as a woman. Many trans people have no choice but to engage in sex work to support ourselves. There are no job opportunities for us in the formal sector. I started working on my own, without a pimp, but, like all of us, I faced a lot of danger. I was stopped by the police almost every day. They beat me, they took my money and forced me to have oral sex with them. When I take off my clothes, I uncover all the scars of the ill treatment I’ve suffered. I can tell you the exact time and date I got each scar. Mehlab Jameel: Trans people, especially from the part of the world where I am from, are always cast as hapless victims. People are so interested in learning about all the ways that we are oppressed, but not interested in challenging the systems that are oppressing us. It’s not that we do not face this violence every single day; it’s that we never get to speak about it on our own terms even within the narratives that are about us.",'I Dream of a Queer Future.'

1176,Billy Perrigo,"Theresa May announced on Friday she would resign as leader of the U.K.’s ruling Conservative Party on June 7, after her last-ditch attempt to secure support for her Brexit deal collapsed leaving her isolated in 10 Downing Street. May will stay on as Prime Minister until a new leader of the Conservative Party is elected, in a process that could be either long or short depending on how many hats are thrown into the ring, but will conclude some time in the summer. There is a packed field of candidates to replace May. The contest will be an internal process in the ruling Conservative Party, as opposed to a national ballot, meaning a new party leader could take over without a general election having to be held. That’s because Britain is a parliamentary rather than a presidential system, so whoever leads the largest party in Parliament becomes the prime minister. The rules of the process will have a bearing on the final result. Candidates will be whittled down, in a series of votes, to two candidates by Conservative lawmakers in the coming weeks. The final two left standing will then be put to party members for a vote. The rank-and-file membership of the Conservative Party is staunchly pro-Brexit, and analysts agree that a hardline candidate would win against a moderate in the final vote. Whether that can be avoided will depend on the voting choices of Conservative lawmakers in the early rounds of voting. Here are the leading candidates who could replace Theresa May as U.K. Prime Minister. Somehow, the former Foreign Secretary, who resigned from May’s cabinet last year over her Brexit deal before agreeing to back it after May offered to resign, is still the frontrunner to succeed the prime minister. In a recent YouGov poll, 39% of party members ranked him their first choice. A campaigner on the “Leave” side in the 2016 referendum, (who famously wrote two op-ed columns, one for leave and one for remain, while deciding which side to support,) Johnson is regarded by many in his own party as a political opportunist. “He is widely seen as dishonest, disloyal, and not a team player by his colleagues,” says Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. “On the flip side, he has this celebrity status and might be able to appeal to people that haven’t traditionally voted Conservative”.",Theresa May Is Resigning as U.K. Prime Minister Next Month.

1177,Ian Bremmer,"The Quick Read About… Turkish Local Elections What Happened This Week: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan braces for municipal elections on Sunday, March 31. It’s the first time Turks head to the polls since Erdogan’s AK Party won parliamentary elections last June, securing him the executive presidency he established to remain in power (going on 17 years now). These are the first elections to be held since Turkey fell into recession for the first time in nearly a decade. Things do not look promising for Erdogan or his supporters. Why It Matters: Turkish elections always matter given the country’s geostrategic location between Europe and the Middle East. But this is the first time that Turkish local elections matter this much. Part of that has to do with the fact that Erdogan continues to frame these local elections as a referendum about his leadership. He keeps saying on the campaign trail, these elections are about “the survival of the Turkish state.” And given the raft of populist measures he’s introduced in the run-up to the vote—upping the minimum wage, offering loans at below-market rates through state banks, selling rationed amounts of fruits and vegetables, among others—he seems to genuinely believe that, even though the Turkish economy is sputtering and can’t really afford these types of government handouts. But Erdogan is desperate, as well he should be, because for years, Erdogan’s rule has coincided with the growth of the Turkish economy, which he eagerly took credit for. But now that same Turkish economy has begun to falter; in part because of the global economic slowdown, and in part because of continued interventions by Erdogan into the economy that have scared off foreign investors. Late last week, Turkey’s currency took a nosedive, dropping 6.5% against the US dollar in a single day, and continued stumbling this week as the government has tried to staunch the bleeding—all told, the Turkish lira has lost 36 percent of its value against the dollar over the last year. Erdogan blamed foreign speculators for causing a run on the currency, and ordered an investigation into JPMorgan Chase, which had written negatively about the future prospects of the Turkish lira. It’s unlikely that the investigation will amount to much; it was seemingly intended as a signal to foreign investors not to publicly disparage Turkey or its economy. Unfortunately for Erdogan, it signaled to investors that investing in Turkey is increasingly becoming a political decision rather than just a financial one. Turkey was once held up as the poster child for successfully transitioning an emerging economy into a developed market, which provided Erdogan with plenty of political capital in the first decade of his rule. As that shield has started to crumble alongside the Turkish economy, Erdogan has begun taking much more provocative geopolitical decisions to play to his nationalist base, like ordering S-400 missile systems from Russia in open defiance of the US and NATO (to which Turkey ostensibly belongs). He’s also leaned into identity politics much more overtly; just last week he aired footage of the Christchurch shooting at a campaign rally to capitalize on the sense of Muslim persecution. A poor showing in this weekend’s municipal elections may make him even more erratic. What Happens Next:",The Quick Read...About Turkish Local Elections,"March 29, 2019"
1178,Ashley Hoffman,"For 35 years, toy Garfield phones the color of macaroni and cheese have inexplicably washed up onto the beaches along the coastal waters of Brittany, France, and now we finally know why. It appears they all came to Marine Nature Park from a shipping container that washed up into a cave after a storm. On Friday, five members of Ar Viltansoù and journalists from FranceInfo visited the cave to discover the origins of the onslaught. “I saw Garfield and container pieces all over the cave. But the bulk of the phones are already gone, the sea has done its job for thirty years. We arrive after the battle,” the president of the local beach cleanup association, Viltansoù Simonin-Le Meur, said according to Le Monde.

The random parts of the phone from his smug chubby face to the number dial pads people used to punch to the coiled lines just kept on coming, which is almost too strange to be true.

1179,Madeline Roache,"Relations between Russia and Ukraine can perhaps be best described as somewhere between a war and a cold war. Before 2014, the Ukrainian government wanted a strategic partnership with Russia. Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014 changed all that. Now, with Ukraine’s presidential elections approaching on March 31, ties with Russia are a key concern. In April of this year, the two countries entered their sixth year of what is now a smoldering conflict in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas. Ukraine demands that the Kremlin return Crimea and the occupied areas of Donbas. And from the Kremlin’s point of view, Ukraine’s government is illegitimate, run by a fascist junta. “Russia would consider ceasing fighting its war on the Ukrainian flank — but only if it drew Kiev closer,” said Gleb Pavlovsky, former Kremlin adviser. Meanwhile “Ukraine dreams of liberating itself from Russia.”  Ukraine has accused Russia of waging a disinformation war to create social unrest; the population’s attitudes toward Russia has hardened over the past five years, with about two-thirds of the population viewing Russia as an aggressor. “Ukrainians want peace, but the price of this varies. Right now, it is impossible for Ukraine to have relations with Russia without being a traitor,” Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian Member of Parliament tells TIME.  A peace resolution is in the Kremlin’s hands, says Anna Korbut, a fellow from the London-based think tank Chatham House, “but it’s up to Ukraine to define its red lines.”  But political analysts say Russia is not interested in ending the war. Control over Ukraine is part of Putin’s legitimacy, says Alexander Motyl, a political scientist at Rutgers University.“ He dare not admit he’s been defeated or admit he’s weak. It could jeopardize his grip on power at home,” Motyl says.  A new president in Ukraine could change a great deal. And the outcome remains difficult to predict, with polls indicating that the none of the three front-runners — the incumbent Petro Poroshenko, the political veteran Yulia Tymoshenko and the comedian-turned-politician Volodymyr Zelensky — are on a clear path to victory. Here’s what to know about how each of them might impact Ukraine-Russia relations. A Poroshenko presidency is the most ‘comfortable’ and ‘convenient’ choice for the Kremlin, says Leschenko. “He’s predictable. They know his strengths and weaknesses.” There is “little hope of the status quo changing” if Poroshenko is re-elected, says Mikhail Minakov, Principal Investigator at a research center, the Kennan Institute and editor-in-chief of Focus Ukraine, the institute’s Ukraine focused blog. “The low intensity conflict will go on and reforms will continue to be faked, while the social pressure for economic reforms will intensify,” said Minakov. Many Ukrainians feel that Poroshenko, 53, failed to live up to the promises he made when he became president in May 2014: to improve standards of living, ensure economic growth, strengthen rule of law and end the war. Now, he no longer gives a time frame for ceasefire and the Kremlin said it refuses to talk with Ukraine until there is a change in leadership.",Ukraine Goes to the Polls on Sunday.

1180,Mahita Gajanan,"George Clooney has called for a boycott of nine hotels connected to the ruler of Brunei, where gay sex will be punishable by death starting April 3. In an op-ed written for Deadline Hollywood, Clooney spoke out against Brunei’s harsh law, which permits death by stoning for gay sex and adultery. Clooney writes the Sultan of Brunei owns “nine of the most exclusive hotels in the world,” and implores people to stop staying at the properties in protest. Sharing that he has previously stayed at many of the hotels owned by the Sultan of Brunei because he did not know about their connection, Clooney wrote, “They’re nice hotels. The people who work there are kind and helpful and have no part in the ownership of these properties.” “But let’s be clear, every single time we stay at or take meetings at or dine at any of these nine hotels we are putting money directly into the pockets of men who choose to stone and whip to death their own citizens for being gay or accused of adultery,” he continues. Brunei had already made homosexuality illegal, but those caught were previously punished with prison time. The nation introduced Sharia law in 2014, sparking a boycott of the Beverly Hills Hotel and and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles, which are owned by the Sultan. The harsh punishment for homosexuality comes as Brunei continues to implement Sharia law. Along with the Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air, the hotels with ties to the Sultan of Brunei span across the world, including The Dorchester, 45 Park Lane and Coworth Park in the U.K.; Le Meurice and Hotel Plaza Athenee in Paris; Hotel Eden in Rome; and Hotel Principe di Savoia in Milan. Clooney notes in his piece that a renewed boycott on the hotels would “have little effect” on Brunei’s death penalty for gay sex. But he asks the public to stop funding the “murder of innocent citizens.” “I’ve learned over years of dealing with murderous regimes that you can’t shame them,” he writes. “But you can shame the banks, the financiers and the institutions that do business with them and choose to look the other way.”",George Clooney Calls for Boycott of Sultan of Brunei's Hotels Over Anti-Gay Stoning Law,"March 29, 2019"
1181,Angus Whitley and Tara Patel / Bloomberg,"The stall-prevention system on a Boeing Co. 737 Max jet automatically switched on before the plane crashed in Ethiopia this month, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing initial findings from the plane’s flight data. The conclusion was relayed at a briefing at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday and is the strongest indication yet that the same system malfunctioned in both the Ethiopian Airlines flight and the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October, the newspaper said. A preliminary report from Ethiopian authorities is expected within days, though the preliminary conclusions — based on analysis of the aircraft’s black boxes — could still change, the people briefed on the matter told the Wall Street Journal. A representative for Boeing said the company was unable to comment on the investigation. The U.S. planemaker, working with regulators, has spent months refining the 737 Max’s software since data from the Lion Air crash indicated the stall-avoidance system had repeatedly tipped the nose down before pilots lost control. Boeing was close to a software fix when the Ethiopian Airlines jet went down on March 10. Air-crash experts have been using flight-data and cockpit-voice recordings recovered from the Ethiopian Airlines wreckage to piece together events leading up to the tragedy, which killed all 157 people on board. Parallels with the loss of an identical Lion Air plane led to a global grounding of the Max model and have given the probe added urgency. The Ethiopian investigation has focused on the anti-stall system, which in the case of the Lion Air crash exerted more and more force until the crew lost control. The software had kicked in on the same aircraft the day before, when an off-duty pilot riding in the cockpit was able to save the plane by helping to cut the power to the rogue system. The feature, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, was designed to keep the Max from climbing too steeply and stalling. The U.S. Transportation Department has begun an inquiry into how it was approved as part of the Max’s certification in 2017, while the Justice Department is using a grand jury to gather information. Officials from the two departments and the Federal Bureau of Investigation began digging into a range of matters related to MCAS within weeks of the Lion Air loss, Bloomberg has reported.",Anti-Stall System Switched on Before Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX Crash: Report,"March 29, 2019"
1182,Mélissa Godin,"When Eliza Jasi saw enormous floods sweeping their way through her village in southern Malawi on March 8th, she had one thought: not again. Malawi, a small, landlocked country in south-east Africa, home to 18.6 million people, has been hit by devastating floods in recent weeks. In early March, following unusually heavy rains, the Shire river in southern Malawi overflowed, sweeping away crops, homes—and people. More than 800,000 people have been affected and at least 59 people have died. (The toll is expected to rise.) On March 9, Malawian President Mutharika declared a state of disaster. On March 15, Cyclone Idai hit Malawi along with Zimbabwe and Mozambique, one of the worst climate-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere. Villages are now completely submerged under water and Nsanje, the most southern district of Malawi has been the most severely affected. Although the government deployed its Defense Force, roads are flooded—preventing aid and rescue vehicles from getting to the worst-affected areas. This is the third major flood that 35-year-old Jasi has endured. In Malawi, violent floods are becoming increasingly frequent and volatile, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures and atmospheric moisture are thought to increase the frequency and severity of floods. According to the United States Agency for International Development, Malawians are particularly affected by climate change because of their reliance on subsistence farming; 80% of Malawians work as farmers. According to the International Monetary Fund, Malawi is the fourth poorest country in the world with 50.7 % of people live under the poverty line and 25% live in extreme poverty.  Women in Malawi are disportionately affected by climate change. Because women are expected to provide food, water, and firewood for their families, droughts have resulted in women walking longer distances to get these resources, increasing the time spent on unpaid household work. The Guardian reports that climate change is also resulting in increased poverty, which is exacerbating the prevalence of early marriages. During environmental disasters — when people are sent to live in camps — women tend to suffer most, in part because of high rates of sexual violence in the camps. Jasi is one of them. During the 2012 floods, one of her six children died. When Jasi sought refuge in an aid camp, there was no shelter and little food. Scared of losing another child, she was forced into prostitution to provide for her family and ended up contracting HIV. According to UNAIDS, one million people in Malawi were living with HIV in 2016, increasing the likelihood of women contracting HIV through these transactions. After the water levels went down, Jasi had to rebuild her home and started regrowing crops that had been swept away. Three years later, another flood hit, displacing more than 230,000 people. Once again, she lost her crops and her home was destroyed. Her husband died shortly after. Now, in 2019, Jasi finds herself in the same predicament: her home and crops have been destroyed and she is once more living in a camp that is unable to provide basic necessities.",‘No Help Is Coming.’ How Devastating Floods Are Fueling Sexual Violence and the Spread of HIV in Malawi,"March 29, 2019"

1184,Amy Gunia,"“If you like a man with power, I’m your guy,” Howard X read aloud as he looked up from the Tinder profile open on the screen of his iPhone. The Kim Jung Un impersonator, who made international headlines last month when he was deported from Vietnam, laughed as he showed off the fake dating profile he created for his North Korean alter ego. Unfortunately for him, Kim’s profile receives a lot more right swipes than his personal one. “What can I say, women like assholes,” he said. Although he looks nearly identical to North Korea’s Supreme Leader, the affable Hong Kong-born Howard is constantly cracking jokes when he is out of character, making it hard to imagine him as a ruthless despot. Howard first dressed up like Kim as an April Fool’s Day joke, he told TIME from a hair salon in Hong Kong’s bustling Tsim Sha Tsui district, where we watched him transform into a replica. When a picture he posted on Facebook landed him an Israeli television commercial for a burger chain, he realized his looks might present a career opportunity. The gig occasionally lands him in hot water, but more often than not, his imitations evoke laughter. “All the police and immigration officials wanted selfies,” he said, referring to his deportation from Hanoi before U.S. President Donald Trump and the real Kim’s second summit in late February. Aside from playing Kim, the multi-talented Howard is a drummer, he runs a samba school and he was once nominated for Best Producer at the Golden Melody Awards, sometimes called the Grammys of the Chinese-speaking world. In an unmistakable Australian accent, he tells TIME that he is also trying to form a satirical band with other authoritarian leader lookalikes, which he wants to call The Tyrants. “I need a Mohammed bin Salman,” he says, before pausing to ask his hairdresser, “can you make it flatter there, just a little bit,” while scrutinizing his new haircut in the mirror. Howard X makes it clear that he imitates the Supreme Leader to satirize him, not to glorify him. “When you have the face of a dictator, it sends a powerful message,” he says, and that can be used to bring attention to injustice. During the 2014 Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong he visited students protesting for democratic elections in the city with a sign that read, “No North Korea style elections in Hong Kong.” He hoped to draw some media attention to the student’s cause. “Humor is a very powerful weapon,” he says.","Meet Howard X, the Dictator Doppelgänger From Hong Kong","March 29, 2019"

1187,Billy Perrigo,"Brexit is complicated. We know. But with the clock ticking toward midnight on Britain’s membership of the European Union, and with virtually all the options still open, understanding it is more important than ever. Here’s what to know about the biggest constitutional challenge the U.K. has faced since World War II. Brexit is a portmanteau of Britain’s exit from the European Union. The U.K. voted to leave the E.U. in a referendum in June 2016 by a margin of 52% to 48%. The U.K. joined the European Union in 1973, back when it was known as the European Economic Community. But it is more than just a free-trade area, founded on the “four freedoms:” the movement of goods, people, capital and services. Citizens of any E.U. country can live and work freely in any other; certain laws and citizens’ rights apply across the bloc; and the E.U. runs several agencies that coordinate scientific, economic and technological cooperation between members. At the moment, there are two potential dates for Britain to leave the bloc. British Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the two year-long process for leaving on March 29, 2017, which meant the U.K. was originally scheduled to leave on March 29, 2019 — i.e. this Friday. But as with everything to do with Brexit, things got a little more complicated. In both January and March, lawmakers refused to ratify the Brexit deal May had negotiated with the E.U., eventually prompting the 27 other member states to agree to give the U.K. an extension period. Under that extension, if U.K. lawmakers had ratified a deal by Friday March 29 then Britain would leave the E.U. on May 22 with a deal. But on Friday, lawmakers refused for a third time to pass May’s plan, setting the U.K. on a path to leave the E.U. on April 12 without a deal — a plan that economists say would cause severe economic damage. But there are two ways out. Firstly, if the U.K. can “indicate a way forward” to the E.U. before April 12, then the E.U. might agree to grant another extension. (The E.U. has called an emergency summit for April 10.) Secondly, the U.K. can legally cancel Brexit and remain a member of the E.U. So it is impossible to say when Brexit will happen for good, if at all. People who wanted Britain to leave the E.U. argued that it was paying too much to the E.U. in membership fees, and that E.U.-wide laws were undemocratic and infringed on the sovereignty of the U.K. parliament. Many advocates of the “leave” side of the referendum also cited border control as a priority: under the E.U., citizens of any member country have the right to live and work in any other. Fears that the U.K. was suffering because of immigration also motivated many voters to choose to leave. People who wanted the U.K. to remain a member of the E.U. also offered a variety of reasons, ranging from the economic to the ideological. They argued that the U.K. benefits from free trade agreements with its largest trading partner, the E.U. — benefits that would be scrapped if the U.K. were to leave. And they spoke about how the E.U. was founded in the wake of World War II to prevent a catastrophic war from ever happening again in Europe, arguing the Union had succeeded in bringing a divided continent together.",What Is Brexit?

He couldn’t open the files on his computer, he couldn’t communicate with his university back in the Dutch city of Utrecht, or even Skype friends or family. “It just makes life really difficult,” he tells TIME. “People have complained, but nothing has changed.”  It’s been one year since access to social media platforms and messaging apps, including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Viber, was blocked in Chad’s latest example of internet censorship. Initially, mobile operators attributed the problems to technical issues, but have since disclosed that the block was ordered by the government led by President Idriss Déby, according to observers. Leading the central African nation of 14.9 million people for almost 30 years, Déby was controversially re-elected in 2016, with a similar online blackout lasting for eight months following his victory. This time round, controls over the Internet appear to have started after proposed constitutional changes were agreed at a conference in March 2018, allowing 66 year old Déby to remain in power until 2033.  The situation in Chad is just one example of how dictatorial governments in the region and beyond are denying citizens access to online information out of fear of uprisings and rebellion. In China, for instance, tight controls are a hallmark of the ruling regime, where state censors constantly monitor social media sites for posts deemed incendiary or subversive. Meanwhile in Russia, President Vladimir Putin recently signed two new bills into law allowing authorities greater control over the web.  The kind of shutdown on social media networks and Internet access going on in Chad has “become the new normal in this part of the world,” says Alain Kemba Didah, an executive board member of Internet Without Borders in Chad, an international monitoring organization dedicated to promoting the free flow of information and defending digital rights. Kemba Didah also points out that even though it is only social media and messaging apps that have been targeted, most of the Internet traffic in the country is actually routed through these sites, therefore affecting the broader ability to access information. While Chad has kept its censorship controls in place for a unusually long time in the region, 2019 has seen several other governments take different short-term measures to increase their grip on the flow of information. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Internet was completely blocked for 20 days in January ahead of contested presidential elections. That same month, Gabon’s Internet and broadcasting services were shut down for 28 hours as the army attempted a political coup, and Zimbabwe’s government ordered two Internet blockouts in the space of a week during civilian protests sparked by a rise in fuel prices. “These bad practices are spreading to prevent populations who aspire to live in a more just and democratic society from expressing themselves,” Kemba Didah tells TIME. A former army chief who seized power in Chad in 1990, Déby is one of several long-ruling African leaders with a tendency to silence dissent. A new report positions him among leaders such as Sudan’s Omar al Bashir, Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni and Cameroon’s Paul Biya as regional heads who have been in power for decades, silencing opposition voices, cracking down on press freedom and ordering Internet shutdowns as the years have passed. Only 5% of Chad’s population numbering some 750,000 people, have access to the Internet, according to a 2018 report monitoring Internet use and access around the world. However, the same report reveals that the country’s Internet use is growing particularly fast — its rate of growth is eighth highest in the world, rising by 90% since 2017. The surge in access to information is likely fueling the government’s desire to suppress it — Chad is classified as one of the most authoritarian regimes in the world. The country has never had free and fair elections, corruption within Déby’s inner circle is rampant and demonstrations thought to be critical of the government are banned. Social media is often crucial to the organizing of such protests, as seen in the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings and the recent protests in Algeria against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term. “Controlling the Internet is a way to curtail opposition,” says Mirjam de Bruijn, Professor of Citizenship and Identities in Africa at Leiden University in the Netherlands. “After elections [in Chad] in 2016, it was clear that the Internet played a huge role in the way that protests grew overnight and how people had access to what was going on in the region.”",This African Country Has Had a Yearlong Ban on Social Media.

1189,Dan Stewart,"Among the many wonders in Netflix’s new wildlife documentary series Our Planet, arguably the most awe-inspiring is a scene where almost no animals appear at all. In this exclusive clip from the show, which premieres April 5, cameras catch the moment when a chunk of ice the size of a skyscraper breaks off the Store Glacier in Greenland and tumbles into the ocean. As seabirds circle in the foreground, 75 million tons of crystalline ice cascade into the water below. “Glaciers have always released ice into the ocean,” says narrator David Attenborough. “But now this is happening nearly twice as fast as it did ten years ago.” Our Planet, produced by the makers of Planet Earth in conjunction with the conservation NGO the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), offers viewers a panoramic perspective of the globe’s many different biomes, filmed in 50 countries over four years. Designed to inform as well as entertain, the series shows us the majesty and marvels of the planet — and tells us what we stand to lose if we don’t act to preserve it. Attenborough spoke to TIME for this week’s print edition about his seven-decade career and his renewed attempts to raise awareness about our planet’s vulnerability to the changing climate. “It is important, and it is true, and it is happening, and it is an impending disaster,” he says.

1190,Madeline Roache,"Icelandic airline Wow Air has suddenly stopped all flights, leaving thousands of passengers stranded around the world. A travel alert published on Wow Air’s website said that the airline is ceasing all operations and cancelling future flights as efforts to raise more money failed. The airline, which flew a total of 3.5 million passengers last year, advised passengers to book new flights on other airlines, and said some may be eligible for compensation. “The reality is that we have run out of time and have unfortunately not been able to secure the funding of the company,” said Wow CEO and founder Skuli Mogensen in a letter to the company’s 1,000 employees, Reuters reported. Wow Air operated short and long-haul routes to various cities in Europe, and to Washington, Boston and Detroit in the U.S. In the travel alert released on Thursday, Wow Air said that passengers scheduled on flights to or from Iceland with Wow Air on March 28 can cancel their reservation for a full refund, or change their reservation to the next available Wow flight. Passengers are concerned they will not get a refund on the abruptly cancelled flights. “If a person booked directly through Wow Air, there’s limited protection and it’s hard to say whether people will be fully refunded, but if they booked through a travel operator they’re more likely to be refunded or compensated,” a spokesperson from the London-based Civil Aviation Authority, who did not wished to be named, tells TIME.   So far, two airlines have stepped in to help. Icelandair announced it’s going to give stranded passengers discounted fares to and from North America (Boston, Edmonton, New York, Toronto and Washington D.C) starting at 100 dollars, and to and from Europe at 60 dollars (excluding taxes and fees). Norwegian Air also said repatriation fares would be available at a 25% discount until April 8, subject to availability and only with a valid Wow Air booking. The Icelandic Transport Authority (ICETRA) tells TIME that they are offering people stuck in the U.K. an alternative route using the EasyJet airline from Edinburgh, London Gatwick and London Luton airports to Keflavik Airport in Iceland’s capital city, Reykjavík. It is also providing rescue fee of £110 cover the cost of flight. This only applies to customers returning to Iceland up to April 14 and they must request it before April 7, or they will have to pay out of their own pocket to get home. ICETRA writes that passengers who bought their ticket from a European travel agent (within the European Economic Area) as a part of a holiday package are protected by the Package Travel Directive, an E.U. law protecting consumers who purchase package holidays.

1191,Hillary Leung,"Last month, Spanish media reported that police were investigating after a group of unidentified assailants raided the North Korean Embassy in Madrid. On Tuesday, the Spanish High Court released a document detailing the Feb. 22 incident. It said 10 people walked into the embassy at around 4:30 pm, carrying machetes, knives and other weapons, and began “shackling” staff and “violently beating” them. They reportedly seized flash drives, two computers, two hard drives and a mobile phone. Most of the individuals left at around 9:40 pm. The document identified Adrian Hong Chang, a Mexican national and U.S. resident, as the leader of the raid. He was said to have been wearing a jacket with a pin of Kim Jong Un, and tricked police who arrived at the scene into thinking that he was a member of staff at the embassy. A group called Cheollima Civil Defense has since claimed responsibility for the incident on its website, and said it shared information “of enormous potential value” with the FBI under “mutually agreed terms of confidentiality.” But the group denied that any intimidation was involved, and said claims that individuals brandished weapons and attacked embassy workers were false. Cheollima Civil Defense (CCD), which also goes by the name ‘Free Joseon,’ calls itself an “organization of refugees who escaped North Korea” that aims to “shake the Kim Jong Un regime.” Its sporadically updated website had its first post on March 7, 2017, which said the group had responded to an “emergency request” to protect the family of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of leader Kim Jong Un killed in a nerve agent attack in the Kuala Lumpur airport in February that year. In the same post, CCD wrote, “If you want to escape or want to share information, we will protect you,” and that the group has “already helped many North Korean people” and expects nothing in return for its services. Last week, CCD embedded a video posted to its YouTube channel of a person, appeared blurred on camera, violently smashing portraits of the Kim family.

1193,Billy Perrigo,"From the vantage point of a news helicopter, the hundreds of thousands of people who lined the streets of Central London on March 23 looked like a colony of ants. The thick column stretched from Hyde Park in the west past the Ritz Hotel before spilling out in front of the Houses of Parliament. Broadcast on loudspeakers and carried aloft on placards came the marchers’ demand: “Put it to the people.” What else could “it” be but Brexit? Nearly three years after the June 2016 referendum in which 52% of voters elected to leave the European Union, the country is both divided and paralyzed by the decision. And on March 27, after two defeats from lawmakers who refused to ratify the exit deal she negotiated with the E.U., Prime Minister Theresa May made one last attempt to end that paralysis by promising to resign if Parliament would just push her deal over the line. As the original March 29 deadline for Britain’s departure approached, patience wore thin on all sides. An online petition calling for Brexit to be canceled altogether drew more than 5.8 million signatures, after causing the government’s official petitions website to crash at least twice. At the same time as the march in London, roughly 100 miles north, Brexit supporters gathered to hear Nigel Farage, a figurehead of the movement to leave the E.U., criticize May’s “Brexit betrayal.” Although a much smaller crowd, the 200 or so marchers claimed to represent the 17.4 million who voted for Brexit. May staked her reputation on delivering Brexit, but she’s been unable to count on the support of even people who want to leave, let alone those who don’t. According to pollster Opinium, 61% of Brits disapprove of her handling of Brexit. “I know there is a desire for a new approach and new leadership,” she told members of her ruling Conservative Party on March 27. “I won’t stand in the way of that.” First comes the still-tricky task of delivering Brexit. On March 14, still with no consensus on moving forward with May’s deal, lawmakers voted to direct her to ask the E.U. for more time. Days later, at a summit in Brussels, leaders of the 27 other E.U. member states agreed to set a new deadline. Now, if lawmakers ratify May’s agreement with the E.U., Brexit will be postponed until May 22–and May will stand down. If they do not agree on a way forward, Britain is set to crash out of the bloc just two weeks after the original date, on April 12. Assailed by protesters on one side and the E.U. on the other, May had long ago lost the support of many of her colleagues. At least 29 members of her government have resigned to vote against her Brexit policy since June 2017, and her Cabinet, delicately balanced between Remainers and Brexiters, is beset by regular leaks and open disagreement. May narrowly headed off an attempt to topple her premiership on March 24, according to reports, and her authority was torn to shreds two days later when lawmakers proposed 16 possible ways forward for the U.K., in defiance of her deal. If Britain ends up with a so-called no-deal Brexit on April 12, trade agreements, citizens’ rights and customs arrangements could be nullified overnight. Authorities are preparing for possible food and medicine shortages, and the Bank of England has warned it could do more harm to the U.K. economy than the 2008 financial crisis. A no-deal Brexit would have repercussions overseas too. Trade with every E.U. country would fall, with Germany and Ireland among the worst hit. The U.S. could also suffer: a recession in Britain, the U.S.’s fifth largest export market, would have knock-on effects for U.S. producers.

1194,Dan Stewart,"It’s the voice you notice first. In person, David Attenborough speaks in the same awestruck hush he has used in dozens of nature documentaries, a crisp half whisper that is often mimicked but seldom matched. Ninety-two years of use may have softened its edges, but still it carries the command of authority. Sitting in his home in the Richmond neighborhood of west London for one in a series of conversations, I feel compelled to drink a second cup of tea when he offers. It somehow seems wrong to say no. In his native U.K., Attenborough is held in the kind of esteem usually reserved for royalty. Over decades–first as a television executive, then as a wildlife filmmaker and recently as a kind of elder statesman for the planet–he has achieved near beatific status. He was knighted by the Queen in 1985 and is usually referred to as Sir David. As he walked into the Royal Botanic Gardens for TIME’s portrait shoot on the day of our interview, the mere sight of him caused members of the public and staff alike to break into goofy smiles. Attenborough pioneered a style of wildlife filmmaking that brought viewers to remote landscapes and gave them an intimate perspective on the wonders of nature. Frans de Waal, the renowned Dutch primatologist, says he regularly uses clips from Attenborough’s shows in lectures. “He has shaped the views of millions of people about nature,” he says. “Always respectful, always knowledgeable, he takes us by the hand to show us what is left of the nature around us.” In the autumn of his life, Attenborough has largely retreated from filmmaking on location but lends his storytelling abilities to wildlife documentaries in collaboration with filmmakers he has mentored. His most famous work, the 2006 BBC series Planet Earth, set a benchmark in the use of high-definition cameras and had a budget equal to that of a Hollywood movie. Among its highlights was the first footage of a snow leopard, the impossibly rare Asian wildcat that hunts high in the Himalayas. More than a decade after its initial release, Planet Earth remains among the all-time best-selling nonfiction DVDs. Now Attenborough is putting his voice and the weight of authority he has accumulated to greater moral purpose. In recent months he has stood in front of powerful audiences at the 2018 U.N. climate talks in Katowice, Poland, and the 2019 World Economic Forum at Davos, in Switzerland, to urge them into action on climate change. These kinds of events are not his chosen habitat, Attenborough tells TIME. “I would much prefer not to be a placard-carrying conservationist. My life is the natural world. But I can’t not carry a placard if I see what’s happening.” Attenborough and his frequent collaborators, filmmakers Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey, will attempt to show the world exactly what is happening on April 5, when Netflix launches Our Planet–a new, blockbuster eight-part documentary series that aims not just to present the majesty of the world around us but also raise awareness of what the changing climate is doing to it. Filmed across every continent over four years, the show takes viewers from remote steppes to lush rain forest to the ocean floor. It has vertiginous ambitions in both its scope and intent. “The idea was not just to make another landmark show, but also to move the dial,” says Scholey, who served as an executive producer. “Not only do we engage a large audience but also actually get to the point of changing policy that would lead to global change.” It’s a show perfectly timed for a global moment in which politicians are prioritizing climate change as never before, students are skipping school to attend climate marches, and governments are attempting to rein in carbon emissions to meet Paris Agreement targets. Although he has been criticized for not speaking up earlier, Attenborough now says that if he has the opportunity to speak truth to power, he has to take it. “It is important, and it is true, and it is happening, and it is an impending disaster,” he says.","David Attenborough Isn't Sure We Can Save the Natural World.

1196,Ian Bremmer,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the White House on March 25 to stand shoulder to shoulder with President Trump, a friend and ally doing his best to help him win re-election this month. Bibi needs the boost. He faces both corruption charges and a strong challenge from an opposition alliance led by his former army chief. Netanyahu’s fortunes were vastly improved by the change in leadership in the White House. Relations with Barack Obama were famously frosty, not just because the two men were temperamentally incompatible, but because Netanyahu believed Obama’s approach to the Middle East, with his cautious support of the Arab Spring, threatened Israel’s security. More ominously from Bibi’s point of view, Obama directly engaged with Iran for the nuclear deal in hopes that a less isolated Iran might become less confrontational with its neighbors. Donald Trump has taken a different approach, to put it mildly, and there’s a reason he has a near 70% approval rating in Israel. Trump has reinvigorated U.S. ties with Saudi Arabia and adopted a confrontational approach to Iran. He has withdrawn the U.S. from the nuclear deal. Where Obama hesitated, Trump ordered military strikes against Syria’s Bashar Assad in response to his use of chemical weapons. On Israel itself, Trump has followed through on Washington’s decades-old promise to defy Arab criticism by moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On March 25, he announced the U.S. would set aside precedent to formally recognize Israel’s authority over the Golan Heights, a piece of strategically important land seized from Syria during the 1967 war. Yet the strength of Netanyahu’s political position comes less from the change in the White House than from Israel’s stable place in the region. Over a decade of Middle East turmoil, Israel has managed to remain mainly above the fray of the upheavals within Arab countries and the Saudi-Iranian proxy wars. This has allowed Netanyahu to maintain a solid bond with the U.S., even when Netanyahu and Obama were at odds, and to build pragmatic relations with Russia, particularly in containing the violence in Syria. It has helped Israel’s Prime Minister improve relations with Arab countries that once called for Israel’s annihilation. He has built promising ties with China and India. This is why Bibi’s main opponent in this month’s elections, his former army chief Benny Gantz, has offered voters a foreign-policy platform virtually identical to the Prime Minister’s. He has avoided promises to work toward an independent Palestinian state. He pledges to keep Jerusalem undivided, the Golan defended and the West Bank under full Israeli control. Gantz promises a hard-line approach to Iran, Hamas and Hizballah. A rocket attack from inside Gaza this week that destroyed a home and injured seven people in central Israel has given Gantz a new opportunity to attack Netanyahu, who also serves as Defense Minister, and another chance to remind voters how many “terrorists” his army killed in Gaza. Israel stands in a strong position not simply because Donald Trump bestows favors on its Prime Minister, but because a decade of change in the Middle East has boosted its regional standing and bolstered its security.

Traffickers allegedly murdered, enslaved, imprisoned, tortured, raped, starved, and forced displacement of their victims between 2012 to 2015, according to a joint investigation by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) and Bangkok-based rights group Fortify Rights. While atrocities committed against the Rohingya in Buddhist-majority Myanmar are well-documented, the new investigation is the first to document abuses in Malaysia and Thailand. “This is the first report documenting international crimes that were perpetrated outside of Myanmar,” Matthew Smith, CEO and co-founder of Fortify Rights told TIME. Approximately 170,000 people fled to Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand by sea during the three-year period between 2012 and 2015, following violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine state that left more than 100,000 Rohingya internally displaced and confined to concentration camps. Heightened security since the unrest contributed to a state of apartheid that steadily eroded their living conditions. Many fled to seek a better life in Muslim-majority Malaysia. Often the refugees were deceived into boarding overcrowded boats lacking adequate food and water, then abused or worse once aboard, the report says. Once they reached their destinations in Malaysia or Thailand, many were enslaved and held for ransom up to $2,000 to secure their release.

According to a press release published by the E.U. Parliament on Wednesday, 560 lawmakers voted in favor of the agreement, while 35 were against and 28 abstained. “Today we have taken an important step to reduce littering and plastic pollution in our oceans and seas,” said Frans Timmermans, the First Vice President of the European Commission. “Europe is setting new and ambitious standards, paving the way for the rest of the world,” he added. The Single-Use Plastics Directive will ban products for which alternatives exist on the market, such as single-use plastic cutlery, plates, and items made of oxo-degradable plastics, by the year 2021. E.U. member states will also have to achieve a 90% collection target for plastic bottles by 2029. Additionally, the agreement will extend the “polluter pays” principle, putting more pressure on manufacturers of tobacco filters, fishing gear and other pollutive products to bear environmental responsibility. According to the European Commission, more than 80% of marine litter is plastics, and less than 30% of the 25 million tonnes of plastic waste generated yearly by E.U. countries is recycled. Due to its slow rate of decomposition, plastic accumulates in seas, oceans and on beaches in the E.U. and worldwide.

1201,Michael Ames,"In the summer of 2018, the Trump Administration began quietly reaching out to the Taliban to strike a peace deal in Afghanistan. With little apparent sense of irony, President Trump pursued negotiations through the same Taliban officials that during his presidential campaign he routinely called vicious, bloodthirsty terrorists—the same five men who President Obama released from Guantanamo Bay in the 2014 prisoner exchange for U.S. Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl. Trump’s Taliban peace talks have been underway in Doha, Qatar, since January, and as the full scope of the war comes into view, Bergdahl’s status as a detested scapegoat can and should be reassessed. In history’s long view, he may be remembered as the key that unlocked a frozen peace process. From the day after they first captured Bergdahl, the Taliban demanded a prisoner trade. For years, Taliban officials, spokesmen, and military commanders broadcast a common refrain—let’s negotiate a prisoner swap—through every available channel. But Washington had no ready reply. Held captive by the Taliban inside Pakistan, our supposed ally, Bergdahl’s plight mirrored the self-enforcing illogic of the entire conflict. The Obama Administration held secret the May 31, 2014 prisoner trade that released him until the last possible hour, not only for operational security on the Afghan-Pakistani border, but also to keep it from political adversaries in Washington. Within hours of the swap, Republican operatives led by Richard Grenell, Trump’s ambassador to Germany, took to cable news to spread reckless gossip that Bergdahl had been a defector. The backlash that followed, led in large measure by Trump himself, revealed the extent to which American politics had come untethered from reality. Two days after the exchange, and long before his gilded descent to the presidency, Trump called Bergdahl a traitor on Fox & Friends, unwittingly regurgitating years of Taliban propaganda on America’s most watched news network. Trump howled that Obama’s prisoner swap wasn’t just a bad deal, but a high crime bordering on treason. “We trade five killers that want to destroy us, that are already back in service to try and knock us out, and we trade five killers for one traitor,” Trump told Fox’s Martha MacCallum in July 2014. MacCallum never pushed back, but Trump was wrong on every count. Far from trying to kill Americans, each of the five Taliban were either working as U.S. intelligence assets or had been detained while trying to. One of the five Taliban officials, Abdul Wasiq, had been an intelligence minister when, in November 2001, he met with American operatives and offered to help track down his boss, Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Wasiq said he would carry a GPS device to lead them straight to Omar, but shortly after the meeting the Americans detained him, bound his wrists with zip-ties, blinded him with goggles stuffed with cotton balls, inserted a tranquilizing suppository in his rectum, and flew him to Guantanamo Bay, where he spent more than twelve years in Kafkaesque purgatory. The primary reason for his detention? According to his official Pentagon records, he was there “to provide information…on Omar’s location.” After Obama released the five, and following their warm welcome in Doha, where the Qataris presented each with a shiny gourmet cake, they were put under house arrest, monitored by Qatari authorities, and have lived in air-conditioned obscurity ever since.

1205,Laignee Barron,"When Rohingya refugees began fleeing into Bangladesh in 2016 and 2017, lawyer and activist Razia Sultana found herself on the frontline of a sexual violence epidemic. The Myanmar military, in its scorched-earth campaign against the Muslim minority, laid waste to entire villages, carried out massacres and lined up women to be raped, according to U.N. investigators, who have called for the alleged crimes to be prosecuted as genocide. As the exodus swelled to more than 770,000, Razia Sultana got to work documenting the violence. Born in Maungdaw, Myanmar, Razia Sultana grew up in Bangladesh where she has worked for the Rohingya community as an educator, campaigner and interpreter. After interviewing hundreds of rape survivors, she established the Rohingya Women’s Welfare Society to provide counseling and respond to issues of domestic violence, child marriage and women’s health. Last year, she testified before the U.N. Security Council, and on March 7, the State Department honored her with a prestigious International Women of Courage Award. She spoke with TIME by phone shortly after receiving the award in Washington, D.C. Caution: The below interview contains graphic material that may be distressing to some readers. How did you start documenting sexual violence against Rohingya women and girls? After the 2016-2017 refugee influx it was just crazy. I had to help the women.

1206,David Ariosto,"It once seemed so encouraging for Venezuela‘s political opposition: Millions in the streets. Strong international support. An unpopular autocrat seemingly on the ropes. But what a difference a month can make. In early March, Juan Guaidó — the man recognized by dozens of countries as Venezuela’s interim president returned home to cheering crowds. He had been abroad for almost two weeks, currying favor with other regional governments, and trying to get much–needed humanitarian aid to his countrymen. But in the days since then, little has changed. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro remains in power, despite having overseen one of the most staggering economic collapses in modern history. Guaidó’s overtures to the military to drop their support for Maduro have had little effect — only an estimated 1,000 soldiers and national police have defected, despite huge protests, growing sanctions pressure, and the whispered threat of US military action. The top brass remains loyal to Maduro. In fact, after a few weeks of mostly ignoring Mr. Guaidó, Venezuelan authorities have quietly ratcheted up pressure of their own. Earlier this week, in a pre-dawn raid, the intelligence services detained Mr. Guaidó’s chief of staff at his home, raising the possibility that the government may be closing in on Mr. Guaidó himself. With relatively few tangible gains to show recently, what is Guaidós plan? Is he open to US military intervention? What would a realistic transition look like?

But over the weekend, one man shared his own personal horror during the storm: his dwindling beer supply. Shane Ryan began live-streaming security footage of his home on Facebook on Saturday to show the storm to concerned friends and family, and he soon realized that the real emergency was the ‘beer-mergency’ of the available beverages in his fridge. “Live Stream of Cyclone Veronica In Baynton Karratha,” Ryan titled one of the posts, which showed a tally of alcoholic drinks remaining in addition to the stormy view outside his house in Karratha, Western Australia. After about three hours, the beer supply reached zero, and Ryan started his tally of Jameson and Ginger Ale, because apparently he’s a man of taste who drinks Whiskey Gingers.  Some faithful viewers commented asking that Ryan “pass some over the fence” to share his minor wealth with others. When the beers ran out and the whiskey tally appeared, one user joked that Ryan must have gone to the liquor store.

The Dutch art historian and art crime investigator recently located Pablo Picasso’s Portrait of Dora Maar ( also known as Buste de Femme) after it was stolen from a Saudi sheikh’s yacht on the French Riviera in 1999. The 1938 painting, which hung in Picasso’s home until he died in 1973, had a personal significance to the artist: Dora Maar was his lover and muse for seven years. According to the BBC, Brand began searching for the rare masterpiece — believed to be worth $28 million — about four years ago when he heard that a “Picasso stolen from a ship” was believed to circulating in the Netherlands criminal underworld. Once he pinpointed which painting that referred to, he spread the word to see if anyone had accidentally bought it. Less than two weeks ago, he said two representatives showed up at his door in Amsterdam, with the painting wrapped in a sheet and black garbage bags. “[The businessman] thought the Picasso was part of a legitimate deal. It turns out the deal was legitimate — the method of payment was not,” Brand told AFP. The painting is now in the hands of an insurance company, and police in France and the Netherlands said they will not prosecute the painting’s last owner, per the BBC. According to the Associated Press, Brand knew the painting was legitimate as soon as he laid eyes on it. “You know it’s a Picasso because there is some magic coming off it.”",Dutch Art Detective Dubbed 'Indiana Jones of the Art World' Finds Stolen Picasso Painting,"March 26, 2019"

The French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) said it is taking action against the companies for “broadcasting a message with violent content abetting terrorism, or of a nature likely to seriously violate human dignity and liable to be seen by a minor,” according to AFP, which received a copy of the complaint. In France, these offenses can carry charges of up to three years’ imprisonment and a 75,000 Euro ($85,000) fine.

1213,Amy Gunia,"China has removed more than two minutes of LGBTQ content from the 2018 Best Picture nominee Bohemian Rhapsody, which landed in the world’s second-largest movie market on March 22. The biopic chronicling British rock-band Queen shows frontman Freddie Mercury kissing and touching other men in its original version. But in China, a scene of two men kissing, the word “gay,” and a clip of the main character dressed in women’s clothing were removed, according to CNN. Mercury (played by Rami Malek), became a queer icon shortly before the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s and eventually died of complications related to the illness, though he never formally came out. The film initially focuses on Mercury’s romantic relationship with Mary Austin (played by Lucy Boynton). As the relationship begins to deteriorate, Mercury tells Austin that he thinks he might be bi-sexual, to which she responds, “No Freddie, you are gay.” That scene has also been cut from the Chinese version of the movie. “Rather than homophobic, I think (China’s censors) are sexphobic,” LGBTQ activist and documentary filmmaker Fan Popo told CNN. “They are probably the most conservative people in China, that’s why they are chosen for this job,” he said. This is not the first LGBTQ censoring in China to raise eyebrows in recent months. One Chinese broadcaster caused uproar on Chinese social media when it censored Rami Malek’s Best Actor Oscar acceptance speech, changing “gay man” to “special group” in the subtitles. Other recent Oscar contenders with LGBTQ themes like Call Me By Your Name and Moonlight were not released in China at all.

1214,Madeline Roache,"In Russia, the reaction to the results of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between Moscow and President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign can be summed up in one phrase: “We knew it all along.” “[It] proved what was known in Russia from the very beginning,” said Konstantin Kosachev, a senator in Russia’s upper house of the legislature, in a Facebook post on Monday. Mueller’s long-awaited report concluded that neither Trump, nor anyone associated with his presidential campaign “conspired or knowingly coordinated” with Russia during the 2016 election, according to a summary released Sunday by Attorney General William Barr. Trump called the report as a “complete and total exoneration,” but Mueller pointedly did not absolve the president on allegations related to obstruction of justice. The report also detailed the disinformation and social media campaign led by Russia’s Internet Research Agency during the 2016 election, as well as the Russian government’s hacking of Democratic Party officials and members of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Since becoming the Special Counsel for the Russia probe in 2017, Mueller compiled hundreds of pages of known court filings, demonstrating Moscow’s alleged plots to sow discord and help Trump win the presidency. Throughout the investigation, Russian politicians and the state media have denied that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 presidential election at all. And until Monday, there was limited coverage of the Mueller probe in the Russian mainstream media. Only occasionally was it referenced as an example of the U.S. government’s attempt to demonize Russia and undermine Trump. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded on Monday, according to Russian state-owned TASS news agency: “We believe the accusations that continue to be made against Russia in terms of interference in the U.S. electoral processes are unfounded because even the brief information that is listed in the summary [of the Mueller report] has no basis.” He added: “It’s hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it’s not there.” Other officials have given a more heated response. Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the information committee at the Federation Council tweeted on Monday: “From the very start it was a biased, artificial, provocative, conspiratorial, designed-to-fuel-hatred towards Trump campaign.

1222,Melissa Chan,"Less than a week after a gunman allegedly murdered 50 worshippers inside two New Zealand mosques, the nation’s prime minister announced a sweeping, nation-wide ban on assault weapons. The measure was met with swift praise in the U.S. among gun reform advocates, who have long been pleading for similar restrictions. On Thursday, they renewed their calls for change and urged U.S. leaders to follow in New Zealand’s footsteps. But would a ban like New Zealand’s even hold up in American courts? It’s difficult to say since the U.S. Supreme Court, the nation’s highest court, has not directly addressed whether semiautomatic weapons are protected under the Second Amendment. But constitutional scholars, pointing to a few legal precedents, say it’s certainly feasible. “It’s difficult to discern the chances,” says Stanford University law professor David Studdert. “But it could hold up in court. That is definitely a possibility.” Before last week’s mosque attacks, New Zealand had not experienced a mass shooting in nearly three decades. The speed with which the country enacted change highlights the stark differences with how the U.S. has reacted to its own massacres. For instance, after 58 people were slaughtered at a Las Vegas music festival on Oct. 1, 2017—the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history—it took the federal government more than a year to ban bump stocks—accessories the killer used in the attack to dramatically increase his weapons’ rate of fire. And after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. in February 2018, the state raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm, among other measures, yet there were no changes to gun laws on a federal level, despite nationwide marches. Here’s what experts say could happen if a New Zealand-style assault weapons ban was passed into law in America: At a news conference Thursday, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said a new federal law would prohibit the sale and possession of military-style semiautomatic weapons, with exceptions made to police and some farmers. It would also ban high-capacity magazines and accessories that can covert firearms into military-style semiautomatic weapons. “In short,” Ardern said, “every semiautomatic weapon used in the terror attack on Friday will be banned in this country.” As part of the new law, which is expected to be in place in a matter of weeks, the prime minister said gun owners would have a “reasonable” amount of time to give up and sell their weapons to the government. The buyback program is estimated to cost New Zealand up to 200 million New Zealand dollars, or $140 million. However, the prime minister said it’s unclear how many of the guns are currently in circulation.",New Zealand Banned All Assault Weapons. Could That Work in America?,"March 22, 2019"
1224,Ian Bremmer,"The Thai people head to the polls this Sunday for the first time since the country’s military seized power in a 2014 coup. It’s the first general election since 2011. For years now, the country’s real political power has lain in the hands of the military, backed by the country’s monarchy. The country maintained a democratic façade over the years by holding elections from time to time leading to the election of political leaders with varying degrees of actual power, often heading weak coalition governments. However, whenever the military deemed a civilian government too much of a threat to itself, the elite establishment or to the royal family, it would overthrow the government and attempt to seize the reins for itself. Since 1932, the country has seen 19 coup attempts, a dozen of which were successful. In 2006, the junta ousted Thaksin Shinawatra, an ambitious populist who was particularly beloved by the country’s rural poor for his generous welfare handouts and who briefly introduced majoritarian politics into the country. After he was run out of the country, he was eventually succeeded by his sister Yingluck, whose government was overthrown by the military in 2014. Both remain in exile to this day, but their main political party, the Puea Thai Party, is expected to do well in Sunday’s elections. Another party that is expected to do well is Future Forward, a group led by 40-year-old billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit that appeals both to youth voters as well as the country’s urban electorate. And while the Puea Thai party is also anti-military, Future Forward appeals to Thais looking to cast a general anti-establishment vote against both the military and the Shinawatra’s. Yet anti-junta parties face an uphill battle to secure enough votes to take control of Thailand’s premiership, both individually and in any type of coalition. Part of that has to do with the fact that the country’s military-backed courts have the power to ban parties and candidates from running on the flimsiest of pretexts. But anti-military parties also have constitutional obstacles in their way; the Thai military wrote a new constitution in 2017 that stacks the odds perpetually in its favor. For example, to appoint a prime minister, any party of coalition must control a majority of the entire congress —not only of the 500-seat House of Representatives, but also of the 250-member Senate. But since the country’s senators are all appointed by the army, anti-junta parties must win at least 376 seats in the House in order to seize power, whereas pro-military parties (including the one headed by junta leader and current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha) need to secure just 126 seats. Credible polls are hard to come by and given the dozens of parties in play, the political math is hard to work out on this side of elections; it doesn’t look likely that any one party will command an absolute majority in the house.",The Quick Read on Thailand's First Election in 8 Years,"March 22, 2019"
1225,Madeline Roache,"Women across New Zealand are wearing headscarves in a show of support for the Muslim community, one week after 50 people were shot dead in two mosques in the city of Christchurch. Women and children have posted pictures of themselves wearing headscarves on social media Friday, with words denouncing last week’s violence and expressing solidarity with victims of the shooting. “I stand with our Muslim community today and against hate and violence of any kind,” one Twitter user wrote. Auckland physician Thaya Ashman told Reuters she thought up the “Headscarf For Harmony” event after seeing a Muslim woman on the news say she was too afraid to go outside wearing a hijab. “I wanted to say: We are with you, we want you to feel at home on your own streets, we love, support and respect you,” she said. Last week, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was praised for wearing a black headscarf during her meeting with members of the Muslim community. A female police officer also put a scarf on her head while she guarded the Friday prayer after the shootings.

1226,Osama Bhutta,"Racists and bigots believe that diverse societies don’t work. Frustrated that their howling at the moon wasn’t enough, they’re now picking up weapons in an attempt to prove themselves right. We can’t keep expressing shock and then moving on until the next outrage. We watched in astonished horror last year when a white supremacist entered a synagogue in Pittsburgh and shot dead 11 worshippers. And yet after the initial horror, the world carried on like before. These haters are destabilizing our societies and concerted action needs to be taken before things get even worse. To be clear, this isn’t just about Western societies. For many Muslims, the attacks on March 15 on Christchurch mosques that left 50 dead, represent just a tiny part of a global rising tide of anti-Muslim bigotry perpetrated by insecure majorities. From east to west, there are countless examples. In Myanmar, decades of hate speech and persecution culminated in 2017 with over 700,000 predominantly Muslim Rohingya having to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh after a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing. The implicated military in Myanmar has been given plenty of diplomatic cover by China, whose authorities are currently holding up to 1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups  in euphemistically titled “transformation-through-education” camps in Xinjiang. It’s one of the stories of our age, subjugation on an epic scale. Meanwhile, India’s historic multi-faith character has taken a hit under the leadership of Narendra Modi, a man who was chief minister during the 2002 Gujarat pogrom, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Muslims. His brand of Hindu nationalism has led to divisiveness rather than unity, leading to growing phenomena such as “cow-related violence”. Many politicians across Europe have been gaining ground by peddling anti-Muslim messages. France’s Marine Le Pen compared Muslims spilling onto pavements from packed mosques after Friday prayers to Nazi occupiers. A key message of the Brexit campaign was the “threat” of Turkey joining the EU. Arch pro-Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage once accused British Muslims of having “split loyalties”. The biggest beneficiary of ballot box Islamophobia though is Donald Trump with his campaign promise of a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” He said that this ban would stay in place until the country’s representatives “can figure out what the hell is going on”. Trump arrived on the back of a generation of Islamophobia that went hand-in-hand with the controversial wars in Afghanistan and Iraq—wars that resulted in the still barely acknowledged deaths of hundreds of thousands of Muslims.","After Christchurch, Here's How We Can End Hate Speech and Islamophobia","March 22, 2019"
1227,Fathiya Dahrul and Harry Suhartono / Bloomberg,"Indonesia’s flag carrier said it plans to meet Boeing officials next week to discuss the airline’s request to cancel its $4.8 billion order for the troubled 737 Max 8 jet. PT Garuda Indonesia, which told Bloomberg last week it wants to cancel its order for 49 Boeing 737 Max jets, has informed the U.S. aircraft maker of its plans and is scheduling to hold the meeting in Jakarta, President Director I Gusti Ngurah Askhara Danadiputra said on Friday. Still, the airline has yet to reach a decision on the cancellation of the Boeing 737 Max order, the company said. Garuda, like Indonesia’s Lion Air and a number of airlines, are wavering on the Max jetliner after two of the planes crashed in the past months, prompting regulators worldwide to ground the Boeing’s best-selling plane, which sells for an average of $121.6 million each.

1228,H.A. Hellyer,"Throughout my career as an academic and author in international relations, I have been instinctively averse to discuss my personal identity in my analysis. Today is an exception, because it’s an unusual time to be both a white Englishman, whose family’s roots in England stretch back for more generations than I can count, and to be an Arab of Egyptian, Sudanese and Moroccan extraction on the other. And at a time when white supremacists and ISIS-style extremists pose incredible threats to us in the West, it often seems that we don’t compare these two, very different, phenomena correctly. As part of my work, I pore over extremist literature — by ISIS and sympathizers, but also by white supremacists and populist nationalists. Our societies have become particularly sensitive to the notion that the rhetoric of non-violent extremists in the far-right end of the Islamist universe can be weaponized. It doesn’t mean they will always lead to militant groups like ISIS, but the transition becomes less difficult. In the aftermath of the July 7 2005 bombings in London, I became the deputy head of a working group convened by the British government to address how to tackle radicalization. One conclusion we reached was that there was, indeed, an extremist ideology—now perhaps best described as ISIS-style extremism—that takes its inspiration from a heterodox interpretation of religion. Thankfully, it is one that affects only a tiny minority of Muslims worldwide, and an even more minute proportion in the West. Nevertheless, we rightly are concerned about – quite vividly.  But when it comes to white supremacy, experts at the Soufan Center, founded by a former FBI special agent, describe a “long-running U.S. double standard with concerns over crime and terrorism that are inspired by the narrative of Bin Ladenism versus crime and terrorism inspired by right-wing ideology.” Just months ago, the former head of the London Metropolitan police’s counterterrorism unit said the U.K. had not “woken up” to the threat that the far-right represents. We are continually giving succour to white supremacist rhetoric, let alone sufficiently challenging it. Following the March 15 attacks in Christchurch, a reporter asked Donald Trump if he saw white nationalism as a rising threat around the world. He responded: “I don’t really. I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.”  It’s a stark denial. It’s one that brings to mind the warning that the U.K.’s top anti-terror policeman in the UK issued this week: “The reality is that every terrorist we have dealt with has sought inspiration from the propaganda of others, and when they can’t find it on Facebook, YouTube, Telegram or Twitter they only have to turn on the TV, read the paper or go to one of a myriad of mainstream media websites struggling to compete with those platforms.” This problem is much larger than many of us want to admit. And ironically, it may well be white supremacy that is the larger problem for us in the West. Last week, New Zealand suffered its own version of London’s July 7 bombings, or even—given New Zealand’s tiny population size—an attack closer to 9/11 in the United States. But for all its repugnant evil, ISIS-style extremism cannot hope to destroy the integrity of Western societies.  After all, ISIS style-extremism appeals to a tiny minority of a tiny minority within Western societies. Even where it has proportionately more appeal, within Muslim majority communities, the attraction is minuscule. Moreover, there is no country in the world where we can imagine that an ISIS-style entity could conceivably emerge again, given that its neighbours and the world would immediately gather to crush it.",Where We Go Wrong in Comparing White Supremacy With ISIS,"March 21, 2019"
1229,Jamie Ducharme,"Ethiopian Airlines said the pilot flying the Boeing 737 MAX 8 that crashed earlier this month was properly trained, as it hit back at reports that he had not practiced on a flight simulator designed for the new plane. Two reports — one from Reuters, and one from the New York Times — cited anonymous sources who said that Yared Getachew, the pilot who died along with all 157 people aboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, had not practiced on a Boeing 737 MAX flight simulator to prepare for differences between the new plane and earlier 737 models. Ethiopian reportedly had the simulator since January. It is unclear whether the co-pilot had trained using the simulator, according to the reports. But Ethiopian Airlines, which is regarded as one of Africa’s safest airlines, disputed those claims in a statement Thursday, saying its pilots had completed appropriate training, as recommended by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing. Additionally, the airline said that the 737 MAX flight simulator was not designed to include problems with the new plane’s automated systems, which are suspected of contributing to the crash. “We urge all concerned to refrain from making such uninformed, incorrect, irresponsible and misleading statements during the period of the accident investigation,” the airline said in the statement. “International regulations require all stakeholders to wait patiently for the result of the investigation.” The airline also expressed “disappointment” over the Times’ “wrong reporting.” The Ethiopian crash has drawn international scrutiny because it is the second deadly crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8, Boeing’s best-selling commercial airliner. The first crash involved a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October. Some are questioning whether the plane’s automated Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which is meant to prevent stalls, caused both crashes. Investigators said preliminary findings pointed to the automated system contributing to the Lion Air crash. Its role in the Ethiopian Airlines accident is still under investigation. Ethiopian maintained in its statement that its pilots were familiar with warnings issued by the FAA following the Lion Air crash. It also said that the MAX 8 simulator is not designed to model the type of MCAS issues implicated in the crashes, seemingly suggesting that additional training would not have prevented the accident.",Ethiopian Airlines Denies Reports That Pilot in Boeing 737 MAX Crash Was Not Properly Trained,"March 21, 2019"
1230,Billy Perrigo,"More than 5.4 million people have signed a petition to cancel Brexit on the U.K. government’s official petitions website — so many that the website crashed multiple times. The petition had received some 600,000 signatures at a rate of 1,500 every 60 seconds before the site crashed at about 9 a.m. U.K. time on Thursday, the Guardian reported. By mid afternoon, the site was back online but suffering intermittent outages. There were 2 million signatures by Thursday, 3 million by Friday, and 5 million by Sunday. The U.K. government must now allow a debate on the petition’s contents in parliament. But the number of signatures still pales in comparison to the number of votes cast in the U.K.’s 2016 referendum on leaving the E.U., where voters decided to leave by a margin of 17.4 million (51.9%) to 16.1 million (48.1%). There is also no guarantee the debate will happen before the U.K. leaves the E.U. The petition asks the Prime Minister, Theresa May, to revoke Article 50, the device in E.U. law by which, two years ago, she set off the Brexit process. The U.K. could legally unilaterally cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50, the European Court of Justice ruled last December. The text of the petition read, “The government repeatedly claims exiting the E.U. is ‘the will of the people’. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the E.U. A [second Brexit referendum] may not happen – so vote now.” A surge of signatures started on Wednesday evening, after May made a defiant televised speech at her 10 Downing Street residence blaming lawmakers for the Brexit impasse, pledging to deliver Brexit and telling voters “I am on your side.” In that speech, May announced she would ask the E.U. to delay Brexit, thanks to her Brexit deal still not having been accepted by lawmakers. On Thursday, she met European leaders, who agreed to delay Brexit from March 29 until May 22 if lawmakers accept her deal, or April 12 if they reject it. May’s statement blaming lawmakers for the Brexit crisis was received sourly by members of her own party as well as opposition parties, many of whom argue it is their duty to vote against May’s deal as it is bad for the country. Sam Gyimah, who resigned as a minister in May’s government last year in protest against her Brexit deal, called her speech “Toxic.”",More Than 5 Million People Have Now Signed a Petition for U.K. Government to Cancel Brexit,"Updated: March 22, 2019 9:59 AM ET | Originally published: March 21, 2019"

Pine,"For the April 1, 2019, International cover of TIME, we reached out to Ruby Jones, a 25-year-old artist from Wellington, New Zealand, to capture the feeling from inside her country in the days following the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch. “This cover image symbolizes the strength that I am seeing and feeling right now in the world. And how tragedies like the terrorist attack in Christchurch do nothing but bring us closer together as a society,” says Jones, whose TIME cover image includes 50 stars, one for each victim of the tragedy. “I was thinking how important a time it is, now more than ever, to be standing together in this world. We can acknowledge that we are all different, every single one of us—we come from different countries, different cultures, different religions, different upbringings, but at the end of the day none of us know what we are doing on this planet,” Jones says. Right after the attack on Christchurch, Jones, who grew up in Dunedin, created a piece of artwork for her Instagram page that went viral as a symbol of the nation’s need to heal. “[The response] has been pretty overwhelming. I’ve received thousands of heartfelt messages from all over the world, from Pakistan to Norway; from Bangladesh to Paris. A lot of people in New Zealand have thanked me for putting their grief into an image when they couldn’t find the words themselves. And from the Muslim community worldwide, they have told me how much it means to them to see themselves in the image and to be represented.” Her original drawing was also left by mourners at memorials and printed on posters throughout New Zealand. “This sort of thing just doesn’t happen in our tiny, peaceful country so I don’t think anyone here knows quite how to deal with what has happened,” says Jones. “One thing that is very clear though is how much love there is amongst the people here, and how absolutely determined we are to not let this change the way we live.” Read TIME’s International cover story here.",The Story Behind TIME's Christchurch Cover,"Updated: March 22, 2019 10:40 AM ET | Originally published: March 21, 2019"
1232,Charlie Campbell/Christchurch,"A few years back, some members of Christchurch’s Linwood mosque suggested installing security cameras outside. Anwar Alisaisy thought they were being ridiculous. Since immigrating to New Zealand from the Kurdish region of Iran in 2002, he’d seen no sign of trouble–not at the hairdresser’s where he worked nor at the mosque directly across the street where he prayed every Friday. “I said, ‘Nobody steals from the mosque. There’s no extremists,'” says Alisaisy. “New Zealand is the safest place.” The father of six recalled this while standing at a length of police tape near the house of worship that is now a crime scene. He had been inside on March 15 when a white supremacist showed up with a carload of guns and a video camera on his helmet. “He was standing by the doorway shooting, and I fled to the back room,” says Alisaisy. “Children were crying, women yelling, and we could hear him keeping on shooting.” The safety of a South Pacific island nation was not the only illusion destroyed that day. Also undone was the popular conception of international terrorism. The Christchurch attacks on two mosques that took at least 50 lives established white supremacy as a threat to Western societies nearly as formidable as terrorism carried out in the name of fundamentalist Islam–and one that, if anything, appears to draw even more oxygen from the Internet. Long pigeonholed as “homegrown” or “domestic” terrorism, the violence of right-wing extremists emerged in remote New Zealand as a transnational threat. Here, a widely traveled and heavily armed Australian invoked white nationalism in the name of an international campaign against immigration. The magnitude of the attacks would have thrown the spotlight onto rightist extremism even if the killer had not streamed them on Facebook Live. Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s Prime Minister, told TIME that governments around the world needed to “take a united front on what is a global issue,” especially in tackling the places on the Internet where radicalization takes root. In national-security circles, there were calls for governments to share intelligence on right-wing extremists “in ways previously reserved for groups like the Islamic State,” as three veteran U.S. counterterrorism officials wrote on the Lawfare blog. Adding to the urgency are indications that right-wing extremists have been emboldened by political leaders expressing the same xenophobia and intolerance. “This attack has been brewing for some time,” says Clarke Jones, a terrorism expert at Australian National University. The attacker’s online expressions of rage against nonwhite, non-Christian immigrants, he says, were “being nearly endorsed by political rhetoric around banning immigration of Muslims and criminalizing refugees.”   The New Zealand attacks may offer a new window into how we think about terrorism. To Americans, the word has been synonymous with Sept. 11, 2001–shock attacks that came literally out of the blue and were carried out in the name of a faith that most Americans did not know firsthand.",The New Zealand Attacks Show How White Supremacy Went From a Homegrown Issue to a Global Threat,"March 21, 2019"
1233,Amy Gunia,"Authorities on both sides of the border have failed to stop the trafficking of hundreds of women from Myanmar to China, says a new report released by Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Thursday. The 112-page report, titled Give Us a Baby and We’ll Let You Go: Trafficking of Kachin ‘Brides’ from Myanmar to China, documents anecdotal evidence from 37 victims of the trafficking trade who later escaped, and several families of trafficking victims. The women, originating from Myanmar’s northern Shan and Kachin States, were typically sold for between $3,000 to $13,000 after being lured across the border by the promise of good jobs. Many of the victims testify to being locked up, raped and forced to bear the children of their captors. The report’s author says that China’s now abolished one-child policy, which began in 1979, is a major cause of the current trafficking crisis because it created a gender imbalance in China. Forced to have only one child, Chinese parents often abandoned female babies or had sex-selective abortions in favor of males, leading to a shortfall in the female population of an estimated 30 to 40 million. “We’re seeing now what the long-term consequences are and one of those is the struggle for Chinese men who want to get married and the way that’s created a market for trafficked women and girls,” Heather Barr, who is also the acting co-director of the women’s rights division at HRW, told TIME. The problem has been exacerbated by financial desperation of women in Myanmar’s northern border region. Years of conflict between Myanmar’s government and those fighting for independence for the mostly Christian Kachin ethnic minority have left over 100,000 people internally displaced in the country’s northernmost states. It is reported that the country’s government has blocked humanitarian aid from getting to camps for internally displaced people. The report says that while displaced people may receive some food, it is “often not enough to avoid hunger.” One camp director told the NGO that each family might only receive two cups of rice per family per day, and employment opportunities are few and far between. Read More: Inside the Kachin War Against Burma While numbers are hard to pinpoint, the Myanmar government reported 226 cases of trafficking in 2017 while the Myanmar Department of Social Welfare says they assist between 100 to 200 women who return to Myanmar from China each year, according to HRW. But it is likely that the number of women being trafficked is much higher.","A Shortage of Women in China Has Led to the Trafficking of ‘Brides’ From Myanmar, Says a Report","March 21, 2019"
1234,Ian Bremmer,"Thirteen European countries have already declared themselves open for Chinese business, but the 14th has both Brussels and Washington on edge. Chinese President Xi Jinping is traveling to Rome in late March to officially welcome Italy into his ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese-backed plan to unite East and West with railways, ports, tunnels and other infrastructure projects and transform China’s economic strength at home into undisputed geopolitical power abroad. While China has already made inroads into various Eastern European countries, signing up Italy–the euro zone’s third largest economy and a G-7 member–has pushed concerns about China’s potential to splinter Europe from the periphery to the core, literally and figuratively. On March 12, the E.U.’s executive body published a paper branding China a “systemic rival” and urging stronger oversight of its investments in Europe. Even the White House has telegraphed its concerns, with a spokesperson commenting that there’s “no need for the Italian government to lend legitimacy to China’s infrastructure vanity project.” But absent an alternative proposed by Washington or the E.U., Italy is set to become the first G-7 country to enroll in China’s signature foreign policy initiative, one that takes square aim at a post–World War II geopolitical order that’s already unraveling. This is not the first time worries about the relations between specific E.U. countries and foreign powers have raised alarm; Russia has also made overtures to certain European countries. But the European leadership could rely on the fact that the E.U.’s combined economic heft far outweighed whatever meager economic benefits Russia’s submerging economy had to offer. Brussels cannot say the same about Beijing. The concern in Brussels is exacerbated by the knowledge that U.S. President Donald Trump will soon turn his sights to Europe, once his trade war with Xi reaches a conclusion. European politicians have begun bracing for auto tariffs from Washington, which look poised to hit as the global economy begins slowing down. And the U.S.’s recent threat to withhold intelligence from allies who sign up for 5G equipment from China’s state-championed Huawei signals that Washington will not hesitate to force European allies to choose between Uncle Sam and the Chinese. That would be a difficult choice even if Chinese investment were being pitted against a transatlantic relationship that was alive, well and supported by common U.S.-E.U. values. In fact, the relationship is on life support. And when China offers carrots while the U.S. offers only sticks, the choice for governments in Europe–especially populist, nonconformist ones like in Rome–is made all the easier. Other G-7 countries will be watching closely to see if there’s any U.S. pushback against Italy. China, meanwhile, gets to demonstrate yet again that it is capable of driving the global agenda, while providing a type of stability and largesse that its only other genuine geopolitical rival is no longer interested in offering. The Italian government gets to show that it is beholden to neither Brussels nor Washington, burnishing its antiestablishment credentials in the process.","China Welcomes Italy Into Its Sphere Of Influence, Unnerving the E.U. and U.S.","March 21, 2019"
1235,Joseph Hincks,"During Mid-March demonstrations against abject living conditions in the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-led government cracked down on residents of the 140-sq.-mi. enclave, prompting condemnation from human-rights organizations. As cell-phone footage circulated online showing security forces clubbing protesters, a U.N. envoy said March 17 that Gaza’s “long-suffering people” should have the right to express economic grievances without fear of reprisal. The Islamist group Hamas has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, when it fought a brief civil war against the secular Fatah party. In the past, protests over living conditions and human rights have targeted the West Bank–based Fatah–which says Hamas beat up its spokesman in the March clashes–and Israel, whose 12-year air, land and sea blockade has strangled the Gazan economy. (Israel blames Gaza’s poverty on Hamas’ corruption and mismanagement.) The sustained “We want to live” protests, which began March 14, marked a rare challenge to Hamas leaders. Under slogans like “Revolt of the hungry,” hundreds demonstrated against hikes in the prices of basic goods–devastating changes in a place where about half the 2 million residents live in poverty. Economists say the increases were driven by Hamas’ raising import taxes in a bid to revive Gaza’s collapsed economy. Authorities arrested dozens, raided homes and used live fire to disperse crowds, rights groups say. The U.N. voiced concern over the “brutal beating of journalists.” March 14 separately saw the launch of two rockets fired from Gaza toward Tel Aviv–the first time the Israeli city has been targeted since 2014. In response, Israel’s military said, it struck 100 sites in Gaza but also agreed with Hamas that the rockets had been fired by mistake. Many had feared an even larger retaliation by Israel, but analysts said both sides worked to prevent escalation: Israel because it wants to avoid instability ahead of April 9 elections, and Hamas because it cannot afford to do otherwise.

Tasnime Akunjee, a solicitor for the family of Shamima Begum, said the revocation violates the European convention on human rights. “We are arguing the decision is wrong because it renders Shamima Begum stateless, it puts her life at risk, exposes her to inhumane and degrading treatment, and breaches her right to family life,” Akunjee told the Guardian. British Home Secretary Sajid Javid wrote in a letter to Begum’s family that he believed that because Begum’s parents are Bangladeshi, she would be eligible to apply for citizenship in Bangladesh. But the country’s ministry of foreign affairs has said that there was “no question” of her being allowed into Bangladesh. Begum fled her London home in February 2015 and escaped to Syria with two other girls from her school after being radicalized online. She was 15 at the time. She subsequently married a Dutch terrorist fighter and had three children, all of whom have died through illness and malnutrition. Begum told a journalist at a refugee camp in in February that she wanted to return to the U.K. so she could care for her third baby, but that child died in early March at about a month old. The family’s appeal states that the decision to strip Begum of her citizenship is unfair because hundreds of U.K. citizens who went to I.S. territory have been allowed back into Britain. “The government has accepted that 400 people have picked up a gun and actively fought for Isis and then been allowed back to Britain,” Akunjee said. “So how can it be proportionate for a 19-year-old girl who had a child not to be allowed to return, when the others have been allowed to return?”",The Family of Shamima Begum Is Appealing the U.K. Government's Decision to Revoke Her Citizenship,"March 21, 2019"

With their chants echoing down the streets, they were among an estimated 1.6 million students in over 120 countries who left school on March 15 in protest of adult inaction on climate change. “It shocks me how great a length we have to go to be heard,” said 16-year-old Miranda Ashby, who’d traveled more than two hours to London with roughly 50 of her classmates. “We are protesting now because if not now, when?” The school climate strikes started with teen activist Greta Thunberg standing vigil outside Sweden’s parliament one Friday last August. “When I first started this strike, I didn’t really expect anything,” Thunberg told TIME on March 14, shortly after Norwegian lawmakers nominated her for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Thunberg’s idea has grown into a global movement; the March 15 action was its biggest yet. Extensive coverage of the strikes by media outlets and individuals on social media have helped elevate the cause in the minds of people across the world. Meanwhile, the lack of a centralized organizational hub makes it easy for teenagers to arrange actions in their own towns and cities; rallies took place in more than 2,200 towns and cities worldwide on March 15. “We’re tired of waiting for politicians to care,” says Nosrat Fareha, an organizer for the Sydney strikes, where 30,000 young people turned out — more than three times Fareha’s expected estimate. In Uganda, where drought and desertification are already devastating, the walk-out took place despite officials blocking strikers from an intended rally location in Kampala. “I realized that my country has to change too,” 14-year-old organizer Leah Namugerwa says. And in the U.S., 17-year-old Feliquan Charlemagne, National Creative Director of the U.S. movement, believes the energy of March for Our Lives, the 2018 student-led initiative for gun control, must be harnessed for this cause too. Born in the Caribbean island of St Thomas, Charlemagne and his family have personally suffered the powerful effects of climate change, after Hurricane Irma devastated the island in September 2017. “This is not something we can play around with,” he says. “This is literally our future.” It’s also their present. The warning of the landmark October 2018 report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that the planet was only 12 years away from catastrophe unless “far-reaching and unprecedented changes” are taken, weighs heavily on the minds of young organizers, who are quick to point out that they are the ones who have to live in that world. The deadline means there’s a lot of work to be done, and they don’t have time to wait to grow up first. Their most pressing hope is for immediate policy measures to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement, limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5° celsius this century, as well as specific local action. In Australia, campaigners want to halt the proposed construction of a controversial coal mine. For activists across the U.S., preservation of public lands and political implementation of the Green New Deal are top priorities. And in the U.K., organizers want a fair portrayal of the climate crisis in school curricula and government information. And they’ve had some success already: youth organizers have met with members of the European Parliament and their strikes have been welcomed by leaders including Angela Merkel and U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres. “It really has changed the discourse,” says Sini Harkki, program manager at Greenpeace Nordic.  But at least for now, that’s all they can change; the youth that draws them to the cause is also an obstacle. Most of the movement’s participants are not just battling the obvious challenges of political inertia, powerful fossil fuel lobbies and disbelieving critics—they are also too young to play a bigger role in business or politics. And so they are determined to continue the Friday strikes. The U.K. Student Climate Network is demanding a meeting with political leaders, U.S. activists are planning a mass strike for May 3 and a pan-European organizer meeting is also in the pipeline. And Thunberg, no longer on her own, is committed to striking every Friday until Sweden reduces its carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. “I know I have something to say,” Thunberg says, referring to her frank speeches in front of international leaders. “I have a message I want to get out and I want people to listen.” Students worldwide have heard her loud and clear.

1240,Billy Perrigo,"Before opening fire on worshippers at two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch last Friday, killing 50 and wounding many more, the far-right terrorist who carried out the attack uploaded a post to an anonymous online message board called 8chan. “Well lads, it’s time to stop shitposting and time to make a real life effort post,” he wrote, shortly before live-streaming the massacre on Facebook. Then, addressing 8chan’s denizens, he added a request: “Please do your part by spreading my message, making memes and shitposting as you usually do.” His appeal was heeded by a decentralized, international network of white supremacists and their sympathizers, many of them users of anonymous message boards like 8chan, who proceeded to repost copies of the horrific video to sites like Facebook and YouTube. More than 1.5 million copies of the video were uploaded to Facebook within 24 hours, with 300,000 bypassing its upload filter to appear for users as young as 13 years-old to watch. YouTube did not release numbers, but told the Guardian the uploading was “unprecedented both in scale and speed — at times as fast as a new upload every second.” The shocking repost campaign illustrated not only the unprecedented reach of online white supremacist networks, but also how they have learned to exploit new tools offered by the large, ill-equipped social media platforms in order to spread messages of hatred online.  The white supremacist ideology espoused by the New Zealand terrorist has been a fringe conspiracy theory for decades, but the Internet has given it unprecedented reach and pushed it into mainstream political discourse. The trend began as early as the 1980s, when white supremacists recognized that they could get around constraints imposed by gatekeepers in the traditional media by posting their own resources on the web. In the 1990s, new anonymous message boards became spaces where users could post whatever text, images and links they wanted, with no usernames to tie a post to the person posting it. That allowed people to “say disgusting things, post violent and horrible images, link to disgusting videos and blogs, all without any fear that their personal relationships would be disrupted,” says Joan Donovan, a Harvard researcher on white supremacist online networks. “That format really incentivizes some of the worst kinds of behavior and disgusting kinds of content.” These sites, initially forums populated by privacy-minded, tech-savvy users looking to have fun online, quickly became spaces where irony-laden memes, jokes and discussions mixed with increasingly sinister racism and misogyny. The most popular was 4chan, founded in 2003 and still online today. “4chan was certainly problematic” in the early days, says Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University, who has been following the development of “chan culture” for years. “But it didn’t have a clear politics the way we think of it as having a clear politics now.” Today, 4chan is virtually synonymous with the far-right. But back in the 2000s and even early 2010s, Phillips says, anybody who took themselves too seriously was a target for ridicule and sometimes harassment. The turning point came in August 2014, Phillips says. That was when “Gamergate” took off — a harassment campaign targeting female video-gamers, coordinated partly on 4chan by users who were furious about what they saw as the unacceptable influence of progressive values, including feminism, over video-gaming culture.",The New Zealand Attack Exposed How White Supremacy Has Long Flourished Online,"March 20, 2019"
1241,Shaparak Shajarizadeh,"The lawyer who saved my life was just sentenced to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes in Iran. I first met Nasrin Sotoudeh — an internationally renowned human rights lawyer, and our country’s foremost campaigner for women’s rights and against child executions — when I was being harassed and violently intimidated by Iran’s intelligence services. My crime? I had removed my headscarf in public and put the video online, in protest of Iran’s forced hijab law and the stifling control over women’s bodies and choices that it represents. I finally felt empowered, being part of this White Wednesday movement in Iran, where every Wednesday women would courageously defy the regime in removing their headscarves, or wearing a white shawl in support of those who did, and which quickly grew into a near daily event. I was an ordinary woman, partaking in an extraordinary movement. For this, I would go on to be arrested a total of three times last year. I was beaten and brutalized in prison, my only breaks from the psychological torture of solitary confinement. It was the most frightening experience of my life — not just the pain — but that I felt so alone, suffering in solitude. But then Nasrin showed up. She told me that my struggle is her struggle — the struggle of all Iranian women — that I am not alone, and that she would not relent until I am free. Knowing Nasrin was there for me gave me solace and sustained me through it all. She courageously protested, spoke to the media, and navigated the complex and opaque Iranian legal system on my behalf. After my third arrest and imprisonment for removing my headscarf, I was told by Iranian Intelligence that when (rather than if) I’m convicted I would never see my 8-year-old son Barbad again. They had already detained Barbad with me the last time; seeing him in handcuffs broke my heart. So when Nasrin got me out on bail, I immediately fled the country with my son, and my trial proceeded without me. Nasrin informed me that throughout the trial, the judge refused to hear my side and had already made his mind up. My fate was predetermined, as it had been for so many of the women who stood trial before me. However, unlike those women — and thanks to Nasrin — I was safely outside the country with my son when my 20-year sentence was handed down. Today, I live in exile in Canada, where I am seeking asylum. As dramatic and draconian an outcome it may seem, Nasrin was unsurprised, given her experience representing human rights defenders in Iran. She had understood that such cases could not be won in the courthouse, but only in the court of public opinion. That is why she revealed my prosecutor’s name to the press and exposed his record of repression, demonstrating that he was more a persecutor than a prosecutor. Nasrin was then herself arrested in June, three days after representing me at my trial. This persecutor had sought his revenge, and filed a criminal complaint against her for her courageous conduct in my case. Intelligence officers showed up unannounced at her home and brought her to the notorious Evin prison in Tehran. While her initial arrest was based on the complaint of the prosecutor in my case, once they had her in detention, further false and fantastical charges were added.",This Iranian Lawyer Saved My Life.

1242,Mahita Gajanan,"An Italian politician who opposed mandatory childhood vaccinations was recently hospitalized with chickenpox. Massimiliano Fedriga, who is part of the far-right League party, was under observation for four days earlier this month after getting chickenpox, according to local news reports. It’s an ironic twist in fate for Fedriga, who opposed the introduction of the so-called Lorenzin law that made it mandatory for children to receive certain vaccinations for diseases including chickenpox, measles, mumps, polio and rubella. Parents can be fined up to $560 if they send their children to school unvaccinated. In opposing the law, Fedriga argued that parents shouldn’t be “coerced” into vaccinating their children, The Independent reports. He said in an interview with an Italian outlet that the Democratic Party, which was the largest member of the coalition government at the time, was “Stalinist” for trying to “impose” the policy. Following his chickenpox contraction, Fedriga claimed in a Facebook post that he does not oppose vaccines and that his children are vaccinated. “I have always said that I am in favour of vaccines, but to achieve the result it is necessary to have an alliance with families not imposition,” he wrote. Robert Burioni, an Italian microbiologist, said in a Facebook post that he hopes Fedriga contracting chickenpox will impact other parents who are skeptical of vaccinations. “If he had infected a pregnant woman we would be facing a malformed child or an abortion,” Burioni wrote. “The only way we have to avoid these tragedies is to inoculate everyone to prevent the circulation of this dangerous virus, which could have hit a much more vulnerable person.”",Italian Politician Who Opposed Mandatory Vaccinations Contracts Chickenpox,"March 20, 2019"

The tablet was handed over to Iraqi Ambassador Salih Husain Ali during a ceremony Tuesday, putting an end to years of legal work following an initial discovery at London’s Heathrow Airport in 2012. “It is a very important piece of Iraq’s cultural heritage,” said British Museum director Hartwig Fischer, praising the “extraordinary and tireless work” of border officials. The tablet, known as a kudurru, records the gifting of land by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I to one of his subjects, curator Jonathan Taylor told AFP. The erosion of the stone’s surface makes it hard for historians to glean much more, however. “The basic identification is quite straightforward,” Taylor said. “More difficult is tying down exactly who the king is and what the circumstances are, for that we need to read the inscription and it’s quite worn.” “There’s a lot of damage in the middle of the text,” he added, referring to the carvings on one side of the stone. Depictions of two Babylonian gods, Enlil and Marduk, are on the other. The object supposedly carried “terrible curses” for anyone who tried to claim the territory or destroy the tablet.","A 3,000-Year-Old Tablet Likely Looted During the Iraq War Is Being Returned by the U.K.","March 20, 2019"
1244,Alan Levin & Harry Suhartono / Bloomberg,"As the Lion Air crew fought to control their diving Boeing Co. 737 Max 8, they got help from an unexpected source: an off-duty pilot who happened to be riding in the cockpit. That extra pilot, who was seated in the cockpit jumpseat, correctly diagnosed the problem and told the crew how to disable a malfunctioning flight-control system and save the plane, according to two people familiar with Indonesia’s investigation. The next day, under command of a different crew facing what investigators said was an identical malfunction, the jetliner crashed into the Java Sea killing all 189 aboard. The previously undisclosed detail on the earlier Lion Air flight represents a new clue in the mystery of how some 737 Max pilots faced with the malfunction have been able to avert disaster while the others lost control of their planes and crashed. The presence of a third pilot in the cockpit wasn’t contained in Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee’s Nov. 28 report on the crash and hasn’t previously been reported. The so-called dead-head pilot on the earlier flight from Bali to Jakarta told the crew to cut power to the motor driving the nose down, according to the people familiar, part of a checklist that all pilots are required to memorize. “All the data and information that we have on the flight and the aircraft have been submitted to the Indonesian NTSC. We can’t provide additional comment at this stage due the ongoing investigation on the accident,” Lion Air spokesman Danang Prihantoro said by phone.

Colbert began his opening monologue on a more serious note than his usual jokes, sending his condolences to those who belonged to the Al Noor and Linwood mosques, as well as the people of New Zealand. He then addressed Trump’s reaction to the shootings, after reviewing comments made by New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who asked of Trump in the wake of the tragedy to “send sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.” “Trump has trouble showing love for things that are not him, and he has a particularly bad record with Muslims,” Colbert said. “So he’s in a bind. On the one hand, after a terror attack to condemn the extremist ideology of the terrorist should be a slam-dunk. On the other hand, he can’t jump.” Colbert later turned to comments made by Trump’s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney during an interview with Fox News Sunday. To Mulvaney’s statement, “The president is not a white supremacist…I’m not sure how many times we have to say that,” Colbert rejoined by saying “having to say it once is a problem.” Later, revisiting another assertion that Mulvaney made about Trump where he claimed, “I don’t think anybody could say that the president is anti-Muslim,” Colbert didn’t even try to be glib about his thoughts on the matter, offering up this jab: “The president is anti-Muslim.” Watch Colbert’s take on Donald Trump’s response to the New Zealand shootings below.

1250,Ciara Nugent,"Representatives of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó said Monday they had seized three diplomatic properties in the U.S. previously used by the government of President Nicolás Maduro, as the two men continue their tug of war over the South American country. Carlos Vecchio, Guaidó’s main envoy in the U.S, told reporters in Washington that they had taken control of two defense buildings in the city and one consular building in New York, adding that they expected to take over the Venezuelan embassy in Washington “in the coming days.” Guaidó has been locked in a stand-off with Maduro since January 23, when he launched a claim on the presidency, saying Maduro’s second term, won in rigged elections last year amid a sprawling economic, political and humanitarian crisis, is illegitimate. Guaidó’s supporters say that, as head of Venezuela’s parliament, the constitution mandates that he take charge if there is a power vacuum in Venezuela. More than 50 countries, including the U.S., have recognized Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader and he has appointed a parallel government, including overseas diplomats. Maduro retains the support of key allies Russia and China, as well as of the Venezuelan military. On Twitter Guaidó said that the aim of taking over the diplomatic properties was to “strengthen bilateral relations [with the U.S.] and to better serve the Venezuelan community in the country.” Venezuela’s embassy and consulates in the U.S. have been closed to the public since January, when Maduro broke off relations with the U.S. in the wake of the Trump administration’s recognition of Guaidó as president. In Washington, Vecchio removed a portrait of Nicolás Maduro from one building, replacing it with one of Guaidó. In New York, Guaidó’s representatives removed locks from the doors of the consulate and hung a sign in the window reading “Soon we will open the doors of this consulate. So that all of us can return home,” according to CNN footage. In a statement, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said it “denounces the forced occupation of its headquarters by people […] who are acting as agents of the U.S., in favor of its political interests” and called on the U.S. government to “fulfil their legal obligations and take necessary measures to undo the occupation.”",Venezuelan Opposition Take Over Diplomatic Offices in the U.S.,"March 19, 2019"

The 1,100-pound whale, found Saturday in the town of Mabini, had more than 40 pounds of plastic bags inside its stomach. D’Bone Collector Museum, a nonprofit organization that aims to retrieve and preserve wildlife, identified the mammal as a male curvier beaked whale in a Facebook post. “This whale had the most plastic we have ever seen in a whale. It’s disgusting,” the post read. The museum added that they also found 16 rice sacks, four banana plantation-style bags and multiple shopping bags during the necropsy. “The plastic in some areas was so compact it was almost becoming calcified, almost like a solid brick,” Darrell Blatchley, president of the museum, told the Times. In April 2018, a 33-foot sperm whale was found dead on a Spanish beach with more than 60 pounds of garbage in its digestive system, and a few months later, in June, a pilot whale died in southern Thailand after eating more than 80 plastic bags. When whales ingest plastic, it gives them a sense of fullness without providing any essential nutrients. This leads to reduced weight, energy and swimming speed, increasing their vulnerability when pursued by predators. The Philippines is the third-largest source of discarded plastic that ends up in the ocean, just behind two other Asian nations, China and Indonesia, according to a 2015 report released by Ocean Conservancy and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment. The report adds that these countries have benefitted from significant increases in GDP and living standards in recent decades, yet the waste-management infrastructure needed to cope with heightened demand for consumer products has fallen behind.",88 Pounds of Plastic Were Found Inside a Dead Whale in the Philippines,"March 19, 2019"
1255,Ciara Nugent,"On January 1, Carlos Chamorro, one of Nicaragua’s most prominent journalists, packed his bags and snuck across the border with his wife. For months, he says, security forces from President Daniel Ortega’s authoritarian regime had been ramping up pressure on him and his colleagues to stop covering the political crisis that has gripped the Central American country of 6 million people since last April. In October, police set up a checkpoint outside his home, interrogating him whenever he stepped out. In December, they raided the offices of Confidencial and Esta Semana, the newspaper and television show that Chamorro, 63, has led for more than 20 years. As the New Year approached, sources told him authorities were planning to arrest him and fabricate a criminal case. “The aim is clearly dictatorial,” he tells TIME from exile in Costa Rica. “They think they can silence us.” Over the past 11 months, since mass protests broke out against Ortega’s regime, the government has launched a widespread crackdown on free expression and critical media organizations. On March 7, the director of the Inter-American Press Society condemned Ortega’s “rigorous, schematic and systematic pressure” on the press and the “suffocation” of some outlets.  The targeting of journalists feels grimly familiar for Chamorro. In 1978 his father, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro, also a famous newspaper editor, was assassinated by the regime of right-wing dictator Anastasio Somoza. Back then, Ortega was the leader of the leftwing Sandinista Liberation Front, an armed resistance group fighting Somoza’s regime. Chamorro’s murder was a major factor in turning public opinion and bringing down the regime a year later. Ortega led a transition government for five years before being elected to a six year term in 1984. While in office, the leftist redistributed lands, expanded public healthcare, and fought off the Contras—right-wing rebels that the U.S. funded and trained as part of its attempt to stop the spread of Communism during the Cold War. (Chamorro’s mother, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, was president from 1990 to 1997 after defeating Ortega in elections.) But in recent years, critics and human rights groups say Ortega has become the kind of strongman he once fought to overthrow. After being re-elected in 2006, he pushed through changes to Nicaragua’s constitution that allow him to run for extra terms and make it harder for the opposition to win elections. Some voters and opposition parties boycotted the 2016 election, which Ortega won with his wife Rosario Murillo as his running mate. Many also accuse Ortega of corruption and of entering controversial alliances with businesses leaders, allowing them to dictate economic and labor policy. Meanwhile, the media had to operate under tight restrictions; in 2017 the Organization of American States found that journalists were experiencing intimidation, indirect censorship and a lack of access to public information and government events. For all that, Chamorro says the regime “still tolerated criticism” from the press. “That’s precisely because they didn’t feel threatened. The government wasn’t really facing political or social opposition because it had been crushed, coopted, made illegal.”  That changed on April 18, when a small student-led protest against planned cuts to social security programs met with violent repression by police and paramilitary gangs. More protests broke out, quickly morphing into widespread calls for Ortega’s resignation.  “Immediately, we got a taste of what was to come,” Chamorro says of the crackdown on the press that began as Ortega sensed his grip on power weakening. The government ordered cable providers to take four independent news channels off the air, police and pro-government gangs beat up reporters and stole equipment from camera men. A radio reporter was struck in the head by a stick while broadcasting protesters’ clashes with the gangs on Facebook Live. Angel Gaona, a TV news reporter, was fatally shot in the head.  By the time the regime outlawed public protest in September, “effectively imposing an unofficial state of emergency,” according to Chamorro, more than 350 people had been killed — mostly by security forces and pro-government paramilitaries. Since then, Ortega has used the full force of the police and judicial system to try and stifle dissent. Political activists have been sentenced to hundreds of years in prison. In December Miguel Mora, the owner of news channel 100% Noticias, was arrested along with his news director, Lucía Pineda. Both were charged with terrorism and fomenting violence through their coverage. (They deny the charges). Their hearing has been repeatedly delayed. On March 18 a judge said it would take place on April 29. The pair remain in custody.",'They Think They Can Silence Us.' How Nicaragua is Waging a War on Journalists,"March 18, 2019"

But perhaps presuming that a set of live tortoises would pass inspection as confections of the cake variety was pushing expectations a bit too far. That’s certainly the case for one man, who was apprehended earlier in March in Berlin’s Schönefeld airport after customs officials discovered he was carrying three tortoises placed in a cake box with clear plastic windows, their distinctive shells obvious to any onlooker. According to translations of the press release shared by the airport, the passenger — a 69-year-old German national traveling back from Cairo Egypt — attempted to convince airport security officials the tortoises were highly realistic-looking “chocolate” tortoises after they stopped him moving through the “nothing to declare” line. His contention turned out to be quite a lie: “When opening the packaging, the customs officers found instead of sweets, however, three living specimens of Moroccan tortoise,” the release notes. Moroccan tortoises are an endangered species, and were promptly confiscated by airport security and placed “in the care of a border veterinarian,” according to the airport. Animal trafficking is a serious crime, and if convicted, the passenger could be looking at a fine of as much as €50,000 — over $55,000 — or a five-year prison sentence.

The latest way Google has enlivened the search page is by giving props to the globally influential Japanese inventor Seiichi Miyake, a man who changed mobility as we know it when he made the world a more accessible place by creating tactile pavement. The late innovator created the canary yellow so-called “braille blocks,” or Tenji blocks, to line the roads with cleverly designed slabs that benefit people on the street who are blind or have visual impairments. The idea was simple but genius: let the bumpy street be your guide. The raised bumps, which you can feel through your shoes or with a walking cane, were a language of their own. The textured design usually maps out as follows: A straight bar helps direct people toward safe zones, while elevated domes warn that there’s treacherous traffic to avoid. The project was personal for Miyake. It all began when he started working on the design out of pocket to simplify getting around for his friend who was losing his sight back in the ’60s, Google’s Doodle blog tells us. And to make maneuvering around public spaces better for everybody, the first tactile pavement popped up in 1965 in Japan, and then in 1967 near the Okayama School for the Blind in Okayma City. Tokyo and Osaka followed suit in subsequent years as Japan really ran with the modification, even going so far as to require that train stations to roll it out on platforms.

Another person died after being transported to a hospital. Thirty-four people among the 50 injured remain in Christchurch Hospital, including 12 in intensive care.

Will Connolly, 17, rose to fame when a video of him throwing an egg at the back of Queensland Senator Fraser Anning’s head while talking to reporters Saturday went viral. Anning sparked outrage when he blamed shootings in two New Zealand mosques on Friday that left 50 people dead and 36 people hospitalized on immigration. “The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place,” Anning said in a statement following the shootings. In a recording of the incident, Connolly can be seen walking up behind the senator before raising his phone to take a video as he throws an egg at the back of the senator’s head. Anning reacts by turning around and punching the teen. Support for the teen, who the internet dubbed “Egg Boy,” flooded social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. As of Monday, the GoFundMe campaign page titled “Money for EggBoi” had over 2,400 donations from people sending messages of support to Connolly, like “you are a good egg” and “omletting you know I think you’re eggcellent.” According to the platform’s website, “EggBoi (Will) plans to send a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack.” The fundraiser is not the only attention the teen has received.

Duterte’s decision became final over the weekend when the Supreme Court of the Philippines declined to grant an injunction requested by a group of human rights activists. Duterte had announced plans to leave the organization after the ICC  announced a preliminary investigation into allegations that he and his government have committed crimes against humanity and mass murder during his so-called war on drugs. Romel Bagares, a lawyer for the rights activists, called the decision “a terrible setback in the long fight against impunity in the country,” according the New York Times, adding that the ICC was the country’s last resort given that the government has failed to stop thousands of deaths in Duterte’s bloody drug war. Duterte began a crackdown against the sale and use of illegal drugs shortly after taking office in 2016. Critics have accused Duterte of using the campaign, which has reportedly killed thousands of people, as cover for a politically motivated attempt to consolidate power and silence his opponents. Just last week, the president of the Philippines publicly named 46 politicians who he says are involved in the drug trade. Amnesty International condemned the Philippines’ ICC departure in a statement on its website. “The cynical withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC is a futile attempt to evade international justice and to halt the ICC’s work,” the statement said.

The Kumeu Militaria Show, billed as the largest gun show in the country, was scheduled to take place this Saturday. Organizers said the event was cancelled “in respect for the victims” of the shooting and due to “elevated security risks.” The show attracts thousands of attendees yearly and has been held at the Kumea Showgrounds since 2014.

In the post’s comments, a number of social media users credited the organizers for the decision and said it was the right thing to do.

1264,Alejandro de la Garza,"Among the victims killed in the horrific shootings at two Christchurch, New Zealand, mosques on March 15 are a goalkeeper for the national futsal team, a Pakistani academic who tried to stop the gunman and dozens of others, many of them immigrants to New Zealand. 50 people were killed in the attacks, which were carried out as the victims gathered at the two mosques for Friday prayers. 36 more are still in the hospital, with 11 in critical condition, according to New Zealand Police. The attack is the deadliest in New Zealand’s modern history, and its apparent ties to a toxic online culture of hate and extremism, have left the island nation and the rest of the world reeling. Here’s what we know about the victims so far: Father and son Naeem Rashid, 50, and Talha Rashid, 21, were two of nine Pakistanis killed in Friday’s mosque attacks, according to a statement released by the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Naeem Rashid’s brother, Dr. Khurshid Alam, told CNN that Rashid was an academic who had spent the past seven years living in New Zealand. Rashid was killed while trying to tackle the gunman, according to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, and the Pakistani government plans to recognize his bravery with a posthumous award. “We stand ready to extend all our support to the families of Pakistani victims of the terrorist attack in Christchurch,” Pakistan’s Prime Minister tweeted. “Pakistan is proud of Mian Naeem Rashid who was martyred trying to tackle the White Supremacist terrorist.” Among the seven other Pakistani nationals killed were Sohail Shahid, Syed Jahandad Ali, Syed Areeb Ahmed and Mahboob Haroon Pakistan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Shah Mahmood Qureshi tweeted.",These Are the Victims of the New Zealand Mosque Shootings,"March 17, 2019"
1265,Olivia B. Waxman,"In the aftermath of the Friday massacre at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, a clear profile of the gunman is still being put together — but the man charged with murder appears to have posted a manifesto online before the shooting, writing: “For once, the person that will be called a fascist, is an actual fascist.” The link between fascism and religiously and racially-motivated violence is one of the constants of the 100-year existence of fascism, say experts on its history. At the same time, the suspect’s apparent declaration highlights a recent and troubling change in the idea’s place in the world. Almost exactly a century ago, on March 23, 1919, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini started a group called the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento, which led to the founding of the original National Fascist Party in 1921. He became Prime Minister a year later, and by 1925, he had ushered in the world’s first fascist dictatorship. The world is greatly changed since then, but the approach of violently attacking people perceived to be enemies remains a thread throughout the history of the idea on which Mussolini seized. “In its essence, fascism is violence against people who you target as enemies,” says Ruth Ben-Ghiat, an expert on fascism and Professor of Italian and History at New York University. “You don’t discuss with your enemies, you just use violence against them, and this is how fascism rose to power in Italy.” Specifically, Ben-Ghiat says, fascist governments and groups target people who threaten their power. From the beginning, that idea has been tied to threats to white supremacy; Mussolini himself was preoccupied with the idea that white people in Italy were dying out and being replaced by the minority groups who were the targets of his hatred. “One core of fascism that hasn’t changed is this creation of a sense of emergency around whiteness,” she says. “If we don’t understand that racism was embedded in fascism from the start, we are getting an incomplete picture.” Mussolini attracted followers, mostly veterans of World War I and businessmen, by encouraging the systematic assault and killing of socialists, who were viewed as disloyal for having opposed the war and whom factory-owners saw as a threat to their power over labor. Mussolini’s regime also targeted people in Italy’s African colonies in the 1930s and Slavs during border conflicts that ensued as Italy tried to expand its territory. While the suspected shooter seems to have been motivated by anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant sentiment, historian Robert O. Paxton, author of The Anatomy of Fascism, says Mussolini was in some ways gripped by an opposing fixation, as he was more preoccupied with who was moving away than who was coming to Italy.",What Historians of Fascism Think About the Suspected New Zealand Shooter's Declaration of Extremism,"March 17, 2019"
1266,Baris Balci / Bloomberg,"Footage of the New Zealand mosque shootings that was pulled down by Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms has resurfaced as a campaign prop in Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan screened a montage of videotaped snippets from the attack on Muslim houses of worship in an apparent attempt to galvanize his pious, conservative base ahead of March 31 local elections. At televised rallies in Istanbul and Tekirdag to the west, he showed blurred fragments of suspected attacker Brenton Tarrant’s online manifesto and his livestream from the massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, which claimed the lives of 50 people. The suspected attacker, who ranted about Turkey in his manifesto, “targeted Turkey and me,” Erdogan said. The Turkish leader then pivoted to assail the leader of Turkey’s main opposition CHP party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who was shown in the campaign video, for talking about “terrorism rooted in the Islamic world.” Erdogan invoked anti-Muslim sentiment to prod his devout supporters to close ranks at the polls amid an economic slump that’s taking a toll on the nation of 82 million. Turkey’s economy entered a technical recession last year following a crash in the lira that also sent inflation to more than five times the official target of 5 percent. In his manifesto, Tarrant railed that Turks must get out of the country’s European sector, vowing to “kill you and drive you roaches from our lands.” “We are coming for Constantinople and we will destroy every mosque and minaret in the city,” which will be “rightfuly Christian-owned once more,” he said, referring to modern-day Istanbul.

Some 200 individuals are in custody, BFM TV reported, citing Paris prosecutors. About 80 shops on the French capital’s iconic avenue were damaged, with several cases of arson and looting, Agence France-Presse reported, citing Jean-Noel Reinhardt, president of the committee of the Champs Elysees. It was the 18th consecutive Saturday of Yellow Vest protests. French President Emmanuel Macron — who cut his ski holiday short following a tour of Africa — vowed on Twitter Saturday evening that “strong decisions” were coming to prevent more violence. Macron said some individuals — dubbed “black blocs” by French police forces — were taking advantage of the protests by the Yellow Vest grassroots movement to “damage the Republic, to break, to destroy.” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Twitter that those who excused or encouraged such violence were complicit in it. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner will meet with Philippe at the French prime minister’s office at 5:30 p.m. Paris time, BFM reported. The Yellow Vests have been protesting across France since the end of November, with demands ranging from lower taxes to better public services. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, in an interview in Le Parisien on Sunday, said she wants the government to explain how it has handled security on the Champs Elysees. December saw the most violent weekends, with protests often forcing shops to shut down during the key run-up to Christmas. The movement had seemed to be losing steam in the past few weeks as Macron’s government brought in a national debate initiative, which allowed individuals and opposition parties to voice their discontent by putting forward proposals to change the status quo.

Ilhan Omar. Clinton was one of numerous public and political figures who condemned Omar’s controversial comments on Israel last month as perpetuating “anti-Semitic tropes.” Omar is one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. In a since-deleted tweet, Omar suggested that politicians only support Israel because of donations from wealthy Jewish people. Clinton called out the freshman Democrat for allegedly trafficking in anti-Semitism. “We should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism,” Clinton tweeted. In a viral video from the vigil, a student can be seen confronting Clinton for rhetoric that she says “stoked” the hatred of Muslims that led to Friday’s terror attack on two Christchurch mosques that took the lives of 49 people and injured at least 40. Twitter user @vivafalastin has claimed to be the student featured in the video. “This right here is the result of a massacre stoked by people like you and the words that you put into the world,” the student tells Clinton in the video. “And I want you to know that and I want you to feel that deeply — 49 people died because of the rhetoric you put out there.” “I’m so sorry that you feel that way,” Clinton responds. “Certainly, it was never my intention. I do believe words matter. I believe we have to show solidarity.” Prominent conservatives such as President Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and Fox News host Tucker Carlson have spoken out in support of Clinton since the video began making the online rounds. “It’s sickening to see people blame @ChelseaClinton for the NZ attacks because she spoke out against anti-Semitism,” Trump Jr. tweeted. “We should all be condemning anti-Semitism & all forms of hate.

1272,"Sharon Verghis / Sydney, Australia","Flags flew at half-mast against a grey sky over the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Saturday, as Australia tried to make sense of what just happened on the other side of the Tasman Sea. Some Muslim women ventured out of their homes only after removing their hijab. Others stayed indoors, still in a state of shock and fear. Parents struggled to explain the tragedy to children, some of whom watched it unfold; a live-stream of the atrocity was widely seen and shared, despite all efforts to stop it from spreading. The terror attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, claimed 49 lives as a man armed with semi-automatic weapons covered in white supremacist iconography opened fire inside two mosques where scores of people, including children, gathered for Friday prayers. The episode sent shock waves around the world, but it also exposed divisions over who belongs in Australia, where the suspect was born and raised. In parts of the commonwealth, academics and rights advocates say white nationalism has seen a resurgence and Islamophobia has become normalized amid the nation’s struggle to cope with immigration. Outside Australia’s multicultural urban centers, divisions can sometimes be hidden in plain sight. The rural town of Grafton, about 310 miles northeast of Sydney in New South Wales, is best known as the host of an annual festival celebrating its jacaranda trees — purple-coated canopies lining streets dotted with Victorian architecture.

New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who characterized the event as a “terrorist attack,” has said that more charges will follow. In a press conference shortly after Tarrant and three other people were arrested, Ardern said those responsible had “absolutely no place in New Zealand and in fact… no place in the world.” Her counterpart across the sea, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison, condemned the “violent, extremist, right-wing terrorist attack,” upon learning the suspected killer was bred within his country’s borders. Colleagues and neighbors say they didn’t see it coming. Tarrant attended the local high school, then got a job at the Big River Squash and Fitness Center. His former boss, the facility’s owner Tracey Gray, told the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age that he trained excessively, was dedicated to health and fitness, and didn’t show any outward sign of “extremist views” or “crazy behavior.” She said that during his employment he never seemed to run afoul of the values of the fitness industry: inclusivity, helping people of all kinds achieve their physical potential. Others were less surprised, particularly those among the Muslim community, some of whom say the political climate in Australia has become hospitable to hatred. Mariam Veiszadeh, a young Afghan-born lawyer and president of the Islamophobia Register, says she has observed a steady uptick of threats and abuse against Muslims for years. Hijab-wearing acquaintances have been verbally demeaned. A friend, walking through Sydney’s central railway station, was spat on squarely in the face. “In broad daylight,” Veiszadeh said, “with hundreds of people walking by.” Much attention has been paid, she says, to preventing the radicalization of Muslim youth, while less has been done to assess the reach and root causes of radicalization among young, disenfranchised white men. In her view, they’re two sides of the same coin. “In fact, one feeds the other,” she says.",Australia Struggles to Make Sense of Its Role in the New Zealand Massacre,"Updated: March 27, 2019 8:37 AM ET | Originally published: March 16, 2019"

1274,Shamim Adam / Bloomberg,"Australia said conservative commentator Milo Yiannopoulos won’t be allowed to enter the country for a tour this year after his comments on the mass shooting in New Zealand. The alt-right provocateur and former Breitbart journalist said on Facebook that attacks such as the one in Christchurch happened “because the establishment panders to and mollycoddles extremist leftism and barbaric, alien religious cultures.” A shooter walked into a packed mosque in the South Island city of Christchurch on Friday afternoon and opened fire on worshipers, filming and live-streaming the act to social media. He drove to another mosque and continued the massacre, killing 49 people and leaving several still fighting for their lives. “Yiannopoulos’ comments on social media regarding the Christchurch terror attack are appalling and foment hatred and division,” David Coleman, Australia’s minister for immigration, citizenship and multicultural affairs, said in a statement. “The terrorist attack in Christchurch was carried out on Muslims peacefully practicing their religion. It was an act of pure evil.” Yiannopoulos defended his comments after the ban was announced. “I explicitly denounced violence,” he said. “And I criticized the establishment for pandering to Islamic fundamentalism. So Australia banned me again.” Twitter banned Yiannopoulos, who is British but has lived in the U.S., from its platform in 2016. Earlier this month, he was granted permission to visit Australia for a speaking tour that would take place before an election in May, the Australian Associated Press reported. His trip there in December 2017 sparked violence after opposing protesters clashed outside a venue where he was speaking, the report said.",Conservative Commentator Milo Yiannopoulos Not Allowed in Australia After New Zealand Mosque Shooting Comments,"March 16, 2019"
1275,"Charlie Campbell / Christchurch, New Zealand","There was no weekend vim and bustle in Christchurch on Saturday. New Zealand’s low-slung second city was cloaked in mourning, shops shuttered and residents zombified, struggling to comprehend Friday’s mass shooting that claimed 49 lives — the worst massacre in the history of this nation of five million. Police continued to sweep for evidence outside the Al Noor mosque, where a lone gunman killed 41 people at 1:45 p.m. local time on Friday, live-streaming his barbarous crimes in ghastly detail. Seven more people were gunned down at a mosque on the other side of the city in the suburban Linwood neighborhood. One more died in hospital, where another 48 wounded are still receiving care, two in a critical condition. Children are among them. Shackled and wearing a white smock, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, appeared in court Saturday morning charged with murder. A native of Grafton, a pretty town of 17,000 some miles northeast of Sydney, he was seen to make a white supremacist hand gesture to assembled media. Assault rifles used in the massacre were daubed with the names of notorious killers of immigrants. One other 18-year-old has been charged with hate-speech though any connection to the murders is unclear. Footage emerged Saturday of the gunman’s daring capture. A police car rammed into his white SUV after it sped away from Linwood, pushing the vehicle up and onto the curb, which allowed officers to drag him onto the pavement at gunpoint. Two improvised explosive devices had been found in the car and disabled. Emergency services struggled to deal with the sheer number of victims. All appointments were canceled at Christchurch Hospital, where every available resource was turned over to surgery for the wounded. Family and friends hung around waiting for news of their loved ones. “We came here as we’re wondering who’s a casualty and who’s dead,” Mohammed Ashif, who narrowly escaped the Linwood mosque during the attack, tells TIME.

1276,Wilder Davies,"In the wake of a terror attack on two Christchurch mosques that took the lives of 49 people and injured at least 20, people have been expressing their sympathies for the victims by leaving flowers at local mosques in New Zealand and around the world. A post by New Zealand’s public broadcasting station showed flowers left outside a mosque in Auckland. Soon after, images of similar memorials at other mosques around the country began to appear on Twitter. Many of the people leaving flowers have not been Muslim themselves. Rather, the floral tributes have become a way for people to express unity and solidarity in the face of Islamophobic and anti-immigration sentiment. In London, the New Zealand War Memorial in Hyde Park Corner became a center of mourning. Several people gathered for a vigil Friday evening and to lay flowers to express their condolences. Flowers and messages of kindness have been showing up in other parts of the world as well. One mosque in Vancouver shared images of their front gates on Twitter. Many more around Europe and in the U.S. have begun to do the same.

1277,Mahita Gajanan,"The mass shooting at two mosques in the city of Christchurch in New Zealand on Friday, which killed at least 49 people, has brought the country’s gun laws into scrutiny. New Zealand is a sparsely populated peaceful nation with very little violent crime but has what are considered to be some of the most lax gun regulations in the Pacific region. Gun ownership levels are high but the rate of gun deaths has historically been low. Within 24 hours of the attacks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern made a promise to change the country’s gun laws. “I can tell you right now, our gun laws will change,” Ardern said, addressing the nation on Saturday. In an earlier address, Ardern described the shootings as “acts of extreme and unprecedented violence.” Attacks are extremely rare in the small island state which prides itself on its inclusion. “We represent diversity, kindness, compassion, a home for those who share our values, a refuge for those who need it,” added Ardern. The shooting is New Zealand’s deadliest since 1990, when 13 people were killed in the town of Aramoana. Following the attack, New Zealand tightened its existing gun laws, which first passed in 1983. However, even with the stricter laws, New Zealand’s gun regulations are more permissive than many other Western countries outside of the United States. New Zealand, along with the U.S. are the only two nations that don’t require universal gun registration, according to GunPolicy.org, which tracks guns throughout the world and presents research from the University of Sydney. However, despite relatively relaxed regulations on guns, fatalities by firearms have remained low in New Zealand, where violent crime and murders are rare. A total of 48 people were murdered in 2017 in New Zealand, marking a low in the country’s homicide figures, according to a police report. Killings by firearms have stayed in the single digits between 2007 and 2016, with the exception of the year 2009, when 11 people were killed by guns, police said. While guns can be purchased online or through mail order with police approval, self-defense does not count as a reason to possess a gun, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. People are permitted to carry guns for “lawful, proper, and sufficient purpose,” which includes using firearms for hunting or pest control. Gun ownership, however, abounds. At least 1.2 million firearms are estimated to be owned by civilians in New Zealand, which has a population of nearly 5 million, according to the 2017 Small Arms Survey. New Zealand’s gun per capita rate, about one for every three people, is higher than in Australia, where there are about 3.15 million guns, about one for every eight people, the Morning Herald reports.",How the New Zealand Mosque Shootings Are Putting Scrutiny on the Country's Gun Laws,"Updated: March 15, 2019 6:40 PM ET"
1278,Bjørn Ihler,"In July 2011, Bjørn Ihler was on Norway’s Utøya island when far-right extremist Anders Breivik fatally shot 69 people and injured 110, mostly students who were attending a summer camp organized by the youth wing of Norway’s Labour party. Since then, Ihler, 27, has worked as a counter-extremism activist, attempting to understand and prevent radicalization.  What happened in New Zealand is devastating, and brings back my memories from 2011 fairly directly. But as someone who has been trying to fight far-right extremism for almost eight years now, I can’t say that I’m very surprised. In all this time, most Western countries have still not learnt the lessons from what happened at Utøya. Most of us have refused to recognize something fundamental: that violent extremism and terrorism are not something external to our society. They are a part of our society. Over the coming days, as happened with Anders Breivik, people will talk a lot about the mental health issues of the individual perpetrators in New Zealand. They’ll try to make them seem abnormal, outside of society, that they have nothing to do with our policies or our governments. This also happens when the perpetrators are Islamist extremists. Even when these are people who have grown up on the outskirts of Paris and Brussels – the capitals of the Western world, to a large extent – we speak about them as foreign because they happen to be Muslim. We say their ideology distances us from them. But we need to start seeing violent extremism as something universal, rather than something ideological. It’s an expression of the simple idea, regardless of what ideology you hold, that we can’t all live together in diverse societies. That idea has only become more prominent since Utøya, as far right movements have grown in political influence. Now, in countries from Eastern Europe to Germany to the U.S., we see people in suits and ties fomenting fear of migration in general and fear of Muslims in particular, just as people marching in streets have. That’s what caused the murder of British lawmaker Jo Cox in 2016 during the run-up to the Brexit vote. The far-right’s belief that we can’t live together is growing in legitimacy, and that is in turn legitimizing violence. The perpetrators in New Zealand clearly want to spread that idea. The attack bears all the signs of being targeted towards an audience, rather than just being a physical attack. By filming themselves and spreading a manifesto – which references Breivik’s attack – they are trying to create the idea that there is a war going on, a clash of civilizations. They want people to see them as fighters in that war and inspire more to do the same. Those who share that video, and media who publish the manifesto are doing exactly what the attackers wanted. They are running errands for extremists.",I Survived a Far Right Terror Attack in 2011. Here’s What We’re Still Getting Wrong About Extremism,"March 15, 2019"
1279,Billy Perrigo,"In an apparent effort to ensure their heinous actions would “go viral,” a shooter who murdered at least 49 people in attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday live-streamed footage of the assault online, leaving Facebook, YouTube and other social media companies scrambling to block and delete the footage even as other copies continued to spread like a virus. The original Facebook Live broadcast was eventually taken down, but not before its 17-minute runtime had been viewed, replayed and downloaded by users. Copies of that footage quickly proliferated to other platforms, like YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit, and back to Facebook itself. Even as the platforms worked to take some copies down, other versions were re-uploaded elsewhere. The episode underscored social media companies’ Sisyphean struggle to police violent content posted on their platforms. “It becomes essentially like a game of whack-a-mole,” says Tony Lemieux, professor of global studies and communication at Georgia State University. Facebook, YouTube and other social media companies have two main ways of checking content uploaded to their platforms. First, there’s content recognition technology, which uses artificial intelligence to compare newly-uploaded footage to known illicit material. “Once you know something is prohibited content, that’s where the technology kicks in,” says Lemieux. Social media companies augment their AI technology with thousands of human moderators who manually check videos and other content. Still, social media companies often fail to recognize violent content before it spreads virally, letting users take advantage of the unprecedented and instantaneous reach offered by the very same platforms trying to police them. Neither YouTube, Facebook nor Twitter answered questions from TIME about how many copies of the Christchurch video they had taken down. New Zealand police said they were aware the video was circulating on social media, and urged people not to share it. “There is extremely distressing footage relating to the incident in Christchurch circulating online,” police said on Twitter. “We would strongly urge that the link not be shared.” Mass shooters often crave notoriety, and each horrific event brings calls to deny assailants the infamy they so desire. (Four arrests were made after the Christchurch shooting, and it remains unclear whether the shooter who live-streamed the attack acted alone.) Facebook said that the original video of the attack was only taken down after they were alerted to its existence by New Zealand police, indicating that an algorithm had not noticed the video. “We quickly removed both the shooter’s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video,” a Facebook spokesperson said. “We’re also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we’re aware.” Experts say the Christchurch video highlights a fatal flaw in social media companies’ approach to content moderation.",'A Game of Whack-a-Mole.'

1280,Ian Bremmer,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continued his struggle to contain the fallout from one of the biggest political scandals in Canadian history. The controversy centers on a Quebec-based construction firm, SNC-Lavalin, accused of bribing the Gaddafi regime in Libya to win government contracts. Canada’s former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Rabould says she was pressured by the Trudeau administration to settle corruption charges with SNC-Lavalin, a move which would have avoided the company being barred from bidding on government contracts. That would have hurt both the company and its workforce, a significant proportion of whom work in Quebec — Trudeau’s home province. The prime minister’s critics say his administration—and Trudeau himself—improperly interfered; Trudeau and his supporters claim that he was only looking out for the wellbeing of Canadian citizens and did nothing improper. As ever, the reality lies somewhere in the middle. Although nobody in Trudeau’s cabinet has been accused of breaking the law, the scandal has rocked Canadian politics. Two Trudeau cabinet ministers have resigned on principle, along with Trudeau’s longtime friend and closest advisor Gerald Butts (he didn’t resign on principle, but to make sure he wouldn’t be a distraction. Read into that what you will). Trudeau maintains that he did nothing wrong and was keeping the interest of Canadian workers front of mind, like he was elected to do. This would all be bad for Canadian politics under normal circumstances. Two things make it worse; the first is the fact that Trudeau has been held up—and holds himself up—to be the champion of Western liberal democracy at a time when that worldview is under assault. There is no shortage of critics who see Trudeau as getting his just come-uppance—for all the talk of “real change” (his 2015 campaign’s slogan) and his being a “feminist” prime minister, the resignation of two of the most high-profile female ministers makes Trudeau appear like just another run-of-the-mill politician. The second is that Canada has elections in the fall; while it was looking like Trudeau and his Liberal party were going to sail to victory and form another majority government, polling in the wake of the scandal has now thrown that prospect into question. Unlike Trump, who generates controversy at a dizzying clip, this one looks significant—and rare enough—to leave a permanent mark on Trudeau and his government. While elections are still months away, it looks like Canada could be heading for a minority government that will require coalition-formation. The only question is whether Trudeau and the Liberals lead that coalition or if it’s their Conservative counterparts. 3 percent — the polling lead lead the Conservatives currently have over the Liberals, whose support has tumbled in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal.",The Quick Read on Justin Trudeau's Mounting Political Troubles,"March 15, 2019"

TIME has partnered with a dozen leading news organizations — including Reuters, the Associated Press, Forbes and HuffPost— to launch the One Free Press Coalition with the goal of promoting press freedom around the world. “TIME is proud to stand with the One Free Press Coalition and journalists all over the world who are taking great risks in pursuit of greater truths,” said TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal. On Friday, the coalition released its first-ever 10 Most Urgent list, identifying 10 journalists around the world who represent the most severe examples of abuses to press freedom or cases of injustice. TIME named The Guardians the 2018 Person of the Year, recognizing four journalists and one news organization for their work in the face of threats. Two of those journalists, Maria Ressa and Jamal Khashoggi, now appear on the 10 Most Urgent list, which will be updated each month.

1282,Hillary Leung,"Conservationists say they have found a dead vaquita porpoise, a critically endangered marine animal of which only about 10 remain in the world, in a fish net off the coast of Mexico. On March 12, crew from environmental group Sea Shepherd set out on patrol ships in the Gulf of California when they spotted an unidentified white animal trapped in an illegal gillnet, an apparatus used to trap fish by their gills. The animal was believed to be the endangered vaquita, but its severely decomposed corpse made it difficult to identify. Preliminary photos sent to experts confirmed that its body matched that of a vaquita porpoise. The vaquita is listed as a “critically endangered” species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s Red List of Threatened Species. A report published by the IUCN on March 6 states that only about 10 vaquitas remained alive in 2018, as per an acoustic monitoring program conducted in the Gulf, though there is a 95% chance they number between 6 and 22. According to Sea Shepherd, gillnets threaten the vaquita porpoise with imminent extinction. Used to target the totoaba fish, also a critically endangered species of a similar size to the vaquita, the nets are a “perfect death trap.” The totoaba fish is caught largely for its swim bladder, and its numbers have been severely reduced due to overfishing in recent decades. Some had previously argued that gillnets are not a threat to vaquitas and other cetaceans. “If there were any reservations about totoaba gillnets being a great danger for vaquitas and other cetaceans, despite ample proof in the past, this event should definitely leave no room for doubt,” said Sea Shepherd Director of Marine Operations Locky Maclean.","Critically Endangered Porpoise Found Dead Off Coast of Mexico, Conservationists Say","March 15, 2019"

The attacks occurred while worshippers attended Friday prayers. The main attack happened at Masjid Al Noor in central Christchurch, the largest city on the country’s southern island, where 42 people were killed, police said. A second shooting took place at Linwood Masjid, in an eastern suburb of Christchurch, where seven people were killed. Another person died after being transported to a hospital. A number of explosive devices attached to vehicles were reportedly defused after the attack. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called the incident a “terrorist attack.” “There is no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme and unprecedented violence,” she said at a press conference in Christchurch.

1284,Hillary Leung,"A major cyclone the equivalent of a strong Category 2 hurricane approached the coast of Mozambique late Thursday, prompting residents to brace for what weather authorities have called a likely “worst case scenario.” Cyclone Idai was forecast to make landfall just south of Beira, the nation’s fourth-largest city with a population of half a million, late Thursday night. It is now carrying sustained 110 mph winds gusting to above 130 mph, according to the Washington Post. Flooding from Idai’s path inland has already killed 122 people in Mozambique and Malawi, making it the deadliest weather disaster this year. The landfall will pose further threat to the African country, with authorities saying it could bring a “life-threatening” storm surge of up to 13 feet along Mozambique’s coastline, and close to 20 feet at the mouth of the Pungwe river, which runs to Zimbabwe. The surge could submerge thousands of homes and businesses, and potentially displace more than 1,000 residents, the Post reports. Mozambique ranks third among countries in Africa most susceptible to weather-related hazards, according to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. In 2015, Cyclone Chedza killed 140, and in 2000, Tropical Cyclone Eline left 350 dead and 650,000 homeless across southern Africa. Cyclone Idai is predicted to be the strongest to make landfall in Mozambique since Eline. Mozambican authorities have issued a red alert regarding Tropical Cyclone Idai and humanitarian response is ongoing in Malawi and Mozambique.

1285,Melissa Chan,"When an Ethiopian Airlines flight carrying 157 passengers crashed Sunday, killing all aboard, the world lost nearly two dozen “superheroes”—selfless humanitarians and peace-seekers whose work for the United Nations helped save thousands of lives across the globe, according to environmental leaders and friends of the victims. At least 22 U.N. workers were killed when the doomed Nairobi, Kenya-bound flight went down minutes after taking off from Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, officials said. Some of them were headed to Nairobi to attend the fourth U.N. Environment Assembly, the top decision-making body on global environmental issues, which kicked off Monday with a somber moment of silence. Heads were bowed and flags were flown at half-staff, officials said, as the thousands gathered paid tribute to their fallen colleagues. Among the dead was 38-year-old Victor Tsang, a kind and fierce fighter for women’s rights, who was about a month away from enjoying the birth of his second child, according to his colleagues and friends. “He was the best of his generation and such a decent human being,” said Erik Solheim, the former executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme. “Victor made the world a better place. He spread sunshine wherever he went.” Tsang, a Hong Kong native, championed gender equality and promoted sustainable energy as an ambassador for the U.N. Environment Programme, the agency said. “He was a very strong feminist,” Solheim told TIME, adding that Tsang may have been motivated to fight for the cause because of his close connection to his wife, who is eight months pregnant. The couple “did everything together” and deeply loved their 2-year-old son, colleagues said. “He would play with his child like a child,” said Pushpam Kumar, the U.N. Environment Assembly’s chief environmental economist. “He had boundless energy.” When he learned of his colleague’s death, Kumar said he had flashbacks of happier memories of Tsang bringing his son into his Nairobi office and expressing his excitement about his upcoming baby. But Kumar, 50, was also hit with waves of sadness. “Life is so fragile. We know that. But this was something else,” he said, adding that he had to ask himself, “Victor is no more?” “He had a full life to go,” Kumar said. “All this potential gone forever.”",‘All This Potential Gone Forever.’ Colleagues Remember the Humanitarians Killed in the Ethiopian Airlines Crash,"March 14, 2019"
1286,Billy Perrigo,"As earthquakes go in recent British politics, this one was the largest. Across three successive evenings, lawmakers handed down three scathing defeats to Prime Minister Theresa May. The scale of the early damage was unquantifiable, there was no immediate plan for how to rebuild, and nobody knew how dangerous the aftershocks would be. But two things were clear. After two years of tortuous negotiations with the E.U., the U.K. was back to square one. And, in a turning point, lawmakers had wrestled control over the Brexit process out of the hands of May’s government. The events played out in three stages. First, on Tuesday, lawmakers rejected the deal May had spent two years negotiating with the European Union. By doing so, they set Britain on course to crash out of the E.U. on its scheduled exit date, March 29, without a deal. But then, on Wednesday, lawmakers voted to rule out such a “no deal” Brexit. Confusingly, that vote was not binding, and did not change the reality that Britain is legally bound to leave on March 29 if no deal has by then been agreed by Parliament. So, to undo that paradox, lawmakers instructed May on Thursday to request the E.U. to postpone Britain’s exit date. The order, by a margin of 412 votes to 202, was an embarrassment for May, who had been steadfast in her rhetoric until Wednesday that Britain would leave on March 29. And it meant that E.U. member state governments now hold the power to allow the U.K. to postpone its departure, or force a no-deal Brexit. With just 15 days to go before Brexit, here’s what to know about what could happen next. Probably not, but there are several options. Perhaps the most likely is that E.U. member states accept May’s request for an extension, and Britain’s exit date is postponed until June 30. (May will likely make the request for an extension at the upcoming E.U. council meeting on March 21.) But if just one E.U. member state vetoes May’s request to postpone Brexit, then Britain legally must leave on March 29. In the case a country chooses to veto, there are three options. The simplest is that Britain leaves on March 29 without a deal.",Britain Votes To Delay Brexit After Chaotic Week In Parliament. Here’s What That Means,"March 14, 2019"

1290,Ciara Nugent,"Chanting “Hands off the Internet” and “No to isolation,” thousands of Russians joined protests in Moscow and other cities on March 10 to denounce new legislation that would severely tighten state control of the Internet. Lawmakers say isolating Russia from the global Internet will protect the country’s networks, but critics accuse the Kremlin of trying to create what some are calling an “online Iron Curtain.” In recent years, Vladimir Putin’s government has introduced a raft of measures curbing Russians’ online freedoms, including blocking the messaging app Telegram in 2018. In February, a digital-sovereignty bill took the first step toward becoming law; it’s expected to pass, banning Internet traffic from being routed through foreign servers and requiring it to pass through state-controlled infrastructure. Putin is also expected to sign off soon on two more laws to impose heavy fines on individuals and media outlets that publish “fake news” or material deemed “disrespectful” to authorities. Last year, in the wake of revelations that Russian hackers tried to influence the 2016 elections, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton warned that Washington would respond “offensively as well as defensively” to foreign cyberattacks. The sovereignty bill specifically cites the “aggressive character” of U.S. policy and promises that by reducing Russia’s reliance on U.S. web infrastructure, the state will be able to keep the Internet running in the event of a cyberwar. Local media say a trial disconnect from foreign servers will take place by April. Protesters say the reforms will give Putin an unprecedented ability to suppress criticism in a nation where offline forms of dissent like street protest are already tightly regulated. Many fear Russia’s social media and search engines will soon resemble China’s strictly censored Internet.

1291,Aryn Baker,"By the time his Libyan captors branded his face, Sunday Iabarot had already run away twice and had been sold three times. The gnarled scar that covers most of the left side of his face appears to show a crude number 3. His jailer carved it into his cheek with a fire-heated knife, cutting and cauterizing at the same time. Iabarot left Nigeria in February 2016 with a plan to head northward and buy passage on a smuggler’s boat destined for Europe, where he had heard from friends on Facebook that jobs were plentiful. The journey of more than 2,500 miles would take him across the trackless desert plains of Niger and through the lawless tribal lands of southern Libya before depositing him at the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. He never made it. Instead, he was captured the moment he arrived in Libya, then sold to armed men who kept a stable of African migrants they exploited for labor and ransom.

1292,Bibhudatta Pradhan / Bloomberg,"China’s move to block a fresh attempt by the United Nations Security Council to designate the chief of Jaish-e-Mohammed as a global terrorist has intensified pressure on the tense relationship between New Delhi and Beijing. “We are disappointed by this outcome,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement. “We will continue to pursue all available avenues to ensure that terrorist leaders who are involved in heinous attacks on our citizens are brought to justice.” The Pakistan-based terrorist group claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 suicide car bombing in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 40 members of its security forces, bringing the volatile nations to the brink of a full-blown war. India launched airstrikes to destroy insurgent bases inside Pakistan, prompting Pakistan to retaliate, leading to an unprecedented clash between warplanes from both sides. An Indian pilot was captured by Pakistan and subsequently released. While the possibility of a worsening military stand-off between the nuclear-armed neighbors reduced in recent weeks, India has continued to press for action against Masood Azhar, the group’s chief. Pakistan has been at pains to show it is taking action against against terrorist groups, closing religious schools and arresting dozens of people with links to terrorism, although observers have cast doubt on the effectiveness of Islamabad’s moves. After an informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping last April, it seemed relations had improved. The leaders committed to strengthening communication between their two militaries to avoid disputes along their contested Himalayan border and coordinating more closely to help boost prosperity in the region. The attack in Kashmir put pressure on China — a close ally of Pakistan — to alter its position at the United Nations Security Council, where the government in Beijing has blocked India’s attempts to list Azhar as a designated terrorist. To India’s dismay, Pakistan has been one of the largest beneficiaries of China’s “Belt and Road” initiative, which has seen about $60 billion committed for roads and power plants across the country, giving Beijing access to the Arabian Sea.

1295,Joseph Hincks,"Neither of the Huseynov brothers got to see their mother before she died last year. Journalist Emin Huseynov had been stripped of his Azeri citizenship and rendered stateless after he escaped the oil-rich Caucasus country of Azerbaijan for Switzerland in 2015. His younger brother Mehman was serving a two-year prison term for allegedly defaming a police officer he said had tortured him.  Denied the chance to visit his mother in hospital, Mehman was only permitted a few hours leave to attend her funeral. In a graveside statement the journalist angered authorities anew when he criticized President Ilham Aliyev and said he would continue exposing the high-level corruption that affects some 10 million Azeris. “I wanted to show them that even in the most difficult part of my life you can’t break my will,” Mehman, 29, told TIME after his release in early March. The murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi has drawn significant attention to how authoritarian regimes’ repress critical media. A case in point is what Reporters Without Borders (RSF) U.K. bureau director Rebecca Vincent calls a “perpetually worsening crackdown” in Azerbaijan. RSF says at least four journalists have been killed with impunity since 2005 in the former Soviet republic, which ranks 163 out of 180 countries on its 2018 press freedom index. The persecution of the Huseynov brothers, Vincent says, is characteristic of the “very personal” way Aliyev targets his critics. On Dec. 26, a few months before Mehman’s scheduled release date, authorities bought new charges against him that his lawyer said could have extended his jail term up to seven years. In response, he went on hunger strike: he was “nil by mouth” for four days before accepting water and eventually liquid yoghurt. He broke his fast late January, when Azerbaijan’s prosecutor canceled the new charges in a rare concession to international pressure. Mehman had also inspired thousands of protesters to take the streets in what opposition figures called Azerbaijan’s largest demonstrations in more than a decade. (State police said 2,800 people attended the rally, while the opposition said there were 20,000.) Emin Huseynov began his journalism career in 2001, two years before Ilham Aliyev took over as President, following on from his father Heydar, who had first ruled Azerbaijan as its Soviet boss, and then as the Republic’s president from 1994. In a cable released by Wikileaks, a former diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Azerbaijan compared father and son to members of The Godfather’s fictional Corleone family. In December, a British tribunal heard that in 2015, Ilham Aliyev’s daughters attempted to buy a $80 million London property that would have carried “a significant risk of money laundering.” Persecution of dissident voices has long been a feature of the Aliyev regime. But historian Audrey L. Altstadt, who has written several books on Azerbaijan, says the repression worsened after 2010, when the ruling party gained absolute control of the legislature and passed laws that provided a pretext for “tax evasion” charges to be brought against organizations that received foreign grants. “That led to the freezing of institutional and then personal bank accounts of NGOs and media groups,” she says. “The ill-gotten wealth of the ruling family and oligarchs grew and criticism or truth-telling around it was deemed “criminal.”” Among those facing repercussions was Emin, founder of a free speech advocacy group called Institute for Reporters Freedom and Safety (IRFS). A police beating in 2008 had left him with brain injuries, according to a case filed against Azerbaijan at the European Court of Human Rights, and when the government launched another crackdown on dissidents in 2014 he went into hiding, aided by his friend and fellow IRFS journalist Rasim Aliyev. Emin spent 10 months living in Baku’s Swiss Embassy before he flew out with a Swiss government delegation who were attending the opening ceremony of the first European Games. Two months later, Rasim Aliyev died after being beaten in what authorities claimed was an altercation over soccer. “He was murdered and it’s clear to us the investigation was not free and fair,” Emin tells TIME from Geneva.",Meet Two Journalist Brothers Paying the Price for Speaking Out in Azerbaijan,"March 13, 2019"

Speaking at a session of the annual National People’s Congress in Beijing Tuesday, the head of the Xinjiang government defended the detainment depots and implied they are a temporary arrangement, according to the Guardian. “In general there will be fewer and fewer students in the centers. If one day our society doesn’t need them, the education and training centers will disappear,” said Shohrat Zakir, the governor of Xinjiang. China recently acknowledged the existence of its network of camps, but insists the sites are providing vocational training to people deemed at risk of “extremist” thought. The confinement of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities has elicited widespread condemnation, including from a U.S. official this week. Reports from former detainees describe the camps as political re-education centers bent on creating loyal communist party supporters by forcing the detainees to renounce their Muslim faith and memorize propaganda. Defiant of the international criticism, Zakir likened the centers to “boarding schools” where students receive free education, training and board, according to the Guardian. He said portrayals of the situation in Xinjiang are “very ridiculous” and “purely fabricated.” Zakir’s comments come the day after the U.S. Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom denounced China’s detainment camps, calling it a “horrific situation.” U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly called on the Trump Administration to act on behalf of those being detained in Xinjiang. According to the U.N. an estimated 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are held in China’s far northwestern Xinjiang Province.

The image, a new logo, is the launching point for The Last Column, a new project from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) that aims to memorialize the many journalists who have been killed in the line of duty.  The project, which includes a book and a short documentary series, seeks to immortalize the work of reporters from all over the world who have died. The Last Column weaves together the final works of reporters including Marie Colvin, whose war coverage for The Sunday Times cemented her as a legend among foreign correspondents, and the Washington Post’s Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered last year at the Saudi consulate in Turkey in an event that triggered international alarm and controversy. Khashoggi was honored, along with several other journalists whose lives were threatened, as The Guardians in TIME’s 2018 Person of the Year issue. Although many of the journalists featured in The Last Column were well-known, others were local reporters killed while uncovering important truths about their own communities, Joel Simon, the CPJ’s executive director, tells TIME. All of their work put together in a single collection highlights the lengths dedicated reporters will go to in the effort to provide information. “When you put it all together in one place, you realize this is what journalism is,” Simon says. “It’s not just big names trying to reach a global audience. It’s people trying to inform their communities, where such activity is inherently dangerous.” One of the accompanying short documentaries features Cat Colvin, sister to Marie Colvin, who shares that she always viewed the famed reporter as invincible.  “She never wanted any other career,” Cat Colvin says of her sister. “She really lived to try to bring more reality to what she was seeing around her to try to express it. In a way, she did die doing what she loved. The horror of it is it wasn’t accidental. She knew she was getting into danger. She did not know she was being targeted.” Bonya Ahmed, who also appears in the series, was attacked along with her husband, Avijit Roy, by Islamic extremists while in Bangladesh in 2015. Roy, a writer and advocate for free expression in Bangladesh, was targeted and killed for the subject matter in two of his books, The Virus of Faith and Homosexuality: A Scientific and Socio-Psychological Investigation, Ahmed says. Roy, a passionate writer, was fired up about issues of fundamentalism, whether religious or nationalistic.  “He really thought that it was very important to talk about it and create awareness through writing,” Ahmed says.",'Murder Is the Ultimate Form of Censorship.'

The incident comes as the country struggles with a resurgence of homegrown radicalism inspired by the Islamic State. Police and bomb squad officers surrounded the house in Sibolga, North Sumatra Tuesday after connecting it to a militant arrested for plotting an attack on a local police headquarters, according to Reuters. As counter-terrorism officials attempted to search the premises, the militant’s wife allegedly threw an explosive device, wounding a police officer and a civilian. “Police, religious figures and relatives of the suspect were negotiating with the suspects and asked them to surrender but they still stayed inside,” said national police spokesperson Dedi Prasetyo. Very early Wednesday morning, police heard additional explosions. “At 1:25 a.m. the wife of the terrorist and their son blew themselves up inside the house,” Dedi Prasetyo said. Police reportedly uncovered about 70lbs of explosives at the site.

Maduro claims that U.S.-backed cyber “sabotage” prompted the six-day power cuts in his crisis-wracked country. “Donald Trump is most responsible for the cyber attack on the Venezuelan electricity system,” Maduro said in a broadcast. But experts said the powercut was more likely caused by technical problems in the link between the country’s hydropower plants and the power grid. Maduro gave U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave, though the State Department already announced Monday that all remaining U.S. Embassy staff in Caracas would be withdrawn because of the “deteriorating situation.” Much of the country has been without power since last Thursday. Amid the prolonged darkness, hospitals have struggled to continue operations, food has rotted and exports from the petrostate’s main oil terminal ceased, Reuters reports. While power sporadically returned to some, but not all areas Tuesday, anger has continued skyrocketing. Thousands of Venezuelans protested on the streets of Caracas in support of opposition leader Juan Guaido last week. The outage is the latest blow in a nation paralyzed by dueling leadership claims by Maduro and Guaido.

Franco, an outspoken advocate for the rights of women, favela residents and the LGBT community, was killed in a drive-by shooting along with her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, in March 2018. Many believe her death was a targeted assassination due to her political activism. Ronnie Lessa, a retired military police officer, and Élcio Vieira Queiroz, a former police officer, have been arrested, the Guardian reports. “It is incontestable that Marielle Franco was summarily executed for her political activity in the defence of the causes she defended,” prosecutors said in a statement cited by the Guardian. The statement also said her killing had been planned three months in advance. Investigators did not confirm who ordered the killing or their motivations. The 38-year-old rising political star was born in a favela and served as the only black woman on Rio’s city council. She had protested against police brutality in favelas, and was involved in a 2008 state legislature inquiry into paramilitary gang activity, according to the Guardian. Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets to protest her death, and supporters have called for authorities to find those responsible for her killings.

1302,Billy Perrigo,"British Prime Minister Theresa May’s 11th-hour attempt to salvage her government’s Brexit deal was thrown into disarray on Tuesday evening, as lawmakers voted down her agreement with the European Union for a second time in two months, with just 17 days to go before Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U. The vote, by a margin of 391 votes to 242, is another blow to May, who rules with a wafer-thin working majority and has lost the support of most of her cabinet according to some reports. May’s defeat means the U.K. is on track to leave the bloc without an agreement that would have stopped raised tariffs on trade and uncertainty about citizens’ rights. But lawmakers will finally be given the chance to vote on Wednesday night to avert such a “no deal” Brexit, and likely delay Britain’s exit date, too, in what could be yet another blow to May’s government. Lawmakers forced the government to allow that vote, and most analysts now believe lawmakers will vote overwhelmingly to do so. That would trigger yet another vote on Thursday on whether to ask the E.U. to delay the date of Britain’s exit, from March 29 to some time further in the future. May had hoped that the looming March 29 Brexit deadline, and warnings of chaos from the Bank of England in the event of a “no deal” Brexit, would pressure lawmakers who voted against her deal in January to change their minds. And although her defeat was by a smaller margin than the record-breaking one she had suffered that month, (by 432 votes to 202,) it was not enough. “This was a bad deal in January when it was rejected by the largest margin in parliamentary history,” said Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party. “And it is a bad deal now.” As May defended her deal with a hoarse voice at the Parliamentary dispatch box before the vote, she was heckled from the benches by calls of “nothing has changed” – a reference to a comment she herself had made after the disastrous 2017 election, which she had called intending to increase her authority going into Brexit negotiations, but in which her party instead lost its majority.",U.K. Parliament Just Turned Down Another Brexit Deal 17 Days From the Deadline,"March 12, 2019"
1303,Mahita Gajanan,"As the United States joins the list of countries grounding the Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes following the deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash, some flights that have a connection to the aircraft have been cancelled or delayed — and the list of impacted flights could grow. While the Federal Aviation Administration had maintained it had confidence in the 737 MAX 8 aircraft, the U.S. faced growing pressure from other countries to ground the planes after an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed on Sunday, killing all 157 people aboard. In the days since, China, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, Argentina, the European Union and many other countries have all grounded the planes. The crash on Sunday marks the 737 MAX 8’s second deadly incident in less than five months — in October, a Lion Air jet crashed in Indonesia soon after taking off, killing all 189 people onboard. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would issue an emergency order to ground all Boeing 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 aircraft in the wake of the plane crash. According to Trump, any planes currently in the air would be grounded upon reaching their destinations. Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, two U.S. based carriers that operate the MAX 8 planes, confirmed they were aware of Trump’s order. Southwest, which has the broadest current domestic use of the MAX 8 planes, with 34 in its fleet, did not immediately return a request for comment on how passengers would be affected if their flights are cancelled. The airline does not typically charge a change fee for rebooked flights, though customers are required to pay the cost in fare difference if they schedule a new itinerary. A statement from Southwest read: “Southwest is aware of media reports stating that the Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet will be grounded in the United States. We are currently seeking confirmation and additional guidance from the FAA and will respond accordingly in the interest of aviation safety.” In a statement to TIME, American Airlines said its fleet of 24 aircraft would be impacted by the order to ground all Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes and that it would try to rebook affected customers as soon as it could. While American Airlines usually changes fees for rebooked tickets, the airline has previously waived such costs in times of emergency. “Earlier today the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) informed us that based on new information, they are grounding the United States Boeing 737 MAX fleet out of an abundance of caution,” read the statement. “American Airlines has 24 aircraft affected by this directive. We appreciate the FAA’s partnership, and will continue to work closely with them, the Department of Transportation, National Transportation Safety Board and other regulatory authorities, as well as our aircraft and engine manufacturers. Our teams will make every effort to rebook customers as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.” How the global efforts to ground the MAX 8 aircrafts will affect passengers whose flights are cancelled and delayed will depend on the number of these jetliners each airline has in its fleet, according to Ahmed Abdelghany, a professor of operations management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Airlines that primarily depend on MAX 8 planes to transport passengers will be more affected than ones that only operate a small number of the aircraft.",Will Boeing 737 Max 8 Groundings Cause Flight Cancellations or Delays?

But seven days and hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit later, the world is looking a little bit cleaner. “Take a photo of an area that needs some cleaning or maintenance, then take a photo after you have done something about it, and post it,” Román wrote on March 5, sharing a before and after photo of a messy area being cleaned up by one young man. Román tells TIME that a friend of his in Guatemala had posted the image along with a similar message in Spanish, so he translated the text to English and added the now widely circulated message: “Here is a new #challenge for all you bored teens.” He tagged the post #BasuraChallenge and #Trashtag — basura means trash in Spanish. Soon after, thousands of people posted photos and videos to Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, showing themselves cleaning up beaches, parks, schools, streets and more, all around the world. Beyond trying to help the environment, of course, Román says that he really did want to help teenagers make a difference on the internet. “When teens get bored, that’s like the worst thing you can ever have — actually, any person being bored,” he tells TIME. “So, I thought, maybe someone will pick up the challenge and do something positive about it.” The positivity has certainly spread far and wide — Román’s original post has garnered 323,000 shares on Facebook alone as of Tuesday afternoon, and the hashtag on Instagram has more than 25,000 posts. People picking up litter everywhere from Vietnam to the Philippines have sent messages thanking Román for starting the trend, he says. Román says he hoped that a challenge of this nature would help people from different ages bond. “We’re all in this together,” he says.

Ethiopian Airlines flight 303 bound for Nairobi crashed six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. Another Boeing 737 MAX 8, owned by Indonesian carrier Lion Air, went down in October, killing 189. In both cases, the pilot had reported difficulties and requested permission to turn back. The Max 8 has become a popular new model for Boeing since its entry into commercial service in 2017, with more than 300 currently in operation and over 5,000 ordered worldwide. The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority issued a global notice of “continued airworthiness” on Monday night. “External reports are drawing similarities between this accident and the Lion Air Flight 610 accident on October 29, 2018. However, this investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions,” the agency said. A growing number of American politicians, including Sen. Mitt Romney, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, have begun to call for the planes to be grounded in the U.S. “Until the cause of the crash is known and it’s clear that similar risks aren’t present in the domestic fleet, I believe all Boeing 737 Max 8 series aircraft operating in the United States should be temporarily grounded,” Feinstein wrote in a statement. As investigators begin to work to determine the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, at least 13 countries have temporarily banned the use of the MAX 8 in their airspaces and at least 26 airlines have temporarily stopped flying them. China was the first country to ban the model on Monday. The Civil Aviation Administration of China ordered all domestic airlines to ground the MAX 8. “Considering the two accidents took place when newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 8s went down just minutes after taking off, they have some degree of similarity,” the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement on Monday reported in Chinese state media.",A Growing Number of Countries and Airlines Are Grounding Boeing 737 Max 8 Planes After the Ethiopian Airlines Crash,"Updated: March 13, 2019 1:09 PM ET | Originally published: March 12, 2019"

While investigators are still piecing together why an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max plunged to the ground minutes after takeoff Sunday, regulators across the globe opted for caution, even as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has said the jet model remains airworthy. Earlier, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia closed their air space to 737 Max planes, and on Monday, China and Indonesia also halted flights. Boeing shares slipped 3.7 in New York, after logging the biggest drop among S&P 500 Index members the prior day. The trend toward safer flying has been building for years as U.S. regulators, the airlines and safety investigators brought on board new safety technologies, better monitoring of potential hazards and improved training. The improving U.S. accident figures don’t include passengers dying of medical emergencies. Boeing said Tuesday that the FAA isn’t mandating action on the 737 Max at this time.

According to the U.N., an estimated 1 million Uighurs are being held in internment camps in Xinjiang. “We have been putting out very clearly that this is a horrific situation that’s taking place in Xinjiang,” said Brownback, the U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom. Brownback was speaking Tuesday from Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, where he is leading a regional conference on religious freedom to raise awareness of the issue. In response to a question submitted by TIME, Brownback said that international pressure on China over their treatment of Uighurs is causing Beijing to change their approach. “Initially they didn’t respond. Then they denied that it was taking place and then finally more recently settled on this idea that this is vocational training. They haven’t said that it’s involuntary vocational training,” he said. “All of these are completely unsatisfactory answers,” he added. “It is past time in the year 2019 for the Chinese government to answer what it’s doing to its own people,” he continued. The ambassador said families of hundreds of people who have gone missing in the detainment camps have contacted him. Brownback called for China to allow international observers to visit Xinjiang and for the release of individuals being held there. He mentioned that if China does not comply, the U.S. could invoke sanctions or enact the Global Magnitsky Act, legislation that allows the U.S. (as well as other countries, including Canada and E.U. member states) to put sanctions on individuals or organizations who are complicit in human rights abuses. “The administration is serious about religious freedom matters and deeply concerned about what is taking place in China,” he said.

1309,Aria Chen,"When Yumi Ishikawa, a 32-year-old model and actress, tweeted in January her belief that employers in Japan should not be allowed to require women to wear high heels to work, she didn’t expect to cause such a stir. But she seems to have struck a chord.  When she saw that her remarks had been retweeted thousands of times and comments were flooding in from other women whose feet and backs were aching, Ishikawa, who is also a writer, seized the momentum and created the hashtag #KuToo — a clever combination of the Japanese words for shoe (kutsu) and pain (kutsuu) with a gentle nod to the #MeToo movement. While #MeToo has taken off in parts of Asia, notably finding its own unique forms in South Korea and China, the movement hasn’t quite had its moment in Japan. But a snowballing #KuToo campaign shows women in the country are pushing back against what they see as major inequality in the workplace. Following the surprise popularity of her comments, Ishikawa launched a petition on change.org calling on the country’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to explicitly forbid employers from requiring women to wear certain types of shoes. “I thought, if there are so many people who feel the same, why not start some sort of movement,” Ishikawa tells TIME. It seems she did; as of this writing, her petition has gathered more than 14,000 signatures. The campaign also ignited passionate online discourse, as many women began posting photos of bruises and blisters on their toes or detailing discomfort and pain. “It’s not about liking the shoes or not,” one Twitter user wrote. “I want this society to be one where people have the freedom to wear whatever shoes they like.” But others have pushed back, arguing that requiring women to wear heels is no different from requiring men to wear leather shoes. The backlash in Japan over what some women view as unfair company policies about women’s workwear has parallels elsewhere in the world. British actress Nicola Thorp faced a storm of criticism in 2016 when she started a campaign asking the U.K. government to ban workplace policies that required women to wear heels after she was sent home from work for showing up in flats.  Thorp’s campaign ultimately did bring about change; her online petition was signed by more than 150,000 people, far exceeding the 10,000 signatures required to mandate a response from the government. A parliamentary committee tasked with investigating the complaint stated that company dress codes must be “reasonable,” including those dress codes that differentiate between what men and women must wear. The committee also found that some companies went far beyond mandating heels for women, some requiring them to periodically reapply make-up, wear revealing clothes and even dye their hair blonde. “The fact that it has been an assumed part of life that women should wear an impractical item of clothing that damages your feet and back, is indicative of ingrained sexism and double standards,” Thorp tells TIME in an email. “In the U.K., most people were shocked that women were still being forced to wear high heels and make up at work. Men especially hadn’t really thought about it, and even women who wear heels every day in discomfort, hadn’t questioned the inequality of it before.”",Japan's #KuToo Movement Aims to Stop Employers From Requiring Women to Wear Heels,"Updated: March 18, 2019 10:31 PM ET | Originally published: March 12, 2019"

On average, almost 100 civilian deaths or injuries were recorded weekly in 2018, according to a recent U.N. report. Across the country, an estimated 85,000 children under five may have died from extreme hunger or disease since the war began. According to UNICEF, eight children are killed or injured across 31 active conflict zones in the country each day. Hajjah is one of the nation’s worst impacted provinces, with more than a million people hungry and thousands of new cholera cases reported. “We fear that thousands of civilians are trapped between the parties and lack the basic services they need to survive,” said Grande.

Singapore said the suspension will be implemented “in light of two fatal accidents involving Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in less than five months,” the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore said in a statement. The ban covers all flights flying in and out of Singapore, and several airlines will be affected including SilkAir, China Southern Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Shandong Airlines and Thai Lion Air. The statement calls the suspension “temporary,” but does not specify how long it will last. Australia also said its ban is a temporary while they “wait for more information to review the safety risks of continued operations” of the aircraft. Australia’s decision will only affect Singapore Airline’s Silk Air and Fiji Airways as no domestic airlines use the plane, according to Reuters. Several other countries have already halted operations of the aircraft. Authorities in China, Indonesia, and Ethiopia ordered airlines to ground Boeing 737 MAX planes on Monday. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration sought to assure the public of the model’s “airworthiness” in a statement on Monday, stating that the aircraft will still be allowed to fly in the U.S. where several major airlines utilize the model.

1314,Hans Blix,"Exactly eight years ago, an earthquake off the east coast of Japan set a massive tsunami on a collision course with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The wall of water overwhelmed the reactors’ cooling mechanisms and over the next four days the plant suffered three nuclear meltdowns. It became the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. In response, Germany, Switzerland and some others around the world accelerated their plans to ditch nuclear power as an energy source. Nuclear power is virtually free of emissions. By contrast, we burn coal and gas at industrial scale to make electricity, pumping carbon dioxide and other noxious chemicals into our atmosphere. As a result, our oceans are warming and extreme climate events are becoming more common. Our children are more aware of these changes than we adults are: later this week, on March 15, young people will walk out of their schools in more than 30 countries to protest the scars we are carving into their futures. There are paths out of this mess. But on March 11, 2011, the world’s course was diverted away from one of the most important. I am talking about nuclear energy. Traditionally, green opposition to nuclear power has been rooted, above all, in fears of radiation let loose in a reactor accident or from waste leaking out of disposal sites. To use nuclear power and generate radioactive waste, environmentalists argued, was like taking off in an airplane without knowing where to land. However, today several countries are building deep underground disposal sites where they can safely land high level radioactive waste. What are we now to fear most: a gram of plutonium escaping from a deep underground waste disposal site, perhaps in ten thousand years, or billions of tons of carbon-dioxide released from burnt fossil fuels in our time? Frankly, it is not the waste from existing or expanded use of nuclear power that threatens our planet. One might even say that the nuclear waste is one of the greatest assets of nuclear power, as it is so small in volume that it can be — and is — safely taken care of in its entirety. On the other hand, the waste of fossil fuels, especially carbon dioxide, is so huge that (despite much experimenting) we do not know how to handle it. Can we responsibly continue to rely on nuclear power after the big accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima? Those were three grave accidents, yes, but accidents in any industry, whether nuclear, aviation or others, lead also to new, safer designs and dedication to safety culture. Plane crashes have not stopped us from flying, because most people know it is an effective means of traveling. They know that risks are rarely zero but also that safety is very high. We must arrive at a similar acceptance of nuclear power. There was a time, in the early atomic age, when nuclear-generated electricity was expected to be “too cheap to meter” — that it would be more effective, in other words, to provide it for free than to charge. In the end, it did not exactly turn out that way. Nuclear power has never been cheap and today it struggles to be competitive on purely economic grounds with electricity generated by burning natural gas — especially from fracking in the United States. However, the story is very different if we see emissions of greenhouse gases as a cost in themselves. According to a 2011 study, taken on average over the lifetime of an energy plant, the burning of coal results in 979 tons of carbon-dioxide (per gigawatt hour) entering the atmosphere. Gas gives off 550 tons. The figure for nuclear power is just 32 tons. Some people claim we can manage the world’s great and increasing hunger for energy by using wind and solar power. The call for “renewable energy sources” excludes fossil fuels, but it also excludes nuclear power, which is based on non-renewable uranium resources. It has been a smart but facile message, and we should be grateful that the world’s two most populous countries — China and India — are fast expanding their use of nuclear power as well as of renewables. Solar and wind power are great in many places and have gone down in cost. However, getting rid of technically sound carbon dioxide-free nuclear power plants, to replace them with carbon dioxide-free wind and solar plants, does not make environmental sense. And to reject nuclear power because uranium is not renewable is silly. With modern technology the global resources of uranium and thorium could fuel thousands of years of expanded use of nuclear power.

1315,Hillary Leung,"An internet expert says he has uncovered an open database in China that details the personal information of more than 1.8 million women, as well as something called their “BreedReady” status. Victor Gevers, a Dutch researcher with nonprofit GDI.Foundation, tweeted his findings over the weekend. According to his research, the database stored women’s names, ages and marital status, among other particulars. The youngest member of the database was listed at 15 years old, while the average age was around 32. More than 80% of the women included appear to live in China’s capital, Beijing. In the screenshot Gevers posted, a field called “BreedReady” is last on the list, which also includes columns for “politics” and “education”. It’s unclear what the “BreedReady” term indicates, though Chinese netizens were quick to draw comparisons to the country’s panic over the plummeting birthrate and aging population. On the Chinese social network Weibo, users called the database a “real-life Handmaid’s Tale,” likening it to Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel. Others called it “horrible and absurd”. China’s declining population has been recognized as an official problem by the government, which in 2015 ended its one-child family planning policy. But the reforms have not made much of a dent in China’s looming demographic predicament, with the country expected to soon enter an “era of negative population growth.” Gevers told TIME that the database of women was taken offline on Monday afternoon. “At this moment we have no idea who the owner of the data is,” Gevers said.","A Researcher Uncovered a Chinese Database That Lists the ""BreedReady"" Status of 1.8 Million Women","March 11, 2019"
1316,Amy Gunia,"An Ethiopian Airlines plane en route to Nairobi, Kenya crashed just minutes after takeoff Sunday morning, killing all 157 people on board. The tragedy affected families across the world, as the passengers hailed from 35 countries. This is the second time a brand new Boeing 737 MAX 8 has mysteriously crashed in less than six months, prompting questions about the safety of the U.S. plane maker’s latest model. Here’s what we know about the ill-fated flight so far. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 took off from Addis Ababa’s Bole International Airport at 8:38 a.m. local time on March 10 and lost contact with ground control six minutes later. The plane crashed around Bishoftu, which is about 40 miles southeast of Ethiopia’s capital. The state-owned airline, which has a good safety record, confirmed that pilot Yared Getachew had “commendable performance” and extensive experience, having logged more than 8,000 flight hours. At just 28 years old, he was reportedly the youngest Ethiopian Airlines pilot to captain a Boeing 737. The plane, which was only four months old, had flown in from Johannesburg earlier the same morning and had undergone safety checks, according to The Washington Post. It remains unclear why the plane plummeted amid clear skies and may take years for the final cause of the wreckage to be determined. But the flight’s erratic path and sudden decent bear remarkable similarities to another wreckage of the same aircraft off Indonesia’s coast in October. Data from Ethiopian Airlines showed an “erratic flight path, with the plane first ascending then descending, then ascending sharply before it fell from the sky,” says the Post.

Two of the journalists — Thomas Seibert, a reporter with newspaper Tagesspiegel, and Jörg Brase, bureau chief of ZDF public television — said Ankara declined to renew their press accreditation for unspecified reasons, Agence France-Presse reports. They were given 10 days to leave the country in a move Berlin condemned as “unacceptable.” Speaking in Istanbul before their departure Sunday, Brase and Seibert accused the Turkish government of trying to “silence” international media. Both journalists pledged to continue reporting on the country. Their expulsion comes after German public broadcast correspondent Halil Gulbeyaz said he also saw his application for accreditation rejected earlier this month, AFP reports. While the country has jailed dozens of Turkish journalists for alleged links to the failed 2016 coup, this is the thought to be the first time accreditation of foreign journalists has been denied, according to BBC. Over a hundred media organizations were shut down by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government in the aftermath of the coup attempt, and in April 2018, 13 journalists working for an opposition newspaper called Cumhuriyet were sentenced to prison on terrorism charges. Turkey remains the world’s worst jailer of journalists, with at least 68 people behind bars in connection with their work as of the end of 2018, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

1319,Alejandro de la Garza,"Airline operators are racing to find answers following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which went down shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa on Sunday morning, killing all 157 people aboard. The aircraft is the second new Boeing 737 MAX 8 to go down in recent months, following the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in October, which killed 189 people. “A brand new aircraft … having repeated fatal crashes would put a big question mark on this aircraft,” Bijan Vasigh, a professor of economics and finance at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told TIME over email. The 737 MAX is the newest version of Boeing’s popular single-aisle airliner; the Associated Press reports that Ethiopian Airlines has only had this particular aircraft since November. Caught at the center of two devastating crashes, representatives from Boeing have so far refrained from speculating on what may have caused Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 to go down. “We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board and stand ready to support the Ethiopian Airlines team,” a representative from the aircraft manufacturer told TIME in a statement. The company also noted that a Boeing technical team is heading to the crash site in order to provide technical assistance under the supervision of the Ethiopia Accident Investigation Bureau and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Experts say it’s too early to know what may have been responsible for the recent crash of Flight 302, though they noted several similarities between the crash outside Addis Ababa and last year’s Lion Air Flight 610 tragedy. “It’s an eye opener, because it’s the second accident and it’s almost involving the same kind of circumstances,” said Ahmed Abdelghany, a professor of operations management at Embry-Riddle. “It should be a concern, but it’s too early to confirm anything.” Abdelghany noted the need for an in-depth investigation to determine the cause of the crash, particularly looking into the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft’s maintenance history. He did note several points of similarity between the two deadly crashes, including the fact that both involved the same model of aircraft, and occurred minutes after takeoff. According to Abdelghany, investigators will first comb through the maintenance record of the aircraft and try to gain insights from its black box, though it will take two to three years to finalize a report on the main reasons behind the crash. Though he says it is likely that some travelers may try to avoid flying on 737 MAX 8 aircraft, at least until more answers come to light, he stressed that it is the responsibility of each airline to make sure their airplanes are safe. China has ordered Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft in the country to be grounded following the Ethiopia crash, while Cayman Airways also announced it has grounded its MAX 8 models.

The Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency may be among those trying to circumvent protections put in place by companies including Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. to find and remove fake content that hackers created to sow division among the American electorate in the 2016 presidential campaign. “Instead of creating content themselves, we see them amplifying content,” said John Hultquist, the director of intelligence analysis at FireEye Inc. “Then it’s not necessarily inauthentic, and that creates an opportunity for them to hide behind somebody else.” Other hackers are breaking into computing devices and using them to open large numbers of social media accounts, according to Candid Wueest, a senior threat researcher at Symantec Corp. The hacked devices are used to create many legitimate-looking users as well as believable followers and likes for those fake users. While covert efforts to amplify divisive content originated by others isn’t a new technique, hackers and trolls seem to be embracing it heavily in advance of the next U.S. presidential election. Wueest said he observed a decrease in the creation of new content by fake accounts from 2017 to 2018 and a shift toward building massive followings that could be used as platforms for divisive messages in 2020. FBI Director Christopher Wray, speaking at the RSA Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, said social media remains a primary avenue for foreign actors to influence U.S. elections, and the bureau is working with companies on the problem. “What has continued virtually unabated and just intensifies during the election cycles is this malign foreign influence campaign, especially using social media,” Wray said. “That continues, and we’re gearing up for it to continue and grow again for 2020.”",Russian Internet Trolls Are Apparently Switching Strategies for 2020 U.S. Elections,"March 9, 2019"

The scandal embroiling Trudeau, who was elected on a platform of transparency, erupted a month ago when Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail published an explosive story that said the Office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was being accused of interfering in a corruption case against a prominent engineering company. Trudeau argued that he and his aides had not acted inappropriately but had instead moved to preserve Canadian jobs. In the past weeks, two cabinet members – Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former minister of justice and attorney general, and Jane Philpot, the treasury board president – spoke out against the office’s conduct and announced their resignations. Canada is facing an election next fall, and it remains uncertain whether Trudeau will keep his seat – and whether his party will maintain parliamentary control.

1323,Nick Wadhams and Jennifer Jacobs / Bloomberg,"For years, President Donald Trump has complained that countries hosting American troops aren’t paying enough. Now he wants to get even, and then some. Under White House direction, the administration is drawing up demands that Germany, Japan and eventually any other country hosting U.S. troops pay the full price of American soldiers deployed on their soil — plus 50 percent or more for the privilege of hosting them, according to a dozen administration officials and people briefed on the matter. In some cases, nations hosting American forces could be asked to pay five to six times as much as they do now under the “Cost Plus 50” formula. Trump has championed the idea for months. His insistence on it almost derailed recent talks with South Korea over the status of 28,000 U.S. troops in the country when he overruled his negotiators with a note to National Security Advisor John Bolton saying, “We want cost plus 50.” The president’s team sees the move as one way to prod NATO partners into accelerating increases in defense spending — an issue Trump has hammered allies about since taking office. While Trump claims his pressure has led to billions of dollars more in allied defense spending, he’s chafed at what he sees as the slow pace of increases. “Wealthy, wealthy countries that we’re protecting are all under notice,” Trump said in a speech at the Pentagon on Jan. 17. “We cannot be the fools for others.” Officials caution that the idea is one of many under consideration as the U.S. presses allies to pay more, and it may be toned down. Yet even at this early stage, it has sent shock waves through the departments of Defense and State, where officials fear it will be an especially large affront to stalwart U.S. allies in Asia and Europe already questioning the depth of Trump’s commitment to them.

1324,Billy Perrigo,"British Prime Minister Theresa May warned Friday that the U.K. may “never leave the E.U. at all” if lawmakers refuse to back her Brexit deal in a crucial vote next week. With just three weeks to go until March 29, when Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc, the country still has no agreement with the E.U., and is set on a default course of a “no deal” Brexit, which economists have warned would be disastrous. The last time lawmakers voted on May’s deal, in January, her government suffered the biggest defeat in modern parliamentary history, by 432 votes to 202, with scores of May’s own lawmakers defying her. In the ensuing two months, May has attempted to secure modifications to her deal in order to appease those critical lawmakers. But the E.U. has stood firm and refused to change the most contentious aspect of the agreement, the so-called Irish backstop. Most analysts believe, therefore, that lawmakers will again reject May’s deal when it comes to a vote on Tuesday. May’s Friday warning, made in a speech in the northern seaside town of Grimsby (where 71% voted to leave the E.U. at the referendum in 2016), was intended to increase pressure on lawmakers in spite of the lack of movement, by raising the possibility of Brexit being delayed, or worse, cancelled. “Next week, Members of Parliament in Westminster face a crucial choice,” May said. “Whether to back the Brexit deal – or to reject it. Back it and the U.K. will leave the European Union. Reject it and no one knows what will happen. We may not leave the E.U. for many months. We may leave without the protections that the deal provides. We may never leave at all.” May also raised the possibility of a second Brexit referendum, which the U.K.’s opposition Labour Party recently adopted as its official policy. Taking that route would “take the U.K. right back to square one,” May said. Then, repeating her threat, she added: “If we go down that road, we might never leave the E.U. at all.” If lawmakers do reject May’s deal again on Tuesday, she will be forced into another vote, where lawmakers decide whether to give their “explicit consent” to continue with a no-deal Brexit.","The U.K. Might 'Never Leave' the E.U.

Nicola Brentnall, QCT Chief Executive said “We are particularly delighted that the first opportunity of formally working together with Her Royal Highness comes on International Women’s Day. This squares perfectly with our focus on amplifying the work and contribution of those furthest away from power.” Kensington writes “In this new role, the Duchess will highlight the Trust’s partnerships with young people across the Commonwealth, and in particular its work supporting women and girls.” As a way of celebrating both International Women’s Day and the prestigious appointment, the Duchess will join a panel of female thought leaders and activists to discuss issues currently affecting women. Among the leaders are Annie Lennox OBE, founder of The Circle, and Adwoa Aboah, a model and founder of Gurls Talk. A video of the discussion will be shared by 12:00pm EST on the QCT website. The Duchess and former actress has been advocating for women’s rights around the world for several years. Before joining the Royal Family in 2018, she worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.",The Queen Just Gave Meghan Markle a Shiny New 'Vice President' Title.

1327,Amy Gunia,"Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has offered to return to North Korea to help restart negotiations on denuclearization, as progress has come to a standstill between Pyongyang and the administration of President Donald Trump. Carter, now 94 years old, told U.S. Representative Ro Khanna at a meeting in Atlanta on Thursday that although he no longer travels, he would be willing to go to North Korea if Trump wanted his help, Politico reports. Khanna also said that the meeting with Carter inspired him to get involved in North Korea negotiations himself, pledging to update a denuclearization strategy that Carter initially drew up with Kim Il Sung, the country’s first leader and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. Carter, who served as the 39th U.S. president, visited North Korea in 1994 to meet Kim Il Sung toward facilitating negotiations with the Clinton administration at a time when tensions were high between Pyongyang and Washington. It’s not the first time Carter has offered to help the Trump administration manage the delicate issue. In 2017, he told Trump’s then-National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster that he was willing to take the lead on negotiations. Talks between President Trump and Kim Jung Un collapsed in late February as the two leaders failed to reach an agreement at their second summit held in Hanoi. Analysts say Pyongyang appears to be ramping up activity at a factory where missiles were produced, as well as rebuilding part of a launch site it had earlier promised to dismantle.

1328,Hillary Leung,"It was more than 60 years ago when a pod of unusual-looking killer whales washed up on a New Zealand beach. With their snubbed noses and pointy fins, scientists had a hunch that these were no ordinary orcas. New research carried out in parts of the ocean off Chile may present viable proof that the animals are a distinct, never-before-discovered species of killer whales, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Bob Pitman, a researcher for NOAA, led the three-week expedition in Cape Horn, near the southern tip of Chile. There had earlier been reports that strange-looking orcas residing in those waters had been snatching the catch from fishermen. During a three-hour window that came after eight days of bad weather hampering their voyage, Pitman and his crew found themselves surrounded by about 30 killer whales that were distinctly different from the orca family they were used to studying. Underwater images captured from wide-angle cameras revealed unique color patterns and body shape. They had rounder heads, shorter noses and narrower, pointier fins, and the white patches around their eyes were smaller than those of other killer whales. By carefully shooting harmless crossbow darts towards the whales, which approached the vessel many times, the team was able to collect tiny skin samples for analysis. The animals have been termed “Type D whales”, adding to a list of three types of whales confirmed to be residing in the Southern Hemisphere, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation. “We are very excited about the genetic analyses to come. Type D killer whales could be the largest undescribed animal left on the planet and a clear indication of how little we know about life in our oceans,” Pitman said. The biopsy samples have been brought to the laboratory, where scientists will analyze DNA from their skin over the next few months.",Scientists Think They May Have Found a New Kind of Killer Whale,"March 8, 2019"
1329,Hillary Leung,"Thousands of civilians could still be inside the Islamic State’s last stronghold in eastern Syria, as ripples of evacuees exit the area ahead of plans by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) for a final assault. Reuters reports that the SDF has said it will wait for all civilians to be evacuated from Baghouz, near Syria’s border with Iraq, before advancing on the Islamic State’s last populated territory. “We are still hearing about the presence of thousands inside Baghouz,” SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali told al-Hadath television, according to Reuters. “We expect a fierce battle later on after the end of the civilian evacuation, given that those that will remain in Baghouz are the ones brimming with salafi jihadi ideology and the ones for whom surrender is not an option,” he added. SDF commander Adnan Afrin said Thursday he hoped the evacuations would “be completed today.” Families of Islamic State fighters, hundreds of whom have surrendered, have been leaving Baghouz in recent weeks, according to the SDF. Nearly 20,000 have walked for hours through a humanitarian corridor to exit, with some paying smugglers to help them evacuate. The Islamic State group has lost roughly 99% of its territory that was spread across much of Syria and Iraq at its height in 2014. U.S. President Donald Trump has said that ISIS is no longer a threat, declaring in a Dec. 19 video shared on Twitter that “we have won” and that ISIS “has been defeated” shortly after announcing that the U.S. would withdraw its 2,000 troops from Syria.",Civilians Stream Out of Islamic State's Last Syrian Enclave as Final Assault Looms,"March 8, 2019"
1330,Amy Gunia,"U.K. Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt announced Thursday that a British-Iranian aid worker being detained in Iran will receive diplomatic protection. The rare move is unlikely to be a “magic wand,” Hunt said, but it formally recognizes that the U.K. government views her treatment as unjust and illegal. “This represents a formal recognition by the British Government that her treatment fails to meet Iran’s obligations under international law and elevates it to a formal state-to-state issue,” Hunt said in a video statement shared on Twitter. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who worked as a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was detained while she was with her young daughter after visiting family in Iran in April 2016, Reuters reports. She was sentenced to five years in jail for allegedly plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, according to Reuters. Her family has denied the charges. Hunt said that he decided to take the “extremely unusual” step of granting a citizen diplomatic protection because of the “unacceptable treatment” of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who he called “an innocent woman.” The Iranian government has failed to provide her sufficient medical care or the right of due process, he added. According to Reuters, Zaghari-Ratcliffe began a hunger strike earlier this year to protest her treatment. “The U.K. will not stand by when one of its citizens is treated so unjustly,” said Hunt.",U.K. Takes 'Extremely Unusual' Step Granting Diplomatic Protection to a Dual National Detained in Iran,"March 8, 2019"
1331,Raisa Bruner,"Today is International Women’s Day, and even Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex is taking some time to mark the occasion by appearing on a panel alongside notable figures in England like Annie Lennox and Adwoa Aboah hosted by King’s College London. “If things are wrong, and there is a lack of justice and inequality, then someone needs to say something. And why not me?” she said, discussing her own start as a voice for women based on a childhood experience where she became active in working towards equality. She also touched on her past work with girls’ education in countries around the world and her plans with the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust, an organization that supports young leaders worldwide, of which she was named Vice-President on Friday. “It is about global feminism. It is about a parity and equality for all of us,” she went on. “It started at 11 [years old], but it still feels like it’s just the beginning.” This is not the first time Markle has celebrated the annual event with a high-profile engagement; back in 2015, she delivered a speech at the U.N. Women conference about gender and equality. “Women need a seat at the table. They need an invitation to be seated there, and in some cases, where this is not available, well then… they need to create their own table,” she said then. So Markle’s interest in women’s causes is no surprise, as many royal watchers and longtime Markle fans will already know. And it’s not necessarily a huge departure from the humanitarian work that others in the family like Prince Charles and Prince Harry have long taken on themselves. It is still significant when royals get political, however, because of the Queen’s impartial relationship to party politics. “You’ve got to be very careful in terms of how anything reflects on the Queen,” explains CNN royals commentator Victoria Arbiter to TIME. “She’s a politically neutral head of state. And the family is very careful in terms of where they go, because they can’t cause her any embarrassment.” This need for caution has been in place ever since the United Kingdom became a constitutional monarchy and reduced royal political powers in 1688. The reigning monarch is still technically responsible for a whole list of tasks, from appointing prime ministers to summoning and dissolving Parliament, and still holds the power to declare war and make peace. But the stability of the U.K. government is based on the fact that the monarch has remained politically neutral as head of state in the intervening centuries. That’s certainly the case for Queen Elizabeth II, who has now been the U.K.’s longest-reigning monarch at 92.",Meghan Markle Raised Her Voice Against Inequality.

1332,Edward Felsenthal,"In addition to co-founding TIME–96 years ago this week–Henry Luce is most famous for articulating his vision of the American Century. And while that vision takes its name from the U.S., its real focus–closely informed by his formative years abroad in China as the son of missionaries–was the shape of the world. Today, TIME continues to take measure of the world by providing our readers unparalleled access to its most influential figures. Since November 2017, led by International Editor Dan Stewart, TIME has published 15 interviews with leaders and leaders-to-be guiding their nations through this extraordinary period of global transformation. These include conversations with the leaders of France, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Colombia, Argentina, Thailand, Italy, Brazil (“I am not a troglodyte!” Jair Bolsonaro volunteered during his time with us), Armenia, Pakistan, Iraq, Austria (the world’s youngest head of government), Malaysia (the world’s oldest) and of course the U.S. For this week’s issue, Shanghai-based correspondent Charlie Campbell traveled to Dharamsala, in the Indian Himalayas, for a conversation with the spiritual leader of one of the world’s most secluded peoples, the Tibetans. Even as China continues to isolate him and attempts to co-opt Buddhism for its own purposes, Charlie says, “The Dalai Lama didn’t show an iota of bitterness, not to the Chinese government, nor the British or Americans who abandoned Tibet, nor anyone else.” Charlie’s story is accompanied by Ruven Afanador’s intimate photographs taken in and around the Dalai Lama’s private residence, and you can watch video of the interview here. This is in fact the third time the Dalai Lama has been on the cover of TIME. The first was in 1959, the year the Dalai Lama, then 23, fled Tibet disguised as a soldier. In 2008, the great travel writer and TIME contributor Pico Iyer profiled him again as China cracked down on Tibetan freedom demonstrations ahead of the Beijing Olympics. The Buddhist message of interdependence is a powerful one for today, when so many of our challenges are global and yet so much of our globe is deeply fragmented. “The Dalai Lama came across as a kind, genuine, fun-loving person,” says Charlie, who has interviewed the leaders of the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand, among others. “He’s one of a kind.” Contact us at editors@time.com.",Why the Dalai Lama’s Message Still Resonates Today,"March 7, 2019"
1333,Jay Root / The Texas Tribune,"Carlos had been thinking about migrating to the U.S. since he was a kid. In San Francisco de la Paz, a valley outpost ringed by lush hills in the lawless “Wild East” of Honduras, about the only business that’s booming is home construction—fueled by American dollars sent home each month from migrants living in the U.S. Remittances from former villagers helped Carlos scratch out a living, but with every dab of mortar he splashed on vacant homes, he longed to join their owners. Making $13 a day as a construction worker, he could barely afford to take care of his wife and daughter, let alone help his parents buy medicine for a range of ailments including diabetes, high blood pressure and thyroid disease. Plus, the street violence that has ravaged Honduras hit too close to home a few years ago, when a cousin was murdered by suspected drug traffickers. So last year, Carlos, 25, did what most Hondurans do when it’s time to get out: he approached one of the three local smugglers who operate in rural San Francisco de la Paz, which has a population of about 20,000. The smuggler gave him a price: $7,000 to cross the Rio Grande and seek asylum—but only if he took his little girl and they surrendered to the U.S. Border Patrol on the other side. Otherwise it would cost $10,000 to traverse Mexico and then evade a gauntlet of law enforcement at the border and the interior checkpoints beyond. Carlos’ wife Claudia pushed back. She feared sending their only daughter Heyli, who was 6 at the time, on a nearly 1,700-mile journey in uncertain conditions. She’d heard grisly stories of migrants suffocating in 18-wheelers or getting assaulted on the long trek through Mexico. Why couldn’t Carlos go by himself? “I told [the smuggler] many times, ‘Better alone,’” Claudia recalls. “But he said, ‘No, it will be easier, better with the girl.’” And cheaper. The decision was wrenching. Leaving would break up their tiny family and require them to go deep into debt. But Carlos and Claudia always dreamed of an easier life for Heyli, away from the grinding poverty of Honduras. So the deal was struck. Thousands of Central Americans are making the same calculation every month. Despite the Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy designed to deter illegal border crossing, the apprehension of “family units” on the U.S.-Mexico border has skyrocketed to record levels in recent months, according to the Border Patrol. In the past five months, Border Patrol agents were apprehending family units at a rate 338% higher than in the same period a year earlier. Unlike the attention-grabbing caravans that have been making their way to Tijuana, the movements of migrants who hire smugglers—and most migrants do—are not tracked by media outlets or in President Donald Trump’s Twitter feed. Like Carlos and Heyli, they slip through Mexico with smugglers, known as coyotes, who bribe cartels and corrupt cops and immigration agents along the way.

1336,Ian Bremmer,"“No Israeli leader is a king,” says Benny Gantz, the man hoping to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On April 9, Israelis will go to the polls for an election that will decide whether it’s time for the leader many know as King Bibi to leave the stage. Netanyahu is fighting for a new mandate and a fifth term. This may well be Bibi’s last stand. The country’s Attorney General has announced he intends to indict him on fraud, bribery and breach-of-trust charges in three separate criminal cases, although formal charges can’t be filed until after a hearing that won’t begin until votes have been cast. Gantz, Netanyahu’s former army chief, has mounted a formidable challenge–partnering with Netanyahu’s former Finance Minister Yair Lapid to form a centrist alliance. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has been forced to turn to far-right parties to find potential coalition partners. Gantz is a compelling character. He lacks Netanyahu’s charisma and grandiosity. He has tried to appeal to voters as a fresh face, free from past political entanglements. The child of Holocaust survivors, he tends to speak softly and carefully, even when calling the Prime Minister a would-be monarch. It’s an effective contrast with Netanyahu, a man of cigars and champagne. “I have always kept my hands clean,” Gantz says. Despite sharply contrasting personal styles, it’s unclear how much they differ on actual policy issues. In part, that’s because Gantz grants very few interviews and remains deliberately vague on economic plans. It’s also because on security policy, he has worked hard to convince voters that he’s neither soft nor a man of the left, as his former boss portrays him. Like Netanyahu, Gantz has avoided committing himself for or against an independent Palestinian state, but he also wants voters to believe he’ll be as uncompromising as Netanyahu in facing down adversaries. He talks tough on Hamas, Iran and Lebanon’s Hizballah. He boasts about the aggressiveness of operations he commanded in Gaza and the number of “terrorists” his troops have killed there. He promises to keep Jerusalem undivided, the Golan Heights defended and the West Bank under full Israeli security control. He refers to his alliance with Lapid as Blue and White, for the colors of Israel’s flag. In a country where a dozen army chiefs have entered politics and two have become Prime Minister, national security remains a national priority. And Gantz’s strategy makes sense, because Netanyahu’s tough stance on security has worked for Israel–even as it infuriates his critics, foreign and domestic. It might not be enough. There’s a reason Netanyahu is just one election victory away from replacing founding father David Ben-Gurion as the longest-serving Prime Minister in Israel’s history. He’s a shrewd politician with both a talent for exploiting grievance and a record of genuine accomplishment. Over the past decade, he has successfully wooed the Presidents of both the U.S. and Russia. He has improved relations with the Arab world without offering much to Palestinians. He has courted India and China. Israel has remained secure, and its economy has proved resilient and strong. His party, Likud, has held the Prime Minister’s office for 31 of the past 42 years. Gantz, on the other hand, has no political experience. But in an era when voters in the U.S., Britain, France, Italy, Brazil, Mexico and elsewhere have voted against their political establishments in favor of transformative change, Israeli voters may look beyond policy proposals and past successes to boost a new voice.",An Israeli General Presents the First Real Threat to Netanyahu in a Decade,"March 7, 2019"
1337,Aryn Baker,"After a spate of attacks on Ebola treatment facilities at the center of an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) suspended operations in the area on Feb. 28. With 894 cases and 561 deaths since the outbreak was declared in August, the epidemic is the second largest on record. In the wake of the attacks, the highly contagious virus is likely to spread. DIFFICULT DECISION After one clinic was set alight on Feb. 24, dozens of armed men flooded another on Feb. 27, shooting up sanitation facilities and setting more fires. At least one person was killed, and the whereabouts of several patients who fled into the forest–some of whom could be contagious–are unknown. MSF’s decision to withdraw was not an easy one for the organization, which was key in ending 2014’s West African outbreak. But its on-the-ground emergency coordinator, Emmanuel Massart, told NPR the attacks left him little choice: “When I send my teams, I need to be sure that they are going to come back alive.” THE TRUST PROBLEM Urgently putting into effect an Ebola treatment program can come at the expense of community education. Ebola’s initial symptoms resemble those of diseases like malaria, so the newly infected rarely seek help. Most are unaware that patients should be isolated and that the dead, still teeming with the virus, shouldn’t be buried in the traditional way. Combine ignorance and fear with eastern Congo’s long-simmering guerrilla war and a suspicion of strangers, and violence can erupt. Massart has said that, in retrospect, MSF should have engaged more with locals from the start. CONTAINING THE SPREAD Health officials are calling on the World Health Organization to declare a public-health emergency of international concern, which would mobilize international aid. But such a declaration often sparks travel restrictions that can cut off vital supply routes and prevent health experts from coming in. As MSF has discovered, progress in defeating Ebola often means taking a step backward for every two steps forward.

1339,Joseph Hincks,"How do other planets smell? Like a refrigerator at 3AM? Like the box new sneakers come in? Or the inside of an astronaut’s space suit? A three-day exhibition held in the crypt of a 19th century English church this weekend promised answers. “The Scent of Other Worlds” would present eight “sniffable” sculptures—one for each of the other planets in our solar system, plus the sun — and feature an “interplanetary soundscape” along with cosmic-themed cocktails. On Saturday, a group of Londoners eager to smell other worlds filed into the shabby-chic vestibule of St. John’s church in the city’s East End. In the crypt below, each sculpture stood on a plinth — inscribed with facts about the planet it represented and connected to the sort of foot pump used to inflate mattresses. When stepped on, the pumps spritzed perfume through the sculptures above. Some would be brought to MIT Space Week March 13, for a 50th anniversary celebration of the first Moon landing, where famous astronauts might sniff them. Rather than literal renderings of each planet’s smell, it turned out perfume company Design in Scent had used information about their surface composition and atmosphere as inspiration for a selection of fragrances. There hadn’t been a “slavish” devotion to physics, the project’s organizers admitted. Jupiter’s swirling gases were represented by “iso E super and aldehydes that bring a diffusive lightness,” according to one description, while “ambroxan and frankincense bring a spark of rich orange.” Whatever those things were, they smelled pleasantly musky: nothing like rotten eggs, cat pee, or bitter almonds—more likely associations of the layers of sulfur, ammonia, and hydrogen-cyanide that shroud Jupiter. At an earlier press launch, somebody had banged a gong and a man in a silver jacket stepped out from between the planets to address the crowd. He introduced himself as Sam Bompas. “The exhibit is drawing a line between your nose and the heavenly bodies,” Bompas said. Beside him, Jupiter glowed milky above its plinth. The three chunks of quartz-like rock that made up Venus glittered. You could see all the way through Saturn, which was made from hand-blown glass. This, though, was not the point. “We spend so much of our time articulating the visual world” Bompas continued. But the Scent of Other Worlds, offers “a rich experience with the Aristotelian lower senses.” Bompas is one half of the duo behind Bompas & Parr, a food design company that made its name shaping gelatin desserts like famous buildings and claims to be the first group to have recorded the sound of jelly wobbling. Other projects have included developing vaporized alcohol that audiences “drink” through their skin and eyes, and taking people “food tripping” with an African berry that tricks the tongue into tasting sour flavors as sweet.  More recently, Bompas has become obsessed with humans’ sense of smell: the brain decodes odors differently depending on which nostril sniffs them; which of the two nostrils is dominant switches throughout the day; and shortly after shaking somebody’s hand, we find a way to sniff our own. “There’s mysteries and wonders to the universe,” he said, “but there’s also mysteries and wonders in your own body.” In the east London crypt, repeated stomping on the foot pumps made the place smell like a fancy candle shop. Lucy Hardcastle, the London-based artist who designed each planet’s sculpture was smelling their associated fragrances for the first time. Did they match her idea of how the planets would be? “I don’t know if I can say that for sure,” she said, “but I do know that humans, in terms of psychology, are very accepting of what is presented to them.”  Hardcastle likes working with scents because they have the power to transport audiences in unpredictable, uncontrollable ways. “You don’t really have a say in that. You’re there, even if you don’t mean to be.”",A New Exhibition Tries to Answer the Unanswerable: What Do Other Planets Smell Like?,"March 7, 2019"
1340,Daniel Cancel / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Carnival is a beloved institution in Brazil, a wild, sensual celebration that dates back centuries. But to the country’s new socially conservative president, Jair Bolsonaro, it is a scandalous affair that symbolizes just how much the country has lost its moral compass.  And so he wasn’t about to let his first Carnival come and go without lashing out at its more extreme elements. Late Tuesday night, just as the festivities were winding down, Bolsonaro posted a video showing a scantily dressed man in leather appearing to touch himself in front of a crowd before bending down to be urinated on by another reveler during a Carnival procession. “I don’t feel comfortable showing this but we have to expose the truth so that people are aware and can take precaution,” Bolsonaro wrote when posting the video on Twitter. “This is what many street processions have become in Carnival. Draw your own conclusions.” On Wednesday morning, after his tweet went viral, Bolsonaro riled up Brazilians further with a follow-up tweet in which he asked, “What’s a golden shower?” Ever since he launched his presidential campaign last year, Bolsonaro has been a lightning rod of controversy in Brazil.

1341,Ian Bremmer,"Protests continue to rock Algeria, an energy-rich country that hasn’t experienced demonstrations of this magnitude in decades. The trigger is the decision of the sitting president—Abdelaziz Bouteflika—to run for a fifth term. In defiance of the protests, Bouteflika went ahead and filed the paperwork to run again for Algeria’s presidency this week. Or rather, a proxy of his did—more on that below.  Bouteflika managed to escape the 2011 Arab Spring unscathed by significantly upping the government’s welfare spending to help buy peace. That’s no longer an option. Why? The most pressing reason is that oil prices aren’t at the level where Algeria’s government can do that anymore (Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro can certainly commiserate). A second reason has to do with the fact that Algeria’s youth—like many other young populations in the region—suffers from high unemployment. Youth unemployment will take risky reforms and years to fix; it can’t be resolved over the next couple of months.  These two issues—falling oil revenues and high youth unemployment—plague several countries. In Algeria, they’ve fueled a combustible political situation. The fact that Algeria is also a major oil producer also means that sustained political unrest in the country has the potential to affect global oil markets as well. And its geographic location in North Africa means that a politically stable Algeria has been an important player in stabilizing migration flows from Africa into Europe. If the situation spirals out of control there, there are no guarantees as to what will happen.  Then there’s Bouteflika himself, who just celebrated his 82nd birthday on Saturday. Bouteflika has been running Algeria since 1999 and until 2011 was doing so under emergency rule (a holdover from a bloody civil war with an Islamic insurgency that left more than 200,000 people dead). In 2013, he suffered a stroke and has been seen very rarely in public ever since; his last public speech was in 2014. The reality is that his handlers (which include his brother and certain key military officials) have been running the country in his absence. The prospect of reelecting an infirm, largely incapacitated elderly person—which in effect means electing his patronage network—is too much for Algerians already aggrieved by the country’s political and economic situation to bear. The hundreds of thousands of protestors aren’t united on much beyond the fact that Bouteflika must step down. That’s a problem for Algeria in the long run, but a much bigger problem for Bouteflika and his patronage network in the short term. Authorities are bracing for more large marches later this week.  The announcement by Algeria’s ruling coalition on Sunday that Bouteflika would indeed run for a fifth term, but wouldn’t serve the full term marked a concession to protestors—and a sign that the elites propping him up are grasping at straws to cling to power in any way they can. Some question why they don’t just offer up another puppet candidate instead. The reason is there is nobody else who can ensure balance among the factions that have been profiting from Bouteflika’s presidency for years now — not to mention that anyone with a pulse now seems to pose an unacceptable risk to those same competing interests. High youth unemployment is a problem under the best of circumstances. It’s an existential threat when nearly 70 percent of the country is under the age of 30. “I am not saying this to scare people, no. I am not trying to take advantage of the past, but we should also remember that in Syria it also began with roses,” Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia.

1342,Josh Wingrove / Bloomberg,"Justin Trudeau’s government never directed Canada’s attorney general to intervene in a Quebec construction company’s legal case but did suggest she seek an outside opinion on the matter, a former top aide said. In televised testimony Wednesday in Ottawa, Gerald Butts laid out his version of events that have put the Canadian prime minister in political jeopardy ahead of an election. His comments come a week after former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould alleged Trudeau, Butts and others pressured her to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. settle corruption charges out of court. Trudeau’s former principal secretary said the prime minister’s marching orders to staff were to bear in mind potential job losses at the Montreal-based firm, and to work with the public service to consider all legal options. Wilson-Raybould was merely asked to consider a second opinion, he said, adding the final decision was hers to make. “We felt that outside advice was appropriate because of the extraordinary circumstances,” Butts told lawmakers on the House of Commons justice committee. “We also made clear that if the attorney general accepted our proposal and took external advice, she was equally free to reject that advice.” The former top prime ministerial aide, in his opening remarks, detailed conversations with Wilson-Raybould and said the topic of SNC-Lavalin came up only rarely. She never made her concerns plain to him early on, or wrote to Trudeau saying her decision was final, he said. Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to a different job in January. Butts said that decision had nothing to do with SNC-Lavalin, and that her objections around SNC only ramped up around that time. The story broke Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported — citing anonymous sources — that Wilson-Raybould felt pressured to intervene.

1343,Hillary Leung / Hong Kong,"New research shows that migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong make a major economic contribution on the city, revealing for the first time that the mostly female workforce employed largely in childcare and housekeeping added $12.6 billion to the economy last year alone. Hong Kong charity Enrich and global information services company Experian on Wednesday published the findings of a year-long survey examining just how much money migrant domestic workers pumped through the city in 2018. There are approximately 385,000 migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong, representing close to 10% of the city’s working population. Most of them are from the Philippines and Indonesia. Read more: ‘Mila,’ the Opera that Depicts the Lives of Domestic Helpers The study found that beyond making major economic contributions to Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region of China and one of Asia’s leading financial centers, domestic workers also play a key role in increasing the city’s female work force participation by relieving women of childcare responsibilities during the daytime. This ultimately allows many households to earn a higher income and increases overall family financial well-being. The cost of hiring domestic workers is at least three times cheaper than alternatives such as nurseries and private tutors, the report says. “The dual income individual families are able to access has significant knock-on effects, and allows them to attain a higher socioeconomic status,” Lucinda Pike, executive director of Enrich, told TIME. With more money coming in, families can invest in property, cars, and more educational opportunities for their children, allowing them to achieve a higher quality of life. The report also looked at the economic impact of domestic workers in Singapore and Malaysia, two Southeast Asian countries where migrant workers are commonly employed. While domestic workers have the largest economic footprint in Hong Kong, the research showed that they face some of the harshest economic conditions.

1344,Charlie Campbell / Beijing,"If last year was the Xi Jinping show, the 2019 National People’s Congress (NPC) — China’s annual rubberstamp parliament — has been all about the economy. Twelve months have past since Xi’s coronation as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong at last year’s NPC, when presidential term limits were officially scrapped and Xi’s eponymous political thought enshrined in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) charter. By comparison, this year’s NPC, which opened Tuesday, had a markedly less triumphant feel. It’s hardly surprising. Growth had slipped to its slowest rate in 28 years while crucial exports have also shrunk. Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative — a Beijing-bankrolled trade and infrastructure network tracing the ancient Silk Road — has encountered opposition from Hanoi to Madrid. Governments around the world are raising concern about China’s tech ambitions, particularly security concerns regarding 5G rollout. Premier Li Keqiang sounded a cautionary note during Tuesday’s Work Report, which forms the NPC’s opening address and is akin to a State of the Union. Next year’s growth forecast would be between 6% and 6.5%, Li revealed, the lowest level since 1990, with Li stressing “graver,” “unpredictable” and “more complex” risks ahead, while steering clear of acknowledging any missteps by the Xi leadership. “The more pressure Xi is under the less scope he has to acknowledge mistakes,” says Steven Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute. None of those pressures loom as large as the ongoing trade war with Washington. Li conceded that “trade disputes” had negatively impacted the economy, but insisted that Beijing had “appropriately” handled the situation. Beijing and Washington are close to finalizing a trade deal, according to U.S. President Donald Trump. “Outside of its own long list of domestic challenges, relations with the U.S. are of paramount concern for Xi Jinping and the Chinese leadership,” says Jude Blanchette, a senior China analyst for Crumpton Group, a business consulting firm. Tellingly, there was no mention of Made in China 2025 in the 35-page Work Report. The key strategic gambit to dominate certain hi-tech industries — such as aeronautics, Artificial Intelligence and semi-conductor chips — prompted a backlash from Washington, which has suggested it flouts WTO rules.",China Prepares for 'Unpredictable' Year Ahead at Subdued Annual Parliament,"March 6, 2019"
1345,Hillary Leung,"India’s flag carrier has instructed crew to end all in-flight announcements with the phrase “Jai Hind,” which translates to “hail the motherland,” causing some confused amusement among social media users. The BBC reports that deeply indebted Air India issued a memorandum to implement the new policy with “immediate effect,” requiring crew to recite the patriotic phrase “at the end of every announcement after a slight pause and with much fervor.” The policy was announced at a time of particularly high patriotism in India, as tensions simmer with Pakistan in the disputed Kashmir region. The two nuclear-armed neighbors have been locked in a standoff since a Feb. 14 suicide bombing by Pakistan-based militants killed 41 Indian troops. The following days were marked by deadly gunfire and tit-for-tat airstrikes, forcing civilians to flee border towns. Last week, Pakistan’s military claimed to have shot down two Indian warplanes and kept one Indian pilot in custody. He was released on March 1 in what Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan called a “gesture of peace.” Air India’s new policy was viewed by some as an attempt to seize nationalist sentiment to reinvigorate business. The BBC reports that the airline hasn’t turned a profit since 2007, and the company owes roughly 7.3 billion in debt, according to the Times of India.

1346,Amy Gunia,"North Korea has made repairs at a major missile launch site it had begun dismantling after agreeing with U.S. President Donald Trump to work toward denuclearization at their first meeting in Singapore last June. Reuters reports that the country began restoring the facility just two days after their second summit failed to produce an agreement between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jung Un in Hanoi late last week. The latest construction at the Sohae launch site, also known as the Tongchang-ri launch site, in the country’s north near the border with China, includes a new roof and door at the facility, according to Reuters. Jenny Town, managing editor at the Washington-based monitoring website 38 North, told Reuters that work on the launchpad can also be seen in satellite images. A report released by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), also based in Washington, says that satellite imagery dated March 2 “shows that North Korea is pursuing a rapid rebuilding of the long-range rocket site at Sohae.”  The construction “may indicate North Korean plans to demonstrate resolve in the face of U.S. rejection of North Korea’s demands at the summit,” CSIS said in a statement. Although Trump has repeatedly claimed that North Korea was willing to denuclearize after his first meeting with Kim, the dismantling of the Sohae site was one of the only signs of progress. Trump abruptly ended talks with Kim in the Vietnamese capital last week, saying that Pyongyang insisted the U.S. remove all sanctions on North Korea. But at a rare news conference held by the North Koreans, senior officials said they had only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for closure of their main nuclear site at Yongbyon.

The cyclist, Nicole Hanselmann, described the “awkward moment” in an Instagram post after Saturday’s annual Omloop Het Nieuwsblad race, during which male cyclists were given an eight-minute head start. As the race progressed, Hanselmann built a lead of almost two minutes against the other women cyclists and “almost saw the back of the men’s peloton.” “[Maybe] the other women and me were [too] fast or the men [too] slow,” she wrote in the Instagram post. Hanselmann, a 27-year-old cyclist and the 2017 national champion in Switzerland, said officials paused the women’s race to stop them from catching up to the men. She said their race was halted for “five or seven minutes.” While she was given a head start to regain her lead when the race began again, Hanselmann told Cyclingnews that she lost her momentum when the race came to an abrupt stop, and her competitors soon gained ground. She ultimately finished in 74th place. “It was a bit sad for me because I was in a good mood and when the bunch sees you stopping, they just get a new motivation to catch you,” Hanselmann also told Cyclingnews. “The race jury just said we had to neutralise the race because we are getting too close to the men.” In a tweet on Saturday, race officials confirmed the “neutralisation” of the women’s race “due to a very slow [men’s] race” and then tweeted about five minutes later to announce the women’s race was restarting.",A Female Cyclist Was Forced to Stop Mid-Race When She Almost Caught Up to the Men,"Updated: March 5, 2019 3:10 PM ET"
1348,Melissa Locker,"Move over, MacGuyver: some quick-thinking teens are being hailed as heroes for rescuing an 8-year-old boy who was dangling from a chairlift at a Vancouver ski resort using an unlikely assortment of items. The nightmarish scenario unfolded when the child was riding a chairlift at Grouse Mountain and somehow slipped from his seat. His father’s hand was the only thing holding the boy up as he dangled “20 or 25 feet in the air” over the mountain, Canada’s Global News reports. That’s when a group of five teenagers jumped into action After seeing the dire situation, one teen asked a grownup to go fetch the orange netting that the resort used to mark the ski resort’s off-limits area. The teens pulled padding from a pole and lined the net to make a soft cushion so the boy could land safely as they held the net taut. While they worked, another teenager tried to keep the boy calm as he dangled off the chairlift as panicking could have hastened his fall. Once the net and padding were set, the teens and two nearby adults got into place, pulling the make-do safety net tight. That’s when the teen heroes told the youngster to take off his skis and managed to convince the boy’s father to let go. The father decided to trust that their idea would work, and let go of his child. The bet paid off and the boy dropped safely into the net. The child was taken to the hospital as a precaution, but according to Global News, was more than fine, as he was reportedly skiing later that afternoon. The president of Grouse Mountain executives met with the heroic rescuers to thank the five teenagers and two adults for their quick action, and according to a follow-up story from Global News rewarded them with “Grouse Hero” passes, a complimentary season’s pass for next year as well as sweaters and hats.

1349,Ciara Nugent,"A.N. Devers has always had a fondness for unwanted things. As a child, her family moved around the U.S. a lot, following her father’s postings in the Air Force. In each new town, they’d go to yard sales, where Devers would dig through other people’s cast-offs and come up with interesting items to take home. A few decades later, that talent for spotting the overlooked is the driving force behind her unusual new bookstore, The Second Shelf. Tucked away in a peaceful courtyard off the busy streets of London’s Soho, the store almost exclusively offers rare books by women authors – a group that has rarely enjoyed the attention, or the price tag, afforded to male writers. Devers, a writer and book dealer, became obsessed with the discrepancy when, at a book fair in 2015, she saw (mostly male) traders relegating titles by renowned female authors like Joan Didion to the lower shelves and, tellingly, selling them for a tiny fraction of the cost of books by their male counterparts. “We don’t value women’s work the same way we do men’s,” Devers says. “It’s depressing. But it’s also exciting, because I can do something about it.” After Devers, 42, moved from New York to London – “a great town for people interested in rare books” – in 2016, she started meeting other women in the trade. The idea for The Second Shelf began to take shape. A prolific user of social media, Devers marshalled her thousands-strong following into powerful online attention for her project, which she initially intended as an online store. She raised over $40,000 on Kickstarter and garnered interest from high-profile figures in the book world.  The Second Shelf opened its reddish pink doors in November. Inside, the walls are papered with the kind of patterned end pages you find in beautiful old books, thousands of which are crammed into tall shelves and dark cabinets. Most are first editions, and many are signed and almost all are by women (a handful of male-authored books about women have made it in). The focus is modern fiction – Elizabeth Bowen novels, romances by Rosamunde Pilcher, poetry by Ntozake Shange. But there’s also travel writing, essays, guidebooks and more. Next year Devers’ first book, Train — a non-fiction exploration of trains in American culture published by Bloomsbury — will surely join them. In collecting these works and promoting them in the Second Shelf’s biannual review, Devers is hoping to correct a historical imbalance in the book trade that has left women authors forgotten over the years. In the U.K., early bookmen (the term for rare book dealers) were “country gentleman who ran estates, and amassed libraries of books to show their wealth and intelligence,” Devers says. There have been some famous bookwomen, she adds, citing Belle da Costa Greene, who built the famous Morgan Library in New York. But for the most part, it has typically been men who decide which books are worth collecting, preserving and passing down to future generations. As in other male-led creative industries of television, film, and the news media, “they focus on themselves,” Devers says. The effect is a stark absence of women’s work among what society considers to be the most valuable cultural artefacts. In January, the Second Shelf went viral on Twitter after Devers pointed out that only eight books by women appeared in a list, compiled by a trade website, of the 500 biggest sales at auction in the books and paper field in 2018. Even among more recently published works, a 2018 study found that books by women are sold for on average 45% less than books by men. “In a capitalist society, where we put our money shows where we see value. We’ve been taught to find value in something really narrow,” Devers says. “It’s time to explore something different.” Devers’ brick-and-mortar shop – made possible by a good deal on the rent from local estate agents – is the physical site of a mostly online movement pushing back against the status quo. (The online store, which Devers promised on her Kickstarter, is on its way). The Second Shelf is named for a 2012 New York Times essay by Meg Wolitzer critiquing the sexist treatment of women’s fiction. Since then, many have promoted the idea of reading only books by women for a year, while student activists have increasingly called on universities to diversify their largely white and male reading lists.",Inside the Bookstore That Wants to Gender-Balance Our Bookshelves,"March 5, 2019"
1350,Kirstine Holst,"On a summer night in 2017, I stayed over at a close friend’s house in Copenhagen after a late meeting as I had done before. In the middle of the night, I awoke to find a man climbing into my bed. He put his arm around my throat and then climbed on top of me. Pinning me roughly to the mattress, he raped me. That man was my friend. We had known each other for several years, since I was in my early thirties, and I trusted him. Sometimes if I was in Copenhagen, I would stay at friends’ houses to save myself the 160-mile drive back to my home in Jutland just as I did a year and a half ago. That night changed my life.  The next day I was in shock. It took me a whole day to even say the word “rape.” Instead I found myself using the word “accident,” and in many ways the sensation at the time was not that dissimilar to the disorientation one feels after having been involved in a violent car crash. And the trauma does not go away. Sadly, my experience of rape is not uncommon. Paradoxically, despite its image as a land of gender equality, the reality for women in Denmark is starkly different. As revealed in a report by Amnesty International published Tuesday, there is a pervasive “rape culture” in Denmark with shockingly high levels of impunity for sexual violence and antiquated rape laws, which fail to meet international legal standards. Rape in Denmark is hugely under-reported and even when women do go to the police, the chances of prosecution or conviction are very slim. Of the women who experienced rape or attempted rape in 2017 (estimates vary from 5,100 according to the Ministry of Justice to 24,000 according to a recent study.) just 890 rapes were reported to the police. Of these, 535 resulted in prosecutions and only 94 in convictions. As I have found out first hand through my experience of trying to navigate the justice system over the last year and a half, women and girls are being failed by dangerous and outdated laws. Rape is often not reported through fear of not being believed, stigma and a lack of trust in the justice system. Even when it is, the barriers to justice can prove insurmountable. The reason for the low conviction rates lies in deeply-entrenched biases within the justice system, and lack of trust in that system contributes to under-reporting.",Denmark Is Supposed to Be a Land of Gender Equality.

Treasury Board President Jane Philpott announced her resignation on Monday, writing in a statement that she has been “considering the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks” and has made the decision to quit “after serious reflection.” Trudeau’s government has been swept up in controversy since his former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the administration of trying to stop a criminal case against Quebec-based firm SNC-Lavalin, one of the world’s largest engineering and construction companies.

1353,Amy Gunia,"U.S. lawmakers have appealed to the Trump Administration to take action against “egregious human rights abuses” in western China, where it is believed that at least one million ethnic Uighur and other minority Muslims are being held in secretive internment camps. In a letter addressed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs said Monday that the Administration had taken “no meaningful action” since the body sent a request in August calling for sanctions that would freeze the travel and assets of officials responsible for abuse. “The United States must stand up for the oppressed and, at every opportunity, make clear to the Chinese government that the situation [in Xinjiang] is a priority for the U.S. Government,” the letter said. The committee said it received a reply from the State Department in September pledging to look into the request, but that nothing had since been done and the global response to the crisis has to date been “insufficient.” The letter also called for controls on the export of technology used to both detain and surveil the minority, which resides predominantly in China’s western Xinjiang Province. Recent reports claiming that U.S. companies have contributed to their persecution are of “particular concern,” the letter said. Lawmakers singled out Chinese tech firms Hikvision and Dahua as having “profited from the surge of security spending in Xinjiang.” China claims that its policy of sending Muslims to so-called “re-education camps” has been an effective means of preventing homegrown terrorism.

1354,Olivia B. Waxman,"On Monday, Pope Francis announced a decision that promises to shed light on a controversial period of Vatican history: starting on March 2, 2020 — years ahead of schedule — the Vatican will let historians access sealed documents about Pope Pius XII, who led the Church during the Holocaust. Eight decades after Pius XII was elevated to Pontiff on March 2, 1939, his legacy has become the subject of great debate. He has been portrayed as having not done enough to publicly condemn the Nazi genocide of Jewish people in Italy and throughout Europe, and his critics hope historians studying the archive will be able to figure out exactly what his role was in the Church’s approach to that issue. On the other hand, those who say Pius XII privately helped save Jews in other ways hope the new batch of unsealed documents will contain more evidence of this kind, especially anything that could bolster his case for sainthood. “The church is not afraid of history,” Pope Francis said on Monday, while acknowledging that Pope Pius XII’s legacy includes “moments of grave difficulties, tormented decisions of human and Christian prudence, that to some could appear as reticence.”  Before he became Pius XII, the Pope in question was Eugenio Pacelli, son of a Vatican lawyer. Before he became pope, he served as both the Vatican’s ambassador to Germany and the Vatican’s Secretary of State. During his tenure, he supported General Franco during the Spanish Civil War and the harmonious Vatican-Mussolini alliance led to the creation of the sovereign state of Vatican City in 1929. It was during Italian dictator Benito Mussolini‘s Fascist rule that Pacelli was declared Pope. From the beginning, the world had many questions about the nature of the working relationship between the Vatican and the Fascist regime. “In general the most serious charges against the Church concern the skill with which the Vatican and its hierarchs have fished and swum in the Fascist sea surrounding them,” TIME noted in an Aug. 16, 1943, cover story on the issue.  And yet, feeling about the Pope was perceived as generally positive during the war. Though he never publicly condemned the Nazis for the murder of Europe’s Jew, Pius XII would often speak in general terms about protecting minorities and hating war. In 1942, a Vatican official said Pope Pius XII “neither understands nor approves” of the persecutions of French Jews, and the Church as an institution was often seen as contrary to the values of Fascism. “No matter what critics might say, it is scarcely deniable that the Church Apostolic, through the encyclicals and other papal pronouncements, has been fighting against totalitarianism more knowingly, devoutly and authoritatively, and for a longer time, than any other organized power,” TIME noted back in 1943. The Chief Rabbi of Rome, Israel Zolli, praised his efforts in 1944. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter That praise came in a complicated context. After all, the Pope wasn’t the only one who had to make calculations about how to reach his goals in that war-torn era. “Everyone wanted to claim the Pope was on their side, so political leaders weren’t going to publicly chastise the Pope or accuse him of cozying up to fascists or Nazis,” says David I. Kertzer, who wrote about this period in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe.

1355,Melissa Chan,"Every year, thousands of families are thrust into a state of limbo when a loved one suddenly goes missing. In one of the most eerie instances, when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished from the skies exactly five years ago this March, a lack of clues kept investigators from making sense of the tragedy, depriving more than 200 families of closure. It’s one of the many inexplicable incidents that continue to puzzle authorities and haunt the relatives left behind. Other unsolved cases range from those the FBI has abandoned, like the nearly 50-year-old hunt for the notorious criminal known as D.B. Cooper, to those still ongoing, like the search for Indiana University student Lauren Spierer, who vanished in 2011. Out of a century’s worth of unsolved disappearances that TIME has revisited, here are five of the most mysterious cases: In what is perhaps the most baffling and tragic aviation mystery of all time, more than 200 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 appeared to vanish mid-air on March 8, 2014. Despite government officials setting out on what they called an “unprecedented” search by air and sea that involved multiple countries and spanned at least three years, the aircraft and the remains of the 239 passengers remain missing. It’s also still unclear what caused the commercial plane to suddenly veer off course. The trip began as usual when the Beijing-bound Boeing 777 aircraft departed as scheduled from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, carrying 12 crew members and 227 passengers. But it went missing soon after a routine handover between air traffic control systems. Instead of heading to its planned destination, the aircraft flew back across the Malaysian Peninsula and made its way to the southern Indian Ocean, officials said. During a news conference last summer, after the release of the latest safety investigation report into the incident, lead investigator Kok Soo Chon said no cause could be confirmed or ruled out. “Due to the significant lack of evidence available to the team,” he said, “we are unable to determine with any certainty the reason that the aircraft diverted.” At some point, the aircraft systems were manually turned off. But Kok said signs did not appear to indicate that the flight’s pilots had maliciously cut off communication. (Some aviation experts had contradicted this conclusion in a 60 Minutes Australia special in May 2018.) There was also the possibility that a third party illegally interfered, investigators said. However, Kok pointed out the unusual fact that no one has since claimed responsibility for the act. “Who would do it just for nothing?” he said. Nearly 50 years ago, an unidentified passenger hijacked a Seattle-bound flight before leaping out of the moving plane with a parachute and $200,000 in ransom money. The daredevil—a man who became known as D.B. Cooper—has since eluded authorities and has almost faded into legend. On Nov. 24, 1971, Cooper bought a one-way plane ticket on Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 at an airport counter in Portland, Ore., according to FBI records. Dressed in a suit and tie, the traveler didn’t appear to arouse any suspicion as he ordered a bourbon and soda while waiting for the plane to take off. Shortly after the plane was in the air, Cooper handed one of the flight attendants a note that said he had a bomb in his briefcase. He demanded four parachutes and $200,000 in $20 bills, which he received once the 36 other passengers on board were freed when the flight landed in Seattle. Keeping several members of the flight crew on the plane, Cooper ordered them to fly to Mexico City. But then the hijacker surprised his hostages and federal investigators when he suddenly jumped out of the back of the plane long before reaching Mexico. The FBI does not believe Cooper survived, though that theory has never been confirmed. Investigators say he did not appear to be an expert skydiver since he made the jump at more than 5,000 feet in risky conditions. He was also not dressed suitably for a safe landing. According to FBI records, Cooper leaped into a wooded area at night while it was raining with 200-mph winds, wearing loafers and a trench coat.",The 5 Most Mysterious Unsolved Disappearances of All Time,"March 4, 2019"

Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex and Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge have come in for their fare share of online abuse over the past few years.

Spam, defamation, obscenity, offensive language, threats and explicit material are all off-limits, as are comments that “promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age.” The royal team is reserving the right to hide, delete, block and report comments and users that deviate from these new norms.

1357,Billy Perrigo,"Pope Francis announced Monday that the Vatican’s archives on controversial World War II-era pope Pius XII would be opened up eight years earlier than planned, in 2020, a move seen as an olive branch to Jews who have criticized the Vatican for not doing enough during the Holocaust. “The church is not afraid of history,” Pope Francis said, announcing the move in a speech to members of the Vatican’s Secret Archives. “On the contrary, it loves it, and would like to love it even more, like it loves God.” Papal archives are usually opened to historians 70 years after the end of a pope’s rule, but the Church has come under pressure to reveal Pius XII’s records earlier than that, while aging Holocaust survivors are still alive. Many Jewish groups have been calling on the Vatican to open the archives for decades. Rabbi David Rosen, of the American Jewish Committee, welcomed the news, telling Reuters it would help historians to “acknowledge both the failures as well as the valiant efforts made” during the Holocaust. The Catholic Church has said Pius, who was pope from 1939 until his death in 1958, worked quietly to save Jews during the Holocaust, while remaining tight-lipped to protect Catholics in Nazi-occupied countries. Indicating he agreed with that line, Pope Francis said Monday that the Pius papacy included “moments of grave difficulties, tormented decisions of human and Christian prudence, that to some could appear as reticence,” but hinted that the documents included evidence of attempts “to keep lit, in the darkest and cruelest periods, the flame of humanitarian initiatives, of hidden but active diplomacy.” Historians will be able to judge those claims against the archival record beginning on March 2, 2020, when the church now plans to unseal the documents. In 2014, Francis said “I don’t want to say that Pius XII did not make any mistakes — I myself make many — but one needs to see his role in the context of the time … for example, was it better for him not to speak so that more Jews would not be killed or for him to speak.”",Pope Francis Says Secret Archives On Holocaust-Era Pope Pius XII Will Be Opened Early,"March 4, 2019"
1358,Amy Gunia,"Hackers linked to North Korea continued waging cyberattacks against U.S. companies and other targets while leaders from Washington and Pyongyang met for their second summit last week, the New York Times reports. Throughout the ongoing, 18-month operation, hackers from Lazarus group have persistently targeted key industries, including energy and telecommunications, as well as government and defense sectors, according to a report California-based cybersecurity firm McAfee published Sunday. Researchers at McAfee say they discovered the campaign, dubbed “Operation Sharpshooter,” in December 2018, but have evidence that it may have started as early as September 2017. Working with an undisclosed law enforcement agency, McAfee says its researchers got access to one of the main computer servers used by the hackers. The researcher then watched attacks unfold in real-time. “[The hackers] are very, very, very active. It’s been nonstop,” Raj Samani, chief scientist at McAfee, told the Times. The operation’s attacks have focused mainly on banks, utilities and oil and gas companies, hitting over 100 targets in the U.S. and other Western countries, according to the Times. Most U.S. targets were in Houston and New York City, but other international cities like London, Madrid, Tokyo, Tel Aviv and Hong Kong were also hit. Cities in Russia and mainland China, which maintain good relations with North Korea, did not receive many attacks. McAfee declined to name which companies were hit. The attacks were highly sophisticated and perpetrated to access computer networks and intellectual property at specific companies, according to the firm. The new information from McAfee shows that although North Korea has not tested a missile in more than 15 months, it may have continued to wage its cyber war with the West unabated.","North Korea Conducted Cyberattacks on the U.S. During the Trump-Kim Summit, Report Says","March 4, 2019"

The renewed interest comes as families of the deceased passengers mark the fifth anniversary of the aircrafts’s mysterious disappearance on March 8, 2014. “If there are any credible leads or specific proposals…. we are more than willing to look at them and we are prepared to discuss with them the new proposals,” said Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke. Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was carrying 239 people when it went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Pieces of debris washing up along the Indian Ocean coastline narrowed previous searches but did not lead to the site of the wreckage. A $141 million underwater effort by Malaysia, China and Australia was called off in January 2017 after it made little progress. A second, three-month hunt by U.S. exploration firm Ocean Infinity similarly concluded in May last year. Loke said Ocean Infinity has expressed interest in another search using new technology, but has yet to offer a proposal. Malaysia offers a “no cure, no fee” agreement, which means that firms will be paid only if they manage to locate the aircraft, Reuters reports.

1361,Bloomberg,"Juan Guaido’s first stop after he skipped out of Venezuela last week was Colombia. But after he failed to push food and medicine across the borders to hasten the end of autocratic President Nicolas Maduro’s rule, he headed to Brazil. He was in Argentina Friday following meetings in Paraguay, and is heading to Ecuador today to be received by President Lenin Moreno. Peru’s President Martin Viscarra has also invited Guaido to Lima, according to the deputy foreign minister. The opposition leader insists he’ll be home soon, but his lengthening regional tour raises questions about just how and when he intends to get back to Caracas. Guaido, head of the opposition-dominated National Assembly, risks not only being blocked from re-entering Venezuela, but being tossed into jail after violating a foreign-travel ban. Meanwhile, the amnesty he promised military officers who join him languishes in his own legislature and resurgent street protests have lost their focal point. The U.S., which along with some 50 other nations recognizes Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader after sham elections, has threatened severe repercussions if Maduro takes direct action against his chief rival. Still, Venezuela’s ruling socialists have already exiled and thrown hundreds of dissidents behind bars. Guaido, a 35-year-old congressman, says his tour is meant to deepen ties with allies and plan how to defeat a dictatorship. Yet the longer he stays abroad, the more the likelihood that his movement to unseat Maduro will lose momentum after the effort to bring humanitarian aid into Venezuela was brutally crushed last week. “We will be back in Caracas very soon to continue the work we swore to do for all of Venezuela,” he said in Asuncion following a closed door meeting with President Mario Abdo Benitez. Later Friday, Guaido flew to Argentina where he was received by President Mauricio Macri. Following a roughly 30-minute meeting with Argentina’s leader, Guaido again said he’d return home in the coming days and that the National Assembly on Saturday would announce dates for protests against the government. He also addressed another concern. “Intervention in Venezuela is not like delivering a pizza, it takes much responsibility,” Guaido said. “Nobody wants the use of force.”","Venezuela's Juan Guaido Travels Across South America, While Possible Imprisonment Awaits in Caracas","March 2, 2019"
1362,Billy Perrigo,"On Sunday, when citizens of the tiny Baltic nation of Estonia go out to vote for their next parliament, many of their compatriots will have already voted — from the comfort of their own homes. That’s because Estonia is the world leader in electronic voting. Since 2005, Estonians have been able to cast their ballots from a computer with an Internet connection anywhere in the world. The government says 30% of Estonia’s population of 1.3 million people use the system, and that its simplicity helps save the country a total of 11,000 working days each election year.  Things are different in the U.S., where voting machines in polling stations are common but voting online is not available. In recent years, U.S. elections have thrown up stories of voter machine meltdown, citizens unable to vote because of technical difficulties, and even the devices casting votes for the wrong candidate because of malfunction or malfeasance. In the 2016 Presidential election, there were credible reports of voters being turned away after waiting in line for hours thanks to machines breaking down, and allegations that some machines had ‘flipped’ votes because of poor touchscreen calibration. Estonia’s last parliamentary elections in 2015, by contrast, ran without a hitch. A record number of Estonians—176,491 to be exact—cast their votes online, and were able to change their minds as many times as they liked before polls closed, with only their last decision being counted. While identity authentication (with citizen ID numbers) was necessary to prevent fraud, the system removed identifying factors by the time the vote was logged, “thereby ensuring anonymity,” according to the Estonian government.  That’s all the more impressive given that the Baltic state, which was part of the Soviet Union until it collapsed, now shares a border with Russia. As Russia’s tactics of information and cyber warfare have become more established under President Vladimir Putin, Estonia has had to fend off the influence of its domineering neighbor. In 2007, widespread riots erupted in Estonia over the relocation of a statue commemorating a Soviet soldier. Amid the unrest, Estonia was hit by a series of distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which temporarily crippled the country’s online governance system. (The Estonian government says 99% of public services are available online.) The government blamed the attacks on the Kremlin; Russia denied involvement. Despite those strained relations, Estonian elections have consistently been determined free and fair by observers, with no major allegations of interference. And as of Friday, Estonia’s election committee had not reported any attempts to meddle with the vote, with more electronic votes counted than ever before. So, should the U.S. implement a similar electronic voting system to Estonia’s? Not so fast, says J. Alex Halderman, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Michigan. In 2014, he and a team of analysts visited Estonia to conduct a security analysis, which found a “series of alarming problems.”",What the U.S. Can Learn About Electronic Voting From This Tiny Eastern European Nation,"March 1, 2019"
1363,Billy Perrigo,"The parents of Otto Warmbier, the U.S. citizen who died in 2017 after being imprisoned by North Korea, issued a stinging rebuke Friday after President Donald Trump’s defense of dictator Kim Jong Un. “We have been respectful during this summit process. Now we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto,” Fred and Cindy Warmbier said in a statement. “Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that.” Their statement came one day after Trump’s summit with Kim in Vietnam. In response to a question at a press conference, Trump said he believed Kim when the North Korean leader said he knew nothing about Warmbier’s imprisonment. “He tells me that he didn’t know about it and I will take him at his word,” Trump said. Kim “felt badly about it,” he added. “He felt very badly.” Trump responded to the Warmbiers’ criticism on Friday afternoon, saying his comments had been “misinterpreted.” “Of course I hold North Korea responsible for Otto’s mistreatment and death. Most important, Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain,” Trump tweeted. “Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often!” Warmbier was arrested in 2016 for allegedly stealing a propaganda banner while on a trip to North Korea. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, but entered a coma in unspecified circumstances shortly afterwards. He was released in 2017 and sent back to the U.S., but died just days later.

1364,Josh Wingrove / Bloomberg,"Justin Trudeau’s ship may be sinking, but he’s not changing course. The Canadian prime minister plowed ahead Thursday after his former attorney general alleged, in explosive testimony aired on national television, that he interfered in the justice system by pressing to end a criminal case against an iconic Quebec construction firm. Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau insisted again his government had every right to consider the job losses that could result from a guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. The scandal has suddenly made Trudeau vulnerable, consuming his Liberals in the run-up to an election in which he’d have otherwise have been the frontrunner. He’s lost his polling lead for the first time since June, and the controversy has undermined his personal brand as a progressive leader who singlehandedly returned his moribund party to power in 2015 on a pledge of change. “It’s very damaging and it’s very serious,” said Penny Collenette, a University of Ottawa professor who served as director of appointments under a former Liberal prime minister. Every politician wants to protect jobs, she said. “But I think the question that needs to be asked here is: at what cost?” Trudeau’s fate depends on several factors — including whether cabinet stands by him and the Liberals stay united. Only a handful of lawmakers have voiced any measure of support for Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet last month but remains a Liberal member of parliament. The prime minister hasn’t decided yet whether to force her out of the party’s caucus. Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the center of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis. “If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,” Nanos said in a telephone interview. “I can’t remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can’t even agree, how is it that they can govern?” The latest polls already show the Liberals have lost their lead in voting intentions.

1365,Ian Bremmer,"A certain U.S. President and a certain North Korean leader met in Vietnam this week to make progress towards denuclearization and thawing relations between the two countries. They did not make progress on either of those fronts, and the summit in Hanoi ended abruptly without any agreement. The fact that nuclear weapons are involved makes this particularly important. But beyond that, people worried President Donald Trump would give away the store without getting anything in return (a fear compounded by the Michael Cohen congressional hearings on Wednesday that gave Trump even more incentive to change the media narrative) can now breathe a big sigh of relief. But while all the headlines you will read this week will declare the Hanoi summit a failure (and with a certain amount of smugness to boot), the truth is that there’s a far smaller threat of escalation on the North Korea issue now than when Trump began his diplomatic outreach to Kim Jong Un. South Korea now has new and more stable relations with Pyongyang.  And the U.S. President still has a better chance of achieving a breakthrough with North Korea than any of his predecessors. Trump still wants to make a deal with Kim, and that desire aligns nicely with his desire to spend less money protecting allies in Asia, as we saw by his decision to suspend military exercises last year.  None of his predecessors would have ever done that, likely seeing it as a “give” without anything in return. Trump saw it as an opportunity to spend less money and jumped at it. And most Presidents wouldn’t have even met with Kim without concrete concessions on the table. For Trump, meeting Kim was an opportunity to showoff his deal-making skills. The mere fact that Trump doesn’t view these American moves as “giveaways” give him much more space for achieving a legitimate breakthrough than any who have come before him, even if the prospects for that breakthrough remain small. The abrupt end to the summit is unlikely to heighten tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, as Trump went out of his way in the press conference afterward to highlight his good relationship with Kim and emphasize that dialogue between the two sides will continue. He also mentioned that Kim promised to stop ordering nuclear and missile tests, and said nothing of increasing American pressure against Pyongyang. Beyond that, it’s not clear. Both sides will go back home and rethink their strategies vis-a-vis the other. Hawks in Japan and South Korea will use the failed summit and rumors that Trump has moved off his demand that North Korea completely denuclearize as a pretext to argue for strengthening their own nuclear capabilities, but are unlikely to get much traction at this point. South Korean President Moon Jae-in will face much more criticism at home from political opponents who always thought that he was too soft on Kim, and the lack of progress at this week’s summit will hit the planned increase in economic cooperation between the two Koreas.  Kim Jong Un reportedly wanted Donald Trump to lift all sanctions in exchange for less-than-complete denuclearization, which Trump balked at. Kim probably figured that Trump was so desperate to achieve a breakthrough in the shadow of the Cohen testimony that he overplayed his hand.",The Quick Read on the Trump-Kim Summit in Hanoi,"March 1, 2019"

1367,Hillary Leung,"Measles cases are soaring around the world, including in areas previously declared measles free, according to the U.N. Children’s Fund. Last year, 98 countries reported an uptick of measles cases, UNICEF said Thursday, while pinning the “alarming” resurgence of the disease on poor infrastructure and conflict in some cases, and “complacency” and an anti-vaccine movement in others. “Almost all of these cases are preventable, and yet children are getting infected even in places where there is simply no excuse,” said Henrietta H. Fore, UNICEF’s executive director. Just 10 countries accounted for about three-quarters of the total rise, according to UNICEF, which analyzed data from the World Health Organization. Ukraine, Philippines and Brazil saw the largest increases. In Ukraine, there were 35,120 cases of measles in 2018, up from 4,782 in 2017. The government reported that another 24,042 people were infected in just the first two months of 2019. Brazil, which had no reported cases in 2017, recorded 10,262 last year. Measles, a respiratory illness, is more contagious than Ebola, tuberculosis or influenza. There is no specific treatment for measles, so vaccination can mean the difference between life and death, according to UNICEF. “This is a wake up call. We have a safe, effective and inexpensive vaccine against a highly contagious disease – a vaccine that has saved almost a million lives every year over the last two decades,” Fore said.","Measles Cases Are Increasing Worldwide Amid 'Mistrust and Complacency,' U.N.

Confusion over the girl’s legal guardianship caused the a delay until her 23rd week of pregnancy, at which point doctors argued it was too risky to carry out the procedure. The girl’s mother had approved an abortion, but since the child lives with her grandmother, the mother’s consent was deemed insufficient. The grandmother’s approval was also considered inadequate since her legal guardianship was terminated over her relations with the alleged-rapist. Several doctors reportedly refused to perform the procedure due to personal beliefs. The baby was born alive, but doctors said its chances of survival are poor, according to the BBC. Local media reported city by the BBC say that the girl was clear about her desire to end the pregnancy. “I want this thing the old man put inside me taken out,” she reportedly told officials. That the girl was forced to deliver the baby via c-section has caused uproar among human rights activists. “When this 11-year-old rape victim entered [the] hospital requesting a legal abortion, the authorities’ number one duty should have been protecting her life and health.

1371,Francisco Bencosme,"Yet again, President Donald Trump has failed to raise North Korea’s dire human rights record at a major historical summit with Kim Jong Un. When asked about it during a press conference, Trump appears to have excused and enabled Kim Jong Un’s worst actions. He gave Kim a platform on the world stage only to showcase his own disdain for human rights. What a reversal from the beginning of the Trump Administration, when Trump got in front of the U.S. Congress and pronounced his commitment to ensure freedom for the North Korean people. He did the same in front of the National Assembly in Seoul. Both instances took place before Trump and Kim “fell in love.” Time and time again, Trump continues to laud and relish his personal chemistry with Kim at the expense of spotlighting relentless and grave human rights violations. In Hanoi, he even took Kim’s words at face value concerning the death of the American citizen, Otto Warmbier. Despite opening up to the outside world to discuss denuclearization and economic cooperation, North Korea has yet to show solid evidence of any improvements in its dire human rights record. There is no sign that grave and systematic human rights violations such as arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearances, are ending in the country. Some of these may amount to crimes against humanity. Judge Thomas Buergenthal, a co-author of a 2017 report from the International Bar Association War Crimes Committee, survived Auschwitz and said North Korea’s labor camps are as bad as those run by the Nazis.  As a result of Trump glossing over the regime’s actions, Kim Jong Un and other North Korean officials who are responsible for these crimes continue to go unpunished. The U.N. has recommended that its Security Council discuss actions regarding the human rights situation in North Korea, including possible referral to the International Criminal Court. Up to 120,000 people remain in detention in four known political prison camps, where they are at risk of forced labor, executions and other human rights violations. Testimonies of North Koreans who left the country, together with satellite images, have proven the operation of these camps.  The North Korean government, however, continues to deny that they exist. Does Donald Trump take that at face value as well? The world must wonder. Human rights violators all around the world must as well. They see a U.S. President who is willing to excuse human rights violations, not just turning a blind eye. North Koreans also remain restricted from freely expressing their opinions, and from communicating with the outside world. There are no independent newspapers, while access to the Internet is limited to select few. Families separated by the inter-Korean border find it almost impossible to stay in contact, as they face the risk of arbitrary surveillance, interference and detention by the authorities.  Pyongyang remains largely closed to the international community on the issue of human rights. Tomás Ojea Quintana, the U.N. expert on human rights in North Korea, has repeatedly requested a visit to the country, but this has never been granted.

1372,Feliz Solomon / Hanoi,"When the leaders of the U.S. and North Korea met in the Vietnamese capital determined to make a deal on denuclearization, few predicted that the outcome would be, in a nutshell, nothing. But when talks collapsed Thursday between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, the consensus among experts was that a whimper was a better way to conclude the summit than a bang. Trump said talks broke down when Kim brought an unacceptable offer to the table: a blanket removal of U.S. sanctions in exchange for partial denuclearization. Trump entered negotiations at a disadvantage; problems were piling up at home, and Kim may have overplayed his hand on the assumption he’d take a win wherever he could find it. “They wanted the sanctions lifted in entirety, and we couldn’t do that,” Trump said in Hanoi. “We had to walk away from that.” Trump and Kim were widely expected to reach some form of agreement that in principle would formally end the Korean War in exchange for concrete commitments on denuclearization — a tradeoff that analysts were ready to call an unacceptable giveaway. Reporters in Hanoi were caught off guard however when a scheduled “signing ceremony” was suddenly canceled and the White House Press Secretary said in a statement that, “No agreement was reached at this time.” The underwhelming outcome has already been described as both a “failure” and “the right move.” On the one hand, it delays further talks and throws fundamental disagreements — such as the definition of denuclearization and the importance of inventory in any further negotiations — into stark relief. On the other hand, several experts shared the same sentiment, borrowing a phrase from U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May: “No deal is better than a bad deal.” “This is the start of a long process,” says David Kim, a research analyst at the Stimson Center. “It’s like there are two lovers; they’re going to have their fights, but ultimately, if they’re committed, they’re going to work it out.”",Trump Walked Away From North Korea Talks.

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec. “I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement. Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events. The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded. “I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.” SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts. Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety.

1374,Billy Perrigo,"An overwhelming majority of Europeans would support a radical new measure that would require social media companies to direct all users who have seen false information toward fact-checks, according to new polling from global advocacy group Avaaz. The initiative is intended to prevent the spread of “fake news” on Facebook and Twitter as governments come under growing pressure to regulate social media. Research shared exclusively with TIME shows that 86.6% of people support Avaaz’s new proposal known as Correct the Record, which activists and politicians say could be the most effective way to stop “fake news” from spreading online. Under the Correct the Record initiative, social media companies would have to make sure that all users who see false information on their feeds are also later presented with fact-checks — whether in the form of a notification telling them something they’ve seen may have been misleading, or a pinned post in their newsfeed with a link to a fact-check by a “verified” organization. The proposal is one of the first concrete suggestions for how to combat the spread of disinformation online, at a time when false news is increasingly affecting the outcome of elections and fueling violence around the world. The international activist network Avaaz, in collaboration with the polling group YouGov, surveyed more than 5,000 people in Germany, France, Spain and Italy on the subject of Correct the Record. In each country, at least 81% and as many as 92% of respondents said they either “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that social media companies should “work with independent and trusted fact checking organizations to provide all users who have been exposed to widespread false or misleading content with verified corrections.” “Correcting the record is a legal responsibility that newspapers have to meet in many countries,” Ricken Patel, the executive director of Avaaz, tells TIME. “When they print false information, they have to print corrections. Part of Correct the Record is just bringing that journalistic tradition of correction into social media.” European Union officials have also welcomed the Correct the Record proposal. “We need rapid corrections, which are given the same prominence and circulation as the original fake news,” said Julian King, the E.U. security commissioner, after being briefed on the proposal late last year. Facebook, one of the key targets of the proposal, has not yet provided a formal response to a TIME request for comment. The company does already have partnerships with fact-checking bodies around the world. “Misinformation is bad for our community and bad for our business.

Jessie Kim, 27 years old, from Hyesan, escaped in 2011 When I saw Trump and Kim Jong Un shaking hands during the first North Korea-U.S. summit, two things came into my mind. 1. With the help of the United States, maybe South and North Korea will actually reunify. And especially when I saw them shaking hands, I couldn’t stop crying thinking how one day I might meet my family again. 2. At the same time, I was worried that the world might forget about the North Korean people who are suffering behind Kim Jong Un’s political showmanship. Jung Jin, 35 years old, from Yanggang Province, escaped in 2014 In North Korea, everyone is taught to be hostile towards America from an early age. We’re taught that the American imperialists are our mortal enemy with whom we cannot live together under the same sky. So when I saw Kim Jong Un smiling and shaking hands with the president of the U.S., I really wondered what was going on in his head. For Trump, it’s about nuclear weapons, and for Kim Jong Un, it’s about maintaining his regime.

1377,Laignee Barron,"The second nuclear summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un appeared to be going smoothly, until Thursday afternoon, when negotiations abruptly ended. No deal was reached. The morning had started on a promising note, with Kim telling journalists he was committed to fully denuclearizing. “If I’m not willing to do that I wouldn’t be here right now,” he said. But then the preliminary meeting went 30 minutes over schedule. Lunch was canceled, and Trump headed to meet the press pool without Kim’s entourage. “Sometimes you have to walk, and this was one of those times,” Trump said at his hour-long press conference. Kim, he added, had wanted all sanctions lifted in exchange for shutting the Yongbyon nuclear facility. Ahead of the meeting, Trump had said there was “awesome” potential for a deal. The world’s largest nuclear power ultimately hopes to convince the most reclusive one to give up its arsenal, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions and future economic prosperity. But, the President repeatedly said, there is “no rush.” Air Force One departed Hanoi more two hours earlier than anticipated. Kim, meanwhile, has said he will stay on until Saturday, and then return to Pyongyang on his armored train. Here, in five moments, is the story of Trump and Kim’s second meeting. Meeting in person for the first time on Wednesday since Singapore last June, the pair shook hands and exchanged pleasantries as the cameras bombarded them. Known for their effusive relationship, the two leaders were quick to shower praise. Smiling widely, Trump reportedly hailed the autocrat as a “great leader,” and in return, Kim called him “courageous.”",5 Key Moments From Trump and Kim's Second Summit,"February 28, 2019"
1378,Karl Vick,"Asense of impending climax followed Juan Guaidó from Venezuela’s capital city to its western border on Feb. 21-22. The young opposition leader is one of two people who claim to be President of the failing petrostate. And at regular intervals on the 500-mile road trip, his caravan pushed through checkpoints manned by the army that answers to the other—Nicolás Maduro, who still clings stubbornly to the presidency after ostensibly winning re-election in a ballot widely seen as stolen. At each roadblock, the contest for control of Venezuela played out in miniature. Guaidó may be recognized as the legitimate ruler by more than 50 nations, including the U.S. But control of the government depends on those in uniform who hold guns and claim allegiance to Maduro. The challenger’s journey, in defiance of a travel ban imposed by his rival, was a calculated gamble to draw the armed forces into the opposition’s orbit. The plan at the border called for dismantling barricades, then driving waiting truckloads of U.S. food and medical aid into the impoverished land. The idea had an elegant logic. By demonstrating control of both the nation’s armed forces and its borders, Guaidó could effectively exhibit the power he had nominally claimed a month earlier, while also feeding at least a few hungry mouths. It didn’t happen. The confrontation at the Colombian border on Feb. 23 merely sparked a round of street clashes between security forces and civilians. The aid stayed put, the barricades stayed up, and despite Guaidó’s boast of the “participation” of the armed forces, all but 320 defectors remained loyal to Maduro. If there had been a turning point, it was the grinding sort that becomes apparent only much later. As the crisis remains stubbornly unresolved, it has grown into a global emergency. The forces aligned against Maduro–including, most prominently, a tough-talking U.S. President Donald Trump–are very nearly as compelling as the country’s extraordinary decline. It has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, yet almost 90% of its people now live below the poverty line. Famed as the birthplace of Latin American liberation, Venezuela in the past three years has lost more than 3 million people, a 10th of its population, to self-exile in nearby countries. “We’re with you 100%,” U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told Guaidó on Feb. 25, when they met in Colombia with regional leaders. Despite Trump’s belligerent tone on Venezuela–in striking contrast with his isolationist approach to foreign policy elsewhere–Pence also made clear that no U.S. military action was imminent. Asked whether he had told Guaidó that “all options” remain on the table, “I assured him that they were,” Pence said after the meeting. “But we hope for better. We hope for a peaceful transition.” Remarkably, Guaidó has emphatically refused to rule out American military intervention. It’s a striking development in a region where Uncle Sam has played the heavy for so long. One historian counted 41 cases of the U.S.’s intervening to change a government in Latin America over the course of about a century–and that’s just the successful ones. The math works out at one every 28 months. This time, however, Washington is confronting a recalcitrant Latin American government not on its own but with an array of concerned neighbors. The 14 nations that make up the Lima Group, named for the Peruvian capital where they gathered in August 2017 to address the crisis, are committed to restoring democracy in Venezuela, ideally by peaceful means, like enforcing economic sanctions on Maduro cronies and generals to coerce them to abandon his regime.","Venezuela's Crisis Reaches a Stalemate, but Time Is Running Out for the Opposition","February 28, 2019"
1379,Ciara Nugent,"Pope Francis arrived at the Vatican in 2013 promising “decisive action” on the child sex-abuse crisis that has racked the Catholic Church for at least three decades. Survivors around the world had told of horrific assaults by priests and callous cover-ups by senior clerics; in the U.S. alone, a 2004 church-commissioned report recorded over 10,000 accusations against more than 4,000 priests. Since then, the evidence has only grown. Yet advocates say Francis has offered little to restore the moral authority of the church beyond strong words. Much then was left riding on the landmark summit the Pope called for Feb. 21–24. Nearly 200 bishops, Cardinals and other senior clerics gathered in the Vatican to hear recorded testimony from survivors, listen to speeches and hold group discussions, all with the aim of getting on the same page. As if to announce a new seriousness of purpose, the church expelled the former Archbishop of Washington, D.C., Theodore E. McCarrick, just days before, on Feb. 16–the first Cardinal to be defrocked over the sexual abuse of minors in modern times. Francis used the summit to call for an “all-out battle” against abuse, and church leaders hailed it as an unprecedented confrontation with the ugliest parts of their organization. “I am convinced that this was a moment of deep transformation,” Father Hans Zollner, one of the church’s top experts on child protection and the summit’s organizer, tells TIME. But many activists and survivors expected more. Francis offered no detailed plan on how to prevent abuse, or binding rules on how to deal with abusers and cooperate with law enforcement. A promise to issue a new guidebook for bishops received short shrift from advocates. “Over the years, we’ve seen many church leaders write new guidelines, which are then developed, watered down, published and ignored,” says Colm O’Gorman, an Irish survivor of clergy abuse who now heads the Irish branch of Amnesty International. “There’s nothing unprecedented about this.” The Pope’s challenge is magnified by uneven attitudes across the church’s many regions. In countries like the U.S., Canada, Australia, Spain, Germany and Ireland, the lengthy list of scandals and revelations has become part of the public consciousness, and top-level clerics are finally facing justice. On Feb. 26, for example, an Australian court revealed that Cardinal George Pell, formerly Francis’ top financial adviser, had been found guilty last year of molesting two choirboys in the 1990s. But in much of Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa–regions that have become crucial for the future of the church as its membership has declined in Europe and the U.S.–no such reckoning has occurred. In areas where sexuality and sexual violence remain taboo subjects, there is less civil-society momentum to turn abuse into a church priority, and the risk to survivors for speaking up is much greater. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, the watchdog group Bishops Accountability says the lone prominent survivor of abuse was ostracized by his family when he came forward. Sister Veronica Openibo, a Nigerian-born nun who addressed the summit with a scathing criticism of the clergy’s “mediocrity, hypocrisy and complacency” on abuse, later told a press conference that some African bishops “were not happy” with her focus. They “felt there were more important issues in Africa,” she said, giving child soldiers and child trafficking as examples. Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean survivor of sex abuse as a minor, tells TIME that he struggled for years to be believed by clergy in his country and that attitudes have barely evolved in the rest of Latin America. “Bishops generally don’t see this as a problem that plagues their particular country or church,” he says.   Some advocates believe the Pope is also afraid to rock the boat by moving too fast. He is already struggling to bridge a divide between his liberal wing of the church and conservatives who disapprove of his relaxed stances on issues like homosexuality and second marriages. “Keeping the church together is clearly his priority,” says Anna Frankowska, a lawyer at the Polish survivors’ group Have No Fear, who met with Francis ahead of the summit to present him with a report accusing 24 Polish bishops, some still active, of covering up abuses as recently as 2012. “The Pope clearly gets it, but he’s scared of upsetting bishops who don’t.”",Why the Pope's Summit on Abuse Disappointed Some Survivors,"February 28, 2019"
1380,Ian Bremmer,"Are we nearing a deal to end the U.S.-China trade war? President Trump seems to think so. “We’re getting very, very close,” he told a group of governors visiting the White House in February. Citing “substantial progress” in recent negotiations, Trump postponed a March 1 deadline that would have sharply increased the rate of tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Trump said he hoped a meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping, most likely in late March at Mar-a-Lago, would become a “signing summit.” Trump’s lunge for a deal may be driven in part by the fast-advancing U.S. electoral calendar. As Democrats begin lining up to run against him next year, the President may be hoping to avoid the stock-market gyrations and economic pain an escalating trade war might soon begin to inflict. He could surely use what he sees as a big political win on China at a time when multiple investigations, increasingly aggressive Democratic lawmakers, his failure to build a border wall and embarrassing public testimony from his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen are all clouding his political horizons. But as with his would-be reset with Russia, Trump can’t change the structural game with China with a single agreement. Although Trump entered office predicting he would improve relations with Moscow, lawmakers of both parties continue to accuse Russia of interference in U.S. elections and various other crimes. Sanctions remain in place and may well expand. Neither Trump’s praise nor congressional punishment has persuaded Russia to change course. The same goes for China. Trump will doubtless win some concessions from Xi, perhaps expanded access for U.S. companies to the Chinese marketplace, agreements on currency management, more Chinese purchases of American soybeans and promises in principle to address other U.S. demands. What Trump cannot do is persuade Xi to overhaul China’s broader economic model. The Chinese state will continue to subsidize state-owned companies and privately owned national champions, tilting the global playing field in its favor. It will push forward, by any means necessary, on expanding technological innovation to compete with U.S. and European firms in the most important economic sectors of the 21st century–AI, fintech and consumer electronics, for example. On these subjects, whatever Xi promises Trump or Chinese officials say publicly, they will not compromise. There are also limits to what Trump can offer to get that deal with Xi. If he signs off on an agreement that removes pressure on Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE, each suspected of undermining U.S. national security, he’ll get pushback from Congress. If he tries to use Meng Wanzhou–the Huawei executive arrested in Canada for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran–as a bargaining chip, he’ll face criticism that he’s meddling in a law-enforcement matter and exceeding his authority.","Deal or No Deal, the U.S.-China Relationship Is Beyond Repair","February 28, 2019"
1381,Laignee Barron,"President Donald Trump defended North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un when confronted Thursday about American college student Otto Warmbier, who died days after he was repatriated from the pariah state with brain damage. Responding to questions in Hanoi before bringing an abrupt end to his second summit with Kim, Trump said he does not believe that the North Korean autocrat knew about Warmbier’s condition until after the fact. “He tells me he didn’t know about it and I will take him at his word,” Trump said of how he could continue calling the young dictator “my friend.” Trump said he has talked to Kim about Warmbier, and that Kim “feels very badly.” “I don’t believe that he would have allowed that to happen. It just wasn’t to his advantage,” Trump added. “Those prisons are rough, rough places and bad things happen.” Warmbier, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, was touring North Korea when he was arrested for allegedly stealing a propaganda sign. He was sentenced to fifteen years hard labor. In June 2017, after 17 months imprisonment, Warmbier was released on “humanitarian grounds.” He arrived back in Ohio in a coma, and died six days later. North Korean officials have said Warmbier suffered a brain injury after contracting botulism, a form of poisoning, but U.S. doctors found no evidence of the condition. After Warmbier’s death, Trump vowed to press North Korea on its abysmal human rights record. But as Trump has sought to seal the denuclearization of North Korea in talks with Kim, the issue has been relegated to the back burner. Human rights was not on the agenda at either of the summits, although in Singapore Trump briefly said the meeting wouldn’t have happened without Warmbier.",'I Take Him at His Word.'

1382,Feliz Solomon / Hanoi,"President Donald Trump cut short his two-day summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, ending the talks early and leaving empty-handed as he returns to Washington facing heavy scrutiny over his former lawyer Michael’s Cohen’s testimony to Congress. At a press conference in the Vietnamese capital, Trump said talks broke down because Kim demanded that the U.S. lift all sanctions on North Korea. Downplaying the setback, Trump said negotiations would continue and that he thinks the two leaders will “end up being very good friends.” “They wanted the sanctions lifted in entirety, and we couldn’t do that,” Trump said, portraying Kim’s proposal as a blanket removal of sanctions in exchange for the closure of the Yongbyon nuclear facility, North Korea’s most important research and production site. “We had to walk away from that.” The offer was ultimately deemed unacceptable, Trump said, because North Korea has other nuclear weapons and missile facilities. “You have to be prepared to walk away,” he said. “We actually had papers ready to be signed, but it just wasn’t appropriate.” Prior to Trump’s trip, the White House tried to tamp down expectations for the second summit with the reclusive dictator. However, Trump said in Hanoi that he and Kim have a “great relationship.” Before talks ended on Thursday, Kim took the rare step of answering a question from a foreign journalist, saying, “It’s too early to tell, but I wouldn’t say I’m pessimistic. For what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results will come out.” Trump landed in Hanoi early this week eager for a victory as drama was unfolding in Washington over speculation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is preparing to issue his final report on the federal investigation into possible election interference by Russia. Then on Wednesday, late into the night in Vietnam, Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen laid into the President during a five-hour testimony before the House Oversight Committee, deriding him as a “racist” and a “conman” live on national television.

1383,Laignee Barron,"President Donald Trump’s nuclear negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam have been abruptly cut short, and ended without a deal. The White House announced Thursday that Trump’s planned press conference was being moved up by two hours – to 2 p.m. local time. Originally, that was when Trump and Kim were joining to sign a joint agreement, but according to the White House Press Secretary, “No agreement was reached at this time.” At a press conference in Hanoi, Trump said talks broke down because Kim said he would only close the Yongbyon nuclear facility – North Korea’s most important research and production site – if the U.S. lifted all sanctions on North Korea.  That offer was ultimately deemed unacceptable, Trump said, because North Korea has other missile facilities elsewhere in the country. “You have to be prepared to walk away,” he said. “We actually had papers ready to be signed, but it just wasn’t appropriate.” “I want to take off the sanctions so badly, because I want that country to grow,” Trump added, before handing over to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “We made real progress,” Pompeo said, “unfortunately we didn’t get all the way.”  Trump’s appearance – in the middle of the night for most of America – comes hours after his former longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen gave explosive testimony on Capitol Hill in which he called the President a “racist,” a “con man” and a “cheat.” Trump is hoping to convince the the 35-year-old dictator that moving away from his nuclear and missile programs could bring North Korea out of the cold.",President Trump and Kim Jong Un's Summit Ended Early Without a Deal.

1384,Laignee Barron,"Undoubtedly, President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un are the main stars of the summit in Vietnam. But around them is an orchestra of senior aides who are keeping the show going. These are some of the trusted advisers and negotiators who, behind the scenes, are helping to formulate the outcome of the second Trump-Kim summit. If any deal happens, they will likely have played a key part in it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney were the plus-2s Trump took with him to his dinner with Kim Jong Un on Wednesday in Hanoi. While Trump continued to lavish praise on his North Korean friend, Pompeo, a chief architect of the second summit, remained firm about the need for the regime to achieve more “real, demonstrable, verifiable” results this time. Against the unorthodox and impulsive moves made by Trump, ex-CIA director Pompeo appears to play a more conventional and even hawkish hand. Last July, Pompeo made waves when he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that North Korea was actively making fuel for nuclear weapons, saying “they continue to produce fissile material.” A month earlier, Trump had prematurely declared North Korea “no longer a nuclear threat.” Amid criticism that the U.S. has achieved little in its public courting of the pariah state, Pompeo has doubled down on the strategy, saying at a press conference ahead of this summit that the U.S. is “making the progress we need.” Trump named Stephen Biegun special envoy to North Korea just a over six months ago.

For what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results will come out.” His remarks were caught on live video of the proceedings carried by multiple media outlets.

1387,Yardena Schwartz / Krakow,"Until she was 13, Marcjanna Kubala thought she was Christian, like nearly every Polish citizen. Then one day after school, she searched her name on Google and found her family tree. Her great-grandmother’s family name didn’t sound Polish, she thought. “Were they German?” Kubala asked her mother. “No,” she replied. “They were Jewish.”  Surprised and fascinated, Kubala, who lives in Krakow, began a journey of rediscovering her identity. Her great-grandmother had lived in Krakow during the Holocaust, and survived because she’d married a Christian—and was therefore able to pass as one. Kubala’s grandmother and mother did the same—both aware of their Jewish heritage and both hiding it. Kubala, on the other hand, had no idea. While her mother had dropped hints over the years, she chose only to tell her daughter directly when she asked that day.  Unlike the generations before her who had to hide their Jewish roots, first during the Holocaust and then under Communism, Kubala could embrace her newfound heritage. She joined Krakow’s Jewish Community Center (JCC), where she met others on the same journey. After college, she became director of Krakow’s Hillel, an organization of young Jews with chapters around the world. “This sounds unusual, but I’m just one of many hundreds of people with a similar experience,” says Kubala, now 27. Hillel membership in Krakow has doubled in the last year. “Most members are like me, people who discovered only later in life that they’re Jewish,” Kubala says. “For many years they had no idea where their family roots came from. Then they discovered a document or a picture and everything changed.”  Amid a resurgence of anti-Semitism throughout Europe, and despite a nationalist government that has sought to silence criticism of Polish complicity in the Holocaust, Poland’s Jewish community is being reborn. It’s a trend being led not just by people who have recently discovered their Jewish ancestry, but also those without Jewish roots who wish to give back. Now Poland, where 1,000 years of Jewish history went up in flames over seven decades ago, is home to one of the fastest-growing Jewish communities in the world. In 1939, Poland was home to 3.5 million Jews, Europe’s largest Jewish population. On the eve of the Holocaust, 10% of Poles were Jewish. (For comparison, less than 2% of the U.S. population is Jewish.)  Being the capital of European Jewry made Poland the prime target for Nazi brutalities. Adolf Hitler’s regime built its deadliest concentration camps here, and more Jews were murdered in Poland than anywhere else by far. Just 10% of Poland’s Jewish population survived.","40 Miles From Auschwitz, Poland's Jewish Community Is Beginning to Thrive","February 27, 2019"
1388,Holly Dagres,"The Instagram post came at midnight, Tehran time. “I sincerely apologize for the incapacity to continue serving and all the shortcomings during the service,” Iran’s foreign minister wrote in Persian on Monday. “Be happy and proud.” The reasons why were unclear, though he later said he hoped to allow his ministry to reclaim its “proper statutory role.” The sudden resignation of Mohammad Javad Zarif shocked many, but for Iran watchers like myself, the day had been a long time coming. For months, Iranian state media entertained rumors that Iran’s smiling top diplomat was leaving his post, something hardliners had wanted all along—though this was apparently over Zarif’s absence in meetings with Syrian President Bashar Assad, a diplomatic faux pas since neither the foreign minister nor his ministry was made aware of the visit. But then, on Wednesday morning, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani officially rejected the resignation. In a letter to Zarif published in Iranian state media, Rouhani wrote: “I believe accepting your resignation would be against the benefit of the country, so I reject it.” Though many Iranian officials rallied behind Zarif after his abrupt announcement, hardliners had welcomed the news that the diplomat might soon be gone. During his six years of service, Zarif has been a headache for them: U.S.-educated and having accrued a “rolodex” of Western contacts during his career, Iran’s main interlocutor has always been viewed with suspicion. His Iranian opponents have gone out of their way trying to label Zarif as having “connections to Western intelligence agencies,” in an attempt to destroy his four decades of foreign service. Decades of experience in the international arena, specifically at the Iranian mission in New York, is rare among Iranian diplomats. And although the United States and Israel celebrated the news of Zarif’s potential departure, it would have been a double-edged sword, with the risk of damaging dialogue or potential diplomacy between Iran and the United States. President Hassan Rouhani’s government spent all its political capital on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Zarif at the helm, a 2015 deal that hardliners advocated against on the basis of Iran getting the shorter end of the stick and because of intense distrust of the United States. When U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out in May 2018, it became their I-Told-You-So moment. Hardliners in parliament were so overcome with joy that they set fire to a U.S. flag and a piece of paper symbolizing the Iran nuclear agreement while chanting, “Death to America!” and “We burned America! We burned the JCPOA!” Pulling out of the Iran Deal brought an unknowing comradery that U.S. hawks and Iranian hardliners share until this day. Both groups have the same goal, but for different reasons. Tehran’s hardliners want Iran to be isolated from the West to keep their hold on power and prevent any form of rapprochement, particularly with the United States, which they see as not having Iran’s best interests at heart. American politicians, particularly republicans and the Trump Administration, want to isolate Iran to change what they call “malign behavior”—though they have on numerous occasions called for regime change. Pulling out the JCPOA, has in turn emboldened these hardline forces in Tehran. At the news of Zarif’s resignation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted: “We note @JZarif’s resignation.

1389,Feliz Solomon / Hanoi,"Life in Vietnam’s picturesque capital carried on this week as though the eyes of the world weren’t on it. Even the flags flapping from light posts along its tree-lined streets — Vietnam’s Communist star flanked by the U.S. and North Korea — are understated. Not too showy, just large enough to catch the eye with a spot of color while whizzing past on the back of a motorbike. Hanoi is focused squarely on impressing two of its most distinguished guests: President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who met in the city Wednesday night for the start of their second summit geared toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Nearly five decades after it was targeted by a relentless American bombing campaign, Hanoi is a fitting peace-broker: both a symbol of rapprochement and a model of economic renaissance. “I think you will have a tremendous future for your country, you’re a great leader,” Trump told Kim in their first meeting since Singapore as the pair posed for photos before a social dinner. He added that North Korea has “tremendous economic potential,” and pledged that the U.S. “will help it to happen.” In talks on Thursday, Trump will try to convince Kim that prosperity awaits if he gives up his nuclear weapons, and Vietnam is a fitting model. The former American enemy is a Communist state that has seen rapid benefits from economic liberalization and diversified security partners. But in a worrying portent for American ally Seoul, Vietnam also achieved what the Kim regime has dreamed of doing for three generations: It absorbed its Western-allied southern half into a unified nation under Communist control. When Trump and Kim met for an initial summit in Singapore last June, the first between the sitting leaders of these longtime foes, they only managed to reach a vague agreement that yielded little progress. Experts say four items are on Trump’s agenda this time around: a declaration of peace; returning the remains of more U.S. soldiers missing since the Korean War; establishment of liaison offices between the two countries; and an end to production of fissile materials at North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear facility. But what does Kim want in return? A declaration of peace would undermine the argument that U.S. troops are still needed in the South, and he is likely to ask for a reduction of the 28,500 currently based there. Trump may try to meet Kim’s demand, after he became the first president since Jimmy Carter to suggest withdrawal last May. The U.S. is technically still at war with the North since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace accord. A declaration of peace wouldn’t end the war, but it would pave the way for a formal treaty and ultimately dissolve the U.S.-led U.N. Command created to keep the peace. The U.S. also has some 50,000 troops based in Japan.",Trump and Kim Just Met Again. Here's What the North Korean Leader Hopes to Get Out of the Talks,"Updated: February 27, 2019 9:08 AM ET"
1390,Laignee Barron,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump locked hands and smiled in Hanoi Wednesday – the second meeting between the two leaders. Trump’s team arrived first at the hotel Metropole Hanoi. About 10 minutes later, Kim’s motorcade pulled in. The two leaders met in a room with North Korean and American flags that looked much like the setting of their first meeting in Singapore.  Trump took three questions from the press pool, but answered with brevity. When asked if the pair would reach a peace deal, Trump told the press corps, “We’ll see.” He reiterated that he and the leader of the reclusive state have a “great relationship,” but when asked if he would be backing down from pursuing complete denuclearization of North Korea, he simply said, “No,” and left it at that. Kim, through an interpreter, said there had been “a lot of thinking, effort and patience” in the months since their last meeting. “We have been able to overcome all the obstacles and here we are today. I hope we can provide an outcome that is welcomed by everyone, and I’m sure that we can do this.” “It’s an honor to be with Chairman Kim,” Trump replied. “I think your country has tremendous economic potential. Unbelievable. Unlimited,” Trump continued: “I think you will have a tremendous future with your country, you’re a great leader. And I look forward to watching it happen and helping it to happen, and we will help it to happen.” The two leaders are now expected to talk face-to-face for 20 minutes with only their interpreters present. “Our relationship is a very special relationship,” Trump said later as they sat for dinner, each of them accompanied by two senior aides.",President Trump and Kim Jong Un Just Met for a Second Time.

1391,Madeline Roache,"Not far from the Kremlin, people lay fresh flowers and candles at the edge of the bridge. It’s the site where Boris Nemtsov, one of Russia’s most prominent critics of Vladimir Putin, was killed exactly four years ago. Just before midnight on Feb. 27, 2015, the 55-year-old Nemtsov was crossing the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge with his girlfriend when he was shot several times from behind. (She survived, the only eyewitness to the assassination.)  Supporters say they are still waiting for justice. A trial held in Moscow that ended in 2017 with five Chechen men convicted for Nemtsov’s murder was condemned by Nemtsov’s lawyer Vadim Prokhorov and human rights activists as a cover-up that left the real organizers of the attack unpunished.  Nemtsov is one of many Kremlin critics who have been murdered, or who have died in highly suspicious circumstances, and whose cases are still unsolved. They include exile Nikolai Glushkov, oligarch and political exile Boris Berezovsky, human rights activist Nastya Estimerova, investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya and former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko.  Speaking to TIME in late February over the phone from her home in Germany, Nemtsov’s daughter Zhanna Nemtsova, 34, expressed her anger that her father’s murderers have not been held to account. “In his last few years, as the regime got tougher, I knew imprisonment was possible,” she says. “But never this brutal murder.”  The Russian government has intensified its crackdown on political opposition and peaceful protesters since 2012 anti-government protests that led to tens of thousands of people taking to the streets to condemn ballot-rigging. In the last couple of years, the Russian parliament has passed laws further curbing freedom of online expression and the media. Authorities have reportedly harassed political and civic activists and increased prosecution for online speech. According to Human Rights Watch, Russian police “systematically interfered with the presidential campaign of the opposition politician” and anti-corruption activist, Alexei Navalny.  After receiving death threats, Nemtsova left Russia for Germany in 2015, where she now works as a journalist at Deutsche Welle. She says the investigation into her father’s murder was blocked by high-ranking politicians, who put pressure on the investigative team not to research it objectively. “The organizers have not been identified, found and brought to justice,” she says. “The motive behind the killing, obviously political, hasn’t been officially acknowledged.”  But she believes the international community can help, mentioning a clause in U.S. Senate legislation on countering “Kremlin’s aggression,” not yet passed, that would allow the U.S. to start investigating her father’s case. Last July, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also passed a resolution urging the Russian authorities to undertake a new, thorough investigation of the murder.  Lawyers representing Nemtsov claim the trail of evidence leads to senior figures in Chechnya, who are loyal to Putin. Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya’s president and Putin’s ally, defended Zaur Dadayev, a former member of Kadyrov’s elite military unit who was found guilty of shooting Nemtsov, describing him as “a true patriot” and his accomplices “completely innocent.” He pointed the finger at “Western intelligence agencies,” alleging they murdered the politician to destabilize Russia.","Four Years Ago, Putin Critic Boris Nemtsov Was Shot Dead in Moscow.

1392,Amy Gunia,"In a sign of the seriousness of its crackdown on restive Xinjiang, China has appointed a political rising star and Xi Jinping loyalist to head up political and legal affairs in the far-Western region. Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reports that Wang Junzheng—the former party chief of the northeastern city of Changchun—will be responsible for law and order in Xinjiang, where China’s persecution of Uighurs, a group of predominantly-Muslim ethnic minorities, has been the subject of international condemnation. Wang, described by the Post as one of “a group of up-and-coming cadres who have won the trust of President Xi Jinping,” pledged to “ensure the party’s absolute leadership over political and legal work, and firmly implement the Party Central Committee’s strategy in governing Xinjiang.” Last year, China created a new government bureau to formulate and advise Beijing’s politicians on policies for the region. The Uighurs, who are of Central Asian origin, are one of China’s largest ethnic minority groups. Approximately 11 million Uighurs live in the western part of the country. It is believed that up to one million Uighur Muslims are currently being detained in camps that China calls “re-education” centers. China has been facing international pressure to close the camps. China denies that its treatment of Uighurs is inhumane, and says that the camps are a successful deterrent to Islamist terrorism in China. Beijing is expected to face tough questions about it’s persecution of Uighurs at the 40th U.N. Human Rights Council meeting, which kicked off in Geneva on Monday.

1393,Laignee Barron,"“Whatever you’re looking for, you will find here,” the film adaptation of The Quiet American says of Vietnam. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have arrived in the buzzy Vietnamese capital searching for detente over the north’s nuclear program, as the reclusive state stands on the brink of being able to strike at targets across the world. Both leaders will be looking for a win from this second summit, and will start jockeying Wednesday night within the plush confines of the hotel Metropole in Hanoi, where The Quiet American was hammered out in the 1950s by English author Graham Greene.  At the $300 a night Metropole (now part of the Sofitel Legend group), a colonial luster lingers—all polished woodwork, antique ceiling fans and iron filigree, with a suite named for Greene and a vintage Citroën parked out front. An escargot-serving sidewalk cafe wraps around the hotel’s exterior, adding to the sense of Parisian chic in the upmarket French quarter. The Swiss watchmaker Patek Philipe has a boutique nearby and a number of boulangeries can be found in the area, along with the chocolate-box facade of the Hanoi Opera House. Built in 1901, the Metropole was a favorite haunt of celebrities and diplomats. Charles Chaplin and Paulette Goddard honeymooned there in 1936, and it reportedly played host to Bill Clinton and Jane Fonda. In 1972, Joan Baez famously took cover in an underground bunker there during the Christmas Bombings. Trump himself has previously visited the hotel, reportedly staying there in 2017. During the war, the Communist north used the stately accommodation to house foreign guests and renamed it the “Reunification” hotel. A 1990 restoration revamped the premises, which had languished as the country recovered from Vietnam War, which killed an estimated 3.8 million Vietnamese and 58,000 American soldiers. The latest installment in the Metropole’s war storied history could see it become an emblem of peace should Trump and Kim make any breakthroughs. At the very least, the Metropole is set to become the iconic backdrop of their second nuclear summit as the pair plan on a 20-minute conversation Wednesday night. The two are also scheduled to have dinner with aides, before Trump departs around 8:30 p.m. Write to Laignee Barron at Laignee.Barron@time.com.",Trump and Kim Are Meeting One-on-One at This Historic Hanoi Hotel,"February 27, 2019"
1394,Casey Quackenbush,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has rejected the resignation of his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, a key architect of the nuclear deal whose notice shook Iran and its markets, the Washington Post reports. “In the view of Dr Rouhani, the Islamic Republic of Iran has only one foreign policy and one foreign minister,” President Rouhani’s chief-of-staff, Mahmoud Vaezi, wrote on Instagram, the BBC said. A foreign ministry spokesman also told local media Zarif’s resignation had been rejected. Zarif announced his resignation on Instagram on Tuesday without a clear reason. The move would have deprived Rouhani of a key supporter in pushing the Islamic Republic toward further negotiations with the West. In his Instagram post, Zarif offered a vague “apology” for his “inability to continue” his service. The move was believed to be in response to the exclusion of Zarif from two meetings between Rouhani and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Aljazeera reports. Pressure has also mounted on Zarif since President Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstalled sanctions, the BBC reports. Many hardliners took issue with the deal to begin with because it forced Iran to compromise its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.

The BBC cited an earlier interview Rivoire gave to the AFP news agency, in which he said that Decathlon’s intention was to “make sport accessible for all women.” The lightweight Muslim headscarf has long been criticized for going against France’s secular values, and some lawmakers have suggested a boycott of the brand. Decathalon, which has 1,510 stores in 49 countries, released an official statement on Twitter. For years, rights groups have argued that France’s secular laws foster Islamophobia and discriminate against Muslim women. Since 2004, it has been illegal for Muslim women to wear a headscarf in state schools and some government buildings, and in 2016, more than 20 towns moved to ban women from wearing so-called burkinis, or full-body swimsuits, on public beaches.

1396,Billy Perrigo,"With tit-for-tat airstrikes across a cease-fire line in late February, tensions between India and Pakistan rose to their highest point in years. The two nuclear-armed states have long clashed over the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir, which each claims as its own. But the situation deteriorated there after a Feb. 14 bombing by a Pakistan-based militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammed, killed 40 Indian paramilitaries in the Pulwama district of Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack in the insurgency that has raged for 30 years in the contested Himalayan region that borders the two countries. Twelve days later, on Tuesday, India sent jets into Pakistani airspace for the first time since 1971, and bombed what it said was a training camp for Jaish-e-Mohammed for the Feb. 14 attack. (Pakistan denied any such sites were hit.) India and Pakistan last went to war over Kashmir back in 1999, and now, with Indian elections approaching in April and May, India’s retaliation threatens to escalate tensions even further. The situation is more fraught than it has been for decades, analysts say, though both sides have kept open the possibility of de-escalation. At least 40 incidents of violence against Kashmiris were recorded across India in the days following the Feb. 14 attack. Here’s what to know.  The two sides gave contesting versions of events on Tuesday. India said that “a large number” of militants were killed by the Indian air strike, which it said was targeted at a training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed, the terrorist organization that claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 suicide bombing. The camp, New Delhi said, was in Balakot — an area inside territory that both sides agree to be Pakistan. The Associated Press quoted residents from a village nearby who said they heard explosions. But Pakistan rejected India’s description of the attack, instead saying that the Indian jets were forced into a “hasty withdrawal” by the Pakistani air force, and that the bombs were dropped onto an open area, causing no casualties. Pakistan released pictures on social media showing what appeared to be a blast site in a forested area. The office of Imran Khan, Pakistan’s Prime Minister, said India had justified Tuesday’s bombing using a “fictitious claim.” A spokesperson said in a statement, “India has committed uncalled for aggression to which Pakistan shall respond at the time and place of its choosing.”",Tensions Between India and Pakistan Are at Their Highest Point in Decades.

1397,George Steer,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Vietnam Tuesday for his second summit with President Donald Trump — and his detachment of bodyguards, famous for jogging alongside his motorcade, were right there with him. The group of 12 men, all of them wearing black suits, striped ties and personalized badges pinned to their lapels, flanked Kim’s limousine as he left his hotel for the North Korean embassy in Hanoi on Tuesday. They are part of an elite military group known as the Main Office of Adjutants, or the Central Party Office #6, according to the BBC. To become one of Kim’s elite guards (the group is comprised of between 200 and 300 personnel), potential recruits are subjected to rigorous background checks — family members going back two generations can be vetted. Recruits tend to be drawn from elite North Korean families. Kim’s bodyguards are picked for fitness, height, eyesight, marksmanship, martial arts prowess, and even their good looks, says the BBC’s South Korea correspondent Laura Bicker. Other members of Kim’s security detail are drawn from the Guard Command, likened to to the U.S. Secret Service, responsible for safety and welfare of Kim Jong Un, his family and senior DPRK officials. It is not the first time Kim’s jogging bodyguards have accompanied him, they also traveled to Singapore with the North Korean leader for the last summit with President Trump in July and previously to the inter-Korea summit in April. According to North Korea Leadership Watch, other, less visible, members of Kim’s security detail are drawn from the Guard Command — a group of approximately 95,000-100,000 personnel spread across North Korea. It’s estimated the Main Office of Adjutants — part of the Guard Command — has around 200-300 personnel; they are some of the only North Korean citizens allowed to carry guns next to their country’s leader.

A few meters away, banners hung across the medians of misty avenues reading: “Hanoi, the city for peace.” This week, the Vietnamese capital gets the chance to live up to that nickname as U.S. President Donald Trump touched down Tuesday for his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, where the pair will attempt to revive denuclearization talks. Trump and Kim are expected to meet twice, and both are determined to walk away with a win. For Trump, the stakes are high and the bar is low — the failure of their meeting in Singapore last June to produce meaningful security outcomes has left him in need of a compromise. So long as Kim doesn’t provoke his counterpart, the two should be on course for a closing handshake. America’s stated goal has long been the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula — which experts agree is not on the horizon. Trump said prior to departing from Washington that he’d settle for a moratorium on testing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. “I’m not in a rush, I don’t want to rush anybody, I just don’t want testing,” the President said Sunday night. “As long as there’s no testing, we’re happy.” Read more: How the U.S. Could Lose a Trump-Kim Summit Kim could extract a lot from Trump given that low bar. His aims are likely twofold, experts say: a declaration of peace and some form of sanctions relief, possibly by creating exceptions that would allow more inter-Korean economic cooperation. The former would be largely symbolic; it would be the first time the U.S. has acknowledged its willingness to bring a formal close to the Korean War, which began in 1950 and ended in armistice three years later. A declaration would not end the war — only a treaty agreed by North and South Korea, the U.S. and China could achieve that — but it would legitimize Pyongyang’s case that America’s alliances in Asia are obsolete. “A declaration of peace is a confidence building measure. Nothing more,” says Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea now at the University of Denver. “The concern is that it could be used by the North Koreans to argue that the U.S. no longer needs troops in South Korea.” What might worry America’s allies is the possibility that the two leaders are in harmony on this particular issue. Some 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in the South, while about 50,000 more are in Japan.

1400,Hillary Leung,"Instead of taking a short flight to Vietnam’s capital, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rattled through China on his armored train, journeying south from Pyongyang over 2,000 miles to meet President Donald Trump for their second nuclear summit. This was no high-speed rail. On Tuesday, after a reported 60-hour, or two-and-half day trip, the 35-year-old leader of the world’s most secretive hermit kingdom alighted at the railway station in Dong Dang, Vietnam. Kim was then picked up by a limo, and driven the rest of the way to Hanoi, according to the Associated Press. This seeming anachronistic mode of travel has long been favored by the Supreme Leaders, Kim, his father and his grandfather. The distinctive green and yellow train adds to the shroud of mystery cloaking North Korea, and is part of the Kim dynasty’s lore. Here are the possible reasons behind Kim’s unusual form of transit. Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, were both allegedly afraid of flying. South Korean media has speculated that the fear was triggered when the two witnessed the explosion of their jet during a test flight. The incident happened in 1982. While Kim Il Sung flew to the Soviet Union after, in 1986, it was the last time a North Korean leader publicly traveled abroad by air for more than three decades, according to AP. By contrast, Kim Jong Un is believed to have become a frequent flier during his boarding school days in Switzerland. Since taking office in 2011, he has also occasionally opted to fly, including to Singapore last year for his first tete-a-tete with Trump. But his preference for rails this trip could be an ode to his family line and a way to keep up the train travel tradition among North Korean leaders. Kim’s train, the same one used by his father and grandfather, has 21 bulletproof carriages with plush leather sofas and conference rooms, according to Reuters. Chosun Media states that two separate trains travel with the main entourage; the one in front handles security checks to ensure the railway tracks are safe, and the one behind carries bodyguards and support personnel.",Here's Why Kim Jong Un May Have Opted for an Arduous Train Journey to Reach Vietnam,"February 26, 2019"
1401,Abigail Abrams,"After a summit in Singapore with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un last summer, President Donald Trump tweeted that “there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” The enthusiasm proved premature. Diplomatic progress between the two countries slowed throughout the fall, and North Korea continued many of its activities as usual, including advancing its nuclear weapons research and improving some missile bases, according to experts. As he heads to a second summit in Vietnam this week, Trump has continued to lavish praise on Kim, but he has dialed down some of the claims. Other U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have said they hope to achieve more “real demonstrable, verifiable” steps this time around. Here’s a closer look at the evidence that North Korea has not significantly changed its nuclear weapons program since the summit in Singapore. Over the course of 2018, North Korea did make a few big gestures at limiting its nuclear weapons program. But many of these took place in preparation for Kim’s first meeting with Trump. In late April, Kim announced he would suspend nuclear and missile tests and close a nuclear test site at Punggye-ri — but he said he was doing so simply because North Korea no longer needed to test nuclear weapons or intercontinental missiles. Then when North Korea said it destroyed the nuclear test site in May, it allowed foreign journalists to observe explosions set off at the site’s entrances, but did not let nuclear experts verify that the site was fully destroyed.",4 Ways North Korea Fell Short of Its Nuclear Promises After the First Trump-Kim Summit,"February 26, 2019"
1402,Brian Bennett,"Donald Trump has spent decades doling out superlatives. He owns the “tallest” building, has “the best words.” He knows technology “better than anyone.” As he prepared to leave Washington at the beginning of the week, Trump predicted his summit on Wednesday with North Korea’s dictator Kim Jong Un will be “tremendous,” and he will talk to Kim “about something that, frankly, [Kim] never spoke to anybody about.”  Just how far into uncharted territory Trump will go to deliver a historic deal is what has experts worried. Kim could promise to destroy North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear complex and a few other nuclear testing sites and extend its pause of nuclear and missile tests. Trump Administration officials have repeatedly said that removing nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula is the ultimate goal, but Trump himself showed over the weekend that he’s content, for now, with Kim’s freeze of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile testing. “I’m not in a rush, I don’t want to rush anybody, I just don’t want testing,” Trump told a group of the nation’s governors gathered for a black tie ball at the White House Sunday night. “As long as there’s no testing, we’re happy.” But it’s what Trump may offer in return that is raising concern. Trump and Kim may sign a political statement declaring an end to the 70-year-old Korean War, acknowledging on paper the reality that most active fighting has ceased since the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953. Such a declaration has been discussed in talks with North Korea for decades, but the U.S. position previously has been that it would acknowledge and end to the Korean War only after North Korea has completely given up its nuclear weapons program. Read More: The Long Flight Home of Hoover Jones Such a declaration wouldn’t be a formal peace treaty or replace the armistice, which would require assent from all the signatories of the ceasefire, including China and the United Nations Command. But South Korea’s president Moon Jae-in has argued that a joint statement would start the process of officially ending the Korean War. “It’s a meaningless, feel-good gesture that carries risks with it,” Bruce Klingner, a research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in Washington, and a former senior CIA official specializing in Korea. “If it’s given in return for freezing Yongbyon. That’s a new price we’ve paid for something we’ve gotten several times before,” Klingner said, referring to North Korea’s promise to dismantle the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center in earlier peace negotiations.

1403,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"It was the lack of change after a 2016 hashtag campaign against Saudi Arabia’s male guardianship laws that finally pushed Reem to flee what she described as her country’s system of female enslavement. Reem, who had never so much as felt the sunlight outside her door without a male relative’s permission, read on her iPhone about freedoms enjoyed by young women elsewhere. Then she came across #StopEnslavingSaudiWomen. “It was depressing to know that we don’t have a future as women in Saudi Arabia and we don’t have any hope for change. The ones who dared to [attempt] change got imprisoned,” she tells TIME in an interview. “This is the moment I planned to leave the country.” She told her younger sister, Rawan, and over the next two and a half years, they plotted their escape via late night WhatsApp messages. “Life in Saudi for a woman with a strict family is like waiting around to die,” Rawan says. (Both sisters are using aliases to protect their identities.) Six months ago, they made their move. But despite their careful plans, the sisters, aged 18 and 20, ended up in the crosshairs of the Saudi government’s efforts to repatriate runaways. They are the latest Saudi women to become marooned in an unfamiliar metropolis, pleading with the international community to provide a safe haven. In 2018, Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was applauded by Western governments for removing a ban on women drivers and reopening movie theaters. But advocates say these incremental changes do little to ease the world’s most rigidly enforced gender segregation, and call for the release of detained female activists and an end to the male guardianship system that prevents women from freely working or even leaving the home without a husband or father’s permission.  “What the prince is doing is not very genuine. He is just trying to please the international community,” says Suad Abu-Dayyeh, Middle East and North Africa consultant for gender equality NGO Equality Now. Saudi women are meanwhile continuing to risk everything to flee beyond their country’s borders. According to the UN Refugee Agency, the number of Saudi asylum seekers increased from 483 cases pending during the 2015 mid-year report, to 1,308 pending in 2018’s report. Although these numbers aren’t broken down by gender, recent high-profile cases have involved young women attempting to escape Saudi Arabia’s patriarchy by any means possible.

Like U.S. President Donald Trump—whose Middle East policies Netanyahu has staunchly supported—the Israeli prime minister has long courted his country’s far right. Unlike in the U.S., however, Israel’s 120-seat Knesset contains a multitude of parties and the ultranationalist Jewish Home is part of the ruling right-wing religious bloc dominated by Netanyahu’s Likud. The objections to Netanyahu’s latest attempt to stretch that coalition even further to the right comes as he prepares to contest what is expected to be one of Israel’s most closely fought elections in years. Former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) head Benny Gantz—who joined forces with former news anchor Yair Lapid in a centrist alliance on Feb. 21—poses a credible threat to Netanyahu’s “Mr. Security” image. Meanwhile, the country’s Attorney General is this week expected to announce whether he will file corruption charges against the prime minister. Here’s what to know about Jewish Power’s partnership with Jewish Home, and how it might impact Israel’s upcoming elections. Established in 2012, Jewish Power was formed by followers of the late Brooklyn-born Rabbi Meir Kahane, who had repeatedly advocated for the forcible expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territories. Their party is considered a successor to Kahane’s Kach Party, which the U.S. deemed a terrorist organization and which Israel banned for its racist policies four years after it first entered the Knesset in 1984. Kahane was assassinated in New York in 1990, but Jewish Power’s pact with Jewish Home opens a way back to the Knesset for his followers. Current key figures in Jewish Power have labelled homosexuality a “disease of choice” and campaigned against marriages between Jews and non-Jews. In a recent interview, prominent member Itamar Ben Gvir told the Times of Israel that Jewish Power was not calling to expel all Arabs—only those “disloyal” to Israel. In 2007, he was convicted of inciting racism for holding aloft a sign saying “Expel the Arab enemy” at a protest.",Netanyahu Is Facing Rare Criticism From Pro-Israel Groups Over His Pact With a Party Many Say Is 'Racist',"February 25, 2019"
1405,Olivia B. Waxman,"When U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meet in Hanoi on Wednesday for their second summit, observers around the world will be waiting to see if the two announce any steps forward on the establishment of a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula. With South Korea and North Korea having already declaring during a historic summit last April that “there will be no more war” there, the possibility seems to some to be in reach for the first time in decades. On Monday, Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for the South Korean President Moon Jae-in, suggested as much. “The North and the United States are the only ones remaining, and if the two declare an end to the war, it will mean that all the four countries that fought war on the Korean Peninsula have declared an end to war,” he said, according to The New York Times. (The U.S. and China, the fourth combatant, aren’t at war because of the normalization of relations that took place in the ’70s.) Peace is a grand hope — and yet, in this case, it can also be a somewhat confusing one. After all, the conflict in question happened in the early 1950s and the U.S. Congress never formally declared war. The Korean War began in the summer of 1950, nearly 70 years ago, when on June 25 North Korean tanks crossed the 38th parallel, the somewhat arbitrary boundary established by World War II victors as a line between the two Koreas. Shortly after, President Truman told the American public that the U.S. would be cooperating with the U.N. Security Council as it defended South Korea against the invasion. As Truman described the series of events in statement reprinted in the July 3, 1950, issue of TIME: So nearly five years after the formation of the United Nations, 48 member countries (and seven-non members) contributed or pledged to contribute equipment, aid or forces to the Korean War. About two dozen of these nations would end up providing ground troops for the conflict, and the U.S. was put in charge of putting those troops to work. U.N. Security Council Resolution 84, adopted July 7, 1950, “recommends” that “members providing military forces and other assistance” will be part of a “unified command under the United States of America.”  But Truman didn’t seek a formal declaration of war, a power that the U.S. Constitution reserves for Congress. Historians now know of several reasons why. From a personal standpoint, Truman was worried that asking Congress for a war declaration would open a Pandora’s box and that ensuing debate could backfire and hurt him politically, as historian Michael Beschloss has argued. After all, with the Cold War was heating up and the atomic age in full swing, there was a fear that formal war declarations could escalate quickly — and that the fate of the entire world hung in the balance. “The sense was, we’re in a new era with nuclear weapons, and you had to put a lid on escalation so that it didn’t become the nuclear version of World War II,” says Sarah Kreps, a Professor of Government and Adjunct Professor of Law at Cornell University and author of Taxing Wars: The American Way of War Finance and the Decline of Democracy.",Trump and Kim Could Declare an End to the Korean War After Seven Decades.

1406,Tim Ross / Bloomberg,"Theresa May is considering a plan to delay Brexit and stop the U.K. leaving the European Union with no deal next month, according to people familiar with the situation. The prime minister is expected to allow her Cabinet to discuss extending the deadline beyond March 29 at a crunch meeting on Tuesday, one of the people said. May would then reveal the Cabinet’s conclusions in an announcement to Parliament later in the day. While no final decision has been taken, putting off the U.K.’s scheduled withdrawal from the EU would be a huge political gamble. On one hand, it would avert mass resignations from pro-EU ministers in May’s team. But it would also risk a destabilizing backlash from euroskeptic Conservatives. Even with the premier likely to carry on with her attempts to get a deal done on time, a postponement would be a major climbdown for the British leader, who has spent the past two years insisting that the U.K. will leave the EU on schedule. It comes within hours of another major U-turn: that of opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn deciding to back a second Brexit referendum. The pound strengthened as much as 0.4 percent in early Asia-Pacific trading Tuesday, reaching $1.3147, its highest level this month. This latest crop of Brexit news is welcomed by investors and businesses because it could mean more time to prepare, or even rethink a strategy that had many worried the U.K. would crash out without a deal. In just over a month, the U.K. is meant to be departing the union it’s belonged to for 40 years but the outlook has never looked more uncertain. May’s hands are increasingly tied by an unpopular divorce deal she sealed with the EU but that Parliament has rejected by a landslide. Brexit has proved to be such a divisive issue that both mainstream parties have suffered defections, businesses are panicking, and voters are exasperated. Delaying Brexit has the potential to split May’s Cabinet and her ruling party, triggering a rebellion from Brexit-supporting Tories who might even try to bring down her government. But May’s allies accept she has run out of time and must now choose between angering her pro-Brexit colleagues, and alienating as many as 20 pro-European ministers who are threatening to quit to vote against her and stop a no-deal exit from the EU in Parliament on Wednesday.",U.K. Prime Minister Reportedly Considering Plan to Delay Brexit,"February 25, 2019"

The pound rose. Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will back a public vote on Brexit — though he doesn’t say exactly how May didn’t secure any concessions from EU at summit in Egypt EU Council President Tusk backs an extension to Brexit day; lawmakers will try to force May into an extension on Wednesday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he’ll put forward or support an amendment that supports a “public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit.” It’s a major shift for Corbyn and comes after members of his team have been pushing him toward a second referendum. Corbyn is more anti-EU than his party, the membership of which backs a second referendum. But any amendment will struggle to win support in Parliament, as some Labour MPs from Leave-voting areas will likely oppose a re-run of the 2016 referendum. At a weekly party meeting this evening, Corbyn is expected to also confirm Labour will back a cross-party effort led by lawmakers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin to prevent the U.K. crashing out of the EU on March 29. “One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent No Deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal,” he will say.

1408,Ciara Nugent,"The ongoing struggle between Venezuela’s authoritarian government, the opposition and the international community reached dramatic new heights over the weekend. Attempts to bring foreign humanitarian aid into the country — against the wishes of embattled president Nicolás Maduro — led to bloody clashes between civilians and the military. Three trucks carrying food and medicine were burned. Dozens of soldiers defected from the government-loyal armed forces. Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader recognized by most Western democracies as Venezuela’s legitimate interim president, signaled he would be open to the U.S. using force to remove Maduro; U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is now headed to Colombia to speak with Guaidó. Here’s everything you might have missed in Venezuela this weekend. Guaidó had promised in early February that humanitarian aid, sent by the U.S. and other countries to help with Venezuela’s lack of food and medicine, would get into the country “one way or another, by February 23.” In anticipation of that Saturday deadline, Maduro had sent soldiers to block key crossings with Colombia, closed the border with Brazil, and banned maritime crossings to the Caribbean island of Curação, where aid was being stored. At around 6.30 am local time Friday, soldiers opened fire on civilians who tried to reopen the Brazilian border to get supplies in, killing two and injuring 12. On Friday and Saturday, British billionaire Richard Branson hosted a massive pop concert near the Tienditas bridge between Venezuela and the Colombian border city of Cúcuta. More than 300,000 people attended the concert, called Venezuela Aid Live, which aimed to raise money for more aid and featured popular acts from Latin America, including Luis Fonsi. On Friday, Guaidó made an appearance on stage, despite being banned from traveling by the Maduro regime. The Presidents of Chile, Colombia and Paraguay also attended. Maduro held his own concert near the bridge on the other side of the border, a three-day event under the banner Hands of Venezuela. One truck carrying aid managed to pierce Maduro’s blockade Saturday morning, getting through from the town of Pacaraima in northern Brazil shortly before 11 a.m. But later, four people died at the Brazilian border as protesters faced off with pro-government militia groups.",The Crisis in Venezuela Is Rapidly Escalating.

1409,Laignee Barron / Hong Kong,"Two Saudi sisters stranded in Hong Kong after they attempted to flee what they described as “slavery” at home have applied for an emergency visa to a third country, TIME has learned. The sisters have just three remaining days during which Hong Kong authorities have agreed to tolerate their presence in the semi-autonomous Chinese enclave, according to documents viewed by TIME. After their Saudi passports were invalidated in November, the sisters, who go by the aliases Reem and Rawan, were permitted to stay until Feb. 28, according to a letter from the Hong Kong Immigration Department. The pair hope that their application to the third country — which they declined to have named — will be approved before the looming deadline. “We are afraid. It’s really stressful not to know what will happen to us. Since there [are] just three days until we become illegal [overstayers] in Hong Kong, I am really scared about what is going to happen,” says Rawan. The sisters, aged 18 and 20, are the latest Saudi women to be marooned in an unfamiliar country, pleading with the international community to provide them a safe haven. Last month, teenage runaway Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun captured global headlines after barricading herself in a Thai hotel room and mounting a social media campaign to avoid forcible repatriation. She eventually secured refugee status and resettled in Canada. The sisters, who fled before Alqunun, arrived in Hong Kong in transit on Sept. 6, after escaping a family vacation to Sri Lanka. They say they never made it to Australia, their intended destination, because officials from the Saudi Consulate intercepted them at the airport, forcing them to enter the city as visitors. The stopover that was meant to only last two hours has instead stretched into nearly six months, with each moment spent looking over their shoulders. “There is a government, there is a family, behind us that is chasing us. It’s an emergency,” says Rawan. The Saudi Consulate and the Saudi Foreign Ministry have not responded to TIME’s request for comment. In Hong Kong, the stranded sisters say they have changed locations 13 times, jumping between hotels and shelters, sometimes not staying in the same place for more than one night.

1411,Amy Gunia,"U.S. President Donald Trump announced a delay on Sunday night of his intention to increase tariffs on Chinese goods imported into the U.S. Trump announced the delay via Twitter, citing “substantial progress” in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Trump had been threatening to increase tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The tweets came following several days of negotiations in Washington led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and China Vice Premier Liu He. Lighthizer and Liu extended talks through the weekend. Trump has hinted in recent days that the increase might be delayed if negotiators made good progress. “It’s not a big surprise, all the signs last week were that they are making enough progress to warrant a delay but not enough progress to make a final deal,” says Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics told TIME. Although details of the agreements made have not been released, Trump told White House reporters on Friday that a deal had been made on currency and currency manipulation. “It seems to me that they’re still ironing out a lot of the issues and haven’t reached an agreement on larger structural issues and how all of this will be enforced,” says Evans-Pritchard Trump did not set a new deadline for increased tariffs. “Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself, at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude an agreement,” Trump tweeted.

That’s according to the 2019 edition of the Bloomberg Healthiest Country Index, which ranks 169 economies according to factors that contribute to overall health. Spain placed sixth in the previous gauge, published in 2017. Four additional European nations were among the top 10 in 2019: Iceland (third place), Switzerland (fifth), Sweden (sixth) and Norway (ninth). Japan was the healthiest Asian nation, jumping three places from the 2017 survey into fourth and replacing Singapore, which dropped to eighth. Australia and Israel rounded out the top 10 at seventh and 10th place. The index grades nations based on variables including life expectancy while imposing penalties on risks such as tobacco use and obesity. It also takes into consideration environmental factors including access to clean water and sanitation. Spain has the highest life expectancy at birth among European Union nations, and trails only Japan and Switzerland globally, United Nations data show. Spain by 2040 is forecast to have the highest lifespan, at almost 86 years, followed by Japan, Singapore and Switzerland, according to the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “Primary care is essentially provided by public providers, specialized family doctors and staff nurses, who provide preventive services to children, women and elderly patients, and acute and chronic care,” according to the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies 2018 review of Spain, noting a decline the past decade in cardiovascular diseases and deaths from cancer. Researchers say eating habits may provide clues to health levels enjoyed by Spain and Italy, as a “Mediterranean diet, supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, had a lower rate of major cardiovascular events than those assigned to a reduced-fat diet,” according to a study led by the University of Navarra Medical School. Meanwhile in North America, Canada’s 16th-place ranking far surpassed the U.S. and Mexico, both of which dropped slightly to 35th and 53rd.

Kim is due to meet Trump this week in Hanoi for their second summit after a meeting in June in Singapore, where they agreed to work toward the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Progress has sputtered since then, with critics saying the statement failed to spell out how to achieve its key goals. Trump will meet with Kim one-on-one in Hanoi for a meal and have lengthier negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, where they will be joined by aides, U.S. officials said. On the trip to the Singapore summit, he flew from Pyongyang on a Chinese state-owned airplane two days ahead of the event instead of using a plane from North Korea’s state carrier, which has been banned from some regions due to safety concerns. It was his farthest foray from home since taking office in 2011. For his rail trips, Kim travels on a heavily fortified train equipped with luxury carriages that plod along the tracks at slow speeds due to its weight and construction. A train journey to Hanoi could take two days or more, and include a lengthy car trip from the Vietnam-China border.

1416,Ciara Nugent,"The border between Venezuela and Colombia is set to become the stage of a showdown Saturday between Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian government and the opposition. Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan parliament leader who many countries now recognize as the country’s interim president, has worked with the U.S. government to bring millions of dollars worth of aid to the country, where a humanitarian crisis has driven millions to the edge of starvation and forced more than 3 million people – one tenth of the population – to flee. Trucks and warehouses filled with food, medicine and other supplies now sit at several locations just outside the country – in the Colombian border city of Cúcuta, at points along the southern border with Brazil and on the nearby island of Curaçao. But Maduro, who has refused to abandon the presidency and retains the support of Venezuela’s powerful military, is refusing to let the aid in. He says it is an attempt “to humiliate the Venezuelan people” and has labelled the food “carcinogenic.” On Wednesday he banned all travel to Curaçao and on Thursday closed the border with Brazil. There, soldiers opened fire on civilians who tried to reopen it to get the aid in, killing two indigenous people. Despite all that, Guaidó has promised the aid will get into Venezuela “one way or another” by Saturday. As aid amasses on the border and Maduro’s military prepares to face-off with Guaidó supporters, here’s what to know about the stand-off: Venezuela’s current crisis dates back to its Socialist Revolution in 1998, led by Maduro’s predecessor and mentor Hugo Chávez, who was elected on a platform of eliminating poverty. For years he used Venezuela’s vast oil wealth (the country has the largest proven reserves in the world) to fund expansive social programs, such as subsidized utilities and free health care and education. But both Chávez and Maduro also presided over widespread corruption and economic mismanagement. The government structured Venezuela’s economy to focus on oil revenues and importing food in order to benefit the military and political elite, which controls both sectors, says Diego Moya-Ocampos, a Venezuela expert at risk analysts IHS Markit.   “They started to generate a crisis, where the country was producing less and less,” he says, adding that the country produces only around 20% of the food it needs. “These shortages have been common in Venezuela for many years now.” Things got dramatically worse in 2014, when a drop in global oil prices meant the government had less cash to import food. At the same time, falling investor confidence in the country sent the value of Venezuela’s currency, the Bolívar, into free fall. Since then acute shortages of food and other imported goods have lead to widespread hunger, with the average Venezuelan losing 24 pounds in 2017. The lack of basic medicine has crippled the health system.

The unidentified woman fell ill after dining at Riff with her husband and son on Saturday, Feb 16. She experienced symptoms of food-poisoning, including vomiting and diarrhea, before succumbing to her illness Sunday morning. Her family also experienced symptoms, but recovered, according to CNN. In a report by Spanish newspaper El País, Health officials who inspected the restaurant determined that 26 other diners had also experienced symptoms of food-poisoning, but were unable to find any concrete causes for the outbreak. Samples of ingredients from the menu were then submitted for toxicology tests. Inspectors determined that the affected diners had visited the restaurant between Feb. 13-16.  The restaurant, Riff “specializes in fashionable European cuisine and Mediterranean food” according to its website. It opened in 2001 and earned its first Michelin star in 2009, one of the highest culinary honors in the world a restaurant can receive. Entrees at the high-end dining establishment cost around $40 USD, in addition to a $150 tasting menu. Head chef Bernd Knöller released a statement expressing his despair over the incident and announced that the restaurant is in full compliance with health inspectors and will remain closed until the cause of the outbreak is confirmed. Riff did not immediately return a request for comment.

1419,George Steer,"On both sides of the Atlantic, authorities are grappling with what to do with people linked to Islamic State (ISIS) returning home from the war in Syria. President Donald Trump has said Hoda Muthana, who left the U.S. to become a propagandist for ISIS, “is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States“, while Shamima Begum, who left London four years ago with two friends to join up with ISIS in Syria, has been stripped of her U.K. citizenship. Other foreign citizens who fought for ISIS are facing justice in their home countries. The British government has prosecuted at least 40 people who have returned to the U.K. having fought in Iraq or Syria. On Feb. 16, Trump called on Britain, France, Germany and other European allies “to take back over 800 Isis fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial.” Begum and Muthana were not combatants, but each pledged allegiance to ISIS. And for now at least, they will not be allowed back to what they consider their home countries. Their cases have raised some difficult questions: What does it mean to be a citizen of Britain or the U.S.? And how easily can that citizenship be removed? Here, we try to explain: To not be a legal citizen of any country. Despite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirming that “everyone has the right to a nationality,” the U.N. estimates there are roughly 12 million people around the world who are not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law, What this means in practice, for example, is that if Begum’s human rights were violated in Syria, there would be no state that would be able to take up her claim or protect her. Because it claims she is a dual citizen of Bangladesh. Britain’s Home Secretary (or interior minister) Sajid Javid says he was legally entitled to strip Begum of her British citizenship because she already has Bangladeshi citizenship via her Bangladeshi-born mother. However, Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs insists she is not a citizen, and that there is “no question” of her being allowed into the country. She has never lived in Bangladesh. Lawyers for Begum say it is illegal under international law for her to have had her British citizenship removed – something that can only legally be done if Begum is also a citizen of another country. If in the future it is found that Begum is a Bangladeshi citizen, Javid’s decision will likely stand; if it’s found that she is not, his decision could be annulled.",Shamima Begum and the Legality of Removing Citizenship from an ISIS Member,"February 22, 2019"

1421,Ian Bremmer,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) travelled to Asia this week in his first major, multi-destination tour outside the Middle East since the Khashoggi incident spilled into international headlines. All told, he will have spent two days in Pakistan, two days in India, and two days in China visiting his political counterparts and signing deals by the time the week is out. Asia was always going to be the most important component of the Crown Prince’s Vision 2030 plan to transform Saudi Arabia’s oil-dependent economy into a vibrant, diversified one better-suited to the economic realities of the 21st century. But plenty has changed on the geopolitical front since Vision 2030 was unveiled to the public in April 2016, from Brexit to Trump. Then came the murder last year of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which has indelibly tarnished the crown prince’s image in the U.S. and beyond. The fallout from that means that Saudi Arabia needs the buy-in from major Asian economic powers now more than ever. But as the trade war between China and the U.S. rolls on, and violence between India and Pakistan continues to flare, investment in Asia holds as much promise as peril for the Saudis. Saudi Arabia is trying to make the best of the fraught situation, positioning itself as a potential peace-broker between India and Pakistan while trying to get closer to the Chinese, its largest trading partner (though a certain U.S. president will probably be less than thrilled with the prospect of the latter). Trying to balance the hostilities between geopolitical rivals India and Pakistan is complicated by India’s strong relationship with Iran, which just happens to be Saudi Arabia’s mortal enemy. But in today’s world, one absent true global leadership, being a regional power-broker (and between two nuclear powers no less) can be a handsome reward if one handles it successfully. We just don’t know if the largely-untested 33-year old MBS has it in him yet. Expect the Saudis to get more involved in China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative going forward, with more investments. More ambitiously, the Saudis will aim to position themselves as the Chinese investment hub into the African continent. There is even speculation that the Kingdom is considering moving its oft-delayed Saudi Aramco IPO to a Hong Kong listing rather than New York or London. Beyond that, economic and diplomatic headwinds will make MBS all the more likely to take steps to stabilize the volatile Middle East rather than ratchet things up in an attempt to better position the Kingdom. That will mean a concerted effort by the Saudis to draw down the war in Yemen, to start repairing its estranged relationship with Qatar, to accept the reality that Bashar Assad won the war in Syria, and to avoid direct confrontation with the Iranians. “Our culture is very compatible with the Chinese culture. We have sent hundreds of our students to study in China, and when they came back speaking Chinese, it makes thousands of Saudi people understand how great China is and how wonderful the Chinese people are. We need more of that,” Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resource.","The Quick Read on MBS's Tour of Pakistan, India and China","February 22, 2019"
1422,Casey Quackenbush,"Two Saudi Arabian sisters have spent almost six months hiding in Hong Kong after authorities reportedly foiled an attempt to flee the conservative kingdom, a human rights group says. Using aliases to protect their identities, non-profit Justice Centre Hong Kong said in a statement that Reem, 20, and Rawan, 18, arrived in the city on Sept. 6, 2018, after escaping during a family holiday in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. The pair had booked a connecting flight to Melbourne Australia, where they planned to seek asylum, but they were intercepted upon landing and told their flight had been cancelled. “We fled our home to ensure our safety,” the pair said in the statement. “We hope that we can be given asylum in a country which recognizes women’s rights and treats them as equals. We dream of being in a safe place where we can be normal young women, free from violence and oppression.” The statement also says the two women have renounced Islam, for which they could face the death penalty if forced to return to Saudi Arabia. According to the Justice Centre, the women arrived in Hong Kong via SriLankan Airlines and were immediately approached by two men now known to be staff of the carrier. Believing they were being assisted, the women followed the men through a security checkpoint before being led to a desk of Emirates Airlines. The Justice Centre said the airline since admitted that the men were acting “solely at the request of the Royal Consulate General of Saudi Arabia in Hong Kong.”  Another man later learned to be the Saudi Arabian Consul General then tried to deceive the women into boarding a flight back to Saudi Arabia, the statement continued. The two men reportedly held their passports, which they tried to get back and flee, fearing they were about to be forcibly abducted. The passports were later returned after the women threatened to call the police, according to the Justice Centre. The Consul General reportedly then told the women that their uncle, described as being from Saudi Arabia’s interior ministry, was on the phone. They refused to speak with him. The pair reportedly fled and tried to board their connecting Cathay Pacific flight, but were told their bookings had been cancelled. The sisters have had to change locations 13 times since their arrival in Hong Kong, the Justice Centre said, fearing for their safety. Their Saudi passports have reportedly been invalidated, but their presence in Hong Kong is believed to be tolerated by the semi-autonomous region’s immigration authorities until Feb. 28.","Saudi Sisters Stranded for Months in Hong Kong After Fleeing the Kingdom, Rights Group Says","Updated: February 22, 2019 8:31 AM ET"
1423,Joseph Hincks,"The question of whether two women who joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq—one British and another American-born—should be allowed to return to their respective countries has provoked fierce debate on how Western governments should treat citizens who left to join the caliphate. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he has told the State Department to ban the return of Hoda Muthana, a 24-year-old U.S.–born woman who left Alabama for Syria in 2014 and is now detained in a Kurdish camp. “I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  Britain’s Home Secretary Sajid Javid, meanwhile, has moved to revoke the citizenship of teenager Shamima Begum, who left London to marry an ISIS fighter in Syria four years ago and has begged to be allowed to return with her newborn son. The resistance to Muthana and Begum’s repatriations comes only days after Trump on Twitter asked Britain, France, Germany and other European leaders to take back “over 800 ISIS fighters” that U.S.-backed forces had detained in Syria. The alternative, he warned, is that “we will be forced to release them” adding that the U.S. does not want to see the militants “permeate Europe.” Here’s what to know about the debate over governments’ responsibilities towards returning fighters, their wives and children. An estimated 6,000 Western European nationals joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq—roughly a third of whom have already returned home, according to a 2018 King’s College, London report. Far fewer Americans attempted to join ISIS and other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq—some 300 according to a study by George Washington University’s Program on Extremism.  Because of the almost complete collapse of ISIS’ physical caliphate. Once spanning an area the size of Britain, the U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces (SDF) say ISIS-controlled territory has shrunk to part of one small town near the Iraqi border. Despite U.S. intelligence officials’ warnings that the jihadist group still poses a serious threat and has returned to its guerrilla warfare roots, the U.S. is pulling its troops from Syria. The SDF says it has detained over 800 fighters of nearly 50 nationalities, but does not have the capacity to put them on trial. Journalists came across the two women, along with Canadian Kimberly Gwen Polman, in a Kurdish refugee camp in mid-February.","How ISIS Returnees Are Stirring a Debate Over Citizenship, Security and Rule of Law","February 21, 2019"
1424,Melissa Locker,"While you would think it would be hard for a bee the size of a thumb to go missing, Wallace’s giant bee did just that. The jaw-dropping giant disappeared for 38 years and scientists and bee lovers were convinced it had gone extinct like so many other insects. Luckily, they were wrong. The world’s largest bee—the Wallace’s giant bee or Megachile pluto—has been rediscovered, minding its own beeswax on Indonesian’s North Moluccas islands. The bee’s disappearing act was foiled by an intrepid and determined search team of North American and Australian biologists who wanted to figure out once and for all whether the bee still existed. The Guardian reports that the scientists found the answer in a termite’s nest in a tree, where a single female Wallace’s giant bee had set up a home. The bee, which photographer Clay Bolt described as a “flying bulldog” calling the entire experience of snapping the first photo of the newly-rediscovered bee “absolutely breathtaking”, which is exactly what someone who saw a flying bulldog would say. The bees live up to their reputation. The females can grow up to four centimeters long and have a wingspan of 2.5 inches. “It’s just ridiculously large,” Simon Robson, a biologist at the University of Sydney in Australia and a member of the expedition, told The New York Times. The giant bee has always been reclusive. It was first documented in 1858 by British explorer and naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace (he helped Charles Darwin come up with the theory of evolution) and was then not seen again until 1981, Bolt writes in a blog post. It’s been playing hide and seek ever since. Bolt teamed up with entomologist Eli Wyman and convinced Global Wildlife Conservation, a nonprofit group that sends out search parties to hunt for “lost” species — animals that  haven’t been spotted in at least a decade— to add Wallace’s Giant Bee to their list. They collaborated with Robson and Canadian-born writer Glen Chilton to track down the elusive monster bee—and they succeeded. Don’t worry there are plenty of other lost animals to find, including the Pink-Headed Duck, the Fernandina Galápagos Tortoise, and the Namdapha Flying Squirrel. While the bee has once-again been found, it’s hard to say how long it will stay. Currently there is no protection for the bee’s habitat, which is threatened by deforestation for agricultural purposes, meaning that while Wallace’s giant bee isn’t extinct yet, it may be in the not-too-distant future.

1425,W.J. Hennigan,"After hundreds of airstrikes failed to curtail the Taliban’s $200 million-a-year opium trade, the U.S. military quietly ended a yearlong campaign that targeted drug labs and networks laced around the Afghan countryside. The end of the operation, code-named Iron Tempest, comes as Trump Administration officials engage in direct peace talks with Taliban leaders that could end the 17-year-old war. The U.S. military first began targeting Taliban narcotics facilities with airstrikes and Special Operations raids in November 2017 when opium production jumped to record highs in Afghanistan. At the time, U.S. commanders estimated the Taliban operated up to 500 drug labs, which helped fuel their nearly two-decade long insurgency. Since then, U.S. and Afghan warplanes have launched more than 200 strikes aimed at disabling Taliban narcotics production, processing, trading and transportation networks. Yet the drug trade thrived. So, over time, the U.S. halted the number of air raids. Only two strikes took place over the last three months of 2018, which marked the end of the campaign, according to the latest Defense Department Inspector General’s report. The military’s strategy became the latest high-priced failure to slow endemic poppy cultivation and drug trafficking in Afghanistan. The U.S. has spent $8.9 billion in U.S. counter-narcotics efforts since 2001, yet the war-torn country has consistently produced about 85% of the world’s illicit opium supply. In total, the air campaign barely dented the drug enterprise. The strikes denied the Taliban an estimated $42 million, while denying about $200 million to “those involved in the illegal drug trade in Afghanistan,” according to a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) report published in January. However, the U.S. government watchdog said it’s difficult to determine financial impact with any certainty because “no ground verification takes place to weigh and assess the amounts of the precursors or products actually destroyed by an airstrike.” Meanwhile, opium production in Afghanistan hit record highs over the past two years. The U.N. reported 1,015 square miles of net poppy cultivation in 2018, resulting in 6,400 tons of opium production. That’s more than double than when the U.S. invaded in 2001. Narcotics trafficking is so pervasive that senior Afghan security leaders and provincial authorities often control drug networks in the country’s western, southwestern and northern regions, SIGAR said. For many years, opium syrup derived from Afghanistan’s vast poppy fields was smuggled into other countries to be processed into heroin or morphine. Now much of that refinement takes place in crude facilities around Afghanistan. The Taliban, which once forbid poppy cultivation before being toppled from power by the U.S. in 2001, seized upon the drug market. Opium trafficking is estimated to make up 65% of the Taliban’s income, according to U.S. officials.",The U.S. Sent Its Most Advanced Fighter Jets to Blow Up Cheap Opium Labs.

1429,Katie Reilly,"Maria Ressa spent New Year’s Eve in Times Square, a guest of honor at a celebration of the free press. Little more than a month later, the Filipina journalist spent the night in a Manila jail over a “cyberlibel” charge brought by the government against her as executive editor of the news site Rappler. Human-rights and journalism organizations have condemned the charge–Amnesty International called it “brazenly politically motivated”–and warned that Ressa’s arrest marks an escalation of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s crackdown on the press. The arrest also comes amid growing concern about the state of press freedom globally. More than 250 journalists worldwide were imprisoned last year, per the Committee to Protect Journalists, and those like Ressa who risk their safety and lives to do that work were named the Guardians, TIME’s 2018 Person of the Year. “The government is sending a very clear message–not just to me or to Rappler or to journalists. It’s to the entire Philippines. And that message is: they’re very powerful, be silent and follow, or you’re going to be next,” Ressa, who has dismissed the charge as “ludicrous,” tells TIME. “We can’t be silent now, especially if we’re under threat.” The charge, which falls under the Cybercrime Prevention Act, stems from a May 2012 Rappler article reporting that businessman Wilfredo Keng was under surveillance relating to illegal drugs and human trafficking–a story published months before the act made libel punishable by up to 12 years in jail. (Keng denies the allegation.) Ressa sees the libel charge, one of several charges she now faces, as the latest attempt to stop the site from reporting on the extrajudicial killings of Duterte’s drug war–a view reinforced by the circumstances of her arrest. She spent one night in jail on Feb. 13 after being arrested in Rappler’s office that evening, late enough for her to believe she was purposefully prevented from posting bail before courts closed. “I realized that’s their point. They wanted me to go through being arrested,” Ressa says. “They wanted me to feel their power.” “The world knows Maria Ressa’s name, so this sort of takes it up to a new level,” says Janet Steele, director of the Institute for Public Diplomacy and Global Communication at George Washington University, who studies journalism in Southeast Asia. “This sends a really bad signal to all other journalists,” she says, warning that it will have a “terrible chilling effect.” Ressa fears the chill has already set in. Days after her arrest, the Philippine Star removed a 2002 story about Keng from its website. In a statement, the Star said “the takedown was seen as a prudent course of action” amid uncertainty about the libel law’s applications. Duterte–who has banned Rappler staff from official events and dismissed its reporting as “fake news”–has denied that charges against Ressa have anything to do with the site’s reporting and has said he doesn’t know Keng. But journalists and human-rights advocates say Duterte and other world leaders bear blame for setting a dangerous tone. “[Duterte] has created an atmosphere whereby the entirety of the press becomes suspect,” says Sheila Coronel, director of Columbia University’s Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism, who has reported in the Philippines. “The creation of an uncivil space that attacks professional newsgathering–you see that all over the world, even in the more advanced democracies.”",The Message Behind Maria Ressa's Cyber Libel Arrest,"February 21, 2019"
1430,Simon Shuster/Munich,"It’s been the stuff of nightmares ever since the Cold War: U.S. officers detect a Russian missile taking flight, and they have just a few minutes to counsel the President on how to react. Under the treaties that govern nuclear arms, those officers have the information they need to help make the right call–and to avoid such scenarios from arising in the first place. But these safeguards are now in jeopardy. Two of the treaties that buttress the world’s post–Cold War security architecture–setting strict limits and enforcing transparency on both the U.S. and Russian arsenals–are in the process of unraveling. The Trump Administration said Feb. 1 that it would withdraw the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, on the grounds that Russia had been violating it for years. In 2021, a separate treaty that governs long-range nuclear missiles, known as New Start, is due to expire. Renewing it would likely take years of talks. But so far, “we have not been offered any meaningful consultations,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told an annual security summit on Feb. 16 in Munich. If talks don’t begin soon, most experts believe the treaty will lapse with nothing to replace it. The unwinding of these agreements comes amid a global buildup of arms. The U.S. and Russia are racing to develop more compact and precision-guided nuclear missiles. China shows little interest in negotiating curbs on its own fast-advancing arsenal. And the Middle East is edging toward an arms race of its own, especially after the Trump Administration pulled out of a deal to stop Iran’s nuclear-weapons program last year. According to the analytics firm Jane’s by IHS Markit, arms spending in the Gulf has risen by 25% since 2013, to an estimated $103 billion this year. But the shifting balance between nuclear states should be of most concern, says François Heisbourg, a military expert who served as an adviser to the French Defense Ministry during the Cold War. Without the rules of transparency written into the nuclear treaties between the U.S. and Russia, he says, both sides would become blind to each other’s nuclear arsenals. For military strategists, that has one disturbing consequence, Heisbourg says: “Treat every crisis as having full-blown nuclear potential.” The world already has no shortage of crises with room for nuclear miscalculation, especially involving Russia. In the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and even the Arctic, Russian forces are operating in close proximity to those of the U.S. and its allies. They sometimes clash, as when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet in 2015, or when Russian mercenaries attacked U.S. Marines last year near a gas plant in Syria. What makes such skirmishes even more dangerous is the growing strength and reach of Russia’s military. In her forthcoming book on the subject, Bettina Renz, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham, concludes that Russia’s “stocks of weaponry have been comprehensively replenished” over the past decade or so. And on Feb. 20, in a major public address, Vladimir Putin made it clear the growth is unlikely to stop. The U.S. has the right to pull out of treaties, he warned, but “let them count the speed and the range of the weapons systems we are developing.” During the Cold War, such threats from the East typically would have pushed the West to develop a joint response. That no longer seems to be the case. The loss of trust between the U.S. and Europe was especially palpable at this year’s Munich summit, a traditional show of mutual reassurance among NATO allies. In her speech to the summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel complained that the U.S. decision to scrap the INF treaty was made without consulting Europe, even though the treaty concerns Europe’s security most of all. “We sit there in the middle with the result,” Merkel said. Minutes later, when Vice President Mike Pence delivered a greeting from his boss, President Donald Trump, the room full of European diplomats responded with stony silence. Their chief concern at the summit, at least when it comes to nuclear security, was the U.S. move in May to pull out of the deal with Iran. That deal took nearly a decade to negotiate, and it committed the Islamic Republic in 2015 to halt its nuclear-weapons program. Yet despite U.S. intelligence agencies reporting the deal was working, the Trump Administration scrapped it, imposing new sanctions against Iran and pressuring European allies to do the same. Germany, France and the U.K. have so far refused.",The Rift Between the U.S. and Europe Brings Nuclear Risks,"February 21, 2019"
1431,Hillary Leung,"A team of archaeologists may have unveiled one of the mysteries about Stonehenge, the iconic circular monument in southwest England. Rocks called bluestones that form an inner horseshoe and outer ring were traced to two precise quarries in west Wales, around 180 miles away from the towering stone circle. According to findings revealed this week in Antiquity, an archaeology journal, the team excavated quarries named Carn Goedog and Craig Rhos-y-felin in the Welsh hills and found evidence that bluestones were extracted around 3000 B.C., the same period as the initial stage of construction of Stonehenge. Past studies have indicated that the bluestones that wound up on the Salisbury Plain originated from the Preseli Hills in west Wales. But now, new research has revealed the exact quarries from which the rocks were lifted, and suggests that they were transported to the site on land, and by hand. At least five bluestone pillars were taken from Carn Goedog, and at least one from Craig Rhos-y-felin, the study states. Evidence suggests that workers used wedges to loosen pillars from the rock face and tied ropes to control their descent onto an artificial platform. Then, they may have laid timbers on top of the platform so they could be lowered onto a wooden sledge and hauled away. That prehistoric builders traveled such a far distance to obtain the bluestones sets Stonehenge apart from many of Europe’s other megalithic structures, which are crafted from rocks that were found within the site’s vicinities, the Washington Post reports. One of the researchers, Michael Parker Pearson suggested that Stonehenge was perhaps a symbol of unity for British tribes during a time of economic and population decline, according to the Post. “A major event like this would have brought together disparate communities that were growing apart,” he said.

1432,Casey Quackenbush,"Taiwan presented Asia’s first same-sex marriage bill on Thursday, draft legislation that would grant similar legal protections to same-sex couples as heterosexual ones, Reuters reports. The bill is a first for Asia, a region not generally known for upholding LGBT rights. Last year, Taiwan’s voters opposed marriage equality in a host of referendums, opting to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Voters supported drafting a special law for same-sex partnerships, which  activists cited as discriminatory, according to Reuters. The new bill has also been met with criticism from conservative groups that oppose same-sex unions. On Thursday, the Coalition for the Happiness of Our Next Generation called the draft “unacceptable.” “Controversies are expected about the proposal, but I really hope our homosexual friends can wait a bit longer,” Premier Su Tseng-chang said in a statement, according to Reuters. “This might fall short of expectations, but after all it’s a start.” Taiwan’s Constitutional Court voted to legalize marriage equality in 2017 on the basis that it was unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples marriage rights. The government was given until May 2019 to implement the ruling, which did not specify how to adopt it. Taiwan’s parliament is expected to vote on the draft bill by late May. Last December, Thailand’s junta backed a bill to recognize same-sex civil partnerships, a move that will now need parliamentary approval.

1433,Melissa Chan,"Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman’s defense lawyers plan to seek a retrial for the recently convicted kingpin following a report that multiple jurors violated a judge’s orders and then apparently lied about it. The alleged and so-far-unverified misconduct claim Wednesday could threaten to undo the results of the three-month federal trial. According to Vice News, a juror came forward anonymously to describe what it was like to sit on the historic trial, which ended last week in federal court in Brooklyn with a guilty verdict on all charges. Vice reported that the juror dropped a bombshell in the interview by saying at least five members of the jury routinely read about the trial, in news reports and in social media, despite daily admonishments by Judge Brian Cogan not to do so. Every day of the trial ended with the judge strictly telling the jurors not to discuss the case or do any research on it after they leave the courthouse. If the jurors ignored the judge’s orders, they may have been exposed to prejudicial and uncorroborated allegations that weren’t allowed to be submitted as evidence, including news reports that Guzman had drugged and raped girls as young as 13. “You know how we were told we can’t look at the media during the trial? Well, we did. Jurors did,” the juror reportedly told Vice. “The judge said, ‘You can’t talk about the case among each other,’ but we broke that rule a bunch of times.” Guzman’s defense team blasted the jurors’ alleged misconduct, calling the issues raised in the news report “deeply concerning and distressing.” Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman, one of Guzman’s attorneys, told TIME the jurors who broke the rules “may have been in contempt of court for their actions.” “We will be filing a motion for a new trial I suspect sooner rather than later,” he said, adding that he was in the middle of doing the legal research. “All we ever wanted for Mr. Guzman was a fair trial and that’s all we deserved,” he said in a more detailed statement. “We will continue to seek justice for him.”",El Chapo's Lawyers Are Pushing for a New Trial After Report Jurors Read News Stories About Him,"February 21, 2019"
1435,Joseph Hincks,"Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been shunned by much of the world after the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October, which the CIA concluded he had ordered. A-list executives pulled out of his Riyadh investment forum (dubbed ‘Davos in the Desert’), street protests greeted his arrival in Tunisia in November, and there were reports Morocco’s King Mohammed VI snubbed him on a visit to the North African country. That wasn’t the case earlier this week in Pakistan, however, which bestowed its highest civilian award on the young Saudi prince, gave him a gold-plated gun, and declared Monday a public holiday in honor of his two-day visit to Islamabad. “Saudi Arabia has always been a friend in need, which is why we value it so much,” Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said Sunday, while seated next to MBS, as the crown prince is known. Earlier Saudi’s de-facto leader had announced investments in Pakistani petrochemicals, power generation, and mining projects worth more than $20 billion. In addition to the staggering financial package, MBS — on Khan’s request — ordered the “immediate release” of more than 2,000 Pakistani prisoners incarcerated in the Kingdom. He “won the hearts of the people of Pakistan,” the prime minister — who broke protocol to personally drive MBS to his official residence — later gushed on Twitter. MBS’s visit to Islamabad is widely regarded as an attempt to repair his tarnished credentials as an international statesman. It precedes stops in India and China, which—like Pakistan—have not spoken out about Khashoggi’s murder. But Saudi Arabia’s investment in the nuclear-armed South Asian state is more than just a PR exercise. Saudi Arabia has a long history of providing financial support to Pakistan. That includes funneling money through Pakistan’s madrassa education system, cushioning the impact of international sanctions following its nuclear test in the late 1990s, and loaning Islamabad $1.5 billion when the Pakistani rupee crashed in 2014. But the latest round of investment comes at a critical time for Islamabad, which is in the middle of an economic crisis. The foreign exchange reserves that Pakistan uses to purchase crucial fuel imports have dwindled to less than $8 billion. Since he was sworn in as prime minister last August, the populist Khan has been engaged in a highly public “austerity drive” while appealing to friendly nations for financial support. In fact, in October his government received Saudi funds to the tune of $6 billion, including $3 billion import payment deferrals. The Kingdom proffered that support package after Khan’s visit to Riyadh, when Pakistan’s central bank reserves had plummeted 40% on the previous year’s figures. Islamabad is currently negotiating a bailout from the IMF—the country’s 13th since the 1980s. Historically known for spending lavishly to win hearts and minds, the Saudi Kingdom now faces financial constraints of its own. It urgently needs to diversify its oil-dependent economy. “The largesse that the Saudis were able to afford in the 80s and 90s, we haven’t seen recently, and we definitely haven’t seen it under MBS,” says Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert at King’s College, London. The pledged $20 billion in not just “a bailout they do because they like the Pakistanis,” he says. Instead there is oversight to ensure investments are “sustainable and will actually have returns in the future.”",Saudi Arabia Is Investing $20 Billion in Pakistan.

1436,Ian Bremmer,"For decades, American foreign policy has rested on a consensus view about the United States’ role in the world. In an international order where there is one unrivaled superpower, foreign policy experts agree that U.S. soldiers and taxpayer dollars are essential for preserving global stability. But that is an assumption that is not necessarily shared by the American public, based on the findings of a new study Worlds Apart: U.S. Foreign Policy and American Public Opinion, conducted by the Eurasia Group Foundation (EGF), an organization I serve as Board President. No matter what party they claim allegiance to, Americans favor a foreign policy that resists entanglements abroad, the survey found—and it’s not limited to conservative libertarians on the right and liberal pacifists on the left. In every age group polled, respondents exhibited a waning appetite for the obligations and impositions of imperial governance. This isn’t the first time these findings have cropped up. Americans have been skeptical of overseas interventions for decades now. But this study provides the clearest picture yet of how Americans view the world at a moment when U.S. President Donald Trump is taking an unprecedented approach to foreign policy, and the fault lines of American politics are being redrawn. For all the (entirely fair) criticism of his chaotic and abrasive decision-making, Trump understands this wariness. Some insist he has hijacked U.S. foreign policy by expressing public doubt about the value of existing alliances and an interventionist foreign policy. But in many ways Trump’s views align more closely than others in Washington D.C. with the ways in which a majority of American taxpayers would define the future U.S. role in the world. America First isn’t just a Trump catchphrase. When it comes to foreign policy, it’s becoming a national worldview. Ever since the Cold War, U.S. policymakers have broadly agreed that two World Wars and the struggle with expansionist Soviet communism offered indisputable proof that American leadership is both good for the world and for U.S. national security. It gives Washington the tools to exert power “over there” to prevent foreign problems from reaching American shores. Yet for all the talk of leadership, Washington policymakers have failed to convince Americans they should bear the cost of exercising it abroad. After the attacks of Sept.11, 2001, and the inconclusive military interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere that followed, the American public is less convinced than ever that it is the U.S.’s responsibility to guarantee global security and prosperity in the 21st century. Asked how best to achieve peace, over one third of respondents to the EGF study said the U.S. should “focus on domestic needs and the health of American democracy.” Just 18% said the best route was by promoting and defending democracy around the world. Americans have not stopped believing the country is exceptional. Rather, as the report’s author Mark Hannah observes, “support for American exceptionalism and leadership is linked to the power of America’s example, and is not necessarily indicative of support for active intervention in global affairs.” Americans believe exceptionalism is better expressed by the power of what the U.S. does at home, rather than by a project to remake the world in America’s image. Almost half of the survey’s respondents believe “America is exceptional because of what it represents.” Only 17% said that “America is exceptional because of what it has done for the world.” I think this in part the case because Americans have come to accept that, globally, democracy has not carried the day.

1437,Ciara Nugent,"Karl Lagerfeld, the iconic creative director of fashion house Chanel, has died in Paris aged 85, according to French media reports. The German designer joined Chanel in 1983 and is credited with revitalizing the label after the death of its founder Coco Chanel. He became one of the most prolific contributors to the label, and to the entire fashion world. Speculation over his ill health began in January, when he missed Chanel’s spring-summer haute couture show in Paris. The brand said he was “feeling tired.” Lagerfeld was born Karl-Otto Lagerfeldt in Germany in 1933 and raised near Hamburg. He later dropped the “t” because, he said, it sounded “more commercial.” Lagerfeld moved to Paris as a teenager and got his first job in the industry in 1955 as an assistant to French designer Pierre Balmain. Over the following two decades he designed collections for a series of prestigious fashion houses including Chloe, Fendi and Valentino. Lagerfeld was already a well-known designer in the early 1980s, when he took the helm at Chanel. Adding irreverent touches to the brand’s classic designs, pioneering high-profile runway shows, and expanding key areas of the business such as perfume and jewellery, he helped turn Chanel into one of the largest and most profitable luxury brands in the world. The company was worth $10 billion last year, according to figures released by its chief financial officer. Lagerfeld’s intense work ethic, and the longevity of his career, became legend in the fashion world – he started his own eponymous fashion house in 1984, while continuing his work at Chanel and Fendi. Meanwhile, his trademark trademark white ponytail and dark glasses, combined with a penchant for making outrageous and eccentric statements, made him a highly visible figure in popular culture. Famous faces from Lagerfeld’s industry shared tributes to him Tuesday.",Legendary Fashion Designer Karl Lagerfeld Dies in Paris at 85,"February 19, 2019"
1438,Hillary Leung,"Absher, a government-backed mobile app in Saudi Arabia, has come under sharp criticism amid claims that it reinforces the country’s system of male guardianship — which requires women to seek approval for things like traveling and getting a job. Among the app’s many features, which include allowing Saudis to renew their driver’s licenses and request government documents online, it also reportedly gives male users the option of receiving SMS alerts when female “dependents” present their passports at a border, effectively enabling men to track and control women’s movement. Several rights groups have called on Google and Apple to ensure Absher doesn’t facilitate the abuse of women’s rights, while some have called for it to be removed from their app stores. But many Absher users within Saudi Arabia have come to its defense, saying it’s a productivity tool that saves them hours of bureaucracy and ultimately makes travel easier for many Saudi women. Absher is a free mobile app launched by the Saudi government in 2015. Available on the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store, Absher is described as “the official individuals eServices Mobile Application that provide the services of Absher portal in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” and is listed under the “Productivity” category on both sites. The name Absher roughly translates to “good tidings” or “yes, done,” in Arabic. Users can use the app to complete day-to-day tasks such as checking their mail, registering vehicles, booking government appointments and applying for visas. The app allows male users to log the information of their dependents and to grant or revoke permission for them to travel at the click of a button. Specifically, male users can register women’s names and passport numbers, select how many journeys she can take and how long she can travel for, according to screenshots of the web version of the app published by Insider. Under the male guardianship law, every woman must have approval from a male custodian in order to travel Critics argue that allowing men to grant this approval via the app normalizes and reinforces an antiquated patriarchal system. On Feb. 11, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden wrote a letter to Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook, the CEOs of Google and Apple respectively, demanding that they take down Absher from the app stores. “It is hardly news that the Saudi monarchy seeks to restrict and repress Saudi women,” Wyden wrote, “but American companies should not enable or facilitate the Saudi government’s patriarchy.” Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both urged Google and Apple to assess the app’s use to determine whether it entrenches discrimination or facilitates abuse. Dana Ahmed, Saudi Arabia researcher for Amnesty International, called it “another example of how the Saudi Arabian government has produced tools to limit women’s freedoms,” adding that giving men the ability to track women “curtails their movement and once again highlights the disturbing system of discrimination under the guardianship laws.” Apple’s Cook told NPR last week that the company would “take a look at it.” Google also said it was “looking into it,” according to CNN. The criticism has prompted backlash from some Saudis who say removing the app would disrupt their daily lives. Marwan Bukhary, a 44-year-old restaurant owner and financial consultant based in the Saudi port city of Jeddah, told TIME he regularly uses Absher to approve work visas and register the Iqama, or Saudi residence ID, for his employees. “This is a life changer app that has made our life easier,” Bukhary says. “It is e-government, we used to do everything by visiting each office and waiting in line for such service, while now we do it in the click of a button.”","What to Know About Absher, Saudi Arabia's Controversial 'Woman-Tracking' App","February 19, 2019"
1439,Billy Perrigo/London,"On a cold November day in London, a demonstrator wearing a large papier-mâché mask of Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg stood outside the U.K. parliament in silent protest, holding up a sign emblazoned with two words: “Where’s Mark?” That question was on the lips of many lawmakers in London that day. More than 20 politicians from nine countries, including Ireland and Canada, had gathered in Westminster. All were worried about Facebook’s role in the spread of disinformation, and all were upset that Zuckerberg had spurned three official invitations for questioning. While the lawmakers couldn’t force Zuckerberg to attend, they laid out an empty chair to represent the missing CEO — and British parliamentary aides ensured photos were sent out to the world’s media. The stunt was devised by Damian Collins, the leader of a U.K. parliamentary investigation into disinformation and “fake news.” The scope of that investigation ranges from Russian election interference to the changing landscape of traditional media, and from Brexit to Trump via Cambridge Analytica.  On Monday, Collins published the final report of that investigation, which proved to be a damning indictment of Facebook. The report accuses Facebook of “intentionally and knowingly” violating data privacy and competition laws; labels top executives “digital gangsters;” and calls for urgent action to regulate social media and investigate Facebook’s alleged lawbreaking. The culmination of 18 months of careful evidence-gathering, the scathing report now makes the U.K. one of the loudest voices calling for legal constraints on Facebook’s power.  “We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people,” Collins said in a statement Monday morning. “The age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end.” In its response to the report, Facebook said it is open to “meaningful regulation.” Collins launched his probe in early 2017, just months after the U.K. voted to leave the E.U. and Donald Trump was elected U.S. President. At the time, the spread of “fake news” was just starting to become a broader topic of interest, and Collins was curious to understand more about how disinformation spreads on social media. The investigation proceeded quietly for the first few months, but rocketed to global prominence in March 2018, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. Collins and his colleagues questioned the whistleblower Christopher Wylie for nearly four hours that same month, in what became the most-streamed select committee hearing in the history of the U.K. parliament. Collins says the Cambridge Analytica development helped put the issue in the spotlight. It made the general public realize “that content is targeted at people in ways they don’t often see or understand,” he told TIME in an interview in his office in January, ahead of the report’s publication. “The ethics of that, and the mechanism for doing that, became a really important part of the inquiry as well.”",How This Politician Put Britain at the Forefront of the War Against Facebook,"February 19, 2019"
1440,Hillary Leung,"The founder of Huawei said there is “no way the U.S. can crush” the tech giant, calling the December arrest of his daughter — the company’s chief financial officer — “politically motivated.” In an interview with the BBC, Ren Zhengfei spoke confidently about the company’s fate despite mounting pressure from Washington. The U.S. has accused the company of circumventing sanctions against Iran and stealing trade secrets. The U.S. has leveled 23 charges against Huawei and Ren’s daughter and Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested at Washington’s request in Vancouver, where she is currently under house arrest awaiting possible extradition. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned countries not to use Huawei technology and said that doing so would make it harder for Washington to “partner alongside them.” The U.S., Australia and New Zealand have already blocked Huawei from their 5G mobile broadband networks. Canada is considering following suit. Nonetheless, Ren remains bullish. “There’s no way the U.S. can crush us,” Ren told the BBC. “The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit.” “If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North goes dark, there is still the South. America doesn’t represent the world.

You’ll lose everything,” Trump said at a Monday night rally in Miami, warning Venezuela’s armed forces to suspend their loyalty to Maduro. The crowd at Florida International University was made up of mostly of immigrants from Venezuela and Cuba, Reuters reports. More than 100,000 Venezuelans and Venezuelan-Americans live in South Florida, the largest concentration in the country. Trump offered strong backing for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself the interim president after rejecting Maduro’s election to a second term last year as illegitimate. Trump called on the military to turn their support to Guaido and allow U.S. aid to be let into country, after Maduro ordered a blockade on the border. “You must not follow Maduro’s orders to block humanitarian aid and you must not threaten any form of violence against peaceful protesters, opposition leaders, members of the National Assembly or President Guaido and his family,” Trump said. He also accused Maduro of following orders from Cuba and being a “Cuban puppet.” Maduro responded by calling Trump’s speech “Nazi-style” and accusing the U.S. President of acting as though he owned Venezuela, according to Reuters.

1442,"David Tweed, Yinan Zhao and Edwin Chan / Bloomberg","China unveiled a sweeping plan to link Hong Kong and Macau with cities in southern China to create a so-called Greater Bay Area, aiming to transform the coastal region into a high-tech megalopolis to rival California’s Silicon Valley. The outline plan, published in Chinese by Xinhua News Agency late Monday, said the government will seek to turn the area into a leading global innovation hub, boost infrastructure connectivity between cities and strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international center of finance, shipping and trade as well as the center for the offshore yuan business. Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen and Guangzhou will be the four key Bay Area cities, driving the region’s economic development, according to the blueprint. HSBC Holdings Plc has estimated the region — with more than 67 million residents — would boast a trillion-dollar economy and eclipse Japan as the world’s fourth-largest exporter. “This policy framework sets out a clear vision for a global economic powerhouse in the Greater Bay Area,” which allows cities and regions to leverage those complementary strengths more effectively, Peter Wong, chief executive of HSBC’s Asia Pacific business, said in an emailed note. The announcement of the strategy drove stocks in the region higher. Guangzhou Port, Zhuhai Port and Shenzhen Yan Tian Port all climbed by the 10 percent daily limit.The long-heralded plan has led to unease in Hong Kong that further integration will erode the autonomy that allows the city to maintain separate legal, monetary and political systems from communist China. Though the plan emphasized the importance of maintaining the “one country, two systems” frameworks meant to ensure a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong and Macau, it didn’t mention which customs and legal systems would predominate. The development of the Greater Bay Area has been challenged by diverging social, legal and customs systems, according to the plan. A comprehensive blueprint can “add new impetus into the development of Hong Kong and Macau” and help build a “world-class cluster of cities,” it said. China has already spent billions of dollars on infrastructure projects linking the cities, and the plan now envisages a strategy for the region that stretches to 2035. President Xi Jinping last year inaugurated a $15 billion, 34-mile bridge, the world’s longest sea crossing, linking Hong Kong with Macau and the mainland city of Zhuhai.

1444,Simon Shuster / Munich,"During his speech to the Munich Security Conference in 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a prediction that many in the West dismissed. He said the Western system of alliances — with its “one master, one sovereign” sitting in Washington, D.C. — would eventually “destroy itself from within.” That speech has aged remarkably well. Twelve years on, as world leaders gathered in Munich again for their annual summit, the Europeans in attendance admitted that Putin had been right. As German Chancellor Angela Merkel put on Feb. 16, the global order had “collapsed into many tiny parts.” That seemed clear enough from the disputes that raged throughout the Munich forum between the U.S. and its European allies, ranging from issues of trade to climate change and nuclear arms. Russia and other American rivals seized the chance to pry the West even further apart. “It’s Diplomacy 101,” Ernest Moniz, the veteran U.S. nuclear negotiator and former Secretary of Energy under President Barack Obama, told TIME after attending several of the closed-door sessions with European diplomats. “If a wedge opens up, you exploit it. You drive it as deep as you can.” Russia and China both put that tactic to use in Munich. Yang Jiechi, the attending member of China’s Politburo, urged his “strategic partners” in Europe to break their dependence on U.S. technology. “We should reject technological hegemony,” he told the crowd of European leaders, appealing for support in China’s escalating trade war with the U.S. and, in particular, the dispute over Huawei, the Chinese industrial giant which the U.S. has accused of violating sanctions and stealing Western technology. “Power politics should be rejected,” Yang added. Russia made a similar appeal. The head of its delegation, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, even suggested building a “shared European home” with Russia that would leave the Americans out. Iran also got in on the action, with Mohammed Javad Zarif, its top diplomat, urging Europe’s leaders not to “succumb” to the bullying of the Trump Administration. Zarif’s most immediate goal in Munich was to salvage the nuclear agreement that Trump withdrew from last year. Despite intense pressure from the White House, the Europeans have stood with Iran on that issue. France, Germany and the U.K. have even continued to trade with Iran in circumvention of U.S. sanctions. Chancellor Merkel insisted that Germany would stick with that position. She also echoed the Chinese delegate in defending free trade in a globalized economy. “We have to fight for multilateralism,” Merkel said, invoking a term that Yang, the Politburo member, used at least 20 times in his speech.",Russia and China Are Driving a Wedge Between Estranged U.S. and Europe,"February 18, 2019"
1445,Billy Perrigo,"Seven lawmakers resigned from the U.K.’s opposition Labour party on Monday morning, in what they described as an act of protest against the party’s Brexit policy and persistent allegations of anti-Semitism, just 39 days before the country is set to leave the European Union. The lawmakers said they supported calls for a so-called “People’s Vote,” or second Brexit referendum, which the Labour party leadership has so far refused to back.  No deal has yet been struck between the U.K. and the E.U. over Brexit, with U.K. lawmakers rejecting May’s deal and the bloc saying renegotiation is off the table. If “Brexit day” of March 29 is reached without an agreement, the U.K.’s trade and legal ties will be cut abruptly with far-reaching effects. Many businesses have already begun stockpiling essential materials to prepare for the eventuality. Trying to get the Labour party to support a second referendum has “been like getting blood from a stone,” said Chuka Umunna, one of the lawmakers, at a press conference on Monday.  The party’s handling of allegations of anti-Semitism were also cited as a reason for the resignations, the latest blow for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. One of the lawmakers who resigned, Luciana Berger, is Jewish. She called the party “sickeningly institutionally racist.” Party members have previously been investigated for bullying Berger, who is eight months pregnant. One member allegedly called her a “disruptive Zionist.” The allegations have dogged Corbyn personally since he became Labour leader in 2015. Critics have pointed to his support in 2012 of a London mural containing anti-Semitic tropes. Corbyn has repeatedly said he is not anti-Semitic or racist. In response to the resignations, Corbyn said on Twitter he was “disappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election.” The lawmakers, who largely belong to the right wing of the party, will not form a new party, but instead sit as independents in parliament and vote on a case-by-case basis.

1446,Hillary Leung,"On the first leg of his three-country Asia tour, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman announced $20 billion-worth of investments in Pakistan, a benefaction that comes amid the ongoing diplomatic crisis sparked by the Khashoggi killing. Financially teetering Pakistan hopes the spate of new deals will ease its balance of payments crisis, Agence France-Presse reports. The Saudi prince, widely known as “MBS”, launched a high-profile, eastward trip to regional allies this week as he seeks to emerge from Western pressure over his alleged involvement in the gruesome murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi last October. Analysts say the Asia tour reflects the crown prince’s attempt to rebuild his reputation and cling to relationships with his allies in Asia. Khashoggi had been a vocal critic of the Saudi regime, and his murder prompted calls — including from Senators — for diplomatic retribution. MBS “wants to demonstrate that he is not an international pariah”, James M. Dorsey, a researcher at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, told AFP. When he landed Sunday at Islamabad’s airport, MBS was greeted by a 21-gun salute and then was warmly embraced by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. Shortly after his arrival, MBS headed into a signing ceremony for the raft of new investments. The two-day visit to Pakistan kicked off amid the nation’s heightened tensions with neighboring India. Last week, a suicide bomber affiliated with a Pakistani extremist group killed over 40 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir, an Indian-administered region that has been the focus of a territorial conflict. MBS will travel to India next, where he will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, before finishing his tour in China on Thursday and Friday.

He did say there was no evidence of interference into the upcoming federal election in May.

The committee concluded that online companies have proved inadequate at self-regulation, and singled out Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg for a “failure of leadership and personal responsibility.” “The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users,” said Damian Collins, chair of the committee. “The guiding principle of the ‘move fast and break things’ culture often seems to be that it is better to apologize than ask permission,” he added. “We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people.

Facebook became a target of the inquiry after whistleblower Christopher Wylie revealed that data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica had illegally obtained access to millions of users’s data. While Zuckerberg apologized over the privacy scandal, he refused to appear before British lawmakers, according to the report. “By choosing not to appear before the Committee and by choosing not to respond personally to any of our invitations, Mark Zuckerberg has shown contempt towards both the UK Parliament and the ‘International Grand Committee’, involving members from nine legislatures from around the world,” the report said.",U.K. Lawmakers Accuse Facebook of 'Intentionally and Knowingly' Violating Data Privacy Laws and Call for Stricter Regulation,"February 18, 2019"

1450,David Goodman and James Ludden / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Prime Minister Theresa May launched a desperate appeal to Conservative Party lawmakers to unite behind her derided Brexit plan as she prepares for a return to Brussels for more talks with European Union leaders. In a letter to her party’s lawmakers, May said she’s planning to meet with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and speak to the leader of every EU member state in the days ahead. Gaining headway in Brussels will depend largely on whether she can show a united front at home. The consequences of the impasse in Parliament were further highlighted this weekend, after British regional airline flybmi ceased operation, partly blaming uncertainty surrounding Brexit. In a BBC interview on Sunday, Katherine Bennett, senior vice president of Airbus SE, said a no-deal outcome would be “catastrophic” and reiterated the plane maker’s warning that it would have to consider future investment in such scenario. Amid the uncertainty, May’s letter, released late Saturday, urged her party to “move beyond what divides us” and sacrifice “personal preferences” to unite in the “higher service of the national interest.” Still, the Sunday Times suggested May’s rhetoric won’t work. It said Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the euroskeptic European Research Group, told his colleagues that Brussels and London were pretending to negotiate while running down the clock so May’s Brexit deal can be forced through parliament. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris rejected that on Sunday, telling Sky News that there’s a “huge amount” of activity from the government in trying to secure a deal, citing trips to Brussels by May and other senior ministers in coming days. May has been forced to return to the EU after lawmakers rejected her deal by a huge margin on Jan. 15, and another vote last week failed after a hard-line group of Brexit-backing MPs shot down any hopes May had of getting it approved. One senior member of May’s administration has said she probably has two weeks to save her deal before the House of Commons takes the process out of her hands, in a vote scheduled for Feb. 27. May urged all sides to make compromises, or risk a situation in which Brexit doesn’t happen — a state of affairs that the prime minister says would undermine British democracy.

1451,Glen Carey and Ben Sills / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — A U.S. appeal for NATO allies to fill the void left by its imminent withdrawal from Syria was dismissed by Spain’s foreign minister, still bristling at Donald Trump’s unilateral decision to bring his troops home. Vice President Mike Pence told reporters at the Munich Security Conference that the U.S. is asking NATO members and other partners to provide “the resources and the support and the personnel” required to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State once U.S. operations conclude. “Requests between countries aren’t made in press releases or conference comments,” Spain’s Josep Borrell said at a briefing in Munich on Saturday. “Spain and the majority of countries aren’t prepared to step in for the U.S. after a withdrawal that was decided in a unilateral way, by surprise.” Trump has pledged to bring home U.S. troops from Syria with Islamic State nearly defeated, an assertion that received renewed criticism after a suicide attack claimed by Islamic State last month killed U.S. soldiers. Trump, in his State of the Union address, reiterated his commitment to end the U.S. presence in Syria, saying that “great nations do not fight endless wars.” Since Trump abruptly announced he was bringing home the troops, he and his top advisers have sought to establish specific conditions for the withdrawal. They’ve promised to depart from Syria slowly and to continue to strike Islamic State on the way out. Pence arrived for Europe’s big annual Munich security conference on Friday, and quickly challenged a common perception that the U.S. has vacated its role as leader of the free world. He joined a large bipartisan U.S. delegation at the conference and addressed the U.S. fight against Islamic State and the decision to pull troops from Syria. “This is a change in tactics, not a change in mission,” Pence said in a talk on Saturday. “The United States will keep a strong presence in the region.

1453,Patrick Donahue / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Chancellor Angela Merkel took President Donald Trump to task before an audience of senior security officials in Munich, calling his administration’s suggestion that European autos are a threat to U.S. national security a “shock.” In a pointed defense of multilateral institutions ahead of a speech by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence at the Munich Security Conference, the German leader called for global trade and cooperation. The biggest BMW plant is in South Carolina, she said, not in the carmaker’s homeland of Bavaria in southern Germany. “Look, we’re proud of our cars,” Merkel said Saturday. “We’re allowed to be. And these cars are built in the United States of America.” “If these cars, which are no less a threat than those built in Bavaria, are suddenly a national security threat to the U.S., then that’s a shock to us,” Merkel said, to loud applause. Still, Germany would be hurt by sanctions, according to data released Friday by the IFO Institute’s Center for International Economics. If the U.S. imposed permanent tariffs of 25 percent, German car exports to the U.S. could fall by almost 50 percent, or about 17 billion euros ($19.2 billion), according to the German think-tank. Total car exports would fall by 18.4 billion euros, or 7.7 percent. Exports from other sectors and to other countries would compensate these effects slightly, so that the total loss of exports would amount to about 11.6 billion euros, it said.

During the address, Trump also spoke about the ongoing substance abuse epidemic in the U.S., and referred to conversations he had with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who Trump said told him that China did not have a drug problem because it could use the death penalty to punish drug dealers. “If we want to get smart, we can get smart,” Trump said. “You can end the drug problem, can end it a lot faster than you think.” The catch is that China does, indeed, have a drug problem, according to experts. “It is incredibly disturbing that President Trump would claim there is not a drug problem in China because they use the death penalty,” says Ann Fordham, executive director of the International Drug Policy Consortium. “I don’t know how it’s possible to claim that. The administration should check its facts, especially when advocating use of the death penalty for drug offenses.” A 2017 report from China’s National Narcotics Control Commission said there were 2.51 million drug users in China as of late 2016, a year-over-year increase of nearly 7%. A report from the Brookings Institution also noted that the number of officially registered drug users in the country increased every year between 1998 and 2016. The actual number of drug users in China, beyond the 2.5 million who are officially registered, is likely “much higher,” Fordham says. In the U.S., an estimated 30.5 million people currently used drugs, including marijuana, in 2017, according to federal data. As of last year, illicit drug use was widespread enough that China invested the equivalent of at least $1.5 million in technology that would allow the government to monitor sewage for signs of drug use, Nature reported.",Trump Said China Doesn't Have a Drug Problem.

1455,Alex Morales / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — U.S. President Donald Trump said he expects trade with the U.K. to increase “substantially,” handing a boost to Theresa May, the beleaguered prime minister, who has flagged a trans-Atlantic agreement as one of the great prizes of Brexit. “With the U.K. we’re continuing our trade and we’re going to be increasing it very substantially as time goes by,” Trump said on Friday. “We’re agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement,” he said. “We have a very good trading relationship with the U.K. and that’s just been strengthened further.’’ The president has close ties with U.K. politicians who campaigned for Brexit, including former U.K. Independence Party Leader Nigel Farage. His latest intervention buttresses the message from Brexiteers that Britain will be able to benefit from trade deals with large economies around the globe after leaving the EU. U.K. Trade Secretary Liam Fox said on Friday he’d signed a “mutual recognition agreement” with the U.S. earlier this week securing trade worth as much as 12.8 billion pounds ($16.5 billion). “The U.K. and the U.S.A. share a special trade relationship and there is real ambition on both sides of the Atlantic to enhance this after we leave the European Union,” Fox said in a statement. “A free trade agreement with the United States is one of my international economic department’s top priorities and I look forward to beginning formal negotiations.” The comments mark another about turn in Trump’s message around Brexit. In July, he first told the Sun newspaper that May’s aim to keep close ties with the EU could jeopardize a future trade deal, before later telling reporters an agreement between the two countries was still on the cards. Then in November he said May’s Brexit deal meant the U.K. might not be able to trade with the U.S., a position backed up by his ambassador a month later.","President Trump Expects Trade to Increase with U.K., Giving Boost to Brexit Supporters","February 15, 2019"
1456,George Steer,"Thousands of schoolchildren descended on central London Friday, walking out of their classrooms to voice their anger at the lack of government action on climate change. Hundreds of banners and placards with messages like “There Is No Plan(et) B” were held high while chants of “Hey, hey, ho, ho, climate change has got to go” rang out across Parliament Square in Westminster. Protesters, some as young as 12, gathered beneath a statue of Mahatma Gandhi before amassing outside Downing Street, the home of the Prime Minister. According to the protests’ organizers, a group known as Youth Strike 4 Climate, similar protests were taking place in more than 60 towns and cities across the U.K. Over 200 academics signed an open letter published in The Guardian Wednesday in support of the march. Other student-led movements have gained momentum across the world in recent months, with demonstrations taking place in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and elsewhere. Just this week, there were large demonstrations in Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and France. The campaign has been inspired by the actions of Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old activist who made headlines last year when she began picketing outside Swedish government buildings, angry that her country was not doing enough to stick to the Paris Climate Agreement. The movement is set to go global on March 15, with students in countries around the world planning to walk out of school. In a statement shared with TIME, British Prime Minister Theresa May’s official spokesperson warned against the “disruption” being caused by the protests. “Everybody wants young people to be engaged in the issues that affect them most so that we can build a brighter future for all of us,” reads the statement. “But it is important to emphasize that disruption increases teacher’s workloads and wastes lesson time that teachers have carefully prepared for. That time is crucial for young people precisely so that they can develop into the top scientists, engineers and advocates that we need to help tackle this problem.” Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the U.K’s Labour Party and Opposition, said he understood why kids were disappointed by older generations, calling climate change “the greatest threat that we all face.”",'Climate Change Is Forever.'

Voice of America reports that President Jovenal Moise appeared on national television Thursday to address calls for his for resignation. Critics claim his government lacks transparency and is ineffective. “I hear you,” Moise said in a speech aired by national broadcaster TNH and live-streamed on Facebook. “You are the reason I ran for president. I’m working for you.” Over the past eight days, protesters have taken to the streets of the capital Port-au-Prince and other cities to denounce what they say is rampant corruption in the country. At least nine people have been killed amid the violent unrest, according to Al Jazeera. In the southern port city of Aquin, 78 inmates broke out of a prison while police were dealing with protesters, the Guardian reports. Current and former government officials have been accused of misappropriating Venezuelan loans meant for development after 2008, according to the BBC. Soaring inflation has also led to worsening living conditions for the population, 60% of whom live on less than $2 a day.

At least 870,000 children under the age of five have lost their lives as a result of armed conflict, a number far greater than the close to 175,000 fighters estimated to have died in the five-year period. The data was released Friday ahead of the Munich Security Conference, which will take place Feb. 15-17. The annual conference gathers more than 450 high-profile leaders to debate international security policy. The report analyzed data from 10 of the worst conflict-affected countries for children in 2017, including Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria. Many of these deaths are attributed to indirect effects of war such as hunger, poor access to healthcare, sanitation and proper infrastructure, and denial of aid. In particular, the report examined the war in Yemen, where an estimated 85,000 children under five may have died from extreme hunger or disease. Last year, the photo of an emaciated 7-year-old girl, Amal Hussain, on a hospital bed in northern Yemen became a symbol of the country’s ongoing humanitarian crisis. Hussain’s parents reported that she died a week after the photo was taken.","Almost Five Times as Many Children Died in Conflict Zones Than Fighters, Report Says","February 15, 2019"
1459,Ciara Nugent,"Rep. Ilhan Omar faced calls from Republicans to resign from the House Foreign Affairs committee this week, following comments she made over U.S. politicians’ motivations for supporting Israel. After apologizing for evoking anti-Semitic stereotypes, the freshman Democrat indicated on Wednesday she has no intention of keeping a low profile on the committee. At a committee hearing on the crisis in Venezuela, where authoritarian president Nicolás Maduro has refused to step down amid a sprawling economic and humanitarian crisis, Omar entered into a heated exchange with Elliott Abrams. President Donald Trump appointed Abrams in January as special envoy for Venezuela. Omar spoke frankly about the diplomat’s controversial record in Latin America. Here’s the history behind her claims: Abrams, a longstanding neoconservative diplomat, served in the State Department during the Reagan Administration and played a key role in U.S. interventions in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala in the 1980s. He later joined the New York-based think tank, the Council on Foreign Relations, as a senior fellow. His appointment to oversee the U.S.’s response to the situation in Venezuela, where Trump has refused to rule out “a military option,” led many to raise concerns over his past dealings in the region, including his entanglement in the notorious Iran-Contra scandal. Omar confronted him with those concerns at the hearing.  “Mr. Abrams, in 1991 you pleaded guilty to two counts of withholding information from Congress regarding the Iran-Contra affair, for which you were later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush,” she said. “I fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony you give today to be truthful.” Omar then brought up El Salvador’s 1981 El Mozote massacre, one of the darkest chapters in U.S. intervention in Latin America, accusing Abrams of having dismissed the massacre and pressing him to reconcile it with his previous characterization of U.S. policy in El Salvador as “a fabulous achievement.” Abrams pushed back, refusing to answer what he deemed a “personal attack” and labeling Omar’s line of enquiry “a ridiculous question.” Omar’s questioning riled many in the foreign policy establishment, who defended Abrams as a human rights advocate and devoted public servant. But others, particularly on the left, praised the congresswoman for a rare honest discussion of the more sinister effects of U.S. foreign policy. Like most 20th century U.S. interventions in Latin America, the Iran-Contra affair began with Washington’s desire to prevent the spread of communism. In 1979, a left-wing movement, the Sandinista National Liberation Front, overthrew a right-wing dictatorship in Nicaragua, and began governing the country according to Marxist principles, including nationalizing private assets and unionizing workers. When Ronald Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he feared that Nicaragua’s government could encourage more leftist movements in Central America and potentially lead to a network of Communist states in Washington’s backyard.",Ilhan Omar Clashed With Venezuela Envoy Elliott Abrams Over Washington's Role in Latin America.

1460,"Anna-Catherine Brigida/San José, Costa Rica","A pristine, white, two-story building stands in downtown San José, home to the Arias Foundation for Peace and Human Progress. It is named after Oscar Arias, one of the country’s most revered presidents, who started the foundation after winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to end civil wars in Central America.  But a string of sexual assault allegations against Arias emerged in early February, casting a shadow on the legacy represented by the building. On Feb. 8, feminist groups protested outside the building with signs reading, “Oscar Arias rapist”, “I believe you” and “He proposes peace, but invades women’s bodies.” On Feb. 5, Alexandra Arce von Herold, a psychiatrist and antinuclear activist, filed formal charges of rape against Arias for putting his hands up her skirt and penetrating her with his fingers in 2014 while at his house for a business meeting. (Under Costa Rican law, rape includes penetration by fingers or other objects.) An unexpected outpouring of support has followed the first report of these charges. At least eight other women have come forward to share their own experiences of being sexually harassed or assaulted by Arias, although only one of those eight have joined Arce von Harold in pressing charges. Among the eight are a Costa Rican journalist, a college professor, and a former Miss Costa Rica. Many are now calling it the country’s #MeToo moment. In Latin America, a region that has yet to grapple with the #MeToo movement, the allegations against Arias have forced citizens to confront uncomfortable discussions about sexual assault, gender equality, and unequal power dynamics. For the women who have come forward, speaking out is not just about this one case, but also the larger implications for gender equality in a country where 25 percent of women are married by the age 18, women only hold 33 percent of parliamentary seats, and abortion is illegal except in cases where pregnancy is a health risk or threatens the life of the mother. “I am adding my voice to what I am certain is a rising number of women against Mr. Arias and against sexual violence in general,” Carina Black, executive director at the Northern Nevada International Center at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) and one of the women who has publicly shared her story, wrote in a statement sent to TIME and other media outlets. She first came forward about her experience in an interview with the New York Times. In 1998, when Arias was visiting UNR, he pinned Black against an elevator wall and tried to kiss her against her will, her statement alleges. (She has not filed formal charges.) Black emphasized the need to speak up to help bring about the kind of change that will mean future generations of women can go about their daily lives without fear of being assaulted.  Gloriana Valladares Navas, a lawyer for the 78-year-old Arias, confirmed to TIME that two women have filed formal changes against Arias: Arce von Herold and Jazmín Morales, a former Miss Costa Rica. She told TIME that under Costa Rican law, neither she nor Arias can comment on the cases while the investigations are pending. Through his lawyers, Arias also declined to comment on the other cases. “In my public life I have promoted gender equality, because I believe that it is an indispensable means to achieve a more just and equitable society for all people,” Arias said in a statement Feb. 5 after the first woman came forward in which he denied the allegations. On Feb. 13, Arias gave a statement to prosecutors about the allegations, but would not speak to media about the case.  Arias, who served as president from 1986 to 1990, and again from 2006 to 2010, is still a powerful figure in Costa Rican society. In 1987, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work promoting cease-fires for countries in the region undergoing civil wars. In 2006, he became the first Costa Rican President democratically elected to a second term. (Costa Rica barred re-election until 2005 and Arias was a proponent of allowing second non-consecutive terms.)

1461,Hillary Leung,"Philippines journalists Maria Ressa, an outspoken critic of President Rodrigo Duterte, was released on bail Thursday following her arrest a day prior on a charge broadly viewed as an attempt to silence her. Ressa, editor and CEO of the influential English-language news website Rappler, was apprehended at the company’s Manila headquarters Wednesday night and charged with “cyber libel.” Philippines broadcaster ABS-CBN reports that Ressa was released after posting bail equal to about US$1,915. The latest charge against Ressa, a former CNN bureau chief and the recipient of numerous journalistic awards, pertains to an article published in 2012 about businessman Wilfredo Keng’s alleged links to human trafficking and the illicit drug trade. Keng claimed the piece was “clearly defamatory.” The law under which the charges were brought was enacted several months after publication of the article. Ressa’s arrest was immediately met with international condemnation, with many saying it is the latest example of Duterte cracking down on high-profile critics who oppose his hardline drug policies. Amnesty International called the move “brazenly politically motivated.”",Philippines Journalist Maria Ressa Released on Bail After Arrest for 'Cyber Libel',"February 14, 2019"
1462,Hillary Leung,"Conservationists have captured their first ever high-quality images of the elusive black leopard in Kenya, confirming previous reports of sightings and proving that the rare creatures do indeed reside in the East African country. The footage was shot by a team of scientists affiliated with the San Diego Zoo, after they set up remote cameras in Laikipia County, north of Nairobi, as part of a large-scale study of leopard populations in two conservancies. The team intensified their camera placements when they heard reports of sightings, yielding multiple observations of the animal, according to San Diego Zoo scientist Nick Pilfold, cited by CNN. Will Burrard-Lucas, one of the photographers, was delighted by the captures. “For me, no animal is shrouded in more mystery, no animal more elusive, and no animal more beautiful,” he wrote in a blog post. The pitch-black coat of the black leopard, also known as a black panther, is the result of melanism, a gene mutation that causes an overproduction of pigment. According to the San Diego Zoo, melanism makes the coat appear completely dark in the daytime, but infrared imagery reveals the leopard’s iconic rosette patterns at night. Melanism occurs in about 11% of leopards globally, but most live in Southeast Asia, Pilford said. The sighting highlights the importance of developing a conservation program to protect the species. San Diego Zoo is working closely with local partners to track and research leopard populations in the area to help maintain a healthy ecosystem in which they can thrive.","'No Animal More Elusive, No Animal More Beautiful.'

The BBC reports that the state-run Daily News paper ran a job advertisement seeking men between the ages of 18 and 45 who possess “mental strength” to serve as hangmen. The country’s last executioner reportedly quit five years ago after he went into shock at the sight of the gallows. According to the BBC, a replacement was hired but he never showed up to assume the job. President Maithripala Sirisena pledged earlier this month to end the country’s four-decade moratorium on capital punishment as concern has grown over drug-related crime. Rape, drug trafficking and murder are all considered capital crimes in Si Lanka, though no executions have occurred since 1976. Last July, Sirisena said Sri Lanka would begin hanging drug offenders, hoping to “replicate the success” of the bloody war on drugs that has left thousands of people dead. During a visit to the Philippines just last month, Sirisena praised the country’s President Rodrigo Duterte for the crackdown, which he referred to as “an example to the world.”  Drug-related crimes have prompted public calls to restart executions in Sri Lanka, with cannabis and heroin the most widely used.

1464,John Quinley III,"When the Myanmar military unleashed its campaign of rapes, arson and murder against the Rohingya Muslims in 2016, members of the persecuted minority’s diaspora were swift to act. They documented the violence. They petitioned the international community. And they helped spotlight the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe as more than 700,000 refugees fled to neighboring Bangladesh. Yet in the fight to hold Myanmar accountable, the Rohingya diaspora is too often overlooked. Historically, the pursuit of justice for human rights violations has been strengthened by the diaspora’s participation. From Rwanda, to Cambodia, to Armenia, mobilizing the diaspora can be a powerful way to engage the community and translate local context. Despite this, our team at Fortify Rights has routinely encountered diplomats, donors and others who dismiss the Rohingya diaspora as disconnected and irrelevant. In reality, as dispersed populations that maintain a sense of collective identity, diasporas provide a vital link between their host countries and their homelands. The Rohingya are no different. Today, more Rohingya reside outside Myanmar than inside the country. The diaspora initially comprised Rohingya uprooted by decades of violence and institutionalized discrimination — including sporadic military campaigns and a denial of citizenship. This longstanding exodus has established outposts around the globe, including refugee camps in Bangladesh, as well as communities resettled in America, Europe and Australia. A second, newer group consists of the Rohingya who fled Myanmar’s most recent waves of violence in 2016 and 2017 in the fastest refugee outflow since the Rwandan genocide. Now more than ever, the international community needs to work with both arms of the Rohingya diaspora to push for accountability and justice. No one knows this better than the Rohingya themselves­ — they are the witnesses, the survivors, the people who remain with these issues long after international attention fades. Myanmar has a long history of diasporas leading change, especially during the nearly 50 years of direct military rule that lasted until 2011. Exiled women’s organizations, such as the Burmese Women’s Union and the Women’s League of Burma, documented human rights violations when the nation was still closed off to the outside world. They lobbied international governments and pressured Myanmar to end impunity for military attacks against civilians.",The Rohingya Diaspora Is Crucial to Achieving Justice in Myanmar,"February 14, 2019"

She said she had moved to the camp two weeks ago from the eastern Syrian town of Baghuz, ISIS’s final stronghold, where her one-year-old daughter and three-month-old son died from illness and malnutrition. “I could not endure the suffering and hardship that staying on the battlefield involved.

Abase was also 15 and Sultana was 16. Two months prior, another student from the school, 16-year-old Sharmeena Begum, also made the journey. All four had reportedly married foreign IS fighters.

The charges were filed by the Philippine Department of Justice over a May 2012 story about businessman Wilfredo Keng and his alleged links to illegal drugs and human trafficking. The Cybercrime Prevention Act — a controversial law that prompted fears of censorship because it made online libel a crime punishable by up to 12 years in jail — was enacted months later in September 2012. Rappler has covered the violent drug war of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has banned Rappler from covering presidential events and called the site “fake news.”  Ressa appeared on one of the covers of TIME’s 2018 Person of the Year issue in December, along with three other journalists and one news organization. In an interview with TIME last week, Ressa called the new charges against her “laughable.” Human rights organizations have also condemned the Philippine government for a “chilling campaign of repression, obstruction and intimidation.” “It is part of the same government effort to try to make Rappler toe the line, which is, ‘You shouldn’t be reporting on the drug war. You should be reporting how wonderful our country is today.’ It is just not what we do,” Ressa told TIME last week. “I want to face this — because the more ludicrous the cases are, the clearer it is that these are tools that are being used to try to silence us.” She also faces charges of tax evasion that carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

Nachtwey, who has worked with TIME for more than 30 years, won the peace prize in 2012 for his work as a war photographer. Natchwey’s photojournalism has taken him around the world documenting war, famine and terror for TIME. When presenting Kim with this year’s prize, Nachtwey said that the widespread image of a young Kim was instrumental in ending the Vietnam War. “There was more power and more truth in the pain and suffering of one nine-year-old girl than in all the political spin devised by America’s “best and brightest” to justify an unjust war,” Nachtwey said. “Perhaps, more than any other image, out of the thousands of images that were made during the war, it had a disproportionate weight in creating the critical mass in public consciousness that was instrumental in bringing the war to an end. And it stands today as an indictment, not only of the Vietnam War, but of all wars.” Kim was placed in the international spotlight when Associated Press photographer Nick Ut captured an image of 9-year-old Kim running, naked and crying, after a South Vietnamese plane mistakenly dropped napalm on her village in 1972 in the midst of the Vietnam War. Ut would win a Pulitzer Prize for the photograph, titled “The Terror of War”, which many credited for portraying the devastating reality of war.

They’re all controversial subjects in China, and were among the most censored topics last year on the country’s ubiquitous social media app, WeChat, according to new research. Last year, WeChatscope, a research project at the University of Hong Kong, tracked more than 4,000 public accounts covering daily news on WeChat. Of the 1.04 million articles reviewed, 11,000 were removed, the researchers revealed earlier this week. Associate professor King-wa Fu, who leads the project at the university’s Journalism and Media Studies Center, said Sino-U.S. relations were among the most censored topics last year. “There were disputes regarding ZTE and Huawei, multiple rounds of trade negotiations, and finally, the arrest of Huawei CTO, Meng Wanzhou, at the end of 2018,” he told TIME. The researchers’ list of the ten most controversial topics also revealed that the #MeToo hashtag was heavily censored, as was coverage of the allegation that Peking University tried to silence activists protesting a two-decades-old rape allegation involving a former professor. A vaccine scandal in July that saw one of the country’s largest vaccine makers distribute substandard vaccines to thousands of babies also made the list. The WeChatscope team arrived at these findings by building a technical web “scraping” system. By tracking the thousands of public accounts posting daily news, the system was able to detect when a post disappeared. The researchers said the most common official reason provided for disappeared articles was that the content was “deleted by the publisher.” “Self-censorship is a common practice among internet users in China as online speech can easily bring them trouble,” the report said.","The U.S.-China Trade War and #MeToo Were Among the Most Censored Topics on China's WeChat, Report Finds","February 13, 2019"

1472,Hillary Leung,"Thirteen LGBT couples across Japan will file lawsuits on Valentine’s Day, hoping to add pressure on the government to recognize marriage equality, Agence France-Presse reports. The five lesbian and eight gay couples are seeking damages of one million yen ($9,000) per person for being denied marriage rights. While Japan’s constitution states that “marriage shall be only with the mutual consent of both sexes”, legal experts argue that the language is intended to ensure consent between prospective spouses and prevent forced marriages. Lawyers for the plaintiffs and others say this language does not necessarily prohibit marriage between same-sex partners. “The government’s failure to enact a law allowing same-sex marriage violates the constitutional principle that all people are equal under the law,” Akiyoshi Miwa, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, told AFP. A survey published in January found nearly 80% of Japanese people aged 20 to 59 are in favor of legalizing gay marriage. Currently, a handful of cities and city wards issue “partnership” certificates to same-sex couples. The documents recognize some next-of-kin legal rights, like medical treatment and property management. But they are not universally availably and fall short of full marriage rights, which typically include spousal visas and inheritance. “What we really want is a court ruling that says the failure to recognize same-sex marriage is unconstitutional,” said Miwa.

1473,Hillary Leung,"An Emirati woman who claims to have fled imprisonment by her family only to end up detained in North Macedonia is begging other countries to avert her imminent deportation and offer her asylum status, CNN reports. Hind Mohammed al-Bolooki, 42, said her family locked her in her home in Dubai last October after they discovered she was seeking a divorce, according to CNN. In a video posted online before her arrest, al-Bolooki says her family feared the divorce would spoil their reputation, and so they tried to steal her passport. But she managed to escape after asking to use the bathroom and joined her friend Nenad Dimitrov in North Macedonia. In a statement, Macedonia’s interior ministry said al-Bolooki’s asylum request was denied on Feb. 4 because there “was no evidence of persecution.” It added that there is “no reason to believe that, should she return [to Dubai], she would be faced with a real risk of serious injury.” But al-Bolooki disagrees. “They will make my life hell,” she says in her video. “And that’s all because I asked only for a divorce.” Al-Bolooki has been granted a 15-day grace period to leave North Macedonia, but has been kept in detention since Dec. 7. With no sign of an impending release, her friends fear she will be deported directly from prison after the allotted time runs out, according to CNN. Dimitrov, who been running al-Bolooki’s Twitter account, is advocating for her release and for a third country to consider her need for asylum. Radha Stirling, founder of U.K. advocacy group Detained in Dubai, said if al-Bolooki went back to the UAE, she would “likely be severely punished for her escape.”",Emirati Woman Pleads for Asylum After Macedonia Rejects Her Case,"February 13, 2019"
1474,Kamakshi Ayyar,"When Sneha began working at a sanitary pad-manufacturing unit in her village on the outskirts of New Delhi, she told her father she was making children’s diapers. “It was embarrassing,” the 23-year-old tells TIME. “If I can’t talk to my friends about this, then how can I tell my father?” “This” is something of a euphemism. It’s one of several non-descriptive terms used by many in India when talking about menstruation, sanitary products and female health, evoking a stigma that colors discussions of the issue. It is that stigma that Sneha is working to change in Period. End of Sentence., a documentary short nominated for an Academy Award this year. Directed by Rayka Zehtabchi and set in central India’s Hapur district, the film chronicles the installation and impact of a machine used to make sanitary pads in rural India. The film is the result of a collaboration between a group of California students and their teacher, an Indian production house and a global network of activists. The machine is the brainchild of Arunachalam Muruganantham, better known as “Pad Man.” When Muruganantham learned that his wife used cheap, dirty cloths instead of expensive sanitary products he decided to do something about it: He developed a simple mechanism that allows women to make affordable sanitary pads. His innovation is proving to be life changing for many women across India, a country that has a complicated view of menstruation. Cultural and religious taboos have led menstruation to be viewed as something that renders a woman dirty during her time of the month. One recent example is the case of Sabarimala temple, where activists have fought to strike down a ban on women of menstruating age because they were perceived as impure. Read more: They Entered a Forbidden Hindu Temple in the Name of Women’s Rights in India. Now They’re in Hiding The stigma has created an environment that stymies female growth. While on their period, many women are prohibited from daily activities like visiting temples and cooking. Even in major cities, the discomfort around menstruation is evident in the fact that stores wrap sanitary napkins in newspaper or brown paper bags for customers. In rural areas, those who cannot buy or afford sanitary products resort to using rags and ashes; girls often skip school because there are no bathrooms to change in.

Now, they have asked whoever the guilty party out there is to make sure and water these plants. Seiji Imura spread word of the incident in a Jan. 13 Facebook post, where he wrote that several of bonsai had been stolen overnight from their garden. He stated that the particular bonsai were “deeply important” to him and the garden, and implored anybody who might have seen them to reach out. Seiji and Fuyumi Iimura told CNN that the thieves specifically targeted their most valuable specimens out of their collection of roughly 3,000 bonsai. The most valuable was a 400-year-old Shimpaku juniper which alone was worth $90,000 USD. Iimura added that the tree would not be able to survive a week without water. Since the incident, the couple has continued to expressed their deep sadness on Facebook, and have asked those responsible for taking the trees to care for them. “These bonsai that we raised like children,” Fuyumi Iimura wrote, “are they being watered properly?” The Iimuras have expressed gratitude for the “all the words of encouragement” they have received, but not a single tree has been found.

1476,Melissa Chan,"Notorious kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman was found guilty Tuesday of all charges stemming from his role in trafficking billions of dollars worth of drugs into the U.S. as a top boss within the Sinaloa cartel. In the sixth day of deliberations, a jury convicted the 61-year-old drug lord, who has been standing trial in federal court in Brooklyn since mid-November. Guzman, who infamously escaped from two top security Mexican prisons, now faces life behind bars in the U.S. Before he was led out of the courtroom, Guzman turned to his wife Emma Coronel Aispuro, who flashed him a thumbs up and nodded at him. The jury’s unanimous verdict, which came after about 34 total hours of deliberation, was a major blow to Guzman and his team of defense lawyers, who had been bumping fists and hugging each other in near celebration after the first week of deliberations ended without a verdict. On Feb. 6, defense attorney Eduardo Balarezo even prematurely tweeted out a photo of a pistol-shaped Mexican tequila bottle, captioned “For after trial.” At a press conference after the verdict, the defense team said they were perhaps too hopeful. They said Guzman remained “upbeat” and “strong,” despite the conviction. “He’s as cool as a cucumber this guy,” attorney Jeffrey Lichtman said, adding that the defense team planned to appeal. Lichtman said Guzman’s conviction was a “trophy for the government,” but that it would not ultimately hinder the illegal drug trade. Speaking to reporters, U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue disagreed, calling Tuesday’s conviction a “victory for the American people.” The trial, he said, “pulled back the curtain on international drug dealing” in a way no other trial has. “This is a day of reckoning,” Donoghue said. “It is a sentence of which there is no escape and no return.” Guzman is expected to be sentenced June 25. Donoghue said the conviction will likely bring a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. During the high-profile trial, the jury—made up of eight women and four men—heard testimonies from 56 witnesses. Fourteen of them were admitted criminals who testified against Guzman in cooperation with the U.S. government. A dozen of them struck deals with prosecutors, which the defense team latched onto while questioning their credibility. Many of the cooperators were former cartel members and, at some point, Guzman’s closest confidantes. Defense lawyers argued Guzman was being framed, saying he was the scapegoat for the real leader of the Sinaloa cartel, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who is still wanted. The defense consistently aimed to discredit the turncoat members of Guzman’s inner circle during cross-examinations. In his closing arguments, Lichtman slammed the cooperating witnesses as “lying opportunists” who he said gave false testimonies in exchange for reduced prison sentences. He added that the convicts were “cleaned up and put on display” in the courtroom to play their part in the prosecutors’ “scripted event.”","El Chapo, the Notorious Drug Kingpin, Has Been Found Guilty in His U.S. Trial","Updated: February 12, 2019 2:56 PM ET"

It’s amazing to see all of the people here and all of the Australian people who supported me,” he said. The 25-year-old Bahrain national has refugee status in Australia, where he plays for the Melbourne team Pascoe Vale FC. Al-Araibi fled to Australia after being detained and tortured following the 2011 Arab Spring protests in Bahrain, according to Human Rights Watch. He was detained in Bangkok in November while on his honeymoon, at the request of Bahraini authorities who then sought his extradition. He faces a 10 year sentence for allegedly vandalizing a police station, which he denies. On Monday, a Thai court ordered al-Araibi’s release after prosecutors dropped a request to extradite him. Had al-Araibi returned to Arab kingdom, activists warned that he could face torture. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed the player’s release on Monday, tweeting, “We look forward to seeing you home, Hakeem.” Upon his return to Australia, his 24-year-old wife, who asked not to be named, told the BBC, “I have had a smile all the time on my face and I can’t stop crying – I am just so happy…I prayed and prayed that he would come back to me, and finally our nightmare is ending.”",Supporters Greet Bahraini Refugee Soccer Player Upon Long-Awaited Return to Australia,"February 12, 2019"
1478,Hillary Leung,"The owner of a USB stick found in the feces of a leopard seal in New Zealand has been identified — and in what seems to be an unthinkable coincidence, she’s the person who helped collect the sample in the first place. Last week, the fully-functioning USB stick was found in a sample of seal feces being studied by the country’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA). The organization put out a call for the rightful owner, broadcasting the footage of two sea lion pups on the South Island coast that was saved in it. Amanda Nally, described as a seal enthusiast, was watching the nightly news when she immediately recognized the clip as her own and realized the USB stick in question was hers. NIWA tweeted Wednesday that the owner had been located. Coincidentally, Nally was actually the person who alerted the leopard seal hotline when she found the creature on Oreti Beach looking thin and perhaps ill. A vet came to examine the animal, and Nally suggested that the feces, which hold valuable information about the rare leopard seal, be sent to NIWA for analysis. Unknown to Nally, the feces — which contained a lot of feathers — concealed her USB stick that she had earlier lost. Representatives of NIWA theorize that a bird had eaten Nally’s USB stick, and the seal then ate the bird, causing the USB stick to be deeply embedded in the scat. “This is probably the weirdest set of coincidences in my life – ever,” Nally said.",'Weirdest Set of Coincidences in My Life.'

A test related to a draft law aimed at making Russia more digitally independent could be carried out before April 1, the BBC reports, but no exact date has been set. The effort is intended to ensure the country can operate online in the event that it becomes isolated by foreign powers. NATO and its allies have threatened to sanction Moscow over frequent allegations of online interference and cyber attacks. The test would involve temporarily unplugging from the global network and routing all data within the country instead of through international servers. The draft Digital Economy National Program would see Russia establish its own version of the net’s address system, called a DNS, that would allow the country to remain online if it got cut off from international servers. According to the BBC, Moscow eventually aims to route all domestic traffic to transit through these points, which would allow the government more control over online activity and could enable mass surveillance similar to that in China.

1480,Hillary Leung,"North and South Korea are planning to launch a joint bid to host the 2032 summer Olympics together, the Guardian reports. The Koreas are expected to present their plans to co-host the Games at the International Olympic City in Lausanne, Switzerland, this Friday. Representatives from the two countries will be in attendance. The South Korean Olympic Committee chose Seoul, which hosted the Olympics in 1988, for the bid. North Korea has not announced which of its cities would join Seoul, but experts say it is likely to be Pyongyang. North Korea’s participation in sporting events has in the past been hindered by the country’s relationship with the South. In 1986, the country boycotted the Asian Games, and two years later, the summer Olympics. Both were held in South Korea. But South Korean President Moon Jae-In has expressed interest in engagement with Pyongyang since assuming office in 2017. Last year, he invited North Korean athletes, supporters and officials to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, the two countries’ delegations marching under one flag. The launch of a joint bid represents a further warming of ties between the Koreas. Officials say a jointly-hosted Olympics is an opportunity for sports diplomacy to bring stability to the Korean peninsula, but its feasibility is dependent on North Korea’s denuclearization plans, which will be discussed during upcoming talks between Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump in Hanoi.

He did not say from where or whom they came from. Supplies sent to Venezuela had so far been stockpiled and blocked by the military from entering the crisis-stricken country. Guaido said the aid was being held at collection points in Brazil, the Colombian border town of Cucuta, and a Caribbean island. While a large number of Western nations, including the U.S. and much of the European Union, have backed Guaido as the country’s de facto interim president, there are few signs that the military-backed Maduro will loosen his grip on power.

1483,Áine Quinn / Bloomberg,"Cows and bulls searching for “moo love” now have a mobile app to help their breeders. A U.K. farming startup introduced a Tinder-style app, called Tudder, that lets farmers find breeding matches by viewing pictures of cattle with details of their age, location and owner. Users hear a mooing sound as they swipe — right to show they’re interested or left to reject possible matches. Hectare, which designed the app, says it “seeks to unite sheepish farm animals with their soulmates.” Selling animals using social media can speed up a process that often involves transporting animals long distances for breeding. “Tudder is a new swipe-led matchmaking app, helping farm animals across the U.K. find breeding partners in the quest for moo love,” according to the Apple app store description. Farmers that swipe right on an image of a particular cow — or group of cows — are directed to Hectare’s livestock-buying website, with a chance to contact the owner or make an offer. The listing website includes information on the animal’s character and any health issues. Profile descriptions range from “nice big strong sorts make nice suckler cows” to “quiet well grown young bull ready to work,” and farmers can also restrict their online search by whether the animal is organic, pedigree or on a farm where tuberculosis has been detected. Marcus Lampard, a farmer in Carmarthenshire in southwest Wales, has one pedigree beef shorthorn breeding bull listed on the app and says it’s a lot easier to sell livestock online. “Going to market is a nuisance,” he said by telephone. “If I go to an open market with a bull, and then maybe bring it back, it shuts everything down on the farm for at least two weeks.’’","'Tinder for Cows' Is Now a Thing, and British Farmers Are Using it to Breed Cattle","February 11, 2019"

Since December 2018, at least 52 polar bears have been spotted around Belushya Guba, a town on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, located in the Arctic Ocean. The state of emergency was declared Feb. 9 due to the “mass invasion of polar bears in residential areas,” said Alexander Minayev, deputy head of the Novaya Zemlya administration, in a statement. “Residents, schools and kindergartens are submitting numerous oral and written complaints demanding to ensure safety in the settlement,” reads the statement. “The people are scared. They are frightened to leave homes and their daily routines are broken. Parents are afraid to let the children go to school or kindergarten.” Extra fences have been installed around kindergartens to better ensure children’s safety, and military personnel are being “delivered to workplaces by special vehicles, while the area is patrolled,” according to Russian state news agency TASS. A specialist group will be deployed to figure out how best to remove the bears. In an interview with TASS, local administration chief Zhigansha Musin said that, because it is illegal to cull polar bears in Russia, “we will have to embark on a longer and less safe way for local residents.” “I’ve been on Novaya Zemlya since 1983,” he added. “There’s never been such a mass invasion of polar bears.” It is thought that rising global temperatures have contributed to a reduction in the size of the polar bears’ sea-ice habitats, forcing them onto land for longer periods of time.",State of Emergency Declared As Dozens of Polar Bears Invade Russian Town,"February 11, 2019"

The Carnevale Di Viargeggio festival in Viareggio, Italy, is attended by about 600,000 people and is famed for its papier-mâché sculptures. The largest of which can be as heavy as 40 tons and often carry a political message. However, to American audience members, one gigantic float stood out: a huge, moving sculpture of President Donald Trump, decked out with wings and golden armor. The parade’s official website said that the float is called “Master-Drone.” In its right hand, the Trump statue carries a sword with a ring of blue Twitter birdies on its hilt. The phrase dazi vostri – which translates to “your taxes” – is inscribed on the blade. Many Italians wrote on Twitter that the expression is actually a play on words with the expression cazzi vostri, which means “none of your f—king business.” The official description of the statue says that the float was created by artist Fabrizio Galli, whose past sculptures included satirical depictions of Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin. It says Master-Drone was a take off of a character from the miniature war game Warhammer 40,000. In the era of Trump, the statement said, fantasy had become reality. “The dominant male par-excellence has arrived, democratically, and is now here, among us. The Master-Drone flies over the Viareggio boardwalk as we prepare to pay the price,” the parade’s description said. Many conservative commentators on Twitter appeared to interpret the float as a tribute to Trump. Several tweeted that it was a “parade for Trump.” Emerald Robinson, the White House Correspondent for right-wing channel One America News, wrote, “This carnival in Italy looks like a lot more fun than the Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. Just look at this Trump float!” Trump’s image has been a popular image in the parade several times over the past few years. In 2017, a snarling Trump-head was placed in the middle of an American-themed float.

The deal with Tencent, a holding company which specializes in technology, is reportedly part of Reddit’s plan to raise $300 million to support the company’s operations, according to a report released Tuesday by TechCrunch. Reddit, which boasts 330 million active users and bills itself as the “Front Page of the Internet,” is inaccessible in China. Update: Reddit confirmed the deal Monday morning, saying that it raised $300 million in a funding round led by Tencent and joined by several of the site’s existing investors. The deal gives Reddit a market valuation of $3 billion. The company did not offer further comment about the funding round. Most of the backlash has been in the form of a number of posts to one of the site’s most popular groups, r/pics, which has over 20 million subscribers. Redditors have written that they feared the site, which is famously a bastion of free speech (with some exceptions) and the home of many niche communities, could end up facing censorship as is seen in China. There, the government blocks references to the bloody 1989 massacre in the Beijing square, as well as images that are more subtly subversive, such as the iconic and lovable Disney bear. Since the deal was first reported five days ago, numerous Reddit users posted threads and memes criticizing the investment, arguing that it would cause Reddit to clamp down on freedom of expression outside of China. One post, which included the iconic image of a single man stopping a tank in Tiananmen Square, was by far the most popular post of the week and “up-voted” more than 200,000 times. Some Reddit users posted Winnie the Pooh as an example of how arbitrary Chinese censors could be. Winnie the Pooh has been an outlaw in China since 2017. The Chinese government appeared to tire of Chinese social media sharing an image of the cartoon bear walking with Tigger compared to a photo of Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama. “Reddit is now funded by Chinese investors, so let’s remember that President Xi Jinping is so insecure in a meme that he banned Winnie the Pooh nationwide,” wrote Redditor kproxurworld.",Reddit Users Rally Against Chinese Censorship After $300 Million Funding Round,"Updated: February 11, 2019 2:21 PM ET | Originally published: February 10, 2019"
1491,Robert Hutton and Lucy Meakin / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will this week ask Parliament to give her more time to renegotiate her Brexit deal with the European Union, promising lawmakers a further chance to take control of the process before the clock runs out, according to officials with knowledge of her plans. With a vote due on Feb. 14, May will ask Parliament to reaffirm its desire to remove the contentious Irish backstop clause from the Withdrawal Agreement, according to an official, who asked not to be identified. She’ll say that if she hasn’t brought them new deal by Feb. 27, there will then be another opportunity to vote, Communities Secretary James Brokenshire confirmed in an interview. “The government will commit that if the meaningful vote, in other words the deal coming back, has not happened by the 27th of February, then we would allow a further motion — votable in Parliament — to take place, to give that sense of assurance as to the process moving forward,” he told the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show.” “That gives that sense of timetable, clarity and purpose on what we’re doing.” The prime minister is aiming to allay lawmaker concern that, unless they vote to take control of the process and order her to seek an extension of EU negotiations, they will have lost their chance to avoid a no-deal Brexit. A similar promise at the end of January thwarted a cross-party attempt to take over the timetable, led by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Conservative Nick Boles. It is that promise that led to this week’s vote. The wording of May’s motion on Thursday, asking Parliament to back her negotiation, will be closely read. Although lawmakers asked for the backstop to be removed, May has said since that the backstop will remain, and that Parliament merely asked for it to be altered.

1492,Cagan Koc / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Turkey demanded Chinese authorities respect human rights of the Muslim Uighur minority and close “concentration camps” imprisoning them. More than 1 million Uighurs are being tortured and “politically brainwashed” in camps and prisons in China, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in a statement on the ministry’s website Saturday. While Turkey and China broadly have good relations, Aksoy said he was responding to the death of Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit in a Chinese prison. Turkish media said he was tortured to death in a so-called re-education camp in China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. “The re-emergence of concentration camps in the 21st century and China’s systematic assimilation policy toward Uighur Turks are great embarrassment for humanity,” Aksoy said. The detention and “re-education” of as many as 1 million minority Muslim Uighurs in China’s far west has been condemned by human rights groups and prompted calls for sanctions from U.S. lawmakers, who reject China’s assertion that the camps are voluntary education centers that help purge “ideological diseases.” Turkey calls on other countries and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to take steps to end the “humanitarian tragedy” in Xinjiang, Aksoy said.

1493,George Steer,"It was a chilly night in late March 2017 when the fifteen activists broke into Stansted Airport, one of the main air transport hubs outside London. They used wire-cutters to break through a perimeter fence before making their way toward a Boeing 767 parked in stand 505, in a remote part of the airport. On board were 60 men and women about to be deported back to West Africa. To stop the government-chartered jet taking off, four of the activists used plastic tubes and expanding foam to secure themselves to the plane’s landing gear while the rest did the same beneath a tripod securing the port-side wing. The group wore pink hats and sang songs to keep the cold at bay. A large pink sign they had smuggled in with them bearing the words ‘no one is illegal’ billowed in the chill early spring air. For ten hours they sat there while airport security staff tried to dislodge them. The flight was canceled. That the fifteen would be arrested was beyond doubt, but none expected a serious conviction. The nine Black Lives Matter protesters who occupied a runway at City Airport, London in 2016 had all been let off with non-custodial sentences. So it came as something of a surprise when, in December, the Stansted 15, as they have since been dubbed by the media, were convicted of terrorism-related offenses carrying potential life sentences. Amnesty International called the decision “a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut”.  On Feb. 6, after seventeen months on bail, the protestors discovered they would be spared jail. Three were given suspended sentences, and twelve will carry out community service. Yet the convictions will continue to affect their lives, limiting which countries they can visit as well as their ability to get a mortgage or take out a loan. Now, human rights groups and experts are warning that the treatment of the Stansted 15 sets a chilling precedent in the use of laws put in place to tackle terrorism to crack down on legitimate and peaceful protests. “The very values [counter-terrorism laws] are ostensibly created to defend – democracy and its core civic and political freedoms – are instead being eroded by their use,” says Karma Nabulsi, Professor in Politics and International Relations at Oxford University. Ruth Potts, one of the fifteen handed a community service order on Wednesday, put it more simply: “The future of peaceful protest is in jeopardy,” she told TIME. The U.K. has a long and proud history of civil disobedience. The Suffragettes, British civil rights activists, gay-rights demonstrators – each of these movements rallied and sometimes agitated for change to unequal or unjust laws. The Equal Franchise Act 1928, the Sexual Offenses Act 1967, which decriminalized homosexuality, and the Race Relations Act 1965 stand as testament to the efforts of radicals who have fought and sometimes died for their rights in the past hundred years.  In the past, judges have recognized this and upheld the principle that a sentence should be proportionate to the gravity of the offense. In 2006, for example, the presiding judge in a case involving a protest against the Iraq war asserted that where demonstrators act with a sense of proportion and do not commit violent acts, magistrates should impose sentences that take this into account. “It is the mark of a civilised community,” said, Lord Hoffman, “that it can accommodate protests and demonstrations of this kind”. But in the last year, that precedent has been ignored more and more often. In October 2018, three anti-fracking protesters became the first environmental campaigners to be imprisoned in the U.K. since 1932. At the court of appeals the decision was overturned and the prisoners released; handing down the judgement, the three judges called the initial custodial sentence “manifestly excessive”.",The U.K.'s Prosecution of Peaceful Protestors Is Raising Fears Over Anti-Terror Laws,"February 8, 2019"
1494,Ian Bremmer,"U.S. President Donald Trump this week nominated David Malpass as World Bank president. The Treasury Department undersecretary for international affairs and former senior economic advisor to the Trump campaign has been a fierce critic of the institution. He will replace Jim Yong Kim, who resigned unexpectedly last month.  At the most elemental level, the nomination of Malpass matters because a person openly critical of the World Bank is now poised to head it, raising legitimate fears about what happens to one of multilateralism’s most storied and impactful institutions when it’s headed by an avowed critic of multilateralism. The World Bank was established in 1944 with the purpose of leading the world’s fight against extreme poverty; it has done so over the last seven-plus decades by extending loans to low-income countries to fund projects at lower rates than if they were to go seek financing for those projects from international markets. Now, an organization that will be loaning upwards of $10 billion in just this fiscal year to some of the world’s most impoverished countries will be led by someone who may seek to undermine it. The appointment also threatens a long-standing (albeit informal) agreement under which the U.S. appoints the head of the World Bank and Europe appoints the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Criticism of the practice has been growing in recent years in favor of nominating people who actually hail from developing countries to these two posts. It’s a call that’s likely to grow louder if Malpass is confirmed. Then there’s the China angle. Beijing is already looking to challenge the current international architecture—China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) was established as a direct competitor to the Washington-based IMF and World Bank. More broadly, Beijing continues to use financial diplomacy to win allies for itself around the world, and without the stringent concessions that typically accompany World Bank financing and loans… all while being one of the World Bank’s biggest borrowers. It is something that many China hawks, as well as Malpass, have taken issue with in the past. Malpass looks likely to be confirmed by the nation states that fund the Bank. The Europeans are too strongly attached to the informal ability to appoint the IMF head to put up much of a fight. In fact, some may see this as a guarantee of the IMF’s leadership for at least one more round — now that the U.S. will “owe” them for backing Malpass. But Malpass’s successful nomination makes it all the more likely that whoever succeeds him will NOT be American. The Bank has been moving in that direction for years now; an unsuccessful and controversial stint by Malpass might be just the thing to push the Bank’s voting shareholders over the edge. “[Malpass’] disdain for the World Bank’s mission of fighting global poverty rivals John Bolton’s respect for the United Nations.” Justin Sandefur, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development",The Quick Read on Trump's Controversial Pick for World Bank Chief,"February 8, 2019"
1495,Casey Quackenbush,"A 27-year-old Indian businessman is planning to sue his parents for bringing him into the world without his consent. The BBC reports that Raphael Samuel from Mumbai identifies as “anti-natalist,” a belief that life is so insufferable that people should stop procreating. “There’s no point to humanity. So many people are suffering,” Samuel said, according to the BBC. “If humanity is extinct, Earth and animals would be happier. They’ll certainly be better off. Also no human will then suffer. Human existence is totally pointless.” Samuel, who acknowledges that it would be impossible to gain consent from an as-yet-unconceived human, has yet to find a lawyer to take up his case. Further tempering his goal, his parents are both lawyers. “I must admire my son’s temerity to want to take his parents to court knowing both of us are lawyers,” his mother, Kavita Karnad Samuel, said in a statement. “And if Raphael could come up with a rational explanation as to how we could have sought his consent to be born, I will accept my fault.” “I’m very happy that my son has grown up into a fearless, independent-thinking young man,” she added. “He is sure to find his path to happiness.” Samuel created a Facebook page about a year ago called Nihilanand, the BBC reports, where he posts anti-natalist messages eliciting a range of responses. One commenter reportedly advised him to “go kill yourself,” while others have shown strong support for his ideas.

1496,Casey Quackenbush,"Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia once said that he would use a “a bullet” on the late journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered at the consulate in Istanbul last October, if he did not stop criticizing the Saudi government, according to a report by the New York Times. U.S. intelligence agencies reportedly intercepted a 2017 conversation between the crown prince and an aide, providing the most detailed evidence to date that the crown prince considered killing the journalist a year before his gruesome death. The Times’ report cites anonymous officials with direct knowledge of intelligence reports related to the crown prince’s transcribed communications. Intelligence agencies have been assessing years of the crown prince’s intercepted communications to get to the bottom of Khashoggi’s murder. The CIA concluded in November that the crown prince had ordered his killing, though the Saudi government has denied he had any involvement. In the conversation with the aide, Turki Aldakhil, Prince Mohammed reportedly said that if Khashoggi could not be coaxed back to the kingdom, he should be forcibly returned. If attempts failed, the crown prince said he would go after the journalist “with a bullet,” according to the Times. The phrase may not have been said literally, according to intelligence analysts, but could indicate that he intended to have Khashoggi killed. Even as congressional leaders rejected the crown prince’s explanation of the Khashoggi’s murder, President Donald Trump has remained reluctant to publicly criticize the kingdom.

1497,Katie Reilly,"Maria Ressa, founder of the Philippines-based news website Rappler, is facing new libel charges — a move widely viewed as part of a crackdown on free press in the country. Department of Justice prosecutors will file “cyber libel” charges against Rappler, Ressa and former Rappler researcher Reynaldo Santos Jr. “very soon,” Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told AFP on Wednesday. Rappler has covered the brutal drug war of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose approval of extrajudicial killings has alarmed human-rights advocates. Ressa says these and previous criminal charges are attempts at intimidation for their reporting. The new charges pertain to a 2012 story about businessman Wilfredo Keng and his alleged links to illegal drugs and human trafficking, as well as his ties to the country’s then-chief justice during his impeachment trial. The National Bureau of Investigation dismissed Keng’s complaint about the story in 2018, but Department of Justice prosecutors later ruled in his favor, Rappler reported. “I look at it as proxy. It is part of the same government effort to try to make Rappler toe the line, which is, ‘You shouldn’t be reporting on the drug war. You should be reporting how wonderful our country is today.’ It is just not what we do,” Ressa tells TIME. “I want to face this — because the more ludicrous the cases are, the clearer it is that these are tools that are being used to try to silence us.” The story in question was published by Rappler in May 2012. The controversial Cybercrime Prevention Act law — which made online libel a crime punishable by up to 12 years in jail — was enacted months later in September 2012, prompting protests amid fears it would lead to censorship. In a statement, Rappler’s lawyer warned that the case could set a “dangerous precedent” of applying laws retroactively. “In this instance, the anti-cybercrime law has clearly been weaponized against legitimate dissent and free speech,” Amnesty International said in a statement on Wednesday, calling the charges against Rappler an “absurd legal attack” that came as “no surprise.”",Philippines Journalist Maria Ressa Slams 'Ridiculous' New Libel Charge as Human Rights Groups Pledge Support,"Updated: February 8, 2019 1:29 AM ET"
1498,Melissa Chan,"A former Colombian veterinarian student who surgically implanted bags of liquid heroin into the bellies of living puppies before shipping them to the U.S. was sentenced Thursday to six years in prison. Andres Lopez Elorez, 39, nervously fiddled with the back of his light olive green jumpsuit in federal court in Brooklyn as he asked U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson for leniency for the crimes he said he did during a “dark chapter” in his life. “Be merciful to me,” he said, through a translator. “Those were very difficult years of my life.” Prosecutors said Lopez Elorez smuggled at least one kilogram of heroin from Colombia to the U.S. through the puppies that he raised on a secret farm, between 2004 and 2005, while he was studying to be a veterinarian. The drugs were surgically removed from the puppies once they arrived. Several of the animals died after the surgeries. Lopez Elorez was extradited to the U.S. from Spain, where he had relocated from Colombia, in 2017. He pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to import heroin into the U.S. “I know I cannot justify my actions,” he told the judge Thursday, acknowledging that he “made mistakes.” In his apology, Lopez Elorez also said he moved to Spain to start a better life once he realized what he did in Colombia was wrong. There, he was working as a veterinarian assistant in Spain before his arrest. “Day after day, I fought to be a new person,” he said, adding that he has been “struggling to make things right” since he was jailed in 2015. “That mistake that I made, I learned to pay it in full,” he said.",Veterinarian Who Smuggled Liquid Heroin Implanted Inside Puppies Sentenced to 6 Years in Prison,"February 7, 2019"
1500,Ciara Nugent,"For the best part of a decade, South African artist Nelson Makamo has had a deal with his 11 year-old cousin, Mapule Maoto. He pays for her studies, and she agrees to model for his colorful paintings. Today, with fans all over the world praising his work, including the likes of Oprah Winfrey, it’s turned out to be a pretty good deal. The latest painting that Mapule has inspired is Makamo’s cover for TIME’s 2019 Optimists issue, guest edited by filmmaker Ava DuVernay. Optimism is a natural fit for Makamo’s work, which has for several years largely focused on young children from rural South Africa. “Later on in life we sometimes forget there’s beauty in being a human being,” he says, speaking from his home in Johannesburg. “But children are just discovering that.” When TIME first approached Makamo to contribute to the issue, he had never produced a magazine cover before. He was eager to create an image that would introduce his work to the world, he says. “It scared me because, even though I’ve been working for a long time, it felt like a debut.” See the 2019 Optimists issue, guest-edited by Ava DuVernay. Makamo, 36, knew very quickly that he wanted a fairly simple image of a child, “something everyone can relate to.” But beyond the initial idea, he doesn’t like to plan his works, and often returns to them to add tweaks long after they might be considered “finished.” After spending three or four months on this painting, he had to stop working. “It was the first one where I really had to force myself to say: OK this is finished now. I’m very critical,” he says of sending the image off to TIME. The final piece, an oil painting on canvas, is titled “Vision of a limitless future.” Makamo had been in contact with TIME guest editor DuVernay since 2017, when the filmmaker bought one of his pieces at auction. In December, she visited his studio in Johannesburg and purchased another. The children (and few adults) that populate Makamo’s award-winning charcoal drawings and colorful paintings are drawn from his interactions with Mapule and others in his life, he says. “But I’m not really focused on trying to portray them as they are. When I look at someone, the moment I’ve seen them can feel so beautiful. I want to capture that moment on a canvas.” Makamo grew up in a small town in South Africa’s northern Limpopo province. His artistic impulse kicked in early. “I just had this urge to draw, to make marks,” he says. That desire grew stronger when he got into comic books, and then works by Van Gogh and Picasso. But it was discovering African artists that really made him fall in love with art, he says.",The Story Behind the Painting on TIME's Optimists Cover,"February 7, 2019"
1501,Ciara Nugent,"Two men claim to be the President of Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves on the planet and so little food that, in a single year, the average citizen lost 24 lb. One, Nicolás Maduro, secured a second term in a 2018 election widely regarded as a sham. The other, Juan Guaidó, took an oath of office on Jan. 23, in a maneuver that was equal parts audacious and ingenious, and that offered the nation at least the possibility of a peaceful way out of its catastrophe. The trick was finding a possible opening in the mire of Maduro’s authoritarianism. By fiat and force, Maduro has spent the last few years remaking the Caracas government to his liking—replacing justices on the Supreme Court, declaring emergency rule, and sidelining the parliament that the opposition had won in a free and fair ballot in 2015. Maduro also created from whole cloth the electoral apparatus that allowed him to remain in office without facing an opponent—a violation of the country’s 1999 constitution. In response, the leader of parliament—Guaidó—said the presidential office had essentially been left vacant in January, the start of Maduro’s rigged second term. He then invoked the constitution’s Article 233, which, in a power vacuum, calls for the person in his role to temporarily assume the presidency.   To read the full story, click here.

1502,Eben Shapiro,"In Zimbabwe, the term for depression is kufungisisa, which translates to “thinking too much.” Like many low-income countries, Zimbabwe is ill-equipped to care for its citizens suffering from mental illness. The country of roughly 16.5 million currently has about 12 trained psychiatrists. One of those psychiatrists, Dr. Dixon Chibanda (above left, with U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock), has been on a mission to narrow this treatment gap ever since one of his young patients, who didn’t have the $15 bus fare to travel to a scheduled evaluation, hanged herself from a tree. In 2007, Chibanda seized on the idea of creating an informal system of therapists from the community. “It suddenly dawned on me that one of the most reliable resources we have in Africa is grandmothers,” he says. Chibanda’s organization, Friendship Bench, now trains hundreds of Zimbabwean grandmothers in problem-solving therapy, role-playing and behavior activation. Their therapy sessions take place outside, on wooden seats known as Friendship Benches. Grandmothers, Chibanda says, are often best equipped to provide care because they listen and guide their charges toward a solution, unlike other members of the community who tend to direct their patients what to do. A study published in JAMA in 2016 illustrated the positive benefits of the innovative approach. Chibanda’s benches are now expanding to four countries in southern Africa and even making their way to New York City. In January he brought a Friendship Bench to Davos, Switzerland, as part of an effort to address depression, an escalating problem that destroys lives and costs the global economy trillions of dollars. “My dream is to take this to scale,” Chibanda says. “With something simple, we make a difference in the world.” Contact us at editors@time.com.

1503,Dan Stewart,"The most valuable resource at the world economic Forum at Davos is time. No one has enough of it, so everyone makes compromises to make the most of it. President Carlos Alvarado Quesada of Costa Rica is no exception. As we near the 10-minute point of our interview at his hotel in the Swiss ski resort, his press officer begins to wrap things up. The Costa Rican leader is expected at the conference center, a mile and a half away, in 15 minutes, she says. So the interview continues in the presidential SUV through the icy, snow-packed streets. Even TIME has to make the most of time. If Alvarado Quesada gets his way, such vehicles will become a rare sight in his own country. In February, his government will pledge to abolish entirely the use of fossil fuels in Costa Rica, making it the world’s first “carbon zero” country. Already, much of its energy supply comes from hydro and geothermal power; he wants to reform transportation so electric vehicles are the norm on Costa Rica’s roads. He’s at the annual gathering of the world’s political and economic elite to make the case that developing countries can lead the world in tackling climate change. “Our ambition is not only to do this on our own,” he says. “We want others to follow.” With so many of the worlds’s top-tier leaders skipping Davos this year, developing countries had a rare opportunity. President Donald Trump was dealing with a government shutdown, while British Prime Minister Theresa May tried to seal parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal. And still reeling from the Gilets Jaunes protests in France, President Emmanuel Macron was in no mood to be seen rubbing shoulders with the 1%. Instead, figures like President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia made their debuts as the star attractions at Davos. The Brazilian populist underwhelmed with a brusque seven-minute speech to the conference center, delivered with all the passion of a hostage reading out his captors’ list of demands. The reform-minded Ethiopian leader, however, impressed with a livelier address emphasizing his country’s new openness to global values and foreign investment. Alvarado Quesada, also attending Davos for the first time after becoming President in May 2018, did not give an address. But he spoke on a panel alongside counterparts from Ecuador and Colombia about the “human-centered future” of Latin America. “I think it was very important to show Latin America is committed not only to economic and human development, but also to the international community,” he says. “To support multilateralism, especially in these times.” A former novelist, the 39-year-old is something of a rarity in the region: a left-of-center champion of social values whose support for same-sex marriage helped win him the presidency. His country too is a beacon of relative economic and political stability in a region known for high poverty and corruption. The nation of 5 million has seen steady growth for a quarter-century and has one of the lowest poverty rates in Latin America. Its leaders are mostly centrist, and the threat of military involvement in government is moot: Costa Rica scrapped its armed forces in 1948. “We believe in strong human rights, strong institutions, free press, gender equality,” Alvarado Quesada says. “The best way to lead is by example. To show what’s possible and what’s good.” Alvarado Quesada and I spoke on Jan. 24, the day after the Trump Administration recognized the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s President, in a direct challenge to the legitimacy of Nicolás Maduro’s regime. Costa Rica is largely shielded from the wave of new migrants fleeing Venezuela’s economic collapse by the Darien Gap, the roadless barrier separating Central from South America. But Alvarado Quesada hopes Maduro will accept the international community’s demand for transparent elections as a way to solve the standoff. “I hope that will happen,” he says, “because what’s the alternative? The other options are not so good, for Venezuela or for anyone else.” Alvarado Quesada also pointed delegates to his country’s extraordinary record of reversing deforestation. In the mid–20th century, Costa Rica’s forest cover dropped from 70% to just 20%. But reforms in the 1990s, in which the government protected existing rain forests and paid landowners to allow regions to regenerate, catalyzed a resurgence in natural growth. Today the country is more than 50% forested again. “People at the time said it was impossible,” he says. “But we want to show that it’s not only possible but that sustainability and growth can go hand in hand.”",Costa Rica's President Carlos Alvarado Quesada Wants to Set a Green Example for the World,"February 7, 2019"
1504,Charlie Campbell,"A passing typhoon has just tickled southern China’s Hainan Island, churning the sea into angry peaks. One glance is enough for Li An Xiao and Zhao Zhi Ping to cancel their customary 7 a.m. swim, the kind of unspoken agreement that comes with half a century of happy marriage. Instead, they join dozens of other retirees performing calisthenics at the adjacent exercise park, where one silver-haired gent nonchalantly hangs upside down from the monkey bars. Li was once a hydro-engineer in China’s arid northwestern province of Gansu. Today, the 85-year-old is enjoying a leisurely retirement with Zhao, 75, on the volcanic island that is Asia’s closest equivalent to Florida. Lunch at noon, a 3 p.m. dip in their apartment complex’s hot tub, perhaps a nap and, typhoon permitting, back to the beach for a sunset swim. “We love it here,” he says. “Just look at all the trees and flowers! The sea air means we’ve never felt healthier.” An estimated 1.5 million retired snowbirds flock to Hainan from China’s frigid northern provinces every winter, and if current trends continue, the migratory pattern is set to expand rapidly. By 2050, 330 million Chinese will be over age 65. Good news perhaps for property owners in Hainan, but dire news for the prospects of the world’s second largest economy–and for those around the world who rely on it. “It’s the No. 1 economic problem for China going forward,” says Stuart Leckie, chairman of Stirling Finance Ltd., a Hong Kong–based pension-fund consulting firm that has advised the Chinese government. If current trends continue, China’s population will peak at 1.44 billion in 2029 before entering “unstoppable” decline, according to a Chinese Academy of Social Sciences study released in January. The country will enter an “era of negative population growth,” the report says, warning that by 2065 numbers will return to the levels of the mid-1990s. Fewer people means less domestic consumption, and thus rapidly slowing economic growth. The ratio of young to old will be dramatically imbalanced by the rising ranks of the elderly, putting unprecedented weight on the ties that hold society together. The scale of the problem is partly due to the legacy of the one-child policy: history’s biggest social-engineering experiment. Introduced in 1980 to reduce the number of hungry mouths to feed, the policy eventually began to act as a hitch on growth, prompting Beijing to permit parents to have two children from 2016. The policy now stands to be scrapped, with a draft civil code published in August 2018 omitting any reference to “family planning.” But reforming the much maligned birth controls has so far done little to defuse China’s ticking demographic time bomb. After an 8% bump in 2016–mainly women who’d waited for years to have a second child–births then fell 3.5% the following year. The trend is being exacerbated by China’s entry into the “middle income trap,” where rapidly developing economies stagnate as incomes reach median level and the emerging middle class start having fewer babies. Just like in the West, many Chinese women are prioritizing careers and stable home life over raising children, especially as the costs of living and education soar. It’s a pattern seen across the developing world. In just 20 years’ time, Africa stands to be the last remaining font of major population growth, as families in Europe, the Americas and across Asia have fewer children. The latest projections suggest the global population will peak at 9 billion around 2090 and then dip southward. The trend is particularly acute in East Asia; in South Korea, the birth rate dropped to a record peacetime low of 0.95 births per woman last year (2.1 births are required to maintain a population), as economic growth slowed. Japan’s current population of 127 million will shrink to 83 million by 2100, according to U.N. data, when over a third of its population will be over 65.

1505,Billy Perrigo,"The first-ever papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula, the birthplace of Islam, was meant to build bridges between faiths. But shortly after Pope Francis touched down in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, on Feb. 3, he made the visit about more than just religion. The UAE is a member of the Saudi-led coalition that has been bombing Yemen since 2015, part of a campaign that the U.S. supports and that the Vatican has criticized. Francis risked his host’s displeasure to make a public point about the crisis in Yemen. Good Relations For Pope Francis, who began his papacy by taking strides to improve interfaith dialogue, the historic visit was a chance to cement ties with Islamic leaders. Together with an influential imam, he signed a “document on human fraternity” on Feb. 4, which calls for believers to “refrain from using the name of God to justify acts of murder, exile, terrorism and oppression.” The church hopes better relations will improve the fate of persecuted Christians around the world. Past Protest Before landing in Abu Dhabi, Francis issued his strongest condemnation yet of the violence in Yemen. “Many children are suffering from hunger, but cannot access food depots,” he said, urging fighters to respect a cease-fire and allow aid convoys through. The U.N. says the war has caused the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today, contributing to a cholera outbreak and tens of thousands of deaths. Balancing Act Even as the UAE has proclaimed 2019 a “year of tolerance” and taken steps to remove barriers to the public worship of religions other than Islam, the state has cracked down on dissenters, including critics of the war. But when Francis made tolerance his topic in a Feb. 4 speech, he said that religious people have a duty to reject war and its “fateful consequences,” adding that he was “thinking in particular of Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Libya.” In using the language of faith to discuss Yemen, Francis bridged another gap that the UAE has tried to preserve: the one between politics and religion.","On Historic Trip to Arabian Peninsula, Pope Francis Tries to Bridge Gulfs","February 7, 2019"
1506,Aryn Baker,"In the small, whitewashed medical clinic of Banki, one of northeastern Nigeria’s largest camps for internally displaced people (IDP), midwife Stella Aneto takes a rare pause between deliveries to catch her breath. Before wiping down the clinic’s sole delivery bed with disinfectant, Aneto glances at the clinic logbook. Two women have already given birth, and at least three others are in the early stages of labor. She instructs an assistant to prepare extra emergency supplies. Anything can go wrong when it comes to labor and delivery, but especially in a region with high rates of child marriage, malnutrition and malaria, where it’s not uncommon for midwives to tend to 18-year-olds giving birth to their fourth child. In a bare-bones clinic that has no electricity or running water, and where the nearest hospital is 80 miles away, the chances of death in childbirth are extremely high. Yet Aneto hasn’t lost a single patient since she started working at the clinic 12 months ago. “I am always afraid of complications,” she says. “If something goes wrong, we don’t have what we need to help.” So Aneto’s goal is to make sure things don’t go wrong. And the only way to do that, she says, is to prepare. “Out here, preparing is our prevention.” To read the full story, click here. Contact us at editors@time.com.

1507,Abhishyant Kidangoor,"The day Behrouz Boochani arrived on the South Pacific island where he has been detained for nearly six years, a blackened tooth fell from his mouth. To the Iranian Kurdish refugee, it seemed like the latest bad omen after his attempted sea route to Australia ended in lock up at the Manus Island Detention Center.  “Is there some connection between my damn tooth falling out and the life I will lead on Manus Island,” Boochani asks in his book, No Friend but the Mountains: Writing From Manus Prison. The 400-page memoir charts Boochani’s flight from Iran to his incarceration in one of Australia’s offshore facilities, documenting the many humiliations of the refugee experience along the way: from cage-like holding cells, to the absence of sanitation.  Last month, the book earned one of Australia’s most prestigious literary honors, the 100,000 Australian dollar ($72,390) Victorian Prize for Literature. But Boochani, who is barred from entering Australia, could not collect his award. Simply writing the book itself was a feat. Composed via WhatsApp text messages, it was strung together amid the looming fear that guards might confiscate Boochani’s phone at any moment. The 35-year-old, who has emerged as a vocal critic of hardline immigration policies practiced in Australia and elsewhere, spoke with TIME by phone from Manus Island, where is he being held in a new facility after the previous detention center was deemed unconstitutional and permanently shut in 2017. How do you feel about being honored with this award?  It is a very paradoxical feeling. We [refugees on this island] have had long journeys and we have been on Manus Island for the past five years. So when I see people in pain and suffering, I cannot think of myself and celebrate this award.  [At the same time] it is a huge recognition for all of the refugees around the world who are victims of fascist systems. I think that’s why it is a huge achievement because we used the power of the written word to challenge this system, this policy.",'This System Humiliates Me.'

1508,Casey Quackenbush,"Suicides around the world have decreased by about a third in recent decades, a new study found, highlighting an overall downward trend. Researchers found that an estimated 817,000 people killed themselves in 2016, a 6.7% increase from 1990. But adjusted for a booming global population, that marks a 32.7% decrease, according to the study published in the BMJ journal. “Suicide is considered a preventable cause of death and this study shows that we should continue in our efforts towards suicide prevention,” said Heather Orpana, research scientist with the Public Health Agency of Canada and a collaborator on the study, according to Agence France-Presse. The report also found that men are more likely to kill themselves than women in all regions and age groups, except for 15- to 19-year-olds. Men account for 15.6 deaths per 100,000 compared with 7.0 among women. The decline in the global suicide rate corresponded with an overall downturn in the global mortality rate among all causes of deaths, suggesting that suicide could be effectively reduced if dealt with like any other illnesses. “Sometimes we might look at suicide as a different kind of health outcome than, say, cardiovascular disease or cancer, which are considered more traditional,” Orpana told AFP. “But what the similar rate (fall) may be telling us is that suicide may be similar to other health outcomes and in some ways may be driven by similar factors.” The Institute for Health and Metrics Evaluation, a think tank partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, conducts the Global Burden of Disease analysis every year. While data collection of self-harm varies by nation, the organization calculates worldwide morality based on hundreds of data sources. The World Health Organization lists suicide as a critical public health issue and reports that at least 800,000 people commit suicide every year. The WHO aims to cut global suicide rates by 10% by 2020, the report says.","Global Suicides Have Declined by a Third Since 1990, a Study Finds","February 7, 2019"
1509,Casey Quackenbush,"Sexual misconduct allegations mounted Wednesday against former Costa Rican president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Óscar Arias Sánchez as a fourth accuser came forward in a period of 48 hours. The New York Times reports that Eleonora Antillón, a former talk show host known by her nickname, Nono, said in an interview that the former president sexually assaulted her in 1986 while he was a candidate and she was a press aide. Arias, 78, has denied the allegations, according to the Times. “In my public life I have promoted gender equality,” Arias said in a statement Tuesday, “because I believe that it is an indispensable means to achieve a more just and equitable society for all people.” Accusations began to surface starting Tuesday after Semanario Universidad published accounts of a psychiatrist who claimed Arias assaulted her about four years ago, grabbing her and forcibly penetrating her with his fingers. She has since filed a criminal complaint against the former president. Since the first allegation became public, two journalists and a book editor have come forward, according to the Times. “People end up thinking, ‘If she dared, others will dare,’” Antillón, 60, said in a telephone interview, according to the Times. “I want to unmask the impostor politician.” The wave of allegations mark significant momentum of the #MeToo movement in Latin America, particularly as they could tarnish the reputation of a revered former statesman who served two terms as president and has been lauded internationally.",Allegations Mount Against Former Costa Rican President Óscar Arias,"Updated: February 8, 2019 2:20 AM ET | Originally published: February 7, 2019"
1511,Joseph Hincks,"The second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to take place in Vietnam at the end of February, Trump told Congress Tuesday, confirming what many had seen as the most likely venue for the talks. Trump’s announcement came during his State of the Union address, in which he also opined the U.S. would by now be “in a major war” with North Korea had he not been elected President. Thanks to his diplomacy, Trump said, “hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months.” Singapore’s Sentosa Island played host to Kim and Trump for their historic first meeting, during which the pair signed a vaguely worded commitment to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But in the interim, North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs have continued unabated, and the Pentagon’s Missile Defense Review said last month that Pyongyang still represents an “extraordinary threat” to America. Here are four reasons Vietnam is a logical choice for the next round of talks between Trump and Kim.  Although Trump did not give a precise venue for Summit 2.0, Vietnam’s capital of Hanoi and the coastal city of Danang have been floated as possible locations. Both are fewer than 2,000 miles from North Korea’s capital of Pyongyang—an even shorter hop from North Korea than Singapore. Kim, who usually travels by armored train, does not share his father’s aversion for flying, but distance still matters: it has been suggested that North Korea’s rickety aircraft fleet is not equipped to make long-haul flights without refueling. Like the slogans that boom out during North Korea’s annual liberation day festivities, Vietnamese wartime propaganda urged patriots to “crush the Yankee imperialists.” Vietnam and North Korea share a bitter historical enmity with the United States; Pyongyang even sent air force personnel to assist the North Vietnamese communists in their crushing victory over the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese Army. While North Korea is still a geopolitical foe of the United States, tensions between Vietnam and Washington have cooled significantly in the decades since the war, and Vietnam is now a popular tourism destination for Americans. Vietnam and the U.S. used to “point a gun and knife at each other,” Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for South Korea’s Blue House, said while commending the choice of host nation Wednesday, according to Reuters. He expressed hopes the talks would lead to “concrete, substantive progress.”",Why Vietnam? 4 Reasons the Southeast Asian Nation Is Perfect for the Second Trump-Kim Summit,"February 6, 2019"

Security minister Ben Wallace said British intelligence officials believe Cantlie is still in custody but he declined to offer further details about why they think he is alive or where he may be held, the Guardian reports. Cantlie appeared in several ISIS propaganda videos since his abduction in November 2012. But he has not been seen alive since 2016, when he was shown in a video in Mosul. The city was liberated from ISIS control last year. Cantlie was a kidnapped along with American journalist James Foley while working as a freelance photographer filing for the Global Post and Agence France-Presse. They were abducted by armed men while driving from the Syrian town of Binesh towards Turkey, according to the New York Times. While the amount of territory controlled by ISIS has decreased considerably, the U.K. does not believe the group has been effectively eradicated. U.S. President Donald Trump, however, claims ISIS has been defeated and plans troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan. The U.N. Security Council estimated in July that 20,000 and 30,000 ISIS fighters remained in Iraq and Syria, with about half in each country. Early this week, the Pentagon released a candid assessment saying withdrawing troops from Syria could lead to a resurgence of ISIS.

The summit is set to take place on Feb. 27 and Feb. 28, the President said. If the meeting takes place as planned, it will be Trump’s second time coming face-to-face with Kim over the last year. The two leaders met for a historic summit in Singapore last June, where they signed a vague agreement that said North Korea would start working toward “complete denuclearization.” Trump touted his relationship with Kim during his speech on Tuesday, saying “our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months.” But in reality, little progress has been made on nuclear negotiations since the leaders’ first meeting. Over the last several months, reports have said Pyongyang has actually continued to improve its nuclear arsenal. U.S. and North Korean officials have met since the two leaders last saw each other, but U.S. intelligence officials recently told lawmakers that Kim may not completely get rid of his nuclear program. Trump himself has expressed mixed opinions on the outlook for future talks with North Korea. During a CBS News interview on Feb. 1 he said there was “a good possibility” that Kim would not give up nuclear weapons, but added “there’s also a very good chance that we will make a deal.” But during the State of the Union address, the President expressed much more confidence. “If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea,” Trump said Tuesday night. “Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.”",Donald Trump Announces Plan to Meet With Kim Jong Un in Vietnam Later This Month,"February 6, 2019"
1515,Sally Hayden,"In the photo, a gun and sneakered foot press Mulugeta’s head to the floor. There’s blood running across his face, and what looks like vomit congealing below his mouth. His feet and wrists are chained together behind his back. This was the image of the 27-year-old Eritrean that was uploaded to Facebook in October, when Mulugeta’s family realized they had exhausted all other options to raise ransom money. They’d already sold their house and jewellery, while begging in churches, mosques and markets. Eventually, Mulugeta told the smugglers he couldn’t pay anymore, so they took a photo of him to send to his family; they knew they could put it on Facebook to raise money from friends. “The smugglers want money, they don’t care how the money is got,” Mulugeta, who asked to only go by his first name for security reasons, tells TIME.  By the time he was released in November, after being repeatedly sold between smuggling groups in Libya, Mulugeta had paid $18,400 to five different smugglers—more than $4,000 of which was raised through crowdfunding on social media. He’s now in a detention center in southern Tripoli, and spoke to TIME through Facebook messages, saying he’s still worried for his future and can’t return to Eritrea, where he fled from indefinite military service in a regime condemned for gross human rights abuses. Hundreds of thousands of African migrants and refugees have tried to escape war, dictatorships or poverty, by heading for Europe in recent years: and social media is raising the cost. Their journeys often involve long and dangerous drives through the desert, and months or years in a smuggler’s camp, before they’re allowed get in flimsy boats to try and cross the Mediterranean. Throughout this journey, technology is both a blessing and a curse: it could be a lifeline to ask for help with, or a means for their families to witness their abuse, suffering and anguish in real time. Facebook, in particular, can offer a glimmer of hope to refugees who are trapped and desperate, because of how easy it is to reach lots of people in a short space of time. Smugglers in north Africa see refugees and migrants as a commodity. Tens or even hundreds of thousands of people are thought to have been held captive by smuggling gangs, who demand hefty ransoms, and torture those who can’t pay up. As in Mulugeta’s case, relatives and friends of those held captive are increasingly turning to Facebook to raise the sums. In photos posted online, men or women, sometimes blindfolded, have their faces pressed to hard ground. Videos show men jolting as they’re tortured with hot plastic, before the camera zooms in on their face. In one picture, a couple sits with their children, the asking price for their lives written in the text over their head: $4,400.  Victims and experts say people in Libya, Sudan and northern Niger have all used Facebook to raise ransom money, and that Eritreans, Ethiopians, and Somalis are the most likely to be held captive like this. TIME has seen eight posts since late November, each shared hundreds or thousands of times between the Eritrean diaspora, with instructions on how to donate directly to a captive’s family. Once the full ransom is collected, it is usually transferred to a bank account in Dubai, or to Khartoum or Istanbul through the hawala system, an alternative money exchange channel that exists outside normal banking and is difficult to trace. From there, it moves on to the smuggling gangs.",The Families of Migrants Held Hostage Are Using Facebook to Raise Money for Smugglers’ Ransoms,"February 5, 2019"

General Joseph Votel, the four-star Army commander who heads U.S. Central Command, made the disclosure Tuesday during an appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee about the withdrawal orders. “I was not consulted,” he said, adding that he was broadly aware of Trump’s “desire and an intent in the past to depart Syria.” When Trump announced his decision to pullout on Dec. 19, it sent shock waves through Washington and the rest of the world. “Our boys, our young women, our men, they’re all coming back and they’re coming back now. We won,” the president said in a video posted on Twitter. The ensuing chaos led to the high-profile resignations of Defense Secretary James Mattis and Brett McGurk, the State Department’s special envoy to the coalition fighting ISIS. “The recent decision by the president came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy that was articulated to us,” McGurk wrote in an email to colleagues obtained by the New York Times. “It left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered.” Votel confirmed he was among those left in the dark, telling the Senate panel: “I was not aware of the specific announcement.” The GOP-led Senate approved legislation Tuesday afternoon that criticized Trump’s planned troop pullout from Syria and Afghanistan. The 77-23 vote on the Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act was non-binding, but delivered a rare Republican rebuke to the president just hours before his State of the Union speech. The U.S. already started the withdrawal process earlier this month when the military hauled vehicles and equipment from northeast Syria into neighboring Iraq.

Speaking at a seminar in his constituency in southwestern Japan over the weekend, Taro Aso had said elderly people are unjustly blamed for the demographic challenges posed to the country of 127 million, including a declining and aging population. “There are lots of weird people who say the elderly are at fault, but that’s incorrect,” Aso said, according to the Guardian. “Rather, those who aren’t giving birth to children are the problem.” Japan’s population is projected to decline by almost 25% between 2015 and 2050, slipping below 100 million. Meanwhile the average number of births per woman has fallen from 2.0 in 1960 to 1.44 in 2016, according to the World Bank. By comparison, in the U.S. and the United Kingdom the rate was 1.8. “The aging population, combined with the diminishing number of children, is the grave issue in the mid and long term,” said the 78-year-old deputy PM, who doubles as the Finance Minister. His comments sparked criticism, including from MPs who accused him of insensitivity toward couples who cannot conceive. In response, Aso said his words had been taken out of context. “I’d like to withdraw my comments and will be careful with my words in the days ahead,” he said. According to government statistics, the number of births in Japan fell to 921,000 in 2018, the lowest since records began in 1899.

After nearly three months of testimonies, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan instructed the 12-member jury on their duties and sent them off to begin deliberating shortly after 1 p.m. Guzman, 61, faces 10 counts of drug and conspiracy charges. Prosecutors have accused him of trafficking billions of dollars worth of drugs into the U.S. in his role as a top boss within the Sinaloa cartel. Defense lawyers argued Guzman was being framed by the 14 cooperating witnesses. The defendant has been standing trial in federal court in Brooklyn since mid-November. During the high-profile trial, government prosecutors called more than 55 witnesses to the stand, including cyber security experts and former members of Guzman’s inner circle. Guzman is perhaps most well-known for escaping from two maximum-security Mexican prisons. About an hour into their deliberations, the jurors returned three notes with questions for the judge. One of the questions the jury asked was whether a drug war constituted as drug-trafficking crime in relation to one of the last counts, which relates to firearms. The judge told the jurors they were essentially jumping ahead. “You can only consider count nine if you find the defendant guilty of one, two, three or four,” he said. “In considering whether he is guilty of one, two, three or four, you may consider evidence of drug wars, but it remains the government’s burden to make that argument beyond a reasonable doubt.” Contact us at editors@time.com.",El Chapo Jury Begins Deliberation in Bombshell Drug Trafficking Trial,"February 4, 2019"

1522,Casey Quackenbush,"A U.S. government decision to mobilize humanitarian aid to crisis-wracked Venezuela could risk escalating the political crisis there as President Nicolas Maduro views such shipments as a pretext for a U.S.-led military intervention, BBC reports. Over the weekend, National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. will send “critical supplies” requested by opposition leader Juan Guaidó, the self-proclaimed interim president. On Twitter, USAID administrator Mark Green shared images of boxes embossed with the U.S. flag en route to help “malnourished children.” Green said he met with Guaidó last week and heard “about the dire humanitarian situation inside Venezuela, where people lack essential basic necessities, such as food and medical supplies.” The aid has become something of a litmus test for the military’s backing of Maduro. Guaidó is pressing the military to allow the shipments in. But Maduro, who has retained support from the top brass, has rejected the idea of U.S. aid and accused his opposition rival of plotting a coup. Venezuela is not “a country of beggars,” the embattled president told his supporters at a rally on Saturday, according to BBC. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said on Twitter that, “Military & police leaders in #Venezuela must now decide to either help food & medicine reach people, or help #Maduro instead.” Last month, the Trump administration recognized Guaidó as the country’s interim president, though the international community remains split between the dueling administrations. Several European countries, including the U.K., Germany, France and Spain, are poised to throw their support behind Guaidó’s acting government Monday after Maduro ignored an ultimatum to call fresh elections. Tens of thousands took to the streets Saturday in competing shows of support for both leaders. Nationwide protests have taken place across the country since Guaidó claimed power on January 23. Guaidó said the move was necessary to restore order and save Venezuela from “dictatorship” after Maduro was sworn in Jan. 10 for a contested second six-year term. Venezuela spiraled into an economic and humanitarian crisis after global oil prices plunged in 2014.

1523,John Walcott,"In the wake of President Donald Trump’s renewed attacks on the U.S. intelligence community this week, senior intelligence briefers are breaking two years of silence to warn that the President is endangering American security with what they say is a stubborn disregard for their assessments. Citing multiple in-person episodes, these intelligence officials say Trump displays what one called “willful ignorance” when presented with analyses generated by America’s $81 billion-a-year intelligence services. The officials, who include analysts who prepare Trump’s briefs and the briefers themselves, describe futile attempts to keep his attention by using visual aids, confining some briefing points to two or three sentences, and repeating his name and title as frequently as possible. What is most troubling, say these officials and others in government and on Capitol Hill who have been briefed on the episodes, are Trump’s angry reactions when he is given information that contradicts positions he has taken or beliefs he holds. Two intelligence officers even reported that they have been warned to avoid giving the President intelligence assessments that contradict stances he has taken in public. That reaction was on display this week. At a Congressional hearing on national security threats, the leaders of all the major intelligence agencies, including the Directors of National Intelligence, the CIA and the FBI contradicted Trump on issues relating to North Korea, Russia, the Islamic State, and Iran. In response, Trump said the intelligence chiefs were “passive and naïve” and suggested they “should go back to school.” The intelligence officials criticizing Trump requested anonymity because the briefings they described, including the President’s Daily Brief, or PDB, are classified. The PDB is one of the most highly restricted products produced by U.S. intelligence analysts. A select group of intelligence officials is involved in preparing these briefings. A small number of senior officials, often including the Director of Central Intelligence, Director of National Intelligence or the heads of other agencies depending on the topic, usually deliver it. The reporting for this story is based on interviews with multiple officials who have first hand knowledge of the episodes they describe, and multiple others who have been briefed on them. Asked in detail about the officials’ concerns, senior White House and National Security Council officials declined to comment. The problem has existed since the beginning of Trump’s presidency, the intelligence officials say, and for a time they tried to respond to the President’s behavior in briefings with dark humor. After a briefing in preparation for a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, for example, the subject turned to the British Indian Ocean Territory of Diego Garcia. The island is home to an important airbase and a U.S. Naval Support Facility that are central to America’s ability to project power in the region, including in the war in Afghanistan. The President, officials familiar with the briefing said, asked two questions: Are the people nice, and are the beaches good? “Some of us wondered if he was thinking about our alliance with the Brits and the security issues in an important area where the Chinese have been increasingly active, or whether he was thinking like a real estate developer,” one of the officials said wryly.",'Willful Ignorance.'

1524,Patricia Laya / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — The embattled Nicolas Maduro regime halted plans to ship 20 tons of Venezuelan gold overseas as a growing international push to ring-fence the country’s dwindling hard assets unnerved those handling the transaction, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The gold bars, which are worth about $850 million, had been weighed and separated in the central bank’s vaults for transportation, but will not be sent out anytime soon, the person said. The bank has suddenly transformed into a microcosm of the crisis: Some staffers, fearful of getting ensnared in U.S. sanctions and worn down by the crippling economic collapse, have begun to disregard orders, prompting senior managers loyal to Maduro to oust them. The blocking of the 20-ton shipment comes just a week after the Bank of England denied Maduro’s request to withdraw $1.2 billion of gold stored there. While the destination of the gold and the nature of the transactions aren’t known with certainty, it’s unusual for a government to be shipping around such massive amounts. And the U.S. officials who are leading the push to have the authoritarian ruler cede power to a transitional government contend that the thwarted deals form part of his regime’s bid to ransack the country in its final days in power. The U.S. is working to ensure that the “benefits of Venezuela’s resources are not pilfered by Maduro and his cronies,” National Security Adviser John Bolton said in a tweet this week. The gold held in Caracas and London is an important source of wealth for a nation that has plunged into extreme poverty under Maduro’s socialist rule. The central bank’s foreign reserves, including the gold, are down to a mere $8 billion. Those assets form a key part of the battle for control of Venezuela’s finances between Maduro and Juan Guaido, the National Assembly leader who is trying to install the transitional government with the support of the U.S. and other countries. On Thursday, Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who is helping spearhead the U.S.’s hard-line stance toward Maduro, fired off a tweet calling out the United Arab Emirates’ Noor Capital as the financial firm orchestrating the gold transaction with Venezuelan authorities. Rubio went on to warn the firm that both it and any airline it hires to take the gold away will be subject to the sanctions that the U.S. government has been stepping up in recent days. Noor Capital said in a statement on its website that it “does not engage in any illegal or prohibited transactions” and is refraining from conducting business with Venezuela until the situation “stabilizes.” The firm said it bought — legally — three tons of gold from the central bank last week but hasn’t made any purchases since. A cargo plane operated by E-Cargo, a Moscow-based company, landed at Caracas international airport on Jan. 30, fueling speculation it was the plane that would cart off the gold. It arrived after leaving Moscow on Jan. 29 and stopping in Dubai, Casablanca and Cape Verde, according to flightradar24.com data. It departed Caracas Friday afternoon.",Maduro Regime Halts Plans to Ship 20 Tons of Venezuelan Gold Overseas,"February 2, 2019"
1525,W.J. Hennigan,"The Trump Administration’s decision to withdraw from a major nuclear arms treaty with Russia could have serious long-term consequences, potentially reshaping the global nature of the nuclear threat from Europe to Asia. On Friday, the Administration announced that the U.S. intends to withdraw the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, citing Russia’s violation of covertly developing and fielding a prohibited missile system that “poses a direct threat to our allies and troops abroad.” “We have raised Russia’s noncompliance with Russian officials, including at the highest levels of government, more than 30 times, yet Russia continues to deny that its missile system is noncompliant and violates the treaty,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday. “Russia’s violation puts millions of Europeans and Americans at greater risk. It aims to put the United States at a military disadvantage, and it undercuts the chances of moving our bilateral relationship in a better direction.” The decision comes after years of arguing between the U.S. and Russia over whether specific weapons programs were in violation, though it received extra scrutiny from critics due to President Donald Trump’s repeated calls for a closer relationship with Russia. News of the withdrawal has already had an effect. Defense stocks surged on the news, outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meanwhile, arms control advocates were left wringing their hands on what the decision meant for the future of nuclear treaties that helped preserve peace since the Cold War. A more serious realignment will come by this summer. A post-INF world is now six months away, thanks to a grace period invoked by the treaty’s Article 15, which gives both countries time to reevaluate decisions on whether to walk way for good. When that deadline passes, it will reopen an era when ballistic and cruise missiles can be peppered on either side of the former Iron Curtain with cross-hairs targeting city capitals. A chance for a much larger deployment also now exists in Asia. The treaty came about during the Cold War, when the United States and Soviet Union would manipulate each other’s nightmares of nuclear annihilation in order to maneuver for advantage in times of relative peace. The superpowers identified certain weapons deemed mutually menacing, and then worked to eliminate the threat altogether.",Trump Is Withdrawing From a Landmark Arms Agreement With Russia.

1526,Ciara Nugent,"Three weeks ago, few Venezuelans knew Juan Guaidó’s name. Today, the 35-year-old is the international face of Venezuelan protest. More than a dozen countries have officially backed Guidó’s claim to be his country’s interim president and tens of thousands of people have turned out on the streets to support him. After years of economic crisis and repression under Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian regime, politicians and the public have rallied around Guiado, who is leader of the opposition-held parliament, which was stripped of its powers in 2017. On Jan. 23, he was sworn in as acting president on the basis that Maduro’s second term was illegitimate and that the constitution says the parliament leader must take charge in a power vacuum. In the week since, Guaidó has appointed members of a parallel government and persuaded the U.S. to impose crippling sanctions that will make it harder and harder for Maduro to cling to power.  Now he’s thinking about the next step toward restoring Venezuela’s democracy. Less than an hour after addressing parliament on Jan. 31, Guaidó spoke to TIME over the phone from his home in Caracas. “Maduro is clearly lost, he seems disoriented,” Guaidó tells TIME. “It’s been weeks and he has barely been able to respond. All he can do is defend himself.” The challenges that remain are daunting, but Guaidó does not seem fazed. Venezuela’s powerful military — which has more than 2,000 generals, 100,000 active members and has enjoyed vast economic and political influence for two decades under the Socialist regime — is still backing Maduro. Analysts say the complicity of the armed forces in networks of corruption and organized crime means they have little incentive to withdraw their support. But Guaidó, who says he has held clandestine meetings with some members of the military, is hopeful that they are starting to listen. “No one is willing to sacrifice themselves for Maduro or take up arms to fight for him,” he says, dismissing the possibility of civil war. “Increasingly, the obvious choice is to put it all aside. Nevertheless, Guaidó worries about being arrested — or worse. There are currently over 350 political prisoners in Venezuela, including his mentor and former leader of his Popular Will party Leopoldo Lopez. Pro-Maduro security forces have killed at least 40 in protests since Guaidó began to lay claim to power.  Hours before Guaidó spoke to TIME, members of a special police force, known as FAES, visited his home while his baby daughter was there. (He and his wife, Fabiana Rosales, were out.) The tense situation in Venezuela and Washington’s support for Guaidó, have led some to raise the prospect of a U.S. military intervention in the country. Guaidó is keen to avoid that — although he has not ruled it out. Intervention, he says, is the last resort. “It’s feasible for us to achieve a peaceful transition in the short term, with pressure from Venezuela and internationally, and knowing that all the cards are on the table.”",Venezuela’s Juan Guaidó Tells TIME How He Hopes to Win Over the Military and Remove Nicolas Maduro,"February 1, 2019"

Behrouz Boochani’s book, No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison, was awarded the 2019 Victorian Prize for Literature, worth $100,000 Australian dollars ($72,650). It also scooped up the prize for non-fiction at the same award ceremony, worth a further $25,000 Australian dollars ($18,160). Boochani is still detained on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island, but the detention center he wrote the book from has since been shut down after a controversy over its conditions. He was unable to pick up the award in Melbourne because he is still not allowed into Australia. “In some ways I am very happy because we are able to get attention to this plight,” Boochani told the BBC. “But on the other side I feel that I don’t have the right to have celebration – because I have many friends here who are suffering in this place.” The prize represents “a victory against the system that has reduced us to numbers,” he told the Guardian. The book was mainly written in Farsi, a language of Iran from which Boochani is a refugee, and translated by Omid Tofighian, the recipient of Boochani’s WhatsApp messages. “WhatsApp is like my office,” Boochani told the BBC. “I did not write on paper because at that time the guards each week or each month would attack our room and search our property. I was worried I might lose my writing, so it was better for me to write it and just send it out.” Australia’s hardline immigration policy has come under harsh criticism from rights groups. The government says asylum seekers who arrive by boat must be housed outside of Australia’s borders while their claims are pending, and must not be allowed to resettle in Australia even if they are found to have a genuine claim to refuge under international law.",Asylum Seeker Who Wrote Book on WhatsApp From Australian Detention Center Wins Literary Prize,"February 1, 2019"

He weighs a little over 100 pounds, has auburn dyed hair, and wears a hoodie emblazoned with the words “Dope Shit.” But in China’s rise to superpower status, the 20-year-old student is a foot soldier playing a vital role. Yin works at Bainiaohe Digital Town, a tech hub set deep in the tree-covered hills of China’s southwestern province of Guizhou. The region is traditionally known for growing tea and producing fiery Moutai liquor, but today it’s luring Yin, and hundreds of young Chinese like him, to work in the booming sector of Artificial Intelligence or AI. For eight hours each day, they sit at computer terminals on brightly colored swivel chairs and help refine the reliability of facial and voice recognition software, driverless car programs, and even mobile apps that are used to identify plants and insects. “I used to think of AI as what’s in American sci-fi movies—many robots and Star Wars,” says Yin. “AI right now is nowhere near that level. It needs to learn. My job here is to teach it.” He does that by highlighting objects in images on his computer monitor. To help a self-driving car algorithm learn to identify common features of a city street, for example, Yin clicks on endless images of buses, sidewalks, or pedestrians. To assist voice recognition software, he’ll listen to garbled human pronunciations and input the correct meaning.

1529,Melissa Chan,"A defense lawyer for Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman blasted the U.S. government’s case against the accused cartel boss Thursday, saying it heavily rests on the cooperation of a band of criminals and the word of “lying opportunists.” During closing arguments, attorney Jeffrey Lichtman told the jury they can’t trust the 14 cooperating witnesses who testified against Guzman because many were “given sweetheart deals” to frame Guzman in exchange for shortened prison sentences. “They’re just lying to your faces,” Lichtman said. “They may be liars. They may be killers. They may be degenerates, but they’re not stupid.” Behind the defense lawyer, a composite of the witnesses’ mugshots were plastered on a giant projection screen. Lichtman said it was the cooperators who “gave this case life, gave it breath.” “The witnesses not only admitted to lying every day of their lives,” but they also lied under oath, the defense lawyer said. He added that the convicts were “cleaned up and put on display” in the courtroom to play their part in the prosecutors’ “scripted event.” “This trial is about one thing and one thing only—getting Chapo,” he said. “Everyone wants the famous Chapo.” Wrapping up his closing arguments, Lichtman asked the jury to look past the defendant’s notorious nickname while deliberating. “You don’t have to give into the myth of El Chapo,” he said.",El Chapo Lawyer Blames ‘Lying Opportunists’ for Giving Case ‘Life’ In Closing Arguments,"Updated: January 31, 2019 3:04 PM ET"
1530,Casey Quackenbush,"Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador declared an end to his country’s war on drugs Wednesday, announcing that the army would no longer prioritize capturing cartel bosses, Agence France-Press reports. “There is officially no more war. We want peace, and we are going to achieve peace,” he said at a daily press briefing after being asked if his government had captured any kingpins since he assumed office in December. “No capos have been arrested, because that is not our main purpose. The main purpose of the government is to guarantee public safety … What we want is security, to reduce the daily number of homicides.” But the announcement drew skepticism from critics, who noted the continued presence of the army, which has been deployed since 2006 to combat cartels. The focus on prosecuting kingpins has fragmented drugs gangs and fueled internal fighting. López Obrador swept into office promising to curb the widespread violence, and to take a different approach. But his proposal to create a national guard has fueled fears of a permanently militarized country. There is a “clear contradiction” in López Obrador’s statements Wednesday, security expert Alejandro Hope told AFP. “His anti-crime strategy barely changes anything, it’s not different from that of previous governments, and even accentuates the use of the armed forces for public security.” According to AFP, there have been more than 200,000 registered murders since the military was deployed to combat drug violence 13 years ago. Some states have recorded homicide rates on par with the most violent regions of the world.

1531,Melissa Chan,"Notorious drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman was a ruthless murderer who regularly resorted to violence and corruption to defend the multi-billion dollar criminal enterprise he led, prosecutors said Wednesday during closing arguments in the Mexican kingpin’s U.S. trial. In the government’s final address to the jury before deliberations, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Goldbarg spent about six hours reminding jurors of the more than 55 testimonies they’ve heard since mid-November. Goldbarg began by recalling a brutal tale of vengeance in which Guzman allegedly gunned down two rivals in the Sinaloa mountains before ordering his henchmen to toss their bodies in a bonfire that raged nearby. “This is how he built his empire and protected it,” Goldbarg said. Guzman, 61, is accused of trafficking $14 billion worth of drugs into the U.S. as the leader of the Sinaloa cartel. He is perhaps most famous for bolting from two top-security Mexican prisons. In 2001, he first escaped from the Puente Grande prison by hiding in a laundry cart. He was recaptured in 2014 in Mazatlán, Mexico—only to break free from the Altiplano prison through a tunnel in 2015. Guzman was re-arrested the next year and extradited to stand trial in the U.S. in 2017. On Wednesday, prosecutors urged the jury to remember his pattern of fleeing justice and not to let him get away with it again. “He’s guilty and he never wanted to be in a position where he’d have to answer to his crimes,” Goldbarg said. “Do not let him escape responsibility. Hold him accountable for his crimes.” Goldbarg said an “avalanche of evidence,” including intercepted text messages and audio recordings, shows Guzman’s guilt “through the defendant’s own words.” The prosecutor said Guzman was standing trial in New York City, where authorities say he is “responsible for bringing almost four tons of cocaine into this district,” Goldbarg said. That amounted to about $5 million in profits at the expense of New Yorkers, she said. Goldbarg also hammered at the point that Guzman’s alleged crimes hit close to home. His stash house that was seized in 2002 was so close to the courthouse, the prosecutor said, that it could be seen from the Brooklyn Bridge. She said it was part of his plan to distribute as many drugs as possible in the U.S. and amass billions of dollars in profits by doing so.",'Do Not Let Him Escape Responsibility.'

1532,Ian Bremmer,"The U.S. government continues to tighten the screws on Nicolas Maduro’s regime in Venezuela; on Monday, the Trump administration announced extensive sanctions against Venezuela’s state-oil giant Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) in a push to collapse the regime in favor of Venezuela’s parliamentary leader and self-proclaimed “interim president,” the 35-year-old engineer Juan Guaido. On Tuesday, the Trump administration handed control to a number of Venezuelan government accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York over to Guaido, ratcheting up pressure further. Because Venezuela continues to be the world’s worst economic-cum-humanitarian disaster. The economic policies of the Maduro administration have largely been an attempt to replicate the socialist welfare policies of late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, who presided over the country at a time of sky-high oil prices. Unfortunately for both Maduro and the Venezuelan people, those ambitious government programs can’t be funded in today’s oil price environment, compounded by woeful economic mismanagement from the Maduro administration. To date, 3 million Venezuelans (roughly 10 percent of the country) have fled the country in search of a better life elsewhere.  Unfortunately, many of those who’ve fled are among the most-educated and most politically-connected—precisely the folks who would be leading the political charge against the Maduro regime. The opposition that remains is fractured and leaderless. Or at least it was until last week, when Guaido, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself the rightful leader of Venezuela until free and fair elections can be held to replace Maduro.  Unsurprisingly, Maduro refused to recognize the legitimacy of Guaido; somewhat more surprisingly, dozens of governments around the world, many of whom have been critical of Maduro but had been wary of wading into the domestic affairs of a foreign country, have voiced their support for Guaido. The most noticeable group to not voice support for Guaido is the leadership of Venezuela’s military, who continue to publicly pledge allegiance to Maduro. And no matter how many international sanctions the Maduro regime is slapped with—and however much the Venezuelan people suffer as a result—so long as the military remains behind Maduro, he’ll be the one calling the shots on the ground in Venezuela. It’s the recognition of this reality that prompted the leaders of the world’s most prominent autocracies—among them Russia, Turkey, Iran and China—to continue recognizing Maduro. Be that as it may, Guaido has injected real momentum into Venezuela’s fractured political opposition, and at a time it desperately needed it. But plenty of dangers remain. Chief among them is just how critical Guaido is to this nascent opposition movement; should anything happened to him personally, the entire movement is at risk of losing momentum. To Guaido’s credit, he’s not backing down, daring the Maduro regime to kidnap him in public speeches. Guaido’s seems to believe the movement is bigger than he is. That remains to be seen. Another key danger not to be overlooked is that the U.S.—and by extension Donald Trump—are now personally invested in the political developments brewing in Venezuela. If the Maduro regime does indeed go after Guaido, Washington will be hard-pressed not to get involved given its very public support of Guaido. All things being equal, there is a greater chance that the current political standoff ends with Maduro leaving than with the U.S. sending in troops to Caracas. But the risk of extreme scenarios (both good and bad) is only rising. The Key Number That Explains It:",The Quick Read on Venezuela’s Political Crisis,"January 30, 2019"
1533,Billy Perrigo,"On Monday, the man leading India’s main opposition announced that his party would guarantee every poor person in India a minimum income if it wins elections scheduled for this spring.  Rahul Gandhi’s surprise promise was welcomed by supporters of Universal Basic Income (UBI), a radical policy proposal that has been gaining ground in recent years. Under UBI, a government gives a fixed amount of cash, without strings attached, to every person in society.  “We cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty,” said Gandhi, the leader of India’s Congress Party. “If voted to power in 2019, the Congress is committed to a Minimum Income Guarantee for every poor person, to help eradicate poverty & hunger.” (It is unclear whether Gandhi is proposing an unconditional basic income.) Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) immediately dismissed Gandhi’s proposal. “Where will the money come from?,” a spokesperson asked Reuters. “He’s promising the moon to fool the people.” Nevertheless, speculation is swirling in political circles that the BJP is poised to make a similar announcement soon. The ministry of finance came out in support of a basic income in India’s 2017 economic survey, and many speculate that the Modi government’s final pre-election budget (scheduled for Feb. 1) could include a basic income. When contacted by TIME, the BJP’s economic affairs spokesman refused to rule out the possibility. “I happen to know that the BJP leadership were very seriously considering [supporting a basic income],” says Guy Standing, an economist and early advocate of UBI who worked with Indian politicians and the U.N. to set up trials in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh in 2011-2012, in which more than 6,000 people were given a basic income. If the BJP do announce their support, “you’ll hear a champagne cork pop here,” Standing says. Effectively, he says, that would have the surprise effect of making a basic income the official policy of the next Indian government. Globally, that would mark a significant leap for UBI, which has never been implemented at a national level. The policy has been dismissed as fantastical by many right-wing governments, and only approached tentatively in the U.S. by left-wing politicians like Bernie Sanders.  The trials in the state of Madhya Pradesh are often referenced by advocates of UBI as evidence the scheme can alleviate poverty more efficiently than means-tested welfare schemes. “We know as a result of our pilots that it works,” Standing says. “We know it improves nutrition, health, school attendance, women’s status, status of the disabled, economic output. But to get the politicians to do it is an incredible leap. I’m obviously excited by the development.” A caveat to his excitement is that Gandhi’s proposal (of which details are scarce) is not likely to be the kind of pure “universal” basic income that Standing advocates, in which money is given to every single person in an economy, no matter how poor or rich. In Gandhi’s speech on Monday, he promised a basic income to “every poor person,” suggesting that some form of means-testing would be included. “Now, our job is to persuade them to make it more universal,” Standing says. “You’re going to spend far more identifying the rich than by just giving it to everybody and taxing it back from the wealthy in some way.”",India's Main Opposition Party Is Promising a Basic Income for the Poor.

Prosecutors suspect the biological parents thought their kids were going to a holiday camp, not to an orphanage that has since been shuttered. “There are only losers in this story and the judge will have to determine where the best interests of the kids lie,” Flemish MP Lorin Parys told the BBC. While Congo has among the highest rates of orphaned kids, it stopped issuing exit permits for adoptions in 2013 amid trafficking concerns, according to BBC. Cases underway at the time were still processed. Belgian authorities began investigating child-smuggling from the central African nation in 2017 when a report revealed four adopted children had falsely been declared orphans. Belgian journalists traced the cases back to biological parents who said their children never returned from what was billed as a youth camp. The kids, who were between the ages of two and four at the time, were instead taken to the Tumaini orphanage. After the 2017 report, Belgian officials looked into all the country’s adoptions from the Tumaini orphanage. The 15 cases involved children who arrived between 2013 and 2015, and whose biological parents are believed to still be alive, BBC reports. “They are different age ranges but the kids who’ve been here the shortest time have been here three and a half years, so they have all been integrated,” said Parys. “The parents here have done nothing wrong and of course the parents in Congo are devastated that they lost their kids under false pretenses.”",Belgium Requests the DNA of Children Adopted From Congo Amid Kidnapping Fears,"January 30, 2019"

The mosque attack occurred shortly after midnight in Zamboanga, a predominantly Christian province in the restive Mindanao region. Zamboanga sits just northeast of the Muslim-majority archipelago where the twin cathedral bombings killed at least 20 people. Regional task force commander Colonel Leonel Nicolas told Reuters the grenade incident was “not a retaliatory act”. In an effort to halt the spread of misinformation, military officials urged the public not to speculate about the incidents on social media. The attack came hours after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte addressed the cathedral bombing on TV. He said that the attack on Jolo Island, a militia hotbed, may have been a suicide bombing. His remarks contradicted what security officials have said, according to Reuters, but were consistent with the account provided by the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attack. If confirmed, it would be one of the first known cases of a suicide attack in the Philippines, Reuters reports.

Revealing text messages painted the 61-year-old notorious kingpin as a prolific philanderer. Stunning testimonies exposed the widespread government corruption in Mexico, implicating some of the country’s top ex-leaders. And in time for the last few witnesses to be called, there was even a surprise celebrity guest appearance by Alejandro Edda, who portrays Guzman in Netflix’s Narcos: Mexico. When a jury found Guzman guilty on all charges on Feb. 12, following 34 hours of deliberation, Guzman remained mostly stoic and motionless until it was time for him to be escorted out of the courtroom. Before leaving, he glanced at his wife, who nodded at him and flashed him a thumbs up. Guzman was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years on July 17. He was also ordered to give up $12.6 billion in what the government said were ill-gotten gains. At the sentencing hearing, the drug lord told Judge Brian Cogan the he was not given a fair trial. “My case was stained and you denied me a fair trial when the whole world was watching,” Guzman said in court, according to the Associated Press. “When I was extradited to the United States, I expected to have a fair trial, but what happened was exactly the opposite.” Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn had put more than 55 witnesses on the stand since the trial began in mid-November to prove Guzman was guilty of trafficking billions of dollars worth of drugs into the U.S. as the leader of the Sinaloa cartel. His defense team said Guzman was being framed by the cooperating witnesses—a cast of admitted drug traffickers who have struck deals with the federal government. Guzman is perhaps most famous for bolting from two top-security Mexican prisons.

1538,Roland Paris,"China’s apparent use of Canadian detainees as diplomatic bargaining chips is not just a problem for Canada. It is a challenge to all countries that seek to uphold the rule of law in their domestic and international affairs. The dispute began in December when Canadian police arrested Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an extradition request from the United States. Meng is accused of fraud for allegedly conspiring to mislead several banks between 2009 and 2014. U.S. authorities claim that she deliberately misrepresented the relationship between Huawei and Skycom Tech, a Hong Kong-based company that did business in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Furious Chinese officials, who portrayed Meng’s arrest as a “politically motivated” attempt by the U.S. to weaken China, threatened Canada with ‘grave consequences’ if she was not immediately released. Regrettably, President Donald Trump did little to dispel their suspicions. In his first public comment on the case, he suggested that he might be willing to intervene in Meng’s prosecution in exchange for trade concessions from China, although it is not clear that he even has the power to do so. The Canadian government sought immediate clarification. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other administration officials quickly rebutted Trump’s remarks. ‘What we do at the Justice Department is law enforcement. We don’t do trade,’ said Assistant Attorney General John Demers. In fact, the charges against Meng stemmed from a long-standing Justice Department investigation that reportedly predated the Trump Administration. Meanwhile, China took dramatic action of its own. Nine days after Meng’s arrest, and just two days after warning Canada of “grave consequences,” Chinese officials detained two Canadian citizens – Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave from the foreign ministry and working for the International Crisis Group, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian businessman – on suspicion of endangering China’s national security. Beijing seemed to be sending a message to Canada. In the words of Canada’s former ambassador to China, “there is no [such thing as a] coincidence in China’ when high-profile arrests are involved. It seemed implausible that Chinese authorities were unaware of the implications of incarcerating an on-leave Canadian diplomat immediately after they had issued a dire warning to Canada. Their actions also fit a pattern of previous Chinese behaviour. In 2014, Canada had arrested another Chinese national, Su Bin, also on an extradition request from the U.S. Shortly afterwards, Chinese security officials detained a Canadian couple living in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, accusing them of espionage.",China’s Use of Canadian Detainees as Diplomatic Bargaining Chips Should Worry Us All,"January 29, 2019"
1539,George Steer,"Ensuring there are no shortages of basic medicines if Britain leaves the EU on March 29 without a Brexit deal will be more of a priority than keeping grocery stores stocked with fresh produce, the British government has admitted. Asked at a select committee why the pharmaceutical industry seemed to be better prepared than the food industry for Britain leaving the EU with no deal in place, member of parliament (MP) Dan Hancock said that “medicines will be prioritized in the event of a no-deal Brexit”. Asked to clarify his comments, Hancock continued: “Of course medicines will be prioritized. And we have been through detailed, line-by-line analysis of the 12,000 licensed medicines in the UK. In fact we had our latest meeting on it this morning, the three of us were there, in order to ensure there is a plan for the continuity for all medicines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.” Speaking to The Guardian, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, said: “The fact that the health secretary is forced to make decisions over whether to prioritize medicine over food in the event of a Tory no-deal Brexit is simply astonishing.” “And it’s all the more irresponsible that Theresa May stubbornly refuses to rule out no deal. Playing Russian roulette with the national interest and putting peoples’ health at risk like this is shameful and scandalous,” he added. The announcement comes just a day after the British Retail Consortium, a trade association, sent an impassioned letter to MP’s urging them to “find a solution that avoids the shock of a no deal Brexit”. In such a scenario, the “complex, just-in-time supply chain,” used by retailers to keep stocks of fresh produce on the shelf all year round would “be significantly disrupted”, the letter said.  On the same day, a memo sent to staff in the Defense Equipment and Support agency (a branch of the Ministry of Defense) and leaked to the BBC revealed that up to 1,000 defense workers could be redeployed to help the government cope with a no-deal Brexit.

The Corruption Perceptions Index, which ranks 180 countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, found overall that the failure to control corruption is contributing to a “crisis of democracy around the world.” Under the Trump Administration, the U.S. slipped four points to 71 on a 0-100 scale, the lowest score its registered in seven years. “The low score comes at a time when the U.S. is experiencing threats to its system of checks and balances as well as an erosion of ethical norms at the highest levels of power,” according to TI. President Donald Trump is a “symptom, not a cause,” Zoe Reiter, the watchdog’s acting representative to the U.S., told Reuters. “Conflict of interest wasn’t a new problem, but it was illuminated in its glory when you have someone who is basically breaking norms,” she said. Where democratic norms struggle, corruption flourishes and populists tend to take advantage, according to TI.

The judge, Christoph Flügge, alleged that Turkey used its veto to end the tenure of a Turkish judge in one of the U.N. courts, setting a dangerous precedent for intervention. “Every incident in which judicial independence is breached is one too many,” he said. “Now there is this case, and everyone can invoke it in the future. Everyone can say: ‘But you let Turkey get its way.’ This is an original sin.” Turkish judge Aydın Sefa Akay was removed over alleged connections to a Turkish cleric living in the U.S. named Fethullah Gülen who Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan blames for a failed coup against him in 2016. Flügge cited White House interference as well. He said the U.S. had threatened judges over an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the conduct of American soldiers in Afghanistan. “John Bolton, the national security adviser to the US president, held a speech last September in which he wished death on the international criminal court,”Flügge said, according to the Guardian. “If these judges ever interfere in the domestic concerns of the U.S. or investigate an American citizen, he said the American government would do all it could to ensure that these judges would no longer be allowed to travel to the United States – and that they would perhaps even be criminally prosecuted.” Flügge said the court was stunned by Bolton’s hostility.",A Top U.N.

1542,Ciara Nugent,"Denmark began construction Monday morning on a 42-mile border fence designed to keep out wild boar from neighboring Germany. The government chose to erect the barrier amid fears that African swine fever is spreading across Europe, it said in a statement. An outbreak of the disease, which is highly contagious, has no cure and is fatal to pigs, was recorded in nearby Belgium in late 2018. With around 12 million pigs at any one time, swine outnumber people two to one in Denmark. Meanwhile, ASF could pose a threat to the country’s $4.6 billion pork industry. The fence will be five feet tall, designed to allow larger animals such as deer to jump over it. The government says the project, which will be completed in fall 2019 and is expected to cost $12 million, is “common sense.” But environmentalists claim the fence, which will be electrified, could endanger protected wildlife species, including the wild wolf. And, over the border, some have questioned the effectiveness of the fence in preventing the spread of the disease. “The virus spreads mainly through people – through animal transport, hunting trips, infected food,” agriculture minister for the northern German region of Schleswig-Holstein told German media. “We have significant doubts about the usefulness and necessity [of the fence].

Carey is scheduled to take the stage in her first concert in Saudi Arabia on January 31 in a lineup that also features DJ Tiesto and Sean Paul. Some are heralding the event as another milestone in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s liberalization agenda, which has included loosening restrictions on the entertainment industry. Carey would be the highest profile, Western female singer to perform in the Kingdom, according to Bloomberg. But others see the performance as further indication of a troubling paradox undergirding the prince’s reforms. Even as the self-styled modernizer invites famous westerners like Carey to headline shows, his government continues to detain women’s rights activists who had campaigned for the right to drive, and perpetuates a male guardianship system that treats women as legal dependents. Women’s activist group CodePink called on Carey not to “artwash” Riyadh, and urged her and the other performers to cancel the show. “Doesn’t she know Saudi Arabia is one of the most repressive and murderous regimes on the planet?” the group said in a statement launching its petition to call off the concert. On Twitter, several commentators also tried to draw Carey’s attention to the Kingdom’s treatment of women. “Dear @MariahCarey, I hear you’re planning on performing in #Saudi Arabia,” wrote Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy. “Are you aware that women’s rights activists have been detained without charge since May 2018?” The scheduled performance comes in the wake of a Saudi teenager’s highly mediatized and ultimately successful quest for asylum earlier this month.

1546,Nikos Chrysoloras / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Three key European Union nations are set to make good on a pledge to help their companies trade with Iran despite U.S. sanctions, a move that could help to salvage a nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic but may have more political symbolism than economic impact. The announcement of the so-called special purpose vehicle could come as soon as Monday, two diplomats familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as last-minute negotiations on the wording of the EU statement continued. The mechanism is key to the EU’s effort to keep Iran from quitting the 2015 accord to constrain its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The U.S. pulled out of the deal in May and has since reimposed sanctions. A draft EU statement seen by Bloomberg welcomes the initiative by U.K, France and Germany as providing “a positive impact on trade and economic relations with Iran, but most importantly on the lives of Iranian people.” The statement is going to be discussed by EU government envoys in Brussels on Monday morning and may be released soon after, if all 28 member states approve. The initiative reflects both European determination to uphold the Iran deal and growing concerns in Europe about the dollar’s clout in the international financial system. The mechanism is supposed help protect European companies keen to do business in Iran from U.S. sanctions that could result from dollar-based transactions. The vehicle would theoretically receive payments from companies that want to continue doing business with Iran, either by receiving waivers for oil imports or permissible trade in goods like food and medicine. With no direct transfer of funds between Iran and European actors, it would, theoretically at least, insulate firms from U.S. penalties. The Trump administration has deemed the channel an attempt to evade its “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, while casting doubt on its ability to circumvent U.S. restrictions. In December, the U.S. Treasury’s top sanctions official Sigal Mandelker, said she’s not concerned “at all” that the mechanism can sidestep sanctions. Since the U.S. left the nuclear accord, the deal’s remaining powers — China, France, Germany, Russia and the U.K. — have struggled to provide the sanctions relief promised when Iran agreed to limits on its nuclear activities. The mechanism proposed by the European nations faced delays and skepticism that it can successfully persuade companies to trade. Iran’s nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said last week that Iran is ready to re-start its enrichment program using more advanced technology if the nuclear agreement fails, according to Iranian newswires. The country is considering the manufacture of nuclear fuel used in naval propulsion systems, implying it may ramp up uranium enrichment levels closer to the purity needed for weapons.","Defying U.S., European Union Nations Set Out to Help Companies Trade With Iran","January 27, 2019"
1547,David Wainer / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Secretary of State Michael Pompeo took the U.S. effort to recognize Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader to the United Nations, part of a broader campaign to replace President Nicolas Maduro, and said the choice is between freedom and mayhem. Pompeo’s comments came as the U.K. and the European Union pushed for new elections to be called within days in the embattled Latin American nation. “Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side. No more delays, no more games. Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you’re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,” Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Saturday during an emergency session called for by the U.S. The top U.S. diplomat also rapped China and Russia for “propping up a failed regime in the hopes of recovering billions of dollars in ill-considered investments and assistance made over the years.” Russia pushed back, saying the U.S. was trying to engineer a coup in Caracas. Venezuela’s competing leaders — Guaido heads the National Assembly while Maduro succeeded the late President Hugo Chavez in 2013 — are vying for support in the streets and the military. The U.S. is betting it has the clout to tip the scales after President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president was joined by Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Panama, among other countries. The U.K. will recognize Guaido as “constitutional interim president if new elections are not announced within eight days,” Foreign Office Minister Alan Duncan told the council. The European Union on Saturday also signaled it will recognize Guaido as the country’s leader if elections aren’t called within days. “We think every country ought to take steps toward achieving that and not side with this cruel dictator in Venezuela, who has caused so much devastation for the people of Venezuela,” Pompeo told reporters on Friday. “We think every country ought to recognize the Venezuelan constitution, the demands of the Venezuelan people.”",Secretary of State Pompeo Urges the U.N. to Recognize Juan Guaido as Venezuela's Rightful Leader,"January 26, 2019"
1548,Joseph Hincks,"The video shows a skier in a blue jacket slaloming down a slope before the camera pans upward, an ominous score playing in the background. “This is what families skiing on Mount Hermon in northern Israel saw when they looked up,” reads the on-screen caption on a 37-second clip the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) posted to Twitter Monday, as two vapor trails cut across a dusky sky. “An Iranian rocket fired towards them from Syrian soil.” Captured on a snowboarder’s camera on Jan. 20, the video of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system apparently intercepting a surface-to-surface rocket fired into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an elevated plateau in southwestern Syria, was posted shortly after Israel carried out a series of retaliatory air strikes against Iranian targets in the country. Those targets included what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “Iranian warehouses containing Iranian weapons” at Damascus International Airport, and a line of Syrian military air defense batteries, including some Russian-made installations. The Israeli air strikes killed 21 people, according to a monitor, among them 12 members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, six Syrian fighters, and three non-Syrian nationals. In response, a high ranking Iranian military official issued fresh threats to annihilate Israel and Syria warned it could hit Tel Aviv’s airport. Meanwhile, Russian called for Israel to halt “arbitrary strikes on the territory of a sovereign state.” By Thursday, Israel had deployed the Iron Dome system in Tel Aviv to provide the metropolitan area with greater air cover amid the tension with Syria, as well as fresh flare ups in the Gaza Strip to the south. Neither tit-for-tat battles nor incendiary threats between Israel and Iran are new. But this week’s violence has underscored fears that both countries’ attempts to set red lines in Syria risk escalating a shadow conflict into open war. Here’s what to know. The IDF’s video describes Mount Hermon as being in northern Israel, but the international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Israel conquered most of the plateau during the Arab–Israeli War of 1967 and unilaterally annexed it in 1981. Although Syria and Israel’s territorial dispute over the Golan Heights was not resolved and the two states have technically been at war since Israel’s founding, Israel’s northwestern border was for decades its least volatile front. That changed when the Syrian war broke out in 2011, and Iran began pouring in money, resources and soldiers into the country in support of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The Islamic Republic’s intervention was, in part, a response to the initial routing of the regime’s forces by Sunni rebels, who were financed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Tehran’s primary strategic objective now is to increase its ability to deter any potential Israeli attack on Iran by raising the stakes of such a strike for Israel, says Payam Mohseni, Iran Project Director at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. The presence of Iran-allied militias on the ground on Israel’s northwest border “may be a game changer” in terms of this deterrent, he says. They also increase Iran’s ability to support and supply Lebanon-based Shi’a Islamist political party and militant group Hezbollah, to Israel’s direct north. “Israel is attacking to severely limit such a scenario.”",Israel and Iran Are Waging a Secret War in Syria.

1551,Billy Perrigo,"One of the two women who made history in India earlier this month by becoming the first of “menstruating age” to enter the Sabarimala temple in the southern state of Kerala has been assaulted and thrown out of her marital home, after her family disowned her in retaliation against her act of protest. Kanakadurga, who only goes by one name, said she was hit on the head by her mother-in-law with a wooden plank one day after returning home, Scroll.in reports. She said the attack left her in the hospital for five days and that she still has trouble speaking and moving her head. “I am not going to say sorry to anyone,” Kanakadurga told the site. “I have not committed any wrong by word or deed. I would like to reiterate that no one, including my brother and husband, has any right to stop me from entering my home.” Kanakadurga and her friend Bindu Ammini, both in their 40s, entered the Sabarimala temple on Jan. 2, becoming the first women to do so. The temple had long barred women of “menstruating age,” defined as between 10 and 50, from entering, citing concerns over their purity. But after India’s Supreme Court ruled in September that the ban was unconstitutional, the issue has become a wider socio-political issue in India, where the relationship between the Supreme Court and religious authorities has a long and controversial history. Both women were forced into hiding after it was revealed they had entered the temple. India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has come down in support of the crowds of Hindu protesters who, before Kanakadurga and Ammini entered the temple, succeeded in preventing female devotees from entering the temple for months. The issue is one of tradition, not gender equality, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the time. On the contrary, he said, the issue of “triple talaq” (by which until recently under Indian law, a Muslim man could divorce his wife by saying “talaq,” or divorce, three times,) was an issue of gender equality and therefore a matter for the Supreme Court, which outlawed the practice in 2017.

1553,Olivia B. Waxman,"A century ago Friday, on Jan. 25, 1919, nearly 30 countries approved a proposal to create a commission to establish the League of Nations. Meant to keep the peace in the aftermath of World War I, the League—championed by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson—was approved at the Paris Peace Conference and went into effect a year later. Though it only functioned until April 1946, it is considered a forerunner to the United Nations and its impact can still be seen today. TIME spoke to Stewart M. Patrick, senior fellow in global governance and director of the International Institutions and Global Governance (IIGG) Program at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), for answers to some basic questions about the League’s legacy: TIME: What did the League of Nations do right? PATRICK: There had been many plans throughout history, since the days of Immanuel Kant, to come up with a permanent institution to help create perpetual peace or reduce the prospects of war. The League of Nations is significant because, even though it failed, it was the first time a bunch of sovereign nations got together and said, ‘We’re sovereign nations, but we’re going to try to combine our power to try to keep the peace.’ It also had some modest successes particularly dealing with certain territorial disputes. The League was not in vain if you consider that there were lessons learned from its failings. Why did the League of Nations fail?  There had to be unanimity for decisions that were taken. Unanimity made it really hard for the League to do anything. The League suffered big time from the absence of major powers — Germany, Japan, Italy ultimately left — and the lack of U.S. participation. Henry Cabot Lodge, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was worried involvement in the League would hamstring the U.S. from determining its own fate and demanded all these reservations to U.S. membership. The biggest issue was Article X, which said League members are committed to protecting the independence and territorial integrity of other countries around the world, and Lodge interpreted that as an automatic decision that if a country was invaded or faced aggression, the U.S. would have to come to [its] aid. The reality was it was more moral than an iron-clad legal commitment. And as a result the Senate rejected U.S. membership in the League of Nations.

1554,Billy Perrigo,"On Monday, in an effort to stop the spread of fake news, WhatsApp announced that users around the world would only be allowed to forward messages to a maximum of five contacts or group chats, down from a previous limit of 20. But in India, where that same policy has already been in place for six months, activists and academics say it has done little to curb the spread of misinformation in the world’s biggest democracy. Ahead of national elections in April and May, India’s political parties are pouring money into creating hundreds of thousands of WhatsApp group chats to spread political messages and memes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has drawn up plans to have three WhatsApp groups for each of India’s 927,533 polling booths, according to reports. With each group containing a maximum of 256 members, that number of group chats could theoretically reach more than 700 million people out of India’s population of 1.3 billion. In reality, the number is likely to be smaller because many people are in multiple group chats, and most chats have fewer than 256 members. But the strategy reflects a fundamental change in Indian society: at the time of the last national polls in 2014, just 21% of Indians owned a smartphone; by 2019, that figure is thought to have nearly doubled to 39%. And for most of them, WhatsApp is the social media app of choice — by one count, more than 90% of smartphone users have it installed. In recognition of that shift, the BJP’s social media chief declared 2019 the year of India’s first “WhatsApp elections.” But according to researchers, as well as screenshots of group chats from as recently as January seen by TIME, these WhatsApp group chats frequently contain and disseminate false information and hateful rhetoric, much of which comes from forwarded messages. Experts say the Hindu nationalist BJP is fueling this trend, although opposition parties are using the same tactics. “There is an army of volunteers whose job is to sit and forward messages,” says Soma Basu, a fellow at the Reuters Institute at Oxford University, who is researching the spread of hate messages on WhatsApp group chats in India. “The volunteer is not able to forward a message to 20 people in one go” any more, she says. “So they’ll just do it five times.”  That limit was introduced in July, after a spate of violence in early 2018, when rumors about child kidnappers, forwarded from person to person and group to group, fueled mass hysteria mainly in rural towns and villages across the country. In one incident in the state of Maharashtra, five people from a nomadic group were killed by a mob after rumors spread on the app about a child-abducting gang being active in the area. In all, at least 30 people were lynched in what came to be dubbed “WhatsApp Killings.” In response, WhatsApp reduced the number of contacts or groups a user could forward a message to from 100 down to five in India, and 20 globally. (A WhatsApp spokesperson told TIME that during testing of the forwarding-limit, the company saw a 25% reduction of forwarded messages being shared.) In addition, WhatsApp added a “forwarded” label to passed-on messages. Even so, WhatsApp still finds itself playing catch-up. In the Brazilian election in October 2018, the company banned hundreds of thousands of accounts; it is now doing the same in India. “WhatsApp is stepping up our efforts to ban accounts engaging in sending spam ahead of elections,” a company spokesperson told TIME. “We will continue to take steps to preserve the private nature of the app, such as limiting viral content and banning accounts engaging in spam.”",How Volunteers for India's Ruling Party Are Using WhatsApp to Fuel Fake News Ahead of Elections,"January 25, 2019"
1555,Ciara Nugent,"Standing on the balcony of his presidential palace on Wednesday, Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro warned his supporters about the U.S. response to their country’s political crisis. “We don’t want to go back to the gringo interventions of the 20th century,” he said. “The U.S. is trying to mount a coup and install a puppet government [to protect] its interests in Venezuela.” As Maduro’s authoritarian regime has plunged Venezuela into humanitarian crisis, the socialist leader has often blamed the country’s troubles on economic sabotage by the U.S., evoking a long and bloody history of American imperialism in Latin America. But this week, as the U.S. publicly recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela — and refused to rule out military intervention in the country — Maduro picked up the refrain with renewed fervor. Now, tensions are rising between the U.S. and the embattled regime. Here’s the history behind Maduro’s claims, and how the current situation compares. The U.S. is among more than a dozen countries, including the U.K., Canada, and most of Venezuela’s neighbors, that have so far recognized the 35-year-old Guaidó as interim president. As leader of the country’s parliament, the National Assembly, Guaidó says he is constitutionally bound to take charge if there is no legitimate president in the country. (Maduro’s second term, won in rigged elections in 2108, is not recognized by the opposition.) Guaidó proclaimed himself president before crowds of supporters in Caracas at mass anti-government protests on Wednesday. Soon after the White House released its statement statement recognizing Guaidó, Maduro announced he was breaking off ties with the U.S. and ordered all diplomats to leave within 72 hours. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hit back, saying the Socialist leader had no “legal authority” to give that order, as “the former president.” Instead of withdrawing the mission, Pompeo pledged to give $20 million in humanitarian aid for Guaidó to hand out.  Maduro says that by pushing for Guaidó to take over, the U.S. “intends to govern Venezuela from Washington.” And Washington certainly has a history of interfering in Latin America’s governments. In the 1950s, 60s and 70s, social movements in Latin America began to challenge stratified class systems that were often hangovers from colonial rule. Leftwing movements and populist parties gained support, and sometimes power, in countries including Brazil, Argentina, Nicaragua and Bolivia. In Chile, Salvador Allende became the world’s first democratically elected Marxist president in 1970. In the context of the Cold War, the U.S. viewed those developments down south as a threat to the global balance of power: American security forces did not want more of its neighbors to become allies of the U.S.S.R.

Soros, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, criticized the administration’s policy toward China, saying its labeling of Beijing as a “strategic” competitor in late 2017 was “too simplistic.” “An effective policy towards China can’t be reduced to a slogan. It needs to be far more sophisticated, detailed and practical; and it must include an American economic response to the Belt and Road Initiative,” he said, referring to Beijing’s global trade and infrastructure strategy. “Regrettably, President Trump seems to be following a different course: make concessions to China and declare victory while renewing his attacks on U.S. allies. This is liable to undermine the U.S. policy objective of curbing China’s abuses and excesses,” he said. “The reality is that we are in a cold war that threatens to turn into a hot one.” Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington at the end of the month to revisit trade negotiations with U.S. officials.

1558,Daniel Cancel and Fabiola Zerpa / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — A standoff is developing at the U.S. Embassy in the Venezuelan capital after a top Socialist Party official threatened to shut off electricity to the complex amid a growing power dispute in the oil-rich nation. President Nicolas Maduro quickly severed diplomatic ties with the U.S. on Wednesday after Donald Trump publicly backed the opposition’s Juan Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela and gave U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave the country. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded to Maduro by saying the U.S. doesn’t recognize his authority and therefore won’t pull its staff, prompting Diosdado Cabello, a close Maduro ally, to make the threatening comments. “They say they don’t recognize Nicolas,” Cabello said late Wednesday on state television. “OK. Maybe the electricity will go out in that neighborhood, or the gas won’t arrive. If there are no diplomatic relations, no problems.” The deadline Maduro gave for the U.S. to remove its staff would expire in the afternoon on Saturday, Jan. 26. A refusal to evacuate would test Maduro’s reaction and whether he’d be willing to use force to try to expel them from the country which could in turn trigger a strong reaction from the U.S. including tougher sanctions. The U.S. has been preparing possible oil sanctions, and Trump said on Wednesday that he wouldn’t even rule out military options. The friction over the hilltop embassy compound punctuated a dramatic week in what was once South America’s richest nation. Guaido, president of the opposition-dominated and powerless National Assembly, said that the nation’s constitution made him president in the absence of a legitimate chief executive. The U.S. publicly backed his claim and opposition supporters filled the streets in the biggest demonstrations since deadly clashes in 2017. Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, one of the key brokers to resolve the power struggle, publicly backed Maduro Thursday while welcoming dialogue with other governments to find solutions. During a press conference, he called the latest developments “very dangerous” and denounced a coup attempt by the Guaido-led faction. And Russian President Vladimir Putin, a longtime ally and financial backer of socialist Venezuela, spoke to Maduro Thursday to voice his continued support and express his concerns about meddling from the U.S. and the other countries that have backed Guaido. “Destructive external interference severely violates basic norms of international law,” Putin said. In his message on Wednesday, Pompeo directly addressed the Venezuelan armed forces as part of his effort to keep U.S. personnel in the country safe.",Venezuelan Official Threatens to Cut Power to U.S. Embassy as Diplomatic Standoff Grows,"January 24, 2019"
1559,Katherine Pomerantz,"For this week’s cover story, TIME turned to Davide Monteleone to create a series of powerful black and white portraits that humanize the larger story of global migration. We were inspired by Monteleone’s personal project, “In the Russian East,” which was influenced by Richard Avedon’s renowned series, “In the American West.” Both photographers were inventive in how they framed their subjects — allowing the individuals or families to literally carry over across the borders of the image. “The choice was appropriate to recall what America is built on: a large number of working migrants from all over the world,” Monteleone told TIME. “This is equally true nowadays in Europe.” When TIME called Monteleone to discuss the project, he explained that he was currently in London working on his Masters in Art and Politics with a personal concentration in migration and mapping systems. It couldn’t have been a more perfect fit. TIME sent Monteleone and a small multimedia team to Tijuana in late November 2018, as a large migrant caravan arrived at the Mexico-U.S. border. Monteleone taped a simple white vinyl backdrop on a wall outside a migrant camp, and in between rain showers, interviewed and photographed dozens of migrants. “Eliminating the desperate conditions in which migrants are generally depicted allows the viewer to reflect on the story of the individual rather than the stereotypical ideas surrounding the migratory experience,” Monteleone said. To help convey the incredible risks many migrants faced along their journeys, we asked them to draw maps of their routes. Many of their illustrations can be seen in a video at TIME.com/migrants. As part of the project, Monteleone also traveled to Germany to photograph migrants who fled the civil war in Syria and to Murfreesboro, Tenn.. There, he photographed cover subjects Albertina Contreras and her daughter, Yaquelin Yohana Garcia Contreras, as they wait to hear if they will be granted asylum in the U.S. Monteleone photographed Albertina and Yaquelin individually, and asked them to hold hands just outside the frame. The intent was to visually represent the idea of separation and reunion — a reality that the mother and daughter faced after they were separated and eventually reunited after arriving in the U.S. last May.

1561,Ian Bremmer,"Tunisia will forever be remembered as the birthplace of the Arab Spring in 2011. That has been both a blessing and a curse for the country. The upside is that democracy and reform have become focal points of national pride in a region badly in need of both–especially after the architects of the transition won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015. The downside is that Tunisia’s halting progress continues to disappoint those who hope others will follow its path. Egypt’s retreat into dictatorship, Libya’s fragmentation and Syria’s catastrophic war make Tunisia that much more important for those who insist that the awakening continues. Eight years after the uprising, many Tunisians are angry at how their newly democratic state is faring. The unemployment rate for graduates is about 30%. For those who have jobs, wages remain stagnant, and GDP per capita is down since 2014. Tens of thousands have fled the country in search of better prospects. Little wonder then that demonstrations have become commonplace in recent years. According to the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, their number has surged from 5,001 in 2015 to more than 11,000 last year. The most recent, at this writing, came on Jan. 17, when Tunisia’s largest labor union staged a nationwide strike to demand better pay for state employees. Timed to mark the democratic uprising’s anniversary, it was joined by hundreds of thousands of workers and brought much of the country’s rail, road and air traffic to a halt. Work in schools, hospitals and state-run media slowed. This follows the self-immolation of a journalist in December, an act of desperate protest echoing the public suicide of vegetable vendor Mohammed Bouazizi in 2011, the spark that ignited the revolution. The unrest puts Prime Minister Youssef Chahed in a tight spot. His country badly needs foreign investment, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) remains the most promising source of needed cash. The catch is that the IMF wants Chahed to prove he’ll keep state spending within recommended limits. But this is an election year in Tunisia, and the Prime Minister knows he can’t afford to ignore demands from frustrated civil servants for better pay, or risk taking tough decisions when the results won’t be seen until after votes are cast. At the same time, street unrest will discourage investment. And protesters demanding that the government tackle rising corruption, reduce income inequality and create jobs won’t be easy to placate. This isn’t yet a crisis. IMF officials understand Chahed’s predicament and want him to succeed, and the fund will probably follow its criticism of his government with more financial support. After another few weeks of fist shaking, the unions will likely end up coming to a compromise with the government. Tunisia and its Prime Minister will all but certainly muddle through. That’s hardly a ringing endorsement for democracy, though–particularly in a part of the world where leaders aren’t eager to share power and few citizens have ever experienced democracy’s benefits. The Arab Spring succeeded in producing at least one country that’s building authentically democratic institutions and holding free and fair elections. But with each passing year, the glow of that achievement dims and demands for prosperity and fairness grow more urgent. If they are not met, then one day Tunisians might decide the revolution–and all it ushered in–was more curse than blessing.",Tunisia’s Fledgling Democracy Shows Signs of Wear and Tear,"January 24, 2019"
1562,"Liam Fitzpatrick / Hue, VIetnam","At a Buddhist temple outside Hue, Vietnam’s onetime capital, 92-year-old Thich Nhat Hanh has come to quietly “transition,” as his disciples put it. The ailing celebrity monk—quoted by Presidents and hailed by Oprah Winfrey as “one of the most influential spiritual leaders of our times”—is refusing medication prescribed after a stroke in 2014. He lies in a villa in the grounds of the 19th century Tu Hieu Pagoda, awaiting liberation from the cyclical nature of existence. At the gate, devotees take photos. Some have flown from Europe for a glimpse of Thay, as they call him, using the Vietnamese word for teacher. Since arriving on Oct. 28, he has made several appearances in a wheelchair, greeted by hundreds of pilgrims, though the rains and his frailty have mostly put a stop to these. On a wet afternoon in December, the blinds were drawn back so TIME could observe the monk being paid a visit by a couple of U.S. diplomats. The Zen master, unable to speak, looked as though he could breathe his last at any moment. His room is devoid of all but basic furnishings. Born Nguyen Xuan Bao, he was banished in the 1960s, when the South Vietnamese government deemed as traitorous his refusal to condone the war on communism. He is now back in the temple where he took his vows at 16, after 40 years of exile. Framed above the bed are the words tro ve—”returning”—in his own brushstroke. In the West, Nhat Hanh is sometimes called the father of mindfulness. He famously taught that we could all be bodhisattvas by finding happiness in the simple things—in mindfully peeling an orange or sipping tea. “A Buddha is someone who is enlightened, capable of loving and forgiving,” he wrote in Your True Home, one of more than 70 books he has authored. “You know that at times you’re like that. So enjoy being a Buddha.” His influence has spread globally. Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, said in 2016 that she could not have pulled off the Paris Agreement “if I had not been accompanied by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh.” World Bank president Jim Yong Kim called Nhat Hanh’s Miracle of Mindfulness his favorite book. The monk’s return to Vietnam to end his life can thus be seen as a message to his disciples. “Thay’s intention is to teach [the idea of] roots and for his students to learn they have roots in Vietnam,” says Thich Chan Phap An, the head of Nhat Hanh’s European Institute of Applied Buddhism. “Spiritually, it’s a very important decision.” But practically, it risks reopening old wounds. Other Vietnamese exiles were infuriated by highly publicized visits Nhat Hanh made in 2005 and 2007, when he toured the country and held well-attended services that made international headlines. To his critics, these tours gave legitimacy to the ruling Communist Party by creating the impression that there was freedom of worship in Vietnam, when in fact it is subject to strict state controls. Other spiritual leaders have suffered under the regime; Thich Quang Do, patriarch of the outlawed Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), has spent many years in jail or under house arrest. In November, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), the government panel that monitors freedom of religion globally, issued a statement condemning his treatment by Hanoi. In this context, Vo Van Ai, a Paris-based spokesman for the UBCV, said Nhat Hanh’s prior visits to Vietnam “played into the government’s hands.” The meaning of his return, therefore, carries great freight here in Vietnam. “[It] symbolizes that both he and the type of Buddhism he represents are fundamentally Vietnamese,” says Paul Marshall, professor of religious freedom at Baylor University in Texas. “For the government, this is both a challenge and an opportunity. If he lives out his life in peace, they can claim credit.”",The Monk Who Taught the World Mindfulness Awaits the End of This Life,"January 24, 2019"

Sanctions and condemnation have had little effect, but a popular uprising, now in its second month, is sending cracks through the once unassailable edifice of his regime. LET THEM EAT BREAD What began on Dec. 19 as a riot in the city of Atbara over the price of bread soon morphed into a nationwide anti-al-Bashir movement. Throngs of young protesters–Sudan’s median age is 19–have filled the streets, calling for “freedom, peace and justice.” Authorities have arrested more than a thousand and killed 40, according to Amnesty International. But the near daily demonstrations continue. “People are hungry, and they see the looting of the country’s resources by the ruling clique,” said Sudanese-British billionaire Mohammed Ibrahim. “When they are pushed against the wall, they just have nothing to lose.” SOLIDARITY AT LAST Al-Bashir’s government is no stranger to unrest, but there are signs that the latest uprising has him rattled. The 75-year-old calls the protesters “traitors” and blames the violence on rebels from Sudan’s Darfur region–a once effective tactic that seems to have lost its teeth. His opponents say diverse ethnic groups are finally united against their President after years of his exploiting divisions. Protesters now chant, “We are all Darfur,” referring to the genocide that in 2009 made al-Bashir the first serving head of state ever to be indicted by the International Criminal Court. TURNING THE TIDE The harsh crackdown has drawn the professional classes to the cause; doctors and lawyers are coordinating many of the rallies. Al-Bashir has insisted he will not step down and says only that he will respect the will of the people in elections slated for 2020. But the Sudanese have lost faith in the country’s rigged election system. Now in the streets and sensing weakness, they may not stop until they get the response they are waiting for.

1566,Casey Quackenbush,"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro met his most serious challenge to date when opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself president Wednesday following days of nationwide anti-government protests. Demonstrations swelled on the anniversary of the 1958 coup that overthrew military dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez, as a newly united opposition marshaled the first mass protests since a bloody crackdown in 2017 that left at least 120 people dead. At least seven people have been reported killed in this week’s protests, according to the Associated Press.  Maduro, who was re-elected last year in a vote marred by allegations of vote-rigging and a suppressed opposition, is under pressure from the U.S. and other governments for what is viewed as his increasingly authoritarian leadership and undemocratic policies. At home, he faces growing disapproval from ordinary Venezuelans, who have suffered under economic policies that brought about a steady erosion of the country’s economy and crippling inflation rates. Despite the latest challenge to his rule, Maduro has shown no indication that he is willing to step down. Here’s what to know. Maduro and Guaidó are now locked in a showdown, with much of the international community backing the 35-year-old opposition leader’s claim to interim power. Speaking to demonstrators in the capital Caracas on Wednesday, Guaidó declared that he would “formally assume the powers of the national executive as president in charge of Venezuela.” As the leader of Venezuela’s parliament (which Maduro stripped of its powers in 2017), Guaidó says the constitution gives him the right to become president if there is a vacuum of power in the country. He claims Maduro’s illegitimate second term is just that. He recognized that the move was risky, but said it was a necessary step to restore order and save Venezuela from “dictatorship.” “We know that this will have consequences,” he said. “To be able to achieve this task and to re-establish the constitution we need the agreement of all Venezuelans.” Prior to January, Guaidó was a little known figure, but he has risen to power quickly as the new head of the opposition-led congress. Maduro has dismissed his assumption of power as part of an American conspiracy. “I am the only president of Venezuela,” Maduro said, according to the New York Times. “We do not want to return to the 20th century of gringo interventions and coups d’etats.” Once the wealthiest nation Latin America, Venezuela has descended into chaos. A drop in global oil prices in 2014  made Venezuela’s oil-backed socialist model impossible to sustain. And, since taking over from his mentor Hugo Chavez in 2013, Maduro’s economic mismanagement has driven the country into humanitarian crisis. Hyperinflation, which the IMF estimates will reach 10 million percent by 2019, has led to mass food and medical shortages. Crime is rampant and starvation has become known as the “Maduro diet.” More than three million of the country’s 31 million people have fled, according to the U.N. migration agency.",A Political Crisis Is Sweeping Venezuela.

1567,Kamakshi Ayyar,"China’s foreign ministry says that Chinese-Australian blogger, novelist and former Chinese diplomat Yang Hengjun was detained on charges of endangering national security. Speaking at a daily press briefing in Beijing Thursday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying offered few details about the case but confirmed Yang’s arrest on suspicion of “criminal activities,” the Associated Press reports. China’s vague national security laws are commonly used to target critics of the ruling Communist Party. Yang, 53, was due to arrive in the Chinese city of Guangzhou early on Dec. 19 and then travel on to Shanghai with his family. But he never cleared security for the second leg of the journey, said Feng Chongyi, an associate professor in China studies at the University of Technology Sydney. Yang reportedly told Feng that his trip to China would not attract any attention from authorities, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. A Wednesday statement from Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government was “seeking to clarify the nature of this detention and to obtain consular access to him.” Australian officials were due to meet with Chinese authorities in Beijing Thursday to learn more about the situation. Yang, an Australian citizen since the early 2000s who has been living in the U.S. for several years, is known for his spy novels and calls for democracy and reform in China. He has a large online following, and his views have earned him the nickname “Democracy Peddler” in some circles, according to the BBC. Yang is the latest in a series of foreign nationals to be detained by China in recent months. Following the December arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, a high-ranking executive of Chinese technology firm Huawei, Beijing arrested two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig. The government of Canada later said more than a dozen of its citizens had been detained, most of them released. Neither is this Yang’s first run-in with Chinese authorities. He briefly disappeared in 2011 after calling a friend from a Chinese airport to say he was being followed. He later said the matter had been a “misunderstanding.” He was also reportedly questioned by authorities during a 2017 visit to China.

Humanitarian workers have so far built around 1,600 such centers throughout the camps. “The scale of the Rohingya refugee crisis demanded a rapid response,” Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF’s representative to Bangladesh, said in a statement. “This year we are scaling up services to reach more children than ever before, while focusing on improving the quality of education each child receives.” More than 920,000 Rohingya, a mostly stateless Muslim minority from western Myanmar, currently live in camps and host communities scattered across Cox’s Bazar, a district of southeast Bangladesh. Most of them — upwards of 700,000 — arrived since August 2017, when the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown on the group in response to insurgent attacks. The U.S. has labeled the ensuing violence “ethnic cleansing,” while U.N. investigators have called for Myanmar military leaders to face charges of genocide.

1572,Matthew Bristow and Oscar Medina / Bloomberg,"A diplomatic crisis is brewing as Colombia seeks the capture of a guerrilla negotiating team in Cuba following the bloodiest terror attack in 16 years. The government of Colombian President Ivan Duque has asked Cuba to extradite the delegation from the National Liberation Army, or ELN, a Marxist rebel group which last week murdered 20 people with a car bomb at a police academy in Bogota. The dispute threatens to draw in the governments of Brazil, Norway and Chile, which underwrote the peace process along with Cuba, and also has the potential to spread further if U.S. President Donald Trump backs Colombia. When Duque took office in August, he insisted that the ELN stop carrying out terrorist attacks, hand over hostages, and stop kidnappings as a condition for continuing the negotiations started by the previous government. As peace talks stalled, the guerrillas stepped up their campaign, carrying out dozens of attacks on oil pipelines. The massacre of young police cadets on Jan. 17 caused widespread revulsion among the Colombian public, and a desire to see the ELN face justice. Duque’s low approval ratings are “a big incentive for him to make a lot of noise on this,” said Adam Isacson, of the Washington Office on Latin America, or WOLA, which studies human rights in Latin America. “It’d probably be pretty popular if he did.” Under the rules agreed for the talks to proceed, the guerrillas would be given 15 days to return to Colombia if talks broke down, where they wouldn’t be subject to arrest or attacks by the security forces for a further 72 hours. Duque’s administration is arguing that it isn’t bound by the agreement, which was reached in 2016 by the government of President Juan Manuel Santos. The government of Norway issued a statement saying it stood by these rules, while Chile said it supported Colombia in its efforts to bring terrorists to justice. Brazil’s Foreign Affairs Ministry didn’t reply to an email seeking comment, sent outside normal office hours.

1574,Angelos Chryssogelos,"Last June, in the picturesque lake region of Prespes, Greece and Macedonia seemed to set aside decades of hostility, as leaders from both countries signed an accord to rename the former Yugoslav republic. Under that eponymous agreement, signed in the presence of European and U.N. officials, Macedonia will become the Republic of North Macedonia. And now, after six months of trying to secure approval by both parliaments, a deal to resolve one of the most intractable — and to many outside observers incomprehensible — bilateral disputes in the Balkans is close to fruition.  After Macedonia enacted all necessary changes in its constitution, the Prespes deal is now very close to ratification by Greece as well, with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras winning a vote of confidence in Athens on Jan. 16 — called because of disagreements in his coalition over the agreement. The name-change deal is now expected to be ratified by Greece later this week, which will pave the way for North Macedonia’s entry to NATO and the start of negotiations to discuss it joining the European Union. After the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991, Greece’s northern neighbor took the name “Macedonia”—but Athens refused to recognize it, saying it gave legitimacy to territorial claims over the northern Greek province of Macedonia. (The U.N. calls it “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.”) The dispute has led Athens to repeatedly block its neighbor’s attempts to join NATO and the E.U., a cause of concern for European leaders who want to strengthen those alliances in the face of Russian aggression.  Even though the dispute between the two countries is centered on the legal question of the official name of a country, it touches upon emotional issues of history and identity in both countries. For the citizens of what will soon be “North Macedonia,” the term “Macedonia” is a marker of their distinct national identity in the Balkans. For Greeks on the other hand, Macedonia is intertwined with important periods and personalities in a historical narrative that extends back to ancient times. Under the weight of still vivid memories of conflict and war during the 20th century, the two nations have found it impossible to reconcile on a jointly agreed understanding and use of the word ‘Macedonia’—until last summer. And still, the leaders of both countries have come up against deeply entrenched nationalist attitudes. The E.U. has supported the agreement throughout all the stages of its negotiation, signing and ratification. For the E.U., the Prespes deal represents all that is good about multilateralism and the rules-based international order at a time when these values are under attack by nationalism and populism in Europe, and by President Donald Trump and Russia further afield. It clears a stumbling block in its enlargement to the Western Balkans and puts back on track its project of transforming this region by enmeshing it in its institutional and legal order. For the E.U. the Prespes agreement then is both a geopolitical victory and a vindication of its vision of how international politics should work. But there are three problems with this narrative. The E.U. has chosen to ignore problematic aspects of a ratification process that has challenged constitutional norms and rule of law principles in both Macedonia and Greece. Because both Tsipras and Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev have razor-thin majorities in their parliaments, pushing through the deal in both countries has required political bargaining that has pushed the limits of legality. In Macedonia, Zaev, who lacked the two-thirds majority in parliament to change Macedonia’s constitution, used both threats of judicial prosecutions for corruption and a questionable law of partial amnesty to induce opposition lawmakers to vote for his constitutional amendments. Opposition MPs in Skopje were reportedly under immense pressure by both supporters and opponents of Prespes, including foreign governments, to vote accordingly. Each side has accused the other of threatening physical violence or promising bribes.","Macedonia’s Name Change Deal Is a Triumph for the E.U., But Worrying for Democracy","January 22, 2019"

According to the probe, He violated “ethical principles and scientific integrity.” He claims to have used CRISP-Case 9, a precise gene-editing technique, to alter a pair of embryos to make them impervious to HIV.  The government probe appeared to corroborate He’s claims, which have not been published or independently verified. The scientist executed his experiment “on his own” and “in the pursuit of personal fame,” according to China’s state-run news agency Xinhua. Based on the probe’s conclusion, SUSTC terminated He’s employment as well as his teaching post and research.

1576,Eli Meixler,"Mexico experienced a record number of murders for the second year in a row in 2018, with official statistics logging 33% more killings than in 2017, Reuters reports. Mexican authorities opened 33,341 murder investigations in 2018, the highest number ever, the country’s Interior Ministry reported Sunday. The figure outpaced even last year’s toll of over 25,000, which was then the highest number since the record began in 1997. The endemic violence presents a crucial challenge for Mexico’s left-wing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December promising to improve security and root out corruption. The bloodshed was also a pivotal campaign issue last year. Former president Enrique Peña Nieto vowed to stem drug cartel violence, but his tenure saw a 40% increase in murder investigations, according to Reuters. Mexico’s murder rate has continued to climb since the end of the drug war that ravaged the country from 2006-2012. The fragmentation of more established cartels has left remaining factions and local gangs fighting for territory and access to drug trafficking routes, resulting in brutal violence. In September, state authorities in Jalisco resorted to temporarily storing corpses in a mobile refrigerated trailer after morgues filled up with victims of the escalating bloodshed. The central state of Guanajuato topped 2018’s skyrocketing toll with 3,290 murder probes, more than three times the state’s total in 2017. Bloody turf wars have unfolded in Guanajuato as gangs duel for control of the stolen fuel market.

1577,Charlie Campbell / Shanghai,"If the first meeting was about making friends, the second summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un must now get down to business. The White House announced Jan. 19 that the President and the North Korean leader will sit down again before the end of February in an attempt to inject life into a stalled denuclearization process. A location has not yet been confirmed but the smart money is on the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. The optics would seem to work for both sides: From the U.S. perspective, the authoritarian Southeast Asian powerhouse offers a political and economic model that Washington wouldn’t mind North Korea following. For North Korea, Vietnam is an Asian nation riven during the Cold War but finally reunited by the Communist North’s crushing defeat of the American-backed South. Not to mention a former bitter foe of the U.S. that Washington is now desperately trying to forge better ties with to counterbalance rival superpower China. In short: North Korea’s aspiration is Vietnam’s history. Regarding denuclearization, Trump needs Kim to offer up something real. So far, he’s returned three American hostages, the remains of Korean War dead and destroyed an obsolete nuclear testing site. His nuclear and missiles programs, however, continue unabated. At the very least, Washington needs a full inventory of North Korea’s ballistic missiles and nuclear, biological and chemical weapons arsenals and facilities. Ideally, the next step would then be returning International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to those declared sites and agreeing on a firm dismantlement schedule in exchange for a phased rollback of U.N. sanctions. “Any substantive agreement must be implemented on an ‘action for action’ basis with verification instead of illusory concessions,” says Sung-Yoon Lee, professor of Korean Studies at The Fletcher School at Tufts University. But Kim may have bigger dreams than simply slackening the economic noose. After all, sanctions enforcement by China—across whose 880-mile shared border virtually all North Korean trade passes—has already crumbled amid Kim’s warming relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Trump’s trade war.",'A Shakespearean Tragedy-in-the-Making.'

1578,David Tweed / Bloomberg,"More than 100 China experts and former envoys to Beijing called on President Xi Jinping to release two Canadians who have been detained for six weeks, saying the cases undermine his efforts to build bridges to the rest of the world. The group, including former U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke, ex-Hong Kong Governor Christopher Patten and five former Canadian ambassadors to China, released an open letter to the Chinese leader Tuesday urging the two men’s freedom. The letter said that Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave to work with the International Crisis Group in Hong Kong, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur who helped organize tourist trips to North Korea, had advocated exchanges that help build ties around the globe. “We who share Kovrig and Spavor’s enthusiasm for building genuine, productive and lasting relationships must now be more cautious about traveling and working in China and engaging our Chinese counterparts,” the letter said. “That will lead to less dialogue and greater distrust, and undermine efforts to manage disagreements and identify common ground.” The letter represented the latest effort to increase international pressure over the detentions, which came days after Canada arrested Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou as part of a U.S.-led extradition effort for alleged bank fraud related to violations of sanctions against Iran. She has denied wrongdoing. China has deflected questions about whether the cases were launched in retaliation, saying only that the men are being held by the country’s spy agency on suspicion of activities endangering national security. The incidents have fueled diplomatic tensions between Ottawa and Beijing, including dueling travel warnings about the risk of arbitrary law enforcement. Canada’s current ambassador to China, John McCallum, said last week that the feud was damaging Beijing’s reputation and risked undermining its interests among the global business community. Before the letter’s release, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed Ottawa’s “empty show of strength” in trying to increase pressure on Beijing. “Canada should stop making irresponsible remarks,” Hua told a regular briefing Monday. Kovrig met regularly and openly with Chinese officials, researchers and scholars as part of his work with Crisis Group, while Spavor spent time building relationships between North Korea and countries including China, Canada and the U.S., according to the letter.",China Diplomats and Academics Urge Xi Jinping to Free Jailed Canadians,"January 22, 2019"
1579,Eli Meixler,"Greenland’s massive ice stockpile is melting faster than previously thought, and it may be too late to do anything about it except “adapt,” scientists have warned in a new study. The rate of ice loss there is up to four times faster than it was in 2003 and is contributing to rising sea levels, according to the new data. The findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), used NASA climate data and GPS stations to study Greenland’s ice sheets, the Guardian reports. Greenland lost 280 billion tons of ice annually from 2002-2016, raising global sea levels by 0.03 inches per year. If Greenland’s entire ice sheet were to melt, oceans levels would swell up to 20 feet, endangering numerous seaside cities and low-lying Pacific islands. “Increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea,” Michael Bevis, the paper’s lead author and professor at Ohio State University, told the Guardian. The ice is also melting four times faster in 2013 than it was in 2003, an increase scientists attributed to rising temperatures and the North Atlantic Oscillation, a pressure system that brings warmer air to Greenland. “The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming – it’s too late for there to be no effect,” Bevis added. “We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point.” Read more: Why We Don’t Need a Moonshot to Solve Climate Change","'A Tipping Point.'

1581,George Steer,"Fears of food and medicine shortages are the top of some people’s concerns in the U.K. as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit increased after a proposed deal by British Prime Minister Theresa May was rejected by the U.K. parliament. Some U.K. citizens and businesses have been making preparations by stocking up on essential necessities that are imported from the E.U. amid uncertainty about supplies in the event the U.K. leaves the E.U. without a deal. A no-deal Brexit has been described by lawmakers, business chiefs and commentators as  catastrophic for food supplies.The British government has said that preparing for a no deal is an “operational priority” in an effort to quell fears amid reports of potential shortages of many basic goods such as toilet paper. The E.U. has warned that transport between the U.K. and the rest of the continent would be “severely impacted”, with extra checks potentially clogging up customs points for six months after March. For companies that depend on goods brought in from Europe – especially industries that depend on ‘just-in-time’ deliveries of key components – the costs could be massive. The political uncertainty has been reflected in the increase of sales of ‘Brexit Boxes’ –a care package, worth £295 ($380) containing dozens of tins of macaroni cheese, sweet and sour chicken and beef and potato stew, as well as a water filter and a fire starter. They are being sold by James Blake who set up the company Emergency Food Storage U.K. in 2009 with the aim of “making emergency preparedness as simple as possible.” Blake began selling the ‘Brexit Boxes’ in December and is now selling around 25 a day with a noticeable up-tick since May’s deal was rejected in parliament. “People are concerned,” he said. “I’ll be fine, I’ve got a warehouse full of supplies, but other people just want to feel reassured”. Online discussions abound about Brexit preparations. A Facebook group, 48% Preppers (a reference to the size of the Remain vote in 2016’s referendum), set up to “discuss the practical preparations people are making for life after Brexit,” has close to 5,500 members, half of whom joined in the last month. The group aims to get as many people as possible prepared for the “food shortages, shortages of medicine and mass unemployment” that they say will follow a no deal Brexit. A leaflet has been circulating online, inspired by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency publication “If Crisis Or War Comes” and addressed to the “residents of what is currently known as the United Kingdom” ranks Brexit alongside “extreme weather, critical infrastructure attacks and military conflicts” in its list of crises readers should be worried about most. While some of the doomsday-like individual preparations may be a little extreme, there are some very serious concerns for businesses and local authorities around supplies of drugs and products imported from the rest of the E.U. if a no-deal Brexit comes to pass. Amazon U.K. chief Doug Gurr went so far as to say there could be “civil unrest” if Britain leaves the E.U. with no trade deal in place. And in a scathing report from December, Kent County Council even warned that: “Bodies may remain uncollected and children might miss exams due to gridlocked roads in the event of a no-deal Brexit”.","Brexit Boxes and Stockpiling Medicines, Britons Prepare for a No-Deal E.U.

1582,Casey Quackenbush,"Global wealth inequality widened last year as billionaires increased their fortunes by $2.5 billion per day, anti-poverty campaigner Oxfam said in a new report. While the poorest half of humanity saw their wealth dwindle by 11%, billionaires’ riches increased by 12%. The mega-wealthy have also become a more concentrated bunch. Last year, the top 26 wealthiest people owned $1.4 trillion, or as much as the 3.8 billion poorest people. The year before, it was the top 43 people. Oxfam’s annual study, released as political and business leaders prepare to descend on Davos for the World Economic Forum, emphasized that this growing inequality is compromising the fight against poverty. “The size of your bank account should not dictate how many years your children spend in school, or how long you live – yet this is the reality in too many countries across the globe,”said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International. Since the financial crisis almost a decade ago, the number of billionaires has nearly doubled, with a new one created every two days between 2017 and 2018. At the same time, the mega-rich and wealthy corporations are enjoying lower tax rates than they have in decades, the report said. “Governments are exacerbating inequality by underfunding public services, such as healthcare and education, on the one hand, while under taxing corporations and the wealthy,” Oxfam said. Women and girls are hit hardest by the growing wealth gap, according to Oxfam. “Girls are pulled out of school first when the money isn’t available to pay fees, and women clock up hours of unpaid work looking after sick relatives when healthcare systems fail,” it said. To address many of these ills, Oxfam advocated raising taxes. It estimated that a 1% wealth tax would be enough to educate 262 million out of school children and to save 3.3 million lives. As of 2015 returns, Oxfam says that only four cents in every tax dollar collected globally came from tariffs on wealth, such as inheritance or property.

1583,Eli Meixler,"Police in Northern Ireland have arrested four men after a car bombing this weekend that is being investigated for links to the New Irish Republican Army (IRA) militant group, Reuters reports. Two suspects in their 20s were detained hours after the Saturday evening explosion in North Ireland’s Londonderry. Another two suspects, men aged 34 and 42, were arrested later on Sunday, according to Reuters. No one was injured by the bomb, which was detonated outside the city’s courthouse. “Fortunately it didn’t kill anybody but clearly it was a very significant attempt to kill people here in this community,” Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told reporters. According to police, attackers filled a hijacked pizza delivery truck with explosives before leaving it outside the courthouse shortly before 8:00 p.m. on Saturday. Police identified the vehicle and began evacuating the area before the “crude” device exploded. Hamilton said the investigation’s “main line of inquiry” is the New IRA, a violent splinter group that remains opposed to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the Associated Press reports. The pact ended three decades of violent strife in Ireland between Protestant unionists, who favored joining the United Kingdom, and Catholic nationalists, who backed independence. About 3,700 people were killed in the conflict, known as The Troubles, before the accord established a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.

1584,Jennifer Jacobs and Nick Wadhams / Bloomberg,"Administration officials are planning for President Donald Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to take place in Vietnam, said people familiar with the plans. The White House announced on Friday that Trump would meet Kim in late February, following a 90-minute meeting between the president and Kim Yong Chol, one of the North Korean leader’s top aides. The pair discussed denuclearization and a second summit, the White House said at the time. Kim Yong Chol also met Friday with Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Trump and Kim held their first meeting in Singapore in June. The February summit is likely to take place in Hanoi, the capital, but Danang, site of the 2017 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, and Ho Chi Minh City in the country’s south have also been discussed as possible venues. Neither the administration nor the North Koreans offered much else after Friday’s meetings about what they’d agreed to and what would be gained from the planned summit. That only raised more questions because so little progress has been made toward the U.S.’s ultimate goal — getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons — since the first meeting between Trump and Kim. The prospect of another meeting with Kim, the enigmatic leader with whom Trump’s struck an unlikely rapport, offered him a departure from the partisan stalemate over the U.S. government shutdown and the continued drip of investigations into his Russia dealings.

But the ISIS-claimed terror attack that killed four U.S. troops in the northern Syrian town of Manbij this week proved the hollowness of U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated claims of victory over the militant network in Syria and Iraq. “We have won,” said Trump on Twitter Dec. 19, days after a phone call with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in which he unexpectedly agreed to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Vice President Mike Pence doubled down on Trump’s victory claims this Wednesday, the same day the U.S. military confirmed American soldiers were among those killed in the Manbij blast. ISIS “has been defeated,” he said in a speech at the State Department, adding that the “caliphate has crumbled.” Read more: A Deadly Suicide Blast in Syria Shows the Battle Against ISIS Is Far From Over While territorial losses have struck at the heart of the Islamic State, the jihadi group’s fighters are far from a spent force. “It would be reckless if we were just to say, well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now,” former U.S. anti-ISIS envoy Brett McGurk told journalists shortly before he handed in his resignation on Dec. 21 in protest over the troop withdrawal. Here’s more: The most recent UN estimates put the number of ISIS militants in Syria and Iraq today at between 20,000 and 30,000, with most dispersed over territory the group no longer fully controls. That’s not many fewer than the 33,000 fighters U.S. intelligence officials estimated the group had at its 2015 peak, according to VOA. Yet in terms of territory the Islamic State is much diminished. In late-2014—the year ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi declared himself caliph—the jihadi network controlled territory in Syria and Iraq the size of Great Britain. Depicted on maps, it sprawled across the Euphrates and Tigris. But the group’s stronghold cities of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria fell in 2017. And after the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Force’s (SDF) rout of the militants from their last urban base in Hajin in December, the New York Times reported, ISIS’ physical footprint was reduced to a river valley south of the town, held by about 2,000 fighters.","ISIS Is Still Active in Iraq, Syria and Beyond.

1586,Olivia B. Waxman,"Berlin was perhaps destined to be a meaningful place for Martin Luther King Jr.; it was the city that, in some ways, gave him his name. And for a man who preached against walls that “divided humanity,” a 1964 visit to the then-three-year-old Berlin Wall, which divided the Soviet-occupied East side of the city and the U.S.-occupied West side of the city, offered a chance to add another layer to that significance. The visit came about after West Berlin’s Mayor Willy Brandt invited King to participate in a memorial ceremony for President John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated the year prior, less than six months after his own famous visit there. King also received an invitation to speak in East Berlin from Heinrich Grüber, who had been a pastor at a church there and a prisoner in a concentration camp for three years during World War II for openly criticizing the Nazi Party. It would be risky for King, as Grüber had been driven out because of his anti-government views, and had been living in West Berlin himself. “I write in the bond of the same faith and hope, knowing your experiences are the same as ours were,” he wrote in a letter to King, according to historian Britta Waldschmidt-Nelson’s account of the visit. “During the time of Hitler, I was often ashamed of being a German, as today I am ashamed of being white,” Grüber wrote. “I am grateful to you, dear brother, and to all who stand with you in this fight for justice, which you are conducting in the spirit of Jesus Christ.” King decided to take that risk and accepted both invitations. On Sept. 13, 1964 — two months after the Civil Rights Act was enacted and a month before he won the Nobel Peace Prize — King addressed 20,000 people at a rally at the outdoor stadium Waldbühne in West Berlin. He also visited the spot where, earlier that day, East Berlin guards had shot and wounded a resident who was trying to climb over the wall into West Berlin. King also delivered the same sermon at St. Mary’s Church in East Berlin, which was over its 2,000-person capacity, and then gave another, unscheduled speech to the overflow crowd at Sophia Church, similarly over its 2,000-person capacity. And, in a city with a division that could not be avoided, he said that, while he was no expert in German politics, he knew about walls. “It is indeed an honor to be in this city, which stands as a symbol of the divisions of men on the face of the earth,” he told East Berliners. “For here on either side of the wall are God’s children and no man-made barrier can obliterate that fact. Whether it be East or West, men and women search for meaning, hope for fulfillment, yearn for faith in something beyond themselves, and cry desperately for love and community to support them in this pilgrim journey.” He talked about the similarities shared by the clash between African Americans and white people in the United States and that between communism and democracy in Berlin, which he described as “the hub around which turns the wheel of history.” Just as America is “proving to be the testing ground of races living together in spite of their differences: you are testing the possibility of co-existence for the two ideologies which now compete for world dominance,” he said. Quoting Ephesians, he spoke of his assumption that “wherever reconciliation is taking place, wherever men are ‘breaking down the dividing walls of hostility’ which separate them from their brothers, there Christ continues to perform his ministry of reconciliation.”",What Martin Luther King Jr. Said About Walls During His 1964 Visit to Berlin,"January 18, 2019"
1588,Ian Bremmer,"In the month since President Trump made the surprise announcement that he would withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, the policy has slowly disintegrated into a mess. First, the snap decision cost him a Defense Secretary, Jim Mattis, who inspired bipartisan respect and trust. Second, anxious allies like Saudi Arabia and Israel urged the President to rethink a move that might strengthen the regime of Bashar Assad and its backers in Russia and Iran. Then on Jan. 16, several U.S. troops were killed in Syria by alleged ISIS operatives–almost exactly a month after the President’s confident assurance that he was pulling out because ISIS had been defeated. The attack threatened to prove right the critics who said a hasty withdrawal would inspire the Islamic State to new brutalities. Trump firmly believes that Americans don’t want an open-ended commitment of U.S. troops and taxpayer dollars to another inherently unstable Middle Eastern country. Although he has been forced to slow the drawdown and has dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to reassure regional allies that the U.S. intends to help “expel every last Iranian boot” from Syria, he wants to find a way to fulfill a promise to his base to stop “endless wars.” Aside from ISIS, one of the most serious obstacles to that goal is Turkey, paradoxically one of the few U.S. allies to welcome the U.S. withdrawal. It was during a friendly phone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Trump first agreed to the policy shift. Since then he has discovered that withdrawal means leaving Syrian Kurds, who are U.S. allies, at the mercy of Turkey’s military, which would like to destroy them. Erdogan insists that Syria’s Kurds are enemies of the Turkish state and that their ties with Kurdish terrorists inside Turkey threaten his country’s national security. In early January, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said U.S. troops would not withdraw unless Erdogan promised to leave the Syrian Kurds alone. Erdogan bristled at Bolton’s remarks, telling the Turkish parliament “it is not possible for me to swallow this.” On Jan. 13, Trump poured fuel on the fire by tweeting that the U.S. “will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds.” The following day, the two came to a compromise of sorts in a conciliatory phone call in which they discussed a buffer zone intended to keep Syrian Kurds away from the Turkish border. But it’s not clear who would police that if U.S. troops do indeed leave the country. Trump might just have been telling Erdogan what he wanted to hear. And that was before ISIS resumed killing American troops. Trump has made clear that Syria is not among the subjects that interest him most. He’s described the country as a place of “sand and death.” But while Americans are dying there, it becomes more difficult to claim the withdrawal as mission accomplished. And it will be impossible if Erdogan decides to target U.S. allies instead of ISIS. The two leaders have much in common. Both are charismatic men who inspire deep loyalty from their strongest supporters, and both bristle when they feel they’re being insulted. Unless they can reach some kind of common ground over the U.S. withdrawal, Trump’s Syria policy looks set to become not just a mess but a quagmire.",Trump's Pledge to Pull U.S. Out of Syria Meets Reality,"January 18, 2019"

Government officials have likened the demonstrations to “terrorism” and blamed “coordinated” opposition groups for setting off the unrest.

It also saw the once prosperous regional “breadbasket” spiral into economic collapse.

African leaders met in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on Thursday to discuss the growing political crisis in the cobalt- and copper-rich country. “The heads of state and government attending the meeting concluded that there were serious doubts on the conformity of the provisional results, as proclaimed by the National Independent Electoral Commission, with the votes cast,” the body said in a statement. “Accordingly, the heads of state and government called for the suspension of the proclamation of the final results of the elections.” A high-level African delegation is urgently being dispatched to Congo to help resolve the country’s post-election crisis, the body said. It urged Congolese officials to cooperate with the mission. If Congo’s Constitutional Court validates the electoral commission’s poll figures, Tshisekedi will succeed Joseph Kabila, who was barred by the constitution from seeking a third term after leading the cobalt- and copper-rich country for almost 18 years. The court is expected to rule on Friday, Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, a senior adviser to Kabila, said in an interview in Addis Ababa.

1593,Eli Meixler,"North Korea’s lead denuclearization negotiator arrived in Washington Thursday for talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Reuters reports, with the possibility of also meeting with President Donald Trump. Kim Yong Chol, North Korea’s former spy chief and top envoy, is visiting the U.S. as the two countries move closer to arranging a second summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump and Kim met in Singapore in June, the first ever conference between sitting leaders of the U.S. and North Korea. They signed a vague framework pledging to work toward the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” but little headway has been made since on curtailing North Korea’s weapons programs. Kim Yong Chol’s visit could mark a minor breakthrough in the diplomatic impasse. The North Korean envoy last visited the U.S. in June, ahead of the first summit. Pompeo had planned to travel to Pyongyang in November, but that mission was scrapped after Trump insisted that North Korea had not made “sufficient progress” toward denuclearization. The visit this week also comes as Trump announced a new missile defense strategy Wednesday that identified North Korea as an ongoing military threat. But Kim Jong Un signaled optimism for the stalled talks in his annual New Year’s address earlier this month, reiterating his willingness to meet Trump again and predicting that relations between the two adversaries could “advance at a fast and excellent pace.” Write to Eli Meixler at eli.meixler@time.com.",North Korea's Leading Envoy Has Arrived in the U.S. to Meet Pompeo — and Maybe Trump,"January 18, 2019"

Aiia Maasarwe was taking a tram home in Melbourne after a comedy show late Wednesday while on the phone. Her sister, on the other end of the line, told police she “heard the sound of the phone falling to the ground and heard some voices,” according to the BBC. Maasarwe’s body was found near La Trobe university, where she was on an exchange program, in the north of the city. A black cap and grey shirt found near the crime scene are also being forensically tested. A 20-year-old man was arrested as part of the ongoing investigation into Maasarwe death, police said on Friday. Police have not ruled out the possibility of sexual assault. “Our presumption at this stage is that this was a random attack and opportunistic,” Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper told reporters. “Someone in the community knows about this. Someone has gone home on Tuesday night, or in the early hours of Wednesday morning, maybe with blood on them, missing items of clothing. Somebody knows about this.” Maasarwe was studying Chinese and English in Shanghai. “She was an excellent student, full of life. She wasn’t in a very dangerous country at all, and yet we are still receiving such a painful message,” her father Abed Katane told the Haaretz newspaper.

1595,Joseph Hincks,"A headed goal from soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo propelled Juventus to 1–0 victory over rivals AC Milan in the Supercoppa Italiana (Italian Super Cup) Wednesday, but the reluctance of the sport’s top players and clubs to speak out against Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuses has prompted accusations they are complicit in ‘sportswashing’ for the Gulf state. The game took place at Saudi Arabia’s 62,000-capacity King Abdullah Stadium, where a fan-zone featured mock gondoliers and Venetian bridges, soccer stars posed for pre-match photos in traditional Saudi headdresses and fans in the bleachers held aloft cardboard cutouts of the Kingdom’s ruling monarchs. But back in Italy, state broadcaster RAI’s journalists union accused Italy’s elite Serie A league of helping gloss over Riyadh’s strict gender segregation laws, the brutal war in Yemen, and crackdowns on dissident voices – including the brutal murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The $8 million that Saudi Arabia is paying for the right to hold each of three Supercoppa games it is scheduled to host over the next five years constitutes “the price of silence in the face of bombs which have been massacring civilians in Yemen for four years, in the face of the enlistment of child soldiers, in the face of the brutal murder [of Khashoggi],” RAI’s journalist union said in a statement issued a couple of days before kickoff. Highlighting the presence of male-only sections in the stadium and the incarceration of women activists, RAI’s union’s accused those involved of being accomplices to delivering “un calcio ai diritti umani” (a kick against human rights). Read more: Women in Saudi Arabia Can Finally Attend Live Soccer Matches Serie A’s deal with Riyadh drew scant public opposition when it was announced last June. The Italian season’s traditional opener—now scheduled during its mid-winter break—had in the past been played in the U.S., China, Qatar and Libya. Its temporary home in Saudi Arabia was confirmed the same month reforms overseen by de-facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmon (nicknamed MSB) permitted women in the Kingdom to drive, and a year after they were allowed to attend live soccer games in stadiums for the first time. But Khashoggi’s murder in Istanbul last year—which U.S. Senators say was ordered by the crown prince—largely put an end to Bin Salman’ efforts to cast himself as a reformer. The high-profile flight of Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun this month prompted fresh scrutiny of the country’s male-dominated guardianship system, which curbs women’s ability to make critical decisions about their lives. In addition to RAI’s and other unions staging a protest outside Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Rome, Wednesday’s match also drew criticism from Italian politicians and Amnesty international, who in October urged Juventus and A.C. Milan to pull out of the game. “International sports events have become an established public diplomacy tool for Gulf countries to enhance their global stature and to deflect attention from political controversies and human rights abuses,” says Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa program at London-based policy institute Chatham House. “But sometimes this strategy has backfired, instead drawing attention to issues the countries would like to sweep under the carpet.”",A Star-Studded Soccer Game Was Saudi Arabia's Latest Attempt to 'Sportswash' Rights Abuses.

1596,George Steer,"French President Emmanuel Macron attacked the integrity of the 2016 Brexit referendum Tuesday, claiming the British people had been manipulated into voting for something “which doesn’t actually exist”. The referendum, he said, had been “manipulated from outside by a lot of what we call ‘fake news’, where everything and anything was said”. Macron was speaking at the launch of his ‘national debate’ – an effort to quell the ‘yellow vest’ movement and rising dissatisfaction with his premiership – when he made the remarks. On Tuesday, British lawmakers resoundingly rejected Theresa May’s Brexit deal, and Macron was quick to emphasise who he thought stood to lose the most from a possible no deal exit. “First option, the British go towards a no-deal so they say there is no agreement. It scares everybody. The first losers of this are the British people,” he said. The second option, he said, is that “they tell us, ‘we’ll try to improve what we can get from the Europeans and we’ll vote again'”.” Any hope Theresa May may have had of extracting further concessions from the EU was quickly quashed, however, when he added: “I don’t really believe it because we went as far as we could do in the agreement”. “There is a third option,” he asserted. “I think [the U.K.] will start with the second option and it will end with the third option. They say, ‘We will take more time’, and they will ask to have a longer transition period to renegotiate something. “So they will take more time. Maybe they will step over the European elections to find something else. But, in the time we are living, it says a lot about [what] referendums – which seemed nice – can create.” “Good luck to the representatives of the nation who have to implement a thing that doesn’t actually exist and explain to people: ‘you voted for a thing, we lied to you'”.","British Public Were 'Lied' to on Brexit, Says French President Macron","January 17, 2019"

Deasy Tuwo, who ran a laboratory at a pearl farm, was reportedly feeding the 1,500-pound crocodile named Merry when she fell into its enclosure on the island of Sulawesi. Her body was found by her colleagues the next morning, officials said on Wednesday. “The indication is that she fell into the crocodile’s enclosure,” Hendriks Rundengan, an official from a local conservation agency, told AFP. Merry reportedly ate one of the 44-year-old woman’s hands and much of her abdomen. “These parts may still be inside the crocodile now,” Rundengan added. Merry, who had been kept illegally on the pearl farm, was sedated and taken out of the enclosure on Jan. 14 in a three-hour ordeal that required assistance from police, the army and conservationists. Rundengan said Merry will be transferred to a conservation area. It’s unclear how Merry came to be a pet crocodile.

1598,Eli Meixler,"More than half of the world’s wild coffee could be at risk of extinction due to climate change, deforestation and disease, new research says. In an analysis of 124 known coffee species, scientists from the U.K.-based Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew found 75 (60%) are at risk of extinction. Thirteen of those species were identified as “critically endangered.” The findings, published Wednesday in the journals Science Advances and Global Change Biology, emphasize that current conservation measures are not enough to ensure the long-term survival of coffee. “Some of the coffee species assessed have not been seen in the wild for more than 100 years, and it is possible that some may already be extinct,” said Eimear Nic Lughadha, lead scientist for Kew’s Plant Assessment Unit and a co-author on the Science Advances paper. The variety behind the world’s most popular cup of joe, Coffee arabica, is now classified as endangered, largely due to projections of how it will be impacted by climate change. The scientists conducted the survey of coffee species under guidelines from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a body that publishes a global Red List of threatened species. The rate of threatened coffee species was determined to be “extremely high.” While the multi-billion dollar cultivated coffee industry is thriving, the long-term health of the commercial trade could be affected if the wild coffee species die out, according to the research. Wild coffee strains help maintain the crop’s stability and diversity, providing a source of seeds and a possible genetic bastion against diseases.","6 in 10 Wild Coffee Species Are Threatened With Extinction, According to Scientists","January 17, 2019"

The blast claimed the lives of two U.S. servicemembers, one civilian Defense Department employee and one military contractor, according to U.S. Central Command, the military headquarters that oversees all operations in the Middle East. Three other servicemembers were injured. ISIS militants claimed a suicide bomber was responsible for the attack, which also killed a number of civilians. ”Initial reports indicate an explosion caused the casualties, and the incident is under investigation,” the U.S. military said in a statement. The names of the servicemembers killed-in-action are being withheld until 24 hours after their families are notified in accordance with a long-standing Pentagon policy. The attack marks the deadliest day for American forces operating in Syria since the Obama Administration began deploying U.S. Special Operations commandos in November 2015. Until Wednesday, only four other U.S. service members died there while assisting Syrian rebel forces in the fight against ISIS. The incident comes less than one month after President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced he would withdraw all American forces from the war-ravaged country.

1603,Lisa Abend/Vordingborg,"On a cold December night, Inger Stojberg stood in an overlit auditorium in Vordingborg, eastern Denmark, and explained why the Danish government had chosen nearby Lindholm Island for its new detention center for rejected asylum seekers. Although she made it clear from the outset that the government would not revoke the proposal (and sure enough, it was approved three days later) one citizen after the next tried to convince her it was a poor decision, drawing on everything from its impact on property values and tourism to what it would mean for locals’ safety. But many in the audience of more than 700 thought something even more important was at stake. “I came tonight because I don’t think this is a decent way to manage these people,” said Marianne Rasmussen, a teacher from the nearby town of Præsto. “It’s not who we Danes are.” Immigration became a thorny political issue throughout Western Europe in the wake of a record influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa in 2015, but the split over Lindholm Island suggests the question has taken on unusual dimensions in Denmark. The prosperous Nordic country of 5.8 million stands out among its neighbors for its reluctance to integrate even comparatively small numbers of foreigners. It granted protection to 2,365 people in 2017, compared with Sweden’s nearly 28,000. Despite a reputation for progressive politics, humanitarianism and a generous welfare state, Denmark has some of the most aggressive anti-immigrant policies in Europe. That has included taking out foreign-newspaper adverts warning potential migrants that they are not welcome, and authorizing police to seize cash and valuables from arriving asylum seekers to offset the cost of their maintenance. By pitting some of Denmark’s long-held values against others, the subject of immigration has not merely divided Denmark, but turned a demographic crisis into an existential one. What, these days, does it mean to be Danish? Denmark received waves of guest workers from Turkey in the 1960s and ’70s, as well as refugees from the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, and today immigrants and their descendants make up 8.5% of the population—projected to rise to 13.1% by 2060. Yet to an extent virtually unmatched in Europe, “Danes are quite polarized over immigration,” says Nils Holtug, director of the Centre for Advanced Migration Studies at the University of Copenhagen. “There’s a large part of the population that is welcoming and positive toward immigrants, and another large group that’s worried about them and wants very restrictive policies.” These days, the latter seems to be winning. The Lindholm Island project, which is intended to house 100 or so rejected asylum seekers who have been convicted of crimes and served their sentences but cannot be deported for various reasons, is explicitly designed to create a less welcoming atmosphere than the facility that currently holds those with a similar “tolerated stay” status. Until recently, the seven-hectare island, which is located three kilometers from shore in Stege Bay and is reached by a ferry nicknamed “Virus,” held research laboratories for infectious veterinary diseases, and its soil, which still contains traces of swine flu and other viruses, will have to be decontaminated before it can received its first residents in 2021. The $116 million budget for the project does not appear to include funds for language lessons, job training or any other activities that might help ease integration into society. “They are unwanted in Denmark,” Stojberg wrote on her Facebook page of those to be exiled there. “And they will feel like that.” Many of the country’s recent immigration initiatives seem to operate from the same principle. In the past year, the center-right government has passed a so-called burqa ban, even though fewer than 0.1% of Muslim women in Denmark wear veils, and a law requiring parents in neighborhoods designated as “ghettos” to submit their children to extra schooling in “Danish values.” From January, new citizens are required to shake hands with the official conducting the naturalization ceremony, regardless of their beliefs about physical contact with members of the opposite sex—a law perceived as targeting conservative Muslims. Danish journalist and historian Adam Holm describes the initiatives as “deliberately hostile.” In other areas, Danish legislators tend to speak in the measured language of jurisprudence. “But the intent here, and people will say it outright, is ‘yes, we are doing this to frighten people away from Denmark.’” Stojberg, a member of the same Liberal Party as the Prime Minister (and which forms part of the conservative bloc in parliament), has adopted an almost gleeful attitude toward migration restrictions. She celebrated the passage of the 50th anti-immigration law with a cake, posting a photo on social media, and published an editorial in a national newspaper in which she suggested that Muslims bus drivers and hospital workers who fasted during Ramadan might pose a safety risk to Danish society.",An Island for ‘Unwanted’ Migrants Is Denmark’s Latest Aggressive Anti-Immigrant Policy,"January 16, 2019"
1604,Ciara Nugent,"On Tuesday night, U.K. lawmakers resoundingly rejected the Brexit agreement Prime Minister Theresa May has spent a year and a half negotiating with the European Union. It was the biggest parliamentary defeat for a government proposal in the U.K.’s modern history, with 432 lawmakers voting against the deal, and only 202 in favor. As May faces a no confidence vote Wednesday and the British government scrambles to find a way to avoid crashing out of the bloc without a deal on March 29 (a “no-deal” Brexit), the rest of Europe is watching the chaos unfold. Here’s what their front pages and editorials looked like. In the Republic of Ireland, whose second-biggest trading partner is the U.K., the mood is understandably tense. Conservative daily the Irish Examiner dubbed the rejection of the deal “carnage” and warned that it leaves the U.K. on the “Eve of Destruction.” Dublin, it says, is now planning for “worst case scenarios”. The editorial board of centrist newspaper The Irish Times writes that the scale of May’s defeat means her only option is to hold a second public referendum on E.U. membership. “The other E.U. members would surely agree to extend the UK’s departure date under Article 50 to allow this to happen,” the paper claims. With dramatic flourish, the editorial board of centre-left daily Le Monde compares the U.K.’s current political trajectory to the country’s most iconic car: “Like a Rolls-Royce whose brakes have been cut and is sliding unstoppably down a slope into an abyss, Great Britain sinks deeper into the Brexit crisis.” While none of the E.U.’s other 27 members wants to “close the door in Britain’s face,” the editorial continues, “Enough is enough. The time has come for them to make up their minds.” Guillaume Maujean, a columnist for French financial newspaper Les Échos, appeals to Britain’s most famous historical statesman, “Churchill, wake up! They’ve gone crazy!” He lays the blame for the confusion firmly on the British political elite, who, he says, “could now push the whole of the U.K. into a no-deal Brexit no one wants”. Italy’s leftist newspaper La Repubblica echoes the widespread sense of uncertainty with its front page headline “May on the edge of the abyss.” A column by the paper’s Enrico Franceschini labels Britain “an island adrift” and expresses frustration that, two and a half years after the U.K. voted to leave the E.U., the whole process “seems to have gone back to square one.”",'Enough is Enough.'

With Parliament voting down May’s deal by 432 votes to 202, Britain is now set on a default track to leave the E.U. without a deal on March 29 this year, unless an alternative plan can win the backing of parliament. The next week in British politics is full of uncertainty. Perhaps in recognition of the need to compromise, May announced on Tuesday evening that she would open talks with “senior parliamentarians” in an attempt to thrash out an approach that could win the backing of parliament.

Here’s what to know. Yes.

May ended up securing the support of more than half her party’s 315 lawmakers, with a majority of 83, leaving her position safe. A different sort of contest was triggered by Corbyn on Tuesday — one in which the whole of Parliament voted, rather than solely members of May’s Conservative Party.

The effigy alludes to a local folktale, which says the city’s Roman-era aqueduct was built by the devil in exchange for a young girl’s soul. (She ended up getting it back, the story goes.) The two-tiered structure, built around the year 50 and spanning half a mile, is listed along with the old town center as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

But residents were perturbed by the playful Prince of Darkness. Some 5,500 people — approximately 10% of the entire city’s population — have signed an online petition calling for the project to be scrapped. The proposed sculpture is inappropriately “jovial” and “exalts evil,” the petition organizers write, adding that Satan should be “repulsive and despicable — not kind and seductive.” “This representation is offensive to Catholics,” the petition adds.

1609,Ciara Nugent,"Three weeks ago, few outside or inside of Venezuela had heard of Juan Guaidó. But on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump and other world leaders recognized him as the country’s rightful president. After years of seemingly unstoppable slide into autocracy under President Nicolas Maduro, Guaidó is reviving a deflated opposition movement—leading many to believe Venezuela’s democracy could be restored. An industrial engineer and one-term lawmaker for the Popular Will party, Guaidó became head of the opposition-held parliament, the National Assembly in early January. While Maduro stripped that legislative body of its powers in 2017, it still meets and is recognized by most countries. According to the Venezuelan constitution, the National Assembly leader becomes president whenever there is a “vacuum of power” within the country. Guaidó claims Maduro’s second term, won through rigged elections in May 2018, constitutes such a vacuum. (The vote was widely recognized as illegitimate because of a boycott by the opposition and claims of vote-rigging. The U.S. and E.U. imposed sanctions, while 14 mostly Latin American countries recalled their ambassadors.) The charismatic 35 year-old has unified a divided opposition with “a new narrative on how they can reach a democratic transition,” says Diego Moya-Ocampos, a Venezuela expert at risk analysts IHS Markit. Guaidó has stopped short of naming himself interim president but has pledged to do so if protests show he has the people’s support and if the military backs him. Once in office, he would have to call fresh elections in 30 days. The architect of Venezuela’s revolutionary socialist model, President Hugo Chávez, died of cancer in 2013, handing power to Maduro, his chosen successor. The following year, a drop in global fuel prices sent Venezuela’s oil-backed economic model into crisis, prompting goods shortages and mass protests. Determined to maintain his grip on power, Maduro has grown increasingly authoritarian, repressing protests with violence, imprisoning political opponents and increasing his control over the media.  Acute shortages of food and other imported goods have lead to widespread hunger, with the average Venezuelan losing 24 pounds in 2017. The lack of basic medicine has crippled the health system, while violent crime rates have spiked. More than 2.3 million people have fled the country since 2014. Intelligence forces detained Guaidó on Jan. 13, only to release him again 45 minutes later. Communications Minister Jorge Rodríguez later blamed rogue agents acting without authorization. The episode may suggest the government is divided about how to deal with the threat Guaidó poses. “Clearly someone gave the order to arrest him, and then someone in the upper ranks said: No, this is not a good idea,” Moya-Ocampos says, adding that visibly attacking Guaidó could backfire. “He’s actually not that well known nationwide and victimizing him could increase media attention and position him as a leader.” Whatever is going on inside the government, the arrest was a reminder of how precarious Guaidó’s position is against a regime with absolute power over the police and military.

1610,Casey Quackenbush,"Starting Tuesday, tens of millions of Hindu devotees in India will gather to wash their sins away on the banks of the Ganges River in a festival known as the Kumbh Mela. The tradition, which dates back over a millennia, is billed as the world’s largest single gathering of humanity. Through March 4, an estimated 120 million people will flock to the northern city of Prayagraj to bathe at the Sangam, a confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati rivers, BBC reports. By comparison, that’s almost 14 times the population of New York City. While the full Kumbh Mela occurs in 12-year cycles, there are three additional festivals held in between. This year’s Kumbh Mela is projected to be even bigger than the last full one in 2013, which drew an estimated 100 million people. As it begins, here’s what you need to know about the mega-festival. Kumbh means pot or pitcher, while mela means festival or fair. According to ancient Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu released drops of an immortality nectar (carried in a kumbh) in four places where the holiday is now celebrated — Nashik, Prayagraj, Ujjain and Haridwar. The festival rotates approximately every three years through these cities, with the exact dates, places and length largely determined by astrology. In 2017, UNESCO added the festival to the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage, citing the event’s “central spiritual role in the country.” Read more: Gathering of the Faithful: LIFE at India’s Colossal Kumbh Mela, 1953 The main ritual of Kumbh Mela is bathing in the rivers.

A vast tent city dubbed a “pop-up megacity” has been built around the delta in Prayagraj to accommodate the millions that will come to submerge themselves in the sacred rivers.

A Belgian pastor says the 16th Century painting was stolen from his church last week, the Guardian reports. Pastor Jan Van Raemdonck said the altar painting’s absence was discovered at the Sint-Ludgerus church in Zele, Belgium on Jan. 11. Two women laying flowers “noticed the external door was open and the painting was missing,” Van Raemdonck said. The pastor said he had revealed his suspicions to “about 20 people,” and reached out to various museums for assistance. “I wanted to wait for the experts and if they said it was a Michelangelo I would have improved the security of the building,” he said. At the time it went missing, the painting was soon to be examined by Michelangelo expert Maria Forcellino to determine its provenance. According to Van Raemdonck, the painting, known as The Holy Family portraying Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus, was donated 16 years ago by former Belgian senator Etienne Cooreman. Van Raemdonck believed it was the work of Michelangelo, the 15th-16th Century Florentine painter and sculptor known for masterpieces like The Creation of Adam, David and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Van Raemdonck estimated the painting could be worth as much as $144.8 million.

1614,"Josh Wingrove, Dandan Li and Crystal Chui / Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) — A Chinese court sentenced a Canadian man to death on accusations of drug trafficking, a move that could escalate tensions between the two nations stemming from the arrest of a Huawei Technologies Co. executive. Robert Lloyd Schellenberg faces the death penalty for drug trafficking after a one-day trial, according to a statement posted on the website of the Dalian Intermediate People’s Court. Schellenberg was initially sentenced to 15 years in prison after his conviction, but saw the penalty increased after an appeal. He can still appeal the latest decision. “It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply’’ the death penalty, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Monday in Ottawa. The court said Schellenberg was involved in smuggling 222 kilograms (489 pounds) of crystal meth. His initial conviction on Nov. 20, with a lower penalty, found him to have been an accomplice. The death sentence comes as two other high-profile Canadian cases in China remain in limbo. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were each detained on Dec. 10 in the aftermath of Canada’s arrest in Vancouver of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou. Meng is out on bail, while Kovrig and Spavor remain in custody. Canada accused China last week of not respecting the principles of diplomatic immunity in the detention of Kovrig — who is an employee of Canada’s foreign department but has been on leave from that job to work with the International Crisis Group. China said the claim of immunity makes Canada a “ laughing stock.” Trudeau repeated the accusation Monday. China executes more people than any other country in the world, according to Amnesty International. The advocacy group estimates that Beijing executed thousands of people in 2017, compared to 993 known cases in the rest of the world, though precise figures aren’t available.

1616,Eli Meixler,"Nobel Prize-winning scientist James Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, was stripped of several honorary titles last week after his recent comments linking race and intelligence to genetics. Speaking on a TV program which aired earlier this month, Watson reiterated his position that genes underlie racial differences on IQ tests. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, where Watson has held numerous leadership roles over nearly four decades, “unequivocally [rejected]” the 90-year-old scientists’ “unsubstantiated and reckless” comments. The institution also rescinded Watson’s titles of Chancellor Emeritus, Oliver R. Grace Professor Emeritus and Honorary Trustee. “Dr. Watson’s statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science, and in no way represent the views of CSHL, its trustees, faculty, staff, or students,” the lab said in a statement posted on Friday. “The Laboratory condemns the misuse of science to justify prejudice.” Watson first made his tendentious claims in 2007. He later apologized, but resigned as chancellor of the lab, according to the BBC. The pioneer of DNA studies helped discover the molecule’s double-helix structure in 1953. He went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick. But in 2014, Watson auctioned off his Nobel medal for $4.1 million, after years of being shunned by the scientific community. Watson’s role as a persona non grata began after he told the U.K.’s Sunday Times that he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours — whereas all the testing says not really.” He added while he hoped all people could exhibit equal intelligences, “people who have to deal with black employees find this not true.” In a new PBS documentary, the titan of genetics said that his opinions on the issue remain unchanged, adding that differences in IQ’s between Caucasians and other races were reflected in DNA.",Nobel Laureate James Watson Loses Honorary Titles Over 'Reprehensible' Race Comments,"January 14, 2019"

At least 145 children received the vaccines at a country health clinic in China’s eastern Jiangsu province on Jan. 7 despite an expiry date of Dec. 11, according to Chinese state media. The children who were administered the vaccines were between three months and four years old, the South China Morning Post reported. Enraged parents demonstrated outside the Jinhu government offices on Jan. 11, blocking traffic and government buildings, according to The Global Times, a newspaper published by the Communist Party. Three people were arrested during the protest, according to police. Parents said the administration of expired vaccines has been a longstanding problem in their county, even if it only boiled over into a flashpoint issue this month. In a statement released on Jan. 11, the local government blamed the expired vaccines on “disorderly management and staff misconduct” and promised to launch a separate investigation.

1619,Andrew Atkinson / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gave his clearest indication yet that his party is ready to call a no-confidence ballot within days of Theresa May losing a U.K. parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal. Lawmakers are scheduled to vote Tuesday on the agreement May reached with the European Union, and the prime minister appears no closer to getting the backing she needs than she was in December, when the vote was dramatically pulled after it became clear the government was heading for a defeat. Speaking on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show” on Sunday, Corbyn said a confidence vote would be brought “at a time of our choosing, but it is going to be soon, don’t worry about that.” As May made a last-ditch appeal to members of Parliament, the Guardian reported the EU is expecting a request from London to extend the March 29 deadline for leaving the bloc. A probable first step would be a “technical” extension until July to allow the prime minister to revise and ratify the Brexit deal, the newspaper said, citing EU sources it didn’t identify. May, in a Sunday Express op-ed, said opponents of her deal risk letting down the majority that voted to leave the EU in 2016. “Doing so would be a catastrophic and unforgivable breach of trust in our democracy,” May wrote. “My message to Parliament this weekend is simple: it is time to forget the games and do what is right for our country.” A defeat would leave Britain on course to leave the EU with no new trading arrangements in place. According to Bank of England analysts, such a chaotic split could hammer the pound and house prices and plunge Britain into a recession worse than the financial crisis a decade ago. Corbyn is seeking to topple the government by forcing a general election.

Tom Malinowski, D-NJ, stepped to the lectern and excoriated Saudi leadership, singling out Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his suspected lead role in Khashoggi’s murder and “the chaos this man has sown, from the war in Yemen to the blockade of Qatar.” As “the author of the crime, the man who ordered it, [he] must be held accountable,” said Malinowski, a firebrand former human rights advocate and State Department official. “If we decide that he is too powerful or that our relationship with him is too important to speak the truth, then he owns us, and Saudi Arabia owns America, and I cannot accept that as a member of Congress.” Malinowski then called on the White House to use the Global Magnitsky Act to warn the House of Saud that “while you may choose your own leaders, you might want to consider the consequences of giving the keys to your kingdom for the next 50 years to someone who will be forever tainted by this crime.” “And if the administration won’t do what’s right, Congress can and I think Congress will,” Malinowski told the assembled GOP and Democratic lawmakers and human rights activists. “We can and should wipe the smug smile of impunity off Mohammed bin Salman’s face, and restore proper balance to our relationship with Saudi Arabia.” Afterward, as the VIP guests mingled and went out into a mostly shut-down Washington, several approached Malinowski to congratulate him for being the only one to call out MBS, as the de-facto Saudi leader is known. “I didn’t get the memo,” he replied to one friend and a reporter.","During a Jamal Khashoggi Event, Participants Were Asked to Steer Clear of Saudi Arabia.

The Top Risks are intended to help you better understand what political stories you need to pay attention to this year. It’s never been more difficult to distinguish between “signal” and “noise”—made harder by an unrelenting news cycle that makes the “noise” near-deafening. Plenty; it’s going to be a long year. Among the things Eurasia Group analysts will be keeping an eye out for in the calendar year ahead: But there’s one thing Eurasia Group will be paying attention to above all else this year: long-term problems. Because the world will continue to be consumed by addressing the various political crises of the day, the broader challenges facing the globe will continue to go unaddressed — from the erosion of U.S. democratic institutions, to the fracturing of key global alliances. That means when a crisis does hit down the road, its impact will be devastating. That’s the very top risk of 2019. Eurasia Group’s full report, obviously. If you prefer your risks in more visual form, we have accompanying videos as well. That 2019 is shaping up to be the most politically explosive year ever. Yes, all the long term trendlines for global politics are trending downwards, but it takes years for a geopolitical order (complete with norms, customs and institutions) to unravel, and years for the next one to take hold in earnest. 2019 isn’t going to be a year where everything suddenly changes. Instead, we’ll see many of the same problems we saw in 2018, and plenty of them will bleed into 2020 as well. People think it’s boom times for the political risk industry. But this gig is kind of like driving a taxi—you want it raining hard enough that everyone wants your services, but not so hard that people avoid leaving the house altogether. That Brexit is a huge risk for 2019. The U.K’s current political situation only got an asterisk is Eurasia Group’s report this year—that’s because there’s as much chance things will be just fine as everything going belly-up, and we just don’t know which is which at this point.

The pair, reportedly unemployed and in their 20s, were arrested and released without charge after telling police that they “just wanted to talk to Yamaguchi,” according to Japan’s national broadcaster NHK. Yamaguchi made the allegation earlier this week during a live-stream that was abruptly cut short, Billboard reports. She said later on Twitter that she stayed silent for a month, hoping her group’s management would do something about the incident. She also expressed concerns for her own safety and that of her fellow members. The 23-year-old pop star, nicknamed “Mahohon,” has since received waves of online support. Using the hashtag #JusticeforMahohon, fans have offered sympathy and expressed anger toward the handling of the situation.

Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were arrested in December 2017 after being handed rolled-up documents by police in what was widely decried as a setup. They were charged under the country’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act and sentenced in September to seven years in prison with hard labor. The pair had been investigating allegations of atrocities committed against the country’s persecuted and mostly stateless Rohingya Muslim minority, and their imprisonment widely viewed as a reprisal for exposing a massacre of 10 Rohingya men found in a mass grave. Their lawyers filed an appeal in November. Judge Aung Naing rejected the appeal, calling the original judgement a “reasonable decision,” according to Agence France-Presse. The journalists can now appeal their case to Myanmar’s Supreme Court. “Today’s ruling is yet another injustice among many inflicted upon Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo,” Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J.

1625,Eli Meixler,"Scientists believe they may have solved one of the many mysteries of Easter Island’s enigmatic statues: why they are there. A new study says the stone monoliths dotting the remote Pacific island might have been placed to point the way to drinkable water. Many of them were built on ancient platforms located near freshwater resources, according to the study published in the journal Plos One on Thursday. The discovery could give scientists further insight into the little-known civilization that inhabited the island, including how they survived in an under-resourced environment. “What is important about it is that it demonstrates the statue locations themselves are not a weird ritual place,” but were “integrated into the lives of the community,” said Carl Lipo, professor of anthropology at Binghamton University and a co-author on the research, according to the Guardian. Easter Island’s indigenous people, known as Rapanui, built nearly 1,000 anthropomorphic statues from the 13th century until they came into contact with European explorers in the 18th century. But the purpose of the statues, known as moai, and platforms they stand on, or ahu, has long puzzled scientists. Read more: Did Easter Island’s Moai Statues ‘Walk’?  The team examined 93 ahu to determine whether their “spatial distribution” could be linked to “resources thought to be the focus of competition in precontact times.” They focused on three provisions: agricultural gardens, fishing grounds and fresh water, a crucial resource on an isolated island that lacks permanent surface freshwater. The study’s authors found that the ahu corresponded with underground aquifers as well as locations where fresh groundwater ran off into the ocean, creating a briny mix that may have been drinkable. Contemporaneous records from European explorers observed that the Rapanui relied on “brackish” water collected in gourds and “drank pretty plentifully” from the ocean. “Every time we saw massive amounts of fresh water, we saw giant statues,” Lipo said. “It was ridiculously predictable.”",Scientists May Have Solved One of Easter Island's Most Puzzling Mysteries,"January 11, 2019"

1627,Simon Shuster,"A pair of Russians indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for meddling in the U.S. elections of 2016 were involved in a plot that led to the murder of three Russian journalists in Africa, according to a private investigation funded by the journalists’ former employer, the exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Data revealed by Khodorkovsky at a briefing in London on Thursday suggests that several Russians linked to Evgeny Prigozhin, a powerful ally of President Vladimir Putin, conspired to lure the murdered journalists into an ambush on a country road in the Central African Republic, where they were shot dead on the night of July 30. Among those implicated in the investigation was Mikhail Burchik, who was indicted alongside Prigozhin last year for allegedly interfering in the U.S. presidential elections. The investigation into the journalists’ murder apparently relied on data from cell phone towers in Africa and what appears to be private communications between several of the Russians involved. When asked how they had obtained this data, the team of investigators said they had paid for it, but refused to disclose where or how they purchased it. TIME was not able to verify the investigators’ findings independently on Thursday. Prigozhin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Russian Foreign Ministry has said the death of the three journalists was the result of a robbery gone wrong. Contacted on Thursday, a spokeswoman for the ministry declined to comment on Khodorkovsky’s allegations in detail, saying only that Russian law enforcement agencies are still working on the case of the murdered journalists. “The investigation is ongoing,” she said. Khodorkovsky, a wealthy and outspoken opponent of President Putin, told TIME in an interview last month that his investigation would disprove the Russian government’s claims about the murders. After outlining the results of the investigation on Thursday, he told reporters, “These facts don’t leave any room for the theory that this was a simple robbery.” The three murdered journalists—conflict reporter Orkhan Dzhemal, documentary filmmaker Alexander Rastorguev and cameraman Kirill Radchenko—arrived in the Central African Republic in late July to work on a film about Russian private military contractors, whose operations across Africa have intensified in recent years. With funding from Khodorkovsky, the journalists focused in particular on the mercenary outfit known as the Wagner Group, which has been identified in Russian and Western media as part of Prigozhin’s business empire. In June 2017, the U.S. government imposed sanctions against the Wagner Group, alleging that it had “recruited and sent soldiers to fight alongside separatists in eastern Ukraine.” Prigozhin has denied having any links to private military contractors.

1628,Joseph Hincks,"Women across Saudi Arabia, inspired by a teenager who fled the country to seek asylum in Australia amid fears that she would be killed by her family, are demanding further reforms — including an end to the male-dominated guardianship system — or else they will leave the country, they say. The emigration threats began trending on social media in the days since 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun was detained in Thailand on Saturday after escaping her relatives in Kuwait. Stripped of her passport and told she would be deported, Rahaf barricaded herself in a hotel at Thailand’s Suvarnabhumi Airport and broadcast her fears to the world. The U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) intervened, and on Wednesday recommended her for asylum in Australia. The impact of Rahaf’s shrewd use of social media—and the international support she was able to muster—was underscored by a Saudi diplomat’s lament, captured on video and shared by the teenager as she awaited news of her fate. “I wish they could have taken her phone, rather than her passport,” he could be heard saying. In the days since, an Arabic language hashtag that roughly translates as “remove the guardianship system or we’ll all migrate” has trended on social media in Saudi Arabia, a country notorious for cracking down on dissent. “Mark my words, [Rahaf] is going to start a revolution in Saudi Arabia,” Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy said on a video posted to Twitter on Jan. 7, adding that the guardianship system is “the foundation of patriarchy in Saudi Arabia.” Like many other users, Eltahawy appended some of her tweets with the migration threat hashtag. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, known as MBS, has eased some restrictions on women’s behaviors, including allowing women to drive legally for the first time. But Saudi Arabia’s guardianship system, which treats women as legal minors and requires them to get male guardians’ permission to travel, marry and more, remains intact. Human Rights Watch in 2017 called Saudi Arabia’s guardianship system the most “significant impediment to realizing women’s rights in the country.” Rahaf’s case is only the latest to provoke outcry against Saudi Arabia’s guardianship system. In 2017, authorities detained 24-year-old Dina Ali Lasloom in the Philippines en-route to Australia, where she intended to seek asylum. Like Rahaf, Lasloom said her Saudi family had threatened her life and posted a plea for help on social media. Unlike Rahaf, local authorities forced Lasloom back to Riyadh. In June 2017, she was believed to have been moved to a women’s shelter in the Kingdom, the BBC reported. Amnesty International says a shelter center set up in 2016 for women fleeing domestic abuse also serves as detention center, and those who want to leave may need a male relative to agree to their release. But Rahaf’s asylum plea follows the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had been critical of MBS’ regime. While several factors—including Rahaf’s public renunciation of Islam, a crime punishable by death in Saudi Arabia—might have influenced the UNHCR’s expedited ruling of her case, “the more skeptical public relations context for Saudi Arabia post-Khashoggi killing certainly shifted the calculations of a Thai government weighing costs of returning the fleeing teen, as well as the Saudi government’s insistence on her return,” says Kristin Smith Diwan, senior resident Scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington (AGSIW).

1629,Ashley Hoffman,"Meghan Markle’s résumé just got a major boost. Her grandmother-in-law, the Queen, has given her not one, but four shiny new gigs, Kensington Palace announced Thursday morning in a series of tweets. The Duchess of Sussex will assume two royal patronages long held by Queen Elizabeth II herself. The first is the royal patron of the National Theatre, and the second is the royal patron of the Association of Commonwealth Universities. As royal patron of the National Theatre, Markle will pick up the Queen’s mantle by focusing on the arts, a field the former Suits star knows a thing or two about. The National Theatre aims to “make world class theatre that is entertaining, challenging and inspiring for everyone and to be as inclusive, diverse and national as possible,” according to the Palace. The Association of Commonwealth universities network represents higher education across all 53 Commonwealth countries, which squares nicely with the memorable speech she delivered during her whirlwind royal stop in Fiji in October. Her focus: the importance of education, particularly for women. As for her other two official new royal patron roles, it looks like they’re uniquely suited to Markle’s causes, as the Palace puts it.

1630,Justin Worland,"The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China may seem chaotic, with twists and turns to flummox even the most seasoned analysts. But in the year since President Trump announced his first tariffs, his Administration has really pursued only one central strategy: weaken China’s economy in order to force the country to change its trade practices. In some ways, the strategy has worked. China’s economy had already showed signs of slowing before the first tariffs hit, and the face-off with the U.S. has accelerated that trend. Economic growth in China sank in the third quarter of 2018 to its lowest level since 2009, and analysts say that situation could worsen if the trade tensions don’t end. “China is not doing well now,” Trump said on Jan. 4, an assessment experts say is largely right. “It puts us in a very strong position.” But China’s slowdown has also put some of the U.S.’s most important industries in economic limbo. And no company’s trade challenge is more telling than Apple’s. The tech giant, which for a time last year ranked as the world’s most valuable company, cut its revenue projections on Jan. 2, saying that trade tensions had hit its bottom line. The iPhone, which accounts for 60% of Apple sales, is at the heart of the issue. In China, the product is significantly more expensive than those of homegrown competitors like Huawei, and buying the fancy American version ranks low on the list of priorities for many Chinese consumers who are tightening their belts. “We anticipated some challenges,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a letter to investors. “We did not foresee the magnitude.” The company’s stock dropped nearly 10% following the news, and analysts ramped up speculation about whether the company could count on China, its third largest market, to keep its long-term outlook bright. “If that market collapses, it’s going to bring down the global market,” says Ryan Reith, a vice president at the International Data Corp., a market-intelligence firm, who watches Apple. The situation facing Apple underscores a simple reality. In an interconnected world, a range of American companies–from big tech firms to oil producers and everything in between–increasingly look to China to expand their bottom lines. And the more the country’s economy is battered, the more American firms will suffer the consequences. Indeed, the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 3% the day after the Apple news. But not everyone seems all that concerned about the situation. Trump dismissed worries about the effect of trade policy on Apple, saying that the company is “going to be fine” and that he needs to “worry about our country.” While the aggressive approach Trump has taken toward China may be clumsy, observers say it has brought a measure of force to negotiations. Talks between midlevel negotiators from both countries wrapped up on Jan. 9 with signs of optimism–including a celebratory Trump tweet before the round of negotiations had even concluded.",The China Trade War Comes Home,"January 10, 2019"

In terrifying footage captured by the dashcam of the driver directly behind the car involved in the incident, a massive road sign suspended over Melbourne’s Tullamarine Freeway can be seen caving in the roof of the vehicle of 53-year-old Nella Lettieri, according to 9NEWS.

1633,Eli Meixler,"Four days ago, 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun fled the watchful gaze of her family and boarded a flight to Thailand on a quest to seek asylum. After she was detained by the Thai authorities, the Saudi teen barricaded herself in a hotel room, evaded deportation and wielded social media to publicize her fears that her life was in danger. Unfolding in live time on Twitter, Alqunun’s plight has served as a high stakes parable of the world’s opaque and often-dysfunctional refugee system. The teenage runaway’s fight for freedom has secured unlikely, global support. It also exposed the geopolitical considerations at play when countries like Thailand must balance obligations to harbor the world’s helpless with the realities of power politics.  For now, Alqunun appears to be safe and to have achieved an interim victory: the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has reportedly recommended her for resettlement in Australia, which is now assessing her claim. As the world waits for the resolution of her case, Thailand’s role as an unreliable host for refugees has come into sharp relief. A regional crossroads for labor and migration, Thailand houses some 106,000 refugees and asylum seekers, according to figures from UNHCR. While the vast majority of this population hails from neighboring, restive Myanmar, some 7,000 of these refugees came from 45 countries. This is in no small part because Thailand offers visa-free entry to dozens of passports, making it an accessible first port of call for people who need an urgent escape from their homeland, refugee advocates told TIME. Yet because Thailand has not ratified the U.N.’s 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol, the main statues defining protections for refugees, Thai law provides little protection or respite to the vulnerable masses. Refugees are often treated as “illegal immigrants,” and struggle to find housing, work and education. Thailand has “rapidly lost its reputation for being a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers,” Andrea Giorgetta, Asia director for the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), told TIME. Instead, the Kingdom has become known for its susceptibility to pressure from global powers to return high-profile refugees, bowing either to economic imperatives or promises “to reciprocate the favor and…send back Thai political exiles,” Giorgetta says. Some who sought a safe haven on Thai soil have suffered refoulement — forcible return to places where they may face persecution — a violation of customary international law. In 2015, Thailand forcibly returned some 100 Uighur Muslims to China, where the group is persecuted, tortured and arbitrarily detained. Last Nov., Thailand detained a former Bahraini soccer player granted refugee status in Australia while he was on his honeymoon. Pakistani religious minorities, Turkish and Cambodian dissidents, and Chinese activists have also been refouled from Thailand, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).",Saudi Runaway's Plight Puts Thailand's Record of Failing Asylum Seekers in the Spotlight,"January 9, 2019"

1635,Casey Quackenbush,"A Japanese tabloid has apologized after it caused outcry by ranking universities on how easily men can acquire the female students and coerce them into having sex, BBC reports. In a December 25 issue, the weekly magazine Spa! ran an article about gyaranomi, drinking parties where men reportedly pay women to attend. The article claimed these parties are popular with female college students and interviewed the developer of an app that helps men scout out women to come to the parties. It also listed five universities where girls are “easily available” and suggested ways men can “coax” the students into having sex, according to BBC. The magazine’s article provoked outrage online. One woman launched a change.org petition calling for the article to be retracted and accused the publication of “sexualizing, objectifying and disrespecting women.” Her campaign had garnered almost 40,000 signatures as of Tuesday night. In response to the criticism, the magazine backtracked over its wording. “We would like to apologize for using sensational language to appeal to readers about how they can become intimate with women and for creating a ranking… with real university names… that resulted in a feature that may have offended readers,” the magazine said in a statement reported by BBC. “On issues that involve sex, we will do what we can as a magazine to listen to various opinions,” it added. Kazuna Yamamoto, who launched the online petition, told Japanese media she was pleased to see her objections to the tabloid article and others like it were being taken seriously. “I would like to fight so that especially on public articles such as this one, sexualizing, objectifying and disrespecting women would stop,” her petition said, according to BBC’s translation. “We demand Shuukan Spa to take this article back and apologize, and promise to not use objectifying words to talk about women.” Sexism runs deep in Japan, where the #MeToo movement has been slow to gain traction. The country ranks 110 out of 144 on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index, and last year, a government investigation found medical schools were systemically rigging exam scores to limit female admissions.",A Japanese Magazine Apologized for Ranking Universities by How Easily the Women Are Coaxed Into Sex,"January 9, 2019"

The 20-year-old man from the western state of Hesse, who lives at home with his parents and calls himself ‘G0d’ on Twitter, confessed to releasing the information in early December, though news of the leak only became public on Jan. 3. The cache of documents, which affected Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as representatives of all the main parliamentary groups except the right-wing AfD, includes personal phone numbers and addresses, internal party documents and credit card details, according to Germany’s federal criminal police (BKA). Close to 1,000 people, including journalists and other public figures, were also targeted. “In the course of the interrogation, the suspect confessed to acting alone in spying and illegally publishing the data,” Georg Ungefuk, a prosecutor specialising in cyber-crime, told a press conference. “Regarding his motivation, the suspect said that he was angry with the public statements of the targeted politicians, journalists and public personalities.” Documents were published online in the style of an advent calendar, with new information released daily throughout December from the @_0rbit Twitter account, which was followed by 18,000 people before it was deleted earlier in January. German authorities are under fire for failing to spot the information sooner; the German Green party leader, Robert Habeck, who had personal chats with family members leaked, and has since deleted his Twitter and Facebook accounts, according to the BBC.     Contact us at editors@time.com.",Man Arrested In Connection With German Data Breach,"January 8, 2019"
1637,Casey Quackenbush,"Some 200 years after their population was decimated by feral pigs, iguanas are being reintroduced to an island in the Galapagos archipelago, Agence France-Presse reports. Conservationists have released 1,436 Galapagos land iguanas onto Santiago Island, authorities said on Monday. The lizard species’ last recorded sighting there was made by British naturalist Charles Darwin in 1835. “Almost two centuries later, this ecosystem will once again count on this species through the restoration initiative,” the park authority said in a statement. The initiative also aims to protect the existing population of an estimated 5,000 iguanas on the nearby North Seymour Island, AFP reports. The herbivorous iguanas once served a vital role on Santiago Island helping to disperse seeds in areas without vegetation. But the species became extinct after the introduction of invasive predators, such as the feral pig, said Jorge Carrión, director of the Galapagos National Park. Feral pigs were eradicated from the island in 2001 in a separate project. A volcanic archipelago 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, the Galapagos are renowned for their unique biodiversity as well as their fragile ecosystem. It was on this archipelago that Darwin made observations that contributed to his theory of evolution. The region is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

1638,Karen Leigh / Bloomberg,"Diplomats from 12 countries with large Muslim populations visited Xinjiang, after months of silence by governments across the Islamic world in the face of China’s crackdown on minority Muslim Uighurs in its far western region. Envoys from Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Thailand, and Kuwait visited the region from Dec. 28 to 30, China’s official Xinhua News Agency said Monday. The visit comes as increasing skepticism over Beijing’s human rights record — namely its campaign against the Uighurs — threatens its global ambitions. Calls have grown in the West to pressure President Xi Jinping’s government to stop the alleged human-rights abuses against the Uighurs. U.S. politicians have proposed freezing the travel and assets of top Chinese officials including Xinjiang Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo. But it has so far escaped serious criticism from officials in the Islamic world, leading U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo to blast Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for not speaking out. “The dire human rights situation inside China and the continued downward trajectory, by virtually every measure” have continued since Xi came to power, a U.S. congressional report said in October. Xinhua’s report comes days after China passed a five-year work plan to sinicize Islam at a summit with Chinese Islamic associations. “They agreed to guide Islam to be compatible with socialism and implement measures to sinicize the religion,” the state-run Global Times newspaper said. In Xinjiang’s Hetian district last month, the diplomats visited one of what the Chinese government calls vocational skills centers — but which the United Nations and rights groups say are “re-education camps” interning as many as one million Muslims. At the Moyu County Vocational Skills Education and Training Center, “students are studying the national language, national musical instruments, calligraphy and painting, legal knowledge and various employment skills in the classroom,” Xinhua said. “The envoys asked the students about their study and life in detail, and watched the performances of the students.” “Xinjiang is an open place,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a briefing in Beijing on Monday. But he cautioned those who would visit to “abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and refrain from interfering in others’ internal affairs or undermining others’ sovereignty.”",China Takes Diplomats to Tour 'Re-Education Camps' as Pressure Builds Over Mass Detention of Uighurs,"January 8, 2019"
1639,Casey Quackenbush,"Forty years ago, Pol Pot’s brutal regime in Cambodia fell from power — but it left behind lasting scars. The Khmer Rouge, a hardline-communist command, terrorized the Southeast Asian country from 1975 to 1979, killing between 1.7 million to 3 million people. In the regime’s pursuit of a classless agrarian society, many were sent to labor camps, prisons and killing fields across the nation, where they died of torture, disease and starvation. It wasn’t until Jan. 7, 1979, that a Vietnam-backed invasion forced the Khmer Rouge to retreat into the jungle. Four decades on, Cambodia, a developing nation of about 16 million people, is still grappling with its past — not just the tragedy beyond conception that was official Khmer Rouge rule, but also the civil war that followed and continued through the early 1990s. In November, a U.N. tribunal delivered a historic ruling, convicting two of the regime’s last surviving leaders of genocide. That significant verdict underscored the lingering legacy of the genocidal regime on Cambodian society today. On the 40th anniversary of the fall of the Khmer Rouge, here’s what to know about one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century and how it still shapes modern Cambodia. In April 1975, the Khmer Rouge overtook Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, toppling a U.S.-backed, right-wing government. The insurgents were driven by Marxist ideology and their army was led by a man called Pol Pot, who had earlier lived in France and became a member of the communist party there. Upon returning to his homeland, he quickly rose up the ranks of the country’s clandestine communist movement. When the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975 (known in the country as Year Zero), millions were immediately sent to work in labor camps in the countryside, on the idea that this was a step toward the creation of an agrarian utopia. Mass killings primarily targeted the middle class and intellectuals — such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, artists and students — as well as ethnic Vietnamese and Cham Muslims. Private property, money, religion and traditional culture were abolished, and the country became known as Democratic Kampuchea. The death toll during that period wiped out up to one fifth of Cambodia’s population at the time.

What’s wrong with this picture? Nothing … yet. The most serious geopolitical risks (a cyber confrontation with Russia, war with Iran, implosion in Europe, a true U.S.-China trade war) are more plausible than they’ve been, but none are particularly likely to play out in 2019. We are heading for serious longer-term trouble down the road, however. That’s the first of Eurasia Group’s Top 10 risks this year. World leaders are so busy dealing with local crises that they’re ignoring much bigger problems down the road. 2019 is the year “bad seeds” are being planted that will eventually threaten the entire global order. Examples? Political institutions across the world’s advanced democracies, the transatlantic alliance, NATO, the European Union, the G20, the World Trade Organization, U.S.-China, Russia and the West… none of these will explode this year, but every one of them is headed in the wrong direction. The US-China relationship is broken, and even a truce in the trade war won’t fix it. Trust between the two sides is almost gone. Democrats and Republicans agree that China poses threats. The Chinese believe they can’t afford to back down. Both sides will work to make themselves less vulnerable to the other by reducing the connections that have so far bound them together. Hackers build new skills, our digital dependency deepens, and there are still no realistic rules of the road to help avoid cyber-conflict. It’s hard to halt an attack. You can’t tell whether it’s a government, a thief, a terrorist or anarchist who’s shooting at you. Your cyber-defenses fast become obsolete. And 2019 will be the year the U.S. government goes on offense. The results are tough to predict. The European Union will hold parliamentary elections in May, and populists will win more seats than ever before. They’ll also win a bigger role in the European Commission and European Council, helping them challenge current European policy on migration, trade, and enforcement of E.U. rules inside member states. Populists will also gain ground this year inside France and Italy—the E.U.’s third and fourth largest economies. Their majority in the House gives Democrats real power for the first time since Donald Trump became president, and though he’s not likely to be removed from office, infighting in Washington will be especially intense in 2019.

Zerpa also reportedly told a Miami-based broadcaster in an interview Sunday that he is prepared to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors investigating corruption and human rights violations in the South American country. “I’ve decided to leave Venezuela to disavow the government of Nicolas Maduro,” Zerpa said in the interview with EVTV, according to Reuters. “I believe [Maduro] does not deserve a second chance because the election he supposedly won was not free and competitive.” Venezuela’s Supreme Court confirmed that Zerpa had left Venezuela, and said that he is currently under investigation for allegedly sexually harassing women in his office. News of Zerpa’s departure came a day after members of Venezuela’s opposition-controlled but powerless National Assembly were sworn into office.

1644,Eli Meixler,"A Saudi Arabian woman who fled her family to seek asylum has temporarily avoided deportation against her will from Thailand to Kuwait, where she fears domestic violence and possibly death after she renounced Islam. Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, was stopped in Thailand’s Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok on Jan. 5 while attempting to fly to Australia after originally departing from Kuwait. She barricaded herself for hours in an airport hotel, fearing she would be put on a plane home immediately. But the Thai government and the U.N.’s refugee agency (UNHCR) confirmed after a long period of uncertainty that she would be given time to apply for asylum. A UNHCR spokesperson confirmed to TIME on Monday that Alqunun had “left the airport to a safe place in the city,” where UNHCR staff will continue to interview her after she has rested. Alqunun claimed to have a visa for Australia and planned to apply for asylum there, according to the Associated Press. But she reportedly had her passport confiscated by a representative from Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Thailand. In a statement, the Saudi embassy denied seizing Alqunun’s passport and said she was detained because she did not have a return ticket, the BBC reports. In a series of videos and more than 100 tweets beginning late on Jan. 6, Alqunun implored the UNHCR and countries including Australia the U.S., Canada and the U.K for assistance. A Change.org petition supporting her garnered thousands of signatures in just a few hours, and the German ambassador to Thailand expressed “great concern.” Alqunun says she has previously faced domestic abuse by male family members including beatings and death threats. She also said she was once detained in a bedroom for six months after she cut her hair, according to Human Rights Watch. “She’s very afraid,” Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson told TIME by phone on Monday, before the Thai government confirmed Alqunun would be allowed more time in the country. “It’s very clear if she’s sent back, her family will kill her.”","'If She’s Sent Back, Her Family Will Kill Her.'

1645,Eli Meixler,"Women in Saudi Arabia will be informed by text message that their marriages have ended under a new regulation aimed at ending the practice of secret divorce, whereby men in the kingdom could unilaterally decide to separate without informing their wives. The new measure was approved by the country’s justice ministry on Sunday, Agence France-Presse reports citing local media. “Women… will be notified of any changes to their marital status via text message,” the justice ministry said in a statement run on the Saudi state-operated Al-Ekhbariya news channel. The report added that women could access “documents related to the termination of their marriage contracts” on the ministry’s website. Under previous statutes, Saudi men could trigger a divorce unilaterally without telling their wives, and women did not need to appear in court for divorces to be issued, according to a 2016 Human Rights Watch report on the country’s male guardianship system. Suad Abu-Dayyeh, Middle East and North Africa consultant for gender rights group Equality Now, called the new measure “a step in the right direction.” “In most Arab countries, men can just divorce their wives,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation . “At least women will know whether they are divorced or not.” The measure follows a series of gender liberalization efforts last year under de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has sought to increase women’s participation in the conservative kingdom’s workforce.

1646,William Horobin / Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) — After nearly two months of violent protests and billions of euros in tax cuts to try to restore calm across France, Emmanuel Macron’s government is counting on a vast, potentially risky public debate to keep his presidency on track. Ministers used broadcast appearances Sunday to promote Macron’s plan for three months of discussions in town halls and online about ecology, taxes, citizenship and democracy, and the organization of public services. The debate will be the foundation for new measures and draft laws introduced as early as April. “I believe deeply that the big debate is the best way to bring French people back together and bring them back to the negotiating table,’’ Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in an interview on Europe1. Macron’s debates are a risky exercise that will likely force the government to strike a delicate balance. If he is seen ignoring the wishes of people, it could stoke further anger. But Macron is also determined to continue with his major reforms and not undo what he’s achieved so far. The process comes at a crucial moment in Macron’s five-year term, which he began with a flurry of unpopular economic overhauls. The Yellow Vest protests over taxes and other issues have tested his resolve to keep up the pace of reform and already forced the French leader into U-turns on tax policies that will prove costly for public finances. The next reforms Macron penciled in include overhauls of the country’s pension and unemployment services, as well as changes in the state bureaucracy and public services. “We moved fast and today we can see that we should take more time,’’ Labor Minister Muriel Penicaud said on BFM TV. “Our citizens don’t just want us to do things for them, they want us to do things with them.’’ About 50,000 people took to the streets across France Saturday for the eighth week of the so-called Yellow Vest protests. While the demonstrators were mainly peaceful, a small group smashed the entrance to the ministry of government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux.",France's Macron Gambles on Public Debate to Restore National Calm Amid Yellow Vest Protests,"January 6, 2019"
1647,Tara Law,"U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan is likely to face isolation, cold showers and intense interrogations in the Russian prison where he is being held on spying charges, according to experts and accounts from people who survived detention there. Lefortovo Prison in Moscow, where Whelan is being held, has a long, violent history. During Joseph Stalin’s “Great Terror,” most political prisoners taken there were shot or tortured to death, according to Russian human rights nonprofit International Center Memorial.  Founded in 1883 by Tsar Alexander III, the prison passed through generations of Russian and Soviet security officials – from the NKVD (the Interior Ministry in the early Soviet Union), to the KGB and finally the contemporary Federal Security Service (FSB). Lefortovo has historically housed some of the Soviet Union and Russia’s most prominent political prisoners and dissidents, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who immortalized the Soviet labor camp system in the novel Gulag Archipelago. More recently, human rights activists have reported torture and physical abuse in Russian prisons. However, foreigners like Whelan have faced conditions designed to wear them down psychologically, Anne Applebaum, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Gulag: A History, tells TIME. The prison’s most famous recent prisoners have included a Norwegian man accused of spying and Ukrainian sailors seized in November in the strait between mainland Russia and Crimea. Whelan, 48, a corporate security expert from Michigan, was in Russia for a wedding when he was arrested Dec. 28 by Russian authorities, his family said. On Wednesday, American consular officials were granted access to Whelan for the first time. A foreigner accused of spying would likely be held in solitary confinement, Applebaum says. Historically, Soviet and Russian prisons have used isolation as a way to make prisoners more susceptible to interrogation – along with darkness or bright lights, insufficient food or blankets and controlled access to bathrooms and showers, Applebaum says. Applebaum notes that she has not visited Russian prisons since the late 90s, but says that conditions in Russian prisons have remained markedly consistent. Physically, many Russian prisons still look the same as they did in the late 1940s and 1950s – and are controlled by many of the same people who ran them under the Soviet Union.","The Long, Violent History of the Russian Prison Where the American Accused Spy Is Being Held","January 4, 2019"
1648,Billy Perrigo,"China hit back on Friday against a new U.S. advisory that warns citizens to “exercise increased caution” there when traveling. Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said the advice “cannot stand up to scrutiny,” according to the Associated Press. The Jan. 3 travel advisory, issued by the State Department, warned of the “arbitrary enforcement of local laws” and “special restrictions” on people with dual U.S. and Chinese citizenship. It came days before talks on the U.S.-China trade war were set to start. The advisory also warned of the “coercive” practice of exit bans, when authorities prevent people from leaving China. The State Department said these practices have been used to force people to cooperate with Chinese government investigations. Lu, the Chinese spokesman, said that 2.3 million Americans visited China between January and November last year, adding, “I think this figure speaks volumes for the security condition in China.” However the Chinese government has come under the spotlight for several cases in the last year in which American citizens have been prevented from leaving the country. Cynthia and Victor Liu, the children of a former executive at a Chinese state-owned bank who is accused of fraud, were prevented from leaving China last year despite being American citizens.

1650,Ian Bremmer,"After President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement two weeks ago that the U.S. would withdraw the remaining 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria imminently (“They’re all coming back and they’re coming back now”), this week the Trump administration announced that the withdrawal would instead take place over the course of four months rather than the originally quoted 30 days by administration officials. Among a series of questionable foreign policy decisions over Trump’s tenure, the abrupt decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria has proved to be one of the most explosive, drawing rebukes across the political spectrum and almost uniformly from the military establishment. Both Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to counter ISIS, resigned as a result. Thus far, Trump has shown himself committed to keeping his campaign promise to bring home US troops from the Middle East. But his decision to relent on the timing shows he’s beginning to understand the full impact of his snap decision to leave Syria to every other major power wanting a piece of it. In terms of actual military developments, not that much. The U.S. presence of 2,000 troops in the country was marginal, and Syria’s outcome was always going to be determined by those foreign powers with the most direct interests and resources invested over there—namely Turkey, Russia and Iran. That said, it does bring the future into sharper relief. Syrian President Bashar Assad essentially wins the Syrian civil war outright; Turkey becomes more militarily aggressive but improves its relationship with Washington by vowing to clean up the ISIS remnants in the country; the Kurds (mortal enemies of the Turks and the Americans’ most effective anti-ISIS ally in the country) get slammed once again; Iran gets more room to operate in Syria without U.S. forces breathing down its neck; Russia declares victory by having propped up Assad; Israel gets more nervous without U.S. troops acting as a buffer in neighboring Syria; ISIS gets one less enemy to worry about. Syria, meanwhile, continues to be a geopolitical mess as various actors continue to pursue their own interests in what’s effectively a failed state. On top of all that, America’s reputation as a dependable military partner and a military difference-maker takes yet another hit. At its height, ISIS had more than 4,500 foreign fighters from Western countries amongst its ranks, including more than 250 Americans, according to the Heritage Foundation. Which means that just because ISIS is defeated in Iraq and Syria (it currently controls less than 2 percent of the territory it once did) doesn’t mean the threat from ISIS vanishes along with it. For Trump, withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria is predicated on Turkey being able to wrap up the fight against ISIS.

Now, after a GoFundMe campaign by her family raised over $76,000, she will be heading home to Virginia following her stint teaching kids English in Thailand. Bradner was diagnosed with Guillain Barré Syndrome, a rare disease that causes people’s immune system to attack their nerves and can cause paralysis lasting months or even years. “Just the day before, she started feeling weak and it became hard for her to walk,” her sister, Pierce, wrote on GoFundMe. “What started as muscle weakness in her abdomen, worsened into paralysis over the course of two days.” Pierce started the fundraiser after Caroline’s travel insurance provider refused to pay for the cost of her flight back, which would require medical assistance and special seating. But after the fundraiser attracted attention on social media, the travel insurance provider said it would pay for the flights, according to Pierce. (She did not name the provider.) The Bradner family said that the money raised would go toward Caroline’s rehabilitation and treatment in the U.S., and that any leftover money would be donated to GBS/CIDP Foundation International, which provides support for sufferers of the syndrome. Guillain Barré Syndrome affects roughly one in 100,000 people each year.

1652,Lina Khatib,"President Donald Trump’s sudden announcement in December that the U.S. would withdraw troops from Syria came at a time when Washington seemed to finally be developing a strategy to tackle the Syrian conflict that went beyond prioritizing fighting ISIS. It was not Syria that was the focus of this new strategy; it was Iran. While former President Barack Obama had pursued a softer approach to Iran that used the nuclear deal as a means of warding off potential Iranian threat to Israel and to nudge Iran towards playing by international rules, Trump views Iran as a destabilizing source in the Middle East. Until he made the announcement about the US withdrawal from Syria, Trump had cast Syria as one of Iran’s venues for regional destabilization. His appointment of Ambassador James Jeffrey — who under George W. Bush had served as deputy national security advisor with a special focus on Iran — in August 2018 as Syria Special Envoy sparked the design of a U.S. strategy for Syria that foregrounded Iran. Two key components of this strategy — masterminded by Jeffrey — are increasing economic pressure on Iran to force it to roll back its activities in the region, and keeping American troops in Syria to limit both Iran’s access to oil fields in northeast Syria and its activities on the strategically important neighboring border with Iraq. The withdrawal announcement put a stick in that wheel. A hasty withdrawal would empower Iran not just in Syria but also more widely. Trump justified the announcement as delivering his election campaign promise to bring back troops from Syria. But implementing this promise before a resolution to the Syrian conflict is reached is akin to shooting oneself in the foot. Trump’s declaration on Jan. 2 that Iran “can do what they want in Syria” shows that he has come to regard Iran’s actions in Syria as distinct from its other regional activities. Yet, an imminent U.S. withdrawal from Syria would end up contradicting another of Trump’s very own campaign promises, which is to stand up to Iran’s influence in the Middle East. After a meeting with Senator Lindsey Graham, Trump appeared to backtrack on the timing of the withdrawal, adding on Jan. 2, that the withdrawal would actually happen “over a period of time.” Graham and Trump may not see eye to eye on a number of issues — Saudi Arabia being one — but they are aligned on wanting to weaken Iran’s regional influence. Graham was one of the vocal opponents to the nuclear deal and strongly supported Trump’s decision to withdraw from it. In May 2018, Graham’s statement that “Iran has used the funds provided by the sanctions relief to enhance their military capability and create havoc throughout the Middle East” could have been taken from the Trump election campaign book. But any progress on the timing of the withdrawal as a result of the meeting with Senator Graham would be annulled by Trump’s isolating Syria from the wider regional context. The area in northeast Syria where U.S. troops in Syria are deployed is highly coveted by Iran. It is rich in oil and is near the border with Iraq through which Iran has been sending into Syria its allied Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) militias under the pretext of fighting ISIS. It is in Iran’s interest for the Syrian-Iraqi border to be porous. The presence of American troops in the area limits these militias’ freedom of movement. It also blocks Iran’s access to the area’s oil fields. As things currently stand in Syria, were the U.S. to withdraw from the north-east, Iran will be able to use the area’s oil revenue to offset some of the economic losses it is incurring following the American reinstatement of sanctions after Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal. Some see in Trump’s announcement an expectation that Russia and the Bashar Assad regime would eventually veer away from Iran. This expectation is based on Russia’s growing competition with Iran over influence in Syria and the pro-Assad camp’s preference for Russia over Iran because Russia channels its influence through strengthening state institutions in Syria, in contrast to Iran’s approach to achieving influence through keeping Syrian state institutions weak. But neither Russia nor the Assad regime is able to completely reign in Iran’s activities in Syria. Their partnership with Iran can loosen in the long run if pressure on Iran in Syria increases and it becomes more of a liability than an asset for its two current allies. An imminent U.S. withdrawal, however, would give Iran time and space to consolidate its presence and access to resources and eventually make it more difficult for Russia and Assad to detangle Syria from Iran. This would be bad news for Israel’s security.",Trump's Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Syria Will Boost Iran's Fortunes,"January 4, 2019"

1654,Jeffrey Kluger,"There is a perfectly wonderful map on a playful Facebook cartography page. It shows all of the countries in the world, with a two-color key underneath. Red indicates “countries with moon on the flag.” There are thirteen of them. Blue indicates “countries with flag on the moon.” There is only one: the United States. It’s hard not to get a patriotic thrill from that—even if it was never technically true. The U.S. is certainly the first—and so far the only—country whose flags on the moon were planted by human hands. But the Soviet Union was the first to get its emblem onto the lunar surface at all, when the Lunik 2 impactor crashed on the moon in 1959, carrying a coin emblazoned with the Soviet flag. It took the U.S. until 1964 to duplicate that feat, and then-Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev could not resist tweaking the behind-the-curve Americans as they struggled to catch up. “The Soviet pennant on the moon has been awaiting an American pennant for a long time,” he said to much laughter. “It is starting to become lonesome.” Ultimately, the Soviet pennant had plenty of company—more than it may have wanted. Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. managed to soft-land spacecraft on the moon, but the U.S. bested that with its astronauts. In 2008, India joined the metal-on-the-moon club, sending an impactor to the surface from its Chandrayaan-1 orbiter. China followed in 2013 with its soft-landed Chang’e-3 lander and rover. And now, in the first week of a new year, Beijing pulled off a true space first, setting its Chang’e-4 lander and rover on the far side of the moon—a place no machine had ever touched and no camera had ever photographed up close. That accomplishment took some doing, requiring that a communications relay satellite—wonderfully named Queqiao, or Magpie Bridge—be placed in lunar orbit first, since no direct communication with Earth is possible through the intervening bulk of the moon itself. It is hard to overstate the significance of the mission, both for China’s reputation as a space power and for the advancement of exploration itself. But that didn’t stop at least one academic from trying. “This space mission shows that China has reached the advanced world-class level in deep space exploration,” Zhua Menghua, a professor of science and technology at Macau University, told The New York Times. “We Chinese people have done something that the Americans have dared not try.” America has indeed never landed on the far side of the moon, but lack of daring was hardly the reason—a claim that’s especially hard to sustain in the same week NASA’s New Horizons probe reconnoitered Ultima Thule, which, at four billion miles away, is the farthest object a spacecraft from Earth has ever visited. The moon, as of the day Chang’e-4 landed, is about 246,400 miles away, or .00616% of New Horizon’s current distance. Still, China can strut and China should strut and like it or not, we should celebrate what they’ve done. The U.S. wasn’t kidding when it sent the Apollo 11 crew to the moon for the first lunar landing with a plaque that read, in part, “We came in peace for all mankind.” Yes, the crew planted an American flag, and yes, the astronauts had that same flag on the shoulders of their spacesuits. But the world took the U.S. at its word and hailed the American achievement as what it was—a human achievement.",Why You Should Be Happy About China's Historic Moon Landing,"January 3, 2019"
1655,Billy Perrigo,"Candidates and voters around the world are preparing for elections scheduled for 2019. Here are five to watch: When President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria seeks a second four-year term in February, he will have to reckon with a poor economic record and the persistent threat of the extremist group Boko Haram, which continues to terrorize the north of the country. With nearly 50% of Nigerians now online, Buhari also faces a new obstacle in the form of viral misinformation, including widespread allegations he is really dead and has been replaced by a clone from Sudan. In December, Buhari stood up in front of an audience and rejected that theory. In April or May, more than 800 million citizens of the world’s largest democracy will cast their votes in the biggest challenge faced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi since he won a landslide victory in 2014. His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has polled well for much of its four-year term, but in December suffered three unexpected losses in state elections. Those results could signal a reversal of fortune for opposition parties including the Indian National Congress party, which hopes to capitalize on discontent over rising prices and unease over violence perpetrated in the name of Hindu nationalism. An ongoing women’s rights controversy could also be troubling for the BJP, who have supported officials at a Hindu temple who are arguing women of “menstruating age” should not be allowed to access the Sabarimala Temple in the state of Kerala because they are “unclean.” Nevertheless, the coalition led by Modi still comes first in most opinion polls. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will seek a fifth term in office in parliamentary elections scheduled for April 9, which were called early last month after his coalition narrowly avoided collapse. If the polls, which his Likud party is currently leading, are correct, he will return to power on a path to become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister ever, overtaking the state’s founder David Ben-Gurion in July. Critics say Netanyahu leads one of the most right-wing governments Israel has ever seen. And human rights groups have slammed Netanyahu’s hardline stance in support of Israeli soldiers who periodically clash with Palestinian protesters, in incidents that Amnesty International has called “unlawful.” Neither the prime minister’s stance on that, nor the recent recommendation by police that he be tried for bribery and fraud, seem to have dented his ratings. And the dissolution on Jan. 1 of the left-wing opposition alliance that would have challenged him in the election might prove also to his advantage. However, his party currently only controls a quarter of the 120 seats in Israel’s parliament, which means it’s possible he may be forced to assemble a more moderate coalition after the vote. Five years after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Ukrainians will decide whether to keep or replace their embattled, anti-Russian President, Petro Poroshenko. His Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, likely had the vote on his mind when Russia fired on Ukrainian boats in shared waters in November, taking 24 sailors hostage. In the wake of that escalation, Poroshenko pointedly declared that the March vote, which he may lose to a poll-leading challenger who is similarly anti-Russian, would not be postponed. The election will take place as Ukraine’s economy suffers, partially because of an economic blockade of key Ukrainian ports by Russian boats. In May, people across the E.U. will vote for their representatives in the European parliament. The election is traditionally seen as an opportunity for protest voting, but its consequences are real. Populist, anti-E.U. parties have made gains in Germany, Austria, Italy, Poland and elsewhere since the last E.U.-wide elections in 2014, and immigration is the top concern in 22 of the 27 countries voting, according to a recent survey. That means populists could find themselves with increased power at the heart of Europe, just as the E.U. finds itself weakest. ­ Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com.",5 Elections to Watch in 2019,"January 3, 2019"
1656,George Steer,"The British Ministry of Defense has confirmed that the “military capability” it had deployed to prevent illegal drone flights at Gatwick airport has been withdrawn. “The Armed Forces stand ever-ready to assist should a request for support be received,” the MoD added in a statement. Gatwick was brought to a virtual standstill between the 19th and 21st of December when several drones were spotted above the airfield. Roughly 1,000 flights were suspended and tens of thousands of passengers were affected while police searched for the drones’ pilots. The U.K.’s aviation minister said that the culprits could face up to five years behind bars if caught and convicted. A Gatwick spokesperson insisted the airport would be just as well protected against drones now that the military had left: “We have invested several million pounds to ensure that we are equipped to the level of security that was provided by the armed forces. We can’t go into any more detail about what that equipment is, but a range of measures are in place”. But according to the Associated Press, an Israeli technology company has said its anti-drone system has drawn major interest in the weeks since the incident at Gatwick. Skylock, the company that manufactures the technology, is one of many now specializing in detecting and downing intruder drones by “jamming” them, or disrupting their frequencies. Product manager Asaf Lebovitz said the company, which emerged to target militant drone use in Syria, has shifted focus to commercial applications and has been approached by airports in North America and Europe. Noam Milstein, drone operations chief for Israel’s Civil Aviation Authority, said such systems are “obviously becoming crucial to prevent drone incursions from those who don’t care about the regulations in place.” Chief Constable Giles York of Sussex Police said last week that police had received 115 reports of sightings in the area, including 93 that had been confirmed as coming from “credible people” including a pilot and airport staff. But the culprits remain at large. Two people – Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk – were arrested on Dec. 23, but later released without charge. The couple told Sky News they felt “completely violated” by the subsequent intrusion into their lives. The following day, a senior Sussex police officer added to the state of confusion when he suggested that there might not have ever been any drones over Gatwick at all – though his comments were later dismissed as a “miscommunication”.",British Army Withdraws From Gatwick Airport After Drone Scare,"January 3, 2019"
1658,Naina Bajekal/Copenhagen,"Holly Ryan knows the biological father of her children has two sisters, is a Coldplay fan, and doesn’t like eating chicken in pasta dishes. She knows his mother is a nurse and his father is a policeman, and that his aunt has green eyes and curly hair. She even has a photo of him as a child, and an audio recording of his voice. But Ryan, 41, doesn’t know his name and has never met him. More than six years ago, she decided she wanted to start a family. “Once you commit to trying to get pregnant, it becomes a kind of obsession,” says Ryan, the director of a talent agency for TV directors, producers and editors. “As a single, gay woman, I knew in order to get from A to B, I had to be strategic about the quickest and least murky route, which I concluded was online shopping for a sperm donor.” Like thousands of women in Europe each year, Ryan turned to Denmark. Today, the Nordic country of 5.7 million people has the greatest proportion of babies born through assisted reproductive technology (ART) — while approximately 1.7% of all infants born in the U.S. are conceived using ART, an estimated 8 to 10% of Danish babies are born thanks to these techniques — but it’s not just the residents who benefit from its treatment options, notably its booming sperm industry. With some of the world’s most liberal legislation on fertility treatment, as well as a less stigmatized culture around the procedures, Denmark has become an attractive destination for women from other countries as well.  “In terms of fertility, people in Denmark are just more open-minded and less judgmental,” Ryan says.  If not for the women wearing white lab coats, StorkKlinik, a private fertility clinic in central Copenhagen, would feel more like a boutique hotel than a medical facility. The clinic is decorated with stylish Scandinavian furniture, soft lighting, and leafy green plants. Contemporary art covers the walls — even in the treatment rooms, where extra-wide medical beds (without stirrups) allow couples to lie and cuddle together so that the insemination procedure feels less clinical. As in most countries, the vast majority of people using ART in Denmark are heterosexual couples. But StorkKlinik, founded in 1999 by the aptly named Nina Stork, has always focused on helping single and lesbian women become parents, groups that still make up at least half of their patients. At that clinic, patients coming from abroad — mostly from Sweden, Germany, Norway, France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom — received more than 90% of the 3,930 in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatments in 2017. Ryan was one of them. After giving birth to her first son, Johan, in 2014 after IUI treatment at StorkKlinik, she returned a few years later to get pregnant again. She is now due to deliver her second child in early 2019. For both pregnancies, she used the same sperm donor, who had registered as open — meaning a child can contact the clinic or sperm bank at the age of 18 and be informed of their biological father’s identity. “I always knew I wanted to have two kids and I thought hopefully I’ll be married,” Ryan says. “But I also said to myself even if I didn’t meet Mrs. Right, I’d just forge on and have another child by myself.” StorkKlinik moved to its current location eight years ago, but it has long occupied an important place in Denmark’s history of fertility treatment. In 1996, the Danish Parliament passed a law making it illegal for doctors to help lesbian and single women get pregnant via ART. Stork, a midwife who had previously undergone IUI and IVF with her partner Inger, had not gotten pregnant before the law went into effect in 1997. But she discovered a loophole: midwives could treat these women, even if doctors couldn’t. In 1999, she set up the Stork fertility clinic. Other midwives as well as people in related medical fields followed suit, opening their own private clinics offering IUI.",Why So Many Women Travel to Denmark for Fertility Treatments,"January 3, 2019"
1659,Aryn Baker,"When Aya, a 23-year-old Syrian refugee living in the west German town of Xanten, came home from her language lessons one afternoon in October, the house was in disarray. A frantic search revealed that her 2-year-old son’s stroller was missing, along with their passports and IDs. She tried her husband; his phone was off. A few hours later Aya received a telephone call from Syria. “Go pack your bags,” her husband’s brother told her. “Mohammad is taking Joud to Syria, and he wants you to go with them.” The instructions were simple. If she wanted to be with her son, she would have to retrace the path she and her husband had taken more than three years ago, when they sought refuge in Europe. Instead, Aya called the police. Her son, after all, had been born in Germany. Her time in the country had taught her that she had rights. But it was too late. The police said her husband and son had taken a plane to Greece that morning. Her brother-in-law filled in the rest: as soon as they arrived, a smuggler took them across the border to Turkey, and they were now headed to Syria. A few days later, a series of text messages jolted Aya out of her grief. “If you want your son, you have to come back to us,” her husband wrote from his hometown of Idlib, where a unsteady truce held between the two sides in the war. “You are becoming German. Come back to your culture, your religion and your people. Come be a good mother again.” In just a few messages, Mohammad laid out a central preoccupation for many Syrian refugees in Germany: how to embrace the freedoms of their new home while preserving the culture and traditions of the one they left behind. It has been three years since the first big wave of Syrian refugees arrived in Germany. Now that they are over the initial shock of dislocation, their focus is on building their lives anew. Some have managed to take the best from both worlds. Many others struggle, fearful that in becoming German, they will lose their Syrian identity. But if they don’t adopt some German ways, they risk isolation from the jobs and activities that can help them flourish. “Traditions and community are good for psychological health. But if you are stuck too much in the home culture, it can make it difficult to integrate here,” says Mona Bünnemann, a clinical psychologist who works with refugees in the city of Bielefeld, near Xanten. German culture emphasizes individual freedoms that are often at odds with societies that cherish extended family ties and the responsibilities that come with them. Unlike previous waves of immigrants who came in search of jobs and were better prepared to adapt to their host country, the recent cohort of Syrian refugees had little choice about leaving home or even where they ended up. For some, the requirement to learn German and embrace German values can feel like an imposition rather than an opportunity, especially when those values come into conflict with Syrian customs. One of the biggest areas of stress, Bünnemann says, is the role of women in society. Recently she has started to see an increase in marital tensions. “The women are revolting more often. Now that they are not merely surviving anymore, they observe the society around them. They get to know German families and want to have the same freedoms.” Some are so determined to assert their new rights that if they don’t get them, they ask for a divorce. When Aya and Mohammad arrived in Germany in September 2015, they had been married only a month. Life in the refugee camp was tough, and Mohammad often took out his frustrations on his wife. “People heard me screaming,” says Aya, who asked that she and her husband be identified only by their first names in order to protect her son. “But no one said anything because in our society, it’s not anyone’s business that a man beats his wife.” The beatings stopped when Mohammad and Aya enrolled in mandatory German-language and integration courses. Aya learned about women’s rights in Germany, and Mohammad learned that beating his wife was illegal. Their son was born a year later. Aya, a top architecture student back in Syria, flourished in her German classes, but Mohammad struggled and soon grew jealous of his wife’s progress. “Aya was much cleverer, and that was a problem for him,” says Anna Pieper, a volunteer for the Caritas aid organization who helped the couple settle in. Soon Aya was handling all the German paperwork for the family, she says, and Mohammad felt that undermined his role as man of the house. The more Aya made friends with fellow students and German mothers in her son’s playgroup, the more Mohammad retreated into the traditional Syrian community centered at a nearby mosque, where he found men who shared his anger and his struggle to find work.",Syrian Women Are Embracing Their New Lives in Germany.

1660,Ian Bremmer,"Every year around this time, people dedicate themselves to self-improvement in the 12 months ahead. So, as a break from my usual column, I’d like to read the minds of the luminaries of global politics and share their New Year’s resolutions for 2019: President Donald Trump: I resolve to win the trade war with China which is CHEATING us, repeal Obamacare, build a big BEAUTIFUL border wall, cut everyone’s taxes, balance the budget FAIRLY QUICKLY, order a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the HELL is going on, take no vacations, play no golf, tell everyone there was NO COLLUSION, make America GREAT again and lose three pounds. Just like last year! British Prime Minister Theresa May: This year, I will keep calm and carry on … Oh, who am I kidding? I resolve to take one more shot at this Brexit nonsense and, if it doesn’t work, pass this utterly thankless job to Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn and see how they like it, thank you very much. French President Emmanuel Macron: I will listen more closely to the desires of my subjects and ensure their government can provide plenty of cake when they are hungry. L’état, c’est Macron! Chinese President Xi Jinping: In 2019, I resolve to project steady confidence, keep making promises and remain patient until Donald Trump is no longer in my path. I then resolve to proceed as before. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un: In 2019, I resolve to project steady confidence, keep making promises and remain patient until Donald Trump is no longer in my path. I then resolve to proceed as before. And to take even more selfies with world leaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin: I will guarantee Ukraine’s elections in March are an event to remember, and promise to use all my discipline and inner strength to avoid laughing at what comes next in the United States, and to find new ways to annoy Washington that are so inventive I surprise even myself. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro: This year, I’ll show the world why my family gave me the middle name Messias.

1661,TIME Staff,"A serial killer dubbed China’s “Jack the Ripper” has been executed three decades after the first in a string of gruesome murders targeting women and girls. Agence France-Presse reports that Gao Chengyong, 54, was sentenced to death after he was found guilty of raping, mutilating and murdering 11 female victims between 1988 and 2002. The court that sentenced him in March 2018 announced his execution Thursday on China’s Twitter-like social media platform, Weibo, according to AFP. Gao reportedly targeted young women who wore red, following them home and sometimes disemboweling them. In some cases, their reproductive organs were removed, according to local media reports. The murders took place in China’s Gansu region and neighboring Inner Mongolia. Gao’s youngest victim was eight years old. Upon his conviction, the court said on Weibo that “many of his female victims’ corpses were damaged and violated,” according to AFP. “The motives of the defendant’s crimes were despicable, his methods extremely cruel, the nature of the acts vile and the details of the crimes serious,” the court’s statement continued. Police had been searching for the killer for years before his arrest in 2016.",A Serial Killer Known as China's 'Jack the Ripper' Has Been Executed,"January 3, 2019"
1662,Lydia Mulvany / AP,"If people switched to alternative sources of protein from beef, diet-related deaths may decline as much as 5% in high- and upper-middle-income countries, according to a report by the World Economic Forum. The report also says such a scenario could reduce food-related greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter. “It will be impossible to sustainably satisfy the world’s future demand for meat,” Dominic Waughray, managing director of the World Economic Forum, said in a statement. The report said the challenge of meeting protein needs of a projected population of 10 billion people by around 2050 sustainably can be helped by innovation and experimentation in alternative and traditional proteins. Global meat consumption is rising with no sign of stopping, the report said. Demand is increasing rapidly in China and increasing in other developing regions, while holding relatively stable at high levels in high-income countries, the report said.

1663,Tara Law,"Hasan Minhaj has spoken out after Netflix removed an episode of his comedy show from its streaming service in Saudi Arabia — and says the move will only make people want to watch it more. After word spread Tuesday that Netflix had, at Saudi Arabia’s request, pulled an episode of Minhaj’s show, Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj, the comedian wrote on Twitter that the decision has made people even more interested in it. “Clearly, the best way to stop people from watching something is to ban it, make it trend online, and then leave it up on Youtube,” Minhaj wrote. He then used his platform to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and asked for donations to the International Rescue Committee. Saudi Arabia had asked Netflix to remove the show because it allegedly violated the country’s cyber crimes law, the Financial Times reported. In the episode, Minhaj criticized Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for their handling of the conflict in Yemen, the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and other alleged misconduct.

1664,Suyin Haynes,"Chinese President Xi Jinping said Taiwan’s unification with mainland China is “inevitable,” issuing a stern warning against any separatist or independence attempts on the self-governing island in a firmly-worded speech Wednesday. “China must and will be united,” said Xi in reference to unification with Taiwan, AFP reports. “We make no promise to give up the use of force and reserve the option of all necessary means,” Xi added, not ruling out the use of military action against separatist efforts in Taiwan. While Beijing still sees Taiwan as part of China’s sovereign territory despite the island’s breakaway from the mainland at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state with its own democratic political system. Taiwan has never formally declared independence from mainland China, but relations have come under pressure since the election of Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen in 2016. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) does not accept the 1992 Consensus — a diplomatic agreement made between Taiwan and China acknowledging the existence of “one China.” On Tuesday, Tsai declared that Beijing “must respect the insistence of 23 million people for freedom and democracy” and “must use peaceful and equal terms to handle our differences,” AFP reports. Merely a day later, Xi described his vision for unification via a “one country, two systems” approach to “safeguard the interests and well-being of Taiwanese compatriots.” Over the past year, Beijing has ramped up efforts to isolate Taiwan, through pressuring international companies and airlines to list the territory as part of mainland China. Taiwan also has very few diplomatic allies with a series of defections to China taking place in 2018, and it is not granted membership or access to international organizations such as the United Nations or the World Health Organization. In mid-term elections last year, the DPP suffered losses causing Tsai to resign as party leader, while the pro-China opposition rival Kuomintang made gains. Last week, the capital city of Taipei was beset by protesters demonstrating against high taxes, echoing France’s gilet jaunes, or “yellow jackets” movement.

1665,Tara Law,"New details have emerged about Paul Whelan, the 48-year-old Novi, Michigan, resident who is facing 10 to 20 years in Russian prison on charges of espionage. While U.S. court records and the accounts of Whelan’s family and workplace cannot clear him from any suspicion of spying, they depict him as a fairly ordinary American – an Iraq war veteran, former sheriff’s deputy and corporate security expert who, his brother says is a loyal friend and family member. “We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being,” the Whelan family said in a statement that his twin brother, David Whelan, posted on Twitter. “His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.” David Whelan later told CNN about that he learned that his brother, who had been in Russia for a wedding, had been detained from a news story. According to David Whelan, Paul Whelan served multiple tours in Iraq as a marine and is a corporate security expert. Paul Whelan had made several trips to Russia in the past, his brother believes that he was attending the wedding to help other guests navigate Moscow. David Whelan told CNN that his brother is a helpful sort of person. “Paul’s a kind soul, he’s very generous, he’s notorious among my kids for his huge belly laugh,” he said. He added that his brother is a highly capable individual, who has served in Iraq and worked in law enforcement.","Who Is Paul Whelan, the American Detained in Russia for Alleged Spying?","January 1, 2019"
1666,Alejandro de la Garza,"In the midst of an ongoing battle over women’s right to visit an important Hindu temple, women in the southern Indian state of Kerala lined up to form a 620km (385-mile) human chain in a mass demonstration for gender equality on Tuesday, reported the BBC. The protest comes during a fraught period for religious and gender rights in Kerala. In September, India’s highest court overturned a historical ban on women of “menstruating age,” defined to be between ages 10 and 50, from entering the state’s Sabarimala shrine. Protesters have attacked women who attempting to visit the temple. Tuesday’s rally was organized by Kerala’s left-leaning government, with approximately five million women from across the state taking part in the “women’s wall,” officials told the BBC. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said on Monday that women’s issues were “part of the party’s class struggle,” reported the Indian Express. He went on to say that the women’s wall “is required to protect the renaissance tradition of the state.” Most Hindu temples allow women to enter if they are not currently menstruating, rather than disallowing women from a broad age group, according to the BBC. Some Hindu communities regard menstruating women as unclean. Two women were able to reach the Sabarimala temple premises in October, thanks to the protection of more than 100 police, but they were forced to retreat after a confrontation with protesters outside the temple sanctum, reported the BBC. The fight over women’s right to enter the temple also comes in the lead-up to India’s general election in April and May. India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has pursued a Hindu nationalist agenda, has painted the September court ruling as an attack on traditional Hindu values. Critics have accused the BJP of exacerbating religious tensions in order to rally their conservative Hindu base. In an interview with Reuters affiliate ANI on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed confidence in the BJP’s prospects in the upcoming elections, despite the party’s recent losses in state contests.",A '620km Human Chain' — Indian Women Rally for Equality,"January 1, 2019"
