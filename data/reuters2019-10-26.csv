"Oil slides 2% as U.S. inventories build, weak economic data weighs","October 2, 2019 /  2:40 AM / 24 days ago","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 2% on Wednesday after official data showed a rise in U.S. crude inventories, adding to worries about an oversupplied market as weak economic readings in the United States depressed global financial markets. Brent crude futures settled down $1.20, or 2%, at $57.69 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 98 cents, or 1.8%, to settle $52.64 a barrel. Wall Street’s main indexes tumbled more than 2% as data suggested fallout from the U.S.-China trade war was hurting the U.S. labor market. World equity benchmarks hit their lowest levels in a month. U.S. crude inventories rose 3.1 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, far exceeding analyst expectations for an increase of 1.6 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI fell by 201,000 barrels, EIA said.  “I think you’re continuing to get signs that demand growth is the primary drag on the market, with the disappointing manufacturing number that came out yesterday,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. On Tuesday, front-month WTI prices settled down for a sixth straight session, their longest losing streak this year after data showed U.S. manufacturing activity dropped to a 10-year low. “Even with 12 days and counting of bearish trading action on WTI futures, that market is now only starting to reach oversold territory. $50.50 remains a key support level,” said David Thompson, executive vice president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington. Signs of easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also weighed on prices, traders said. Tensions flared after Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for an attack on Saudi oil facilities on Sept. 14., a charge Tehran denies. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh sought to defuse tensions with Saudi Arabia, calling his counterpart in Riyadh “a friend” and saying Tehran was committed to stability in the region. Both oil ministers, who have repeatedly clashed at OPEC meetings over output policies, were attending a top Russian energy conference chaired by President Vladimir Putin. Iran’s oil minister said he expected a slight surplus in oil supply next year. Putin said it was important to use all available tools to balance energy markets. He pledged Russia would remain a major player in OPEC+, the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil-producing nations, which has cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day.  The United Arab Emirates’ Minister of Energy and Industry Suhail al-Mazrouei said conformity levels were the same as previously announced at the last OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting.     Ecuador, one of the smallest OPEC members, said it would leave the 14-nation bloc from Jan. 1 due to fiscal problems. Ecuador will be the second country to withdraw from OPEC in the last year after Qatar.  "

"Florida joins Justice Department settlement with Sprint, T-Mobile","October 2, 2019 /  7:11 PM / 24 days ago","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Florida has signed on to a consent agreement that the Justice Department reached with Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc to allow the companies to merge, according to a court filing on Wednesday. While Florida’s decision to join the government is a morale boost for the companies, it may have little practical effect since the two sides already settled. A group of 17 states and the District of Columbia has filed a separate lawsuit to stop the $26 billion merger, arguing that it will lead to higher prices for consumers. A trial date has been set for Dec. 9. Florida on Wednesday joined Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma and South Dakota in backing the federal government’s decision to approve the deal on condition that the companies, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless companies, divest Sprint’s prepaid businesses to satellite television company Dish Network Corp to create a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Separately, the Federal Communications Commission has indicated it plans to approve the merger and has begun the process of formally doing so.  "
U.S. set to quickly widen trade war with EU tariffs after WTO ruling: sources,"October 2, 2019 /  6:05 PM / 24 days ago","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States’ top trade body is likely to release a list of European goods subject to new tariffs Wednesday afternoon, after the World Trade Organization’s landmark ruling on illegal aircraft subsidies, industry sources said.  Three industry sources briefed on the United States Trade Representative’s plans said they expected the agency to release a list of European products that would be taxed at 4 p.m. EDT. The USTR submitted a request Wednesday to the WTO to convene a fast-track meeting of its dispute settlement body to adopt these tariffs, two U.S.-based trade sources said.  Wednesday’s request means the WTO body could meet as soon as Oct. 14. The USTR and WTO did not respond to requests for comment.  The United States won approval Wednesday to tax $7.5 billion in European goods over illegal EU subsidies for aircraft maker Airbus (AIR.PA). The EU is expected to respond with taxes of its own on U.S. products, after the global trade body found U.S. aircraft maker Boeing Co (BA.N) also received illegal subsidies.   Lobbying groups, trade organizations and congressional staff in Washington were scrambling Wednesday to prepare for any U.S. tariff announcement, which ultimately could involve billions of dollars in European import, and make planes, specialty foods, and luxury goods more expensive. In April, the USTR put out a provisional list of EU goods worth $21 billion that it could target, including cheese, olive oil and aircraft. The USTR said in July another $4 billion in European products could be taxed as much as 100%. Airlines expect the USTR will put tariffs as high as 15% on Airbus orders.    "
Analysts cut estimates for Exxon's third-quarter profit on weaker oil prices,"October 2, 2019 /  6:52 PM / 24 days ago","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Analysts on Wednesday trimmed their profit estimates for Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) after the largest publicly traded oil producer pointed to weaker third-quarter results in a regulatory filing due to weaker oil prices and chemicals margins. Exxon’s summary of business changes during the quarter ended Sept. 30 showed it “continues to struggle to generate strong earnings,” analysts at Mizuho Securities USA wrote in a client note. The company this year began disclosing quarter-to-quarter comparisons of prices, taxes and refining margins to deliver information on its businesses to investors soon after a quarter ends. The consensus estimate prior to Tuesday’s filing was for profit of 86 cents per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon. But after Exxon signaled weaker oil prices and chemicals margins, several brokerage houses cut their earnings forecasts.   Edward Jones lowered its per share estimate to 65 cents from 85 cents previously. Mizuho also cut its forecast to 65 cents, from $1.04 and slashed its full year projection to $2.86 a share from $3.27. Exxon earned $1.46 a share in the year-earlier third quarter. Exxon shares were down 2.6% to $67.18 in mid-day trading. “We expect the company to continue to outspend its cash flow as it invests heavily over the next few years,” said Jennifer Rowland, an equity analyst with Edward Jones.  Exxon’s range of impacts indicate per-share earnings of between 54 and 67 cents, RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote. Margins in the company’s chemicals business “remain extremely weak, driven by trade-war related issues and ample supply,” said RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria. JP Morgan left its 65 cents a share estimate unchanged, but noted that the company does not provide insight into unplanned outages in its refining and chemicals units. The quarter’s outages could put “EPS closer to 60 cents at the midpoint,” it wrote.  Exxon earlier this year warned analysts it was spending heavily to replace production, with major investments that include the Permian Basin shale fields in the U.S. and offshore Guyana. In the second quarter, Exxon reported a 21% drop in quarterly profit, its third period in a row of weaker year-over-year results, as sharply higher oil production was offset by weaker refining and chemicals business.

Pick-up trucks remain mainstay for Detroit Three in third quarter,"October 2, 2019 /  1:43 PM / 23 days ago","(Reuters) - The Big Three U.S. automakers on Wednesday reported a rise in sales of pick-up trucks for the third quarter as lower interest rates boosted demand in an otherwise sluggish auto market. Shares of General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) were, however, trading lower, tracking a broad selloff in the market over fears of a U.S. slowdown. While higher vehicle prices and rising interest rates earlier in the year kept car shoppers on the sidelines, recent interest rate cuts helped sales in the third quarter. Automakers in the United States are also focusing on selling larger SUVs and trucks that are more profitable, as sedans fall out of favor. “Gas prices and interest rates remain at historically low levels ... (and) support our industry to 17 million plus level for what is now the fifth straight year,” Mark LaNeve, Ford’s vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service, said on a call with analysts. There were concerns that GM’s sales could take a hit after 48,000 hourly employees at the top U.S. automaker walked out for the first time in 12 years on Sept. 16 and remain on strike. GM did not face a severe inventory crunch in the third quarter, as most dealers showed healthy supply levels heading into October, according to an analysis by automotive shopping website CarGurus. However, the company risks facing parts shortage that could possibly affect sales in the current quarter, likely benefiting rivals including Ford.     Sales of Silverado pick-up trucks jumped 16.6% to 155,482 vehicles, boosting GM’s total U.S. sales by 6.3% to 738,638 vehicles. Sales of Ford’s pick-up trucks rose 5% to 240,387, their best third-quarter performance in 14 years, even as overall sales fell 4.9% to 580,251 units, hurt by lower demand for the company’s passenger cars including the Taurus sedan. Fiat Chrysler’s sales of its Ram pick-up trucks surged 14% to 161,635, marginally lifting overall sales by 0.1% to 565,034 units. GM’s sales fell slightly short of U.S. car shopping website Edmunds’ forecast of 748,746 vehicles, while Ford and Fiat Chrysler beat expectations. Edmunds had expected third-quarter sales for the industry to rise by 0.8% to 4.3 million vehicles, led by volume gains at GM. Edmunds had forecast Ford’s sales at 570,179 vehicles and Fiat Chrysler’s at 558,302. The results showed September U.S. light vehicle seasonally adjusted annualized pace was tracking 17.2 million vehicles, above consensus of 17 million, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said. Shares of GM fell 4.7% to their near four-month low of $34.41, while those of Ford slumped 5.2% to more than six-month low of $8.44. Fiat Chrysler’s U.S.-listed shares slipped 2.1% to $12.46. "
Slowing U.S. private hiring adds to gloom over economy,"October 2, 2019 /  12:47 PM / 24 days ago","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hiring by U.S. private employers slowed further in September, suggesting that trade tensions, which have pressured manufacturing, could be spilling over to the labor market. The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday also showed private payrolls growth in August was not as strong as previously estimated, and said “businesses have turned more cautious in their hiring,” with small enterprises becoming “especially hesitant.” It came on the heels of a survey on Tuesday showing manufacturing activity tumbled to a more than 10-year low in September. The reports added to cooling consumer spending in suggesting that the economy was losing momentum, though a recession is probably not on the horizon.  The economy’s darkening outlook was also underscored by another report on Wednesday showing a measure of current business conditions in New York City dropped to a 40-month low in September.  The longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, is losing ground with the blame largely put on a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has eroded business confidence.  Slowing job growth is a concern as it could curb consumer spending, which has been the economy’s main growth engine. Private employers added 135,000 jobs in September, the ADP National Employment report showed. Data for August was revised downward to show private payrolls increasing by 157,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 195,000 positions. “We continue to believe that the underlying trend in job growth has slowed lately but that it remains decent,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private employment rising by 140,000 jobs in September. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street dropped to one-month lows. The ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department’s more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report due out on Friday, which includes both public- and private-sector employment.  The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody’s Analytics, has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government’s employment report. However, last month’s job gains fit in with economists’ expectations for moderate nonfarm payrolls growth in September.  Some analysts believe a weaker employment report is likely. “I believe that Friday’s nonfarm payrolls will come in weaker than forecast,” said Kevin Giddis, chief fixed income strategist at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee. “In my opinion, a number below 100,000 is likely more probable. It just has that feeling.”   According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 145,000 jobs in September, after rising 130,000 in August. Job gains have averaged 158,000 per month this year, above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working age population.  The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.7% for a fourth straight month. The ADP report showed employment in the goods-producing sector increased by 8,000 jobs in September. Manufacturing payrolls rose by 2,000 jobs last month and construction added 9,000 positions. Natural resources and mining shed 3,000 jobs.  The services sector added 127,000 jobs last month, with gains concentrated in education and health services, professional and business services, and trade, transportation and utilities industries. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management-New York current business conditions index dropped to a reading of 42.8 last month, the lowest since May 2016, from  50.3 in August. Businesses were also downbeat about the outlook over the next six months.  The survey’s six-month outlook gauge tumbled 26.2 points to 45.2 in September, the lowest reading since February 2009. Its employment measure dropped to a 19-month low of 52.5 from 69.0 in August.  “Purchasing managers are struggling and are more nervous about the future than they have been at any point since the Great Recession,” said Adam Kamins, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. But there was some encouraging news on the housing market, which has been struggling since hitting a soft patch last year. The Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to purchase a home increased 10% last week from a year ago. The report added to data on homebuilding, building permits and home sales in suggesting that the housing market slump had probably run its course. Residential investment has contracted for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession.  The housing market is being lifted by lower mortgage rates, thanks to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. "
ASOS shakes up board to revive fortunes,"October 2, 2019 /  7:40 AM / 24 days ago","(Reuters) - Online fashion retailer ASOS Plc on Wednesday revamped its board by naming several new directors, including Ocado Solutions Chief Executive Officer Luke Jensen, as it looks to bounce back from a string of profit warnings. ASOS, which sells fashion aimed at twentysomethings, is tapping experienced hands to revive its business after the company in July issued its second profit warning since December. It had said problems in ramping up warehouses in the United States and Germany restricted product availability, hitting sales and raising costs. The company appointed four new independent non-executive directors in total on Wednesday, increasing the number to six. Two existing directors, Hilary Riva and Rita Clifton, will leave in April 2020 after their six-year tenures. The other three new directors are Sky executive Mai Fyfield, former Burberry executive Eugenia Ulasewicz and Micro Focus executive Karen Geary. Jensen will sit on the audit and nomination committees along with Geary and Ulasewicz, while Fyfield will join the audit and remuneration committees.

Airbus hits four-month low after WTO ruling; Pernod falls,"October 2, 2019 /  2:56 PM / 24 days ago","LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) shares fell to four-month lows and Pernod Ricard SA (PERP.PA) extended losses on Wednesday after Washington won approval to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods, opening a new front in the global trade war. While the ruling was in line with expectations, the news deepened a rout that had punished European stock markets throughout the session as investors worried about a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war as the global economy falters. The planemaker shares ended the day down 2% at their lowest since early June, reversing a brief move higher. French drinks company Pernod Ricard came under fresh pressure too. The stock was down 0.1%. The U.S. Trade Representative’s provisional list of products that are eligible to be targeted with tariffs ranges from Airbus jets themselves to helicopters, wine, handbags and cheese. “We are seeing European stocks hit hard in anticipation of a widening rift between the U.S. and EU, leading to a similar tit-for-tat trade war” to Washington’s spat with China, said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG in London. “(U.S. President Donald) Trump knows what hurts the EU most, and his willingness to act against automakers could leave that sector exposed to future actions.” An index of European carmakers and auto suppliers .SXAP closed down 2.6%, while the aerospace and defence index ended 2.4% lower for its worst day in two months.

London forex trader sues Citigroup over 'malicious' forex prosecution,"October 2, 2019 /  4:23 PM / 24 days ago","LONDON (Reuters) - A London-based former Citigroup (C.N) trader is suing the U.S. bank for more than $112 million, alleging it made materially false and malicious statements to U.S. prosecutors that led to his trial in New York on foreign exchange-rigging charges. Rohan Ramchandani, the former European head of Citigroup’s forex spot market trading desk, alleges in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday that Citigroup made false and “gravely derogatory” assertions against him to government investigators and the media after firing him in 2014 without cause. “Ultimately, Citi quite literally fabricated an antitrust case for the United States Department of Justice against Ramchandani based upon knowingly false allegations that he engaged in market ‘manipulation’ and ‘collusion’,” read the complaint filed in the federal court in Manhattan. A spokeswoman for Citigroup in London said the bank rejected the allegations and would fight the case. “Mr. Ramchandani’s claims of malicious prosecution are without merit and we will contest them vigorously,” she said. A New York jury last year cleared Ramchandani, alongside two other London-based currency traders, of scheming to rig benchmark exchange rates in the $5.3 trillion-per-day foreign exchange markets after just hours of deliberation. The verdict was a blow for U.S. authorities, which alongside Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had fined some of the world’s most powerful banks — including Citigroup — a total of around $10 billion over the foreign exchange scandal.  The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) abandoned its own criminal investigation into currency rigging allegations in 2016, saying it lacked sufficient evidence for a successful prosecution. Ramchandani alleges that a Citigroup lawyer, who is not named in the filings but who he said had “full knowledge” of the facts, had recognized that he had not engaged in intentional wrongful conduct or violated any law or regulation. He also alleges his manager at Citigroup, an experienced forex spot market trader tasked with reviewing and evaluating Ramchandani’s communications, had volunteered that Ramchandani had not engaged in “collusion or price fixing” and there was “nothing criminal” in his intent or actions. Citigroup only pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currencies in order to pin the blame on Ramchandani and to limit the regulatory consequences for their senior managers and officers, the former trader alleged.  Ramchandani alleged that although he had been acquitted, Citigroup’s conduct had cost him tens of millions of dollars, damaged his reputation and ended his successful and well-paid professional career. He is demanding a trial by jury. "
"Trump Jr touts 'dream' Indonesia projects, denies any conflicts","August 13, 2019 /  10:14 AM / 2 months ago","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of the U.S. president, said he was upbeat about two planned Trump-branded projects in Indonesia and dismissed any risk of conflict of interest over involvement in the luxury resorts in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. The executive vice president of the Trump Organization, which is partnering with Indonesia’s MNC Group run by billionaire Hary Tanoesoedibjo on the projects, made the comments at a pre-launch event in Jakarta on Tuesday. The visit comes amid rising trade tensions between the countries, with Indonesian officials worried about potential U.S. tariffs being applied as the Southeast Asian nation had an $8.3 billion trade surplus in 2018. “I’m very excited to be here, to see these very different projects,” said Trump Jr, referring to the two resorts located on the popular holiday island of Bali and in Lido, near the heavily populated capital Jakarta. “Property is about location, location, location,” he said, describing the planned resorts as “dream projects”. Seeking to allay any concerns about potential conflict of interest, he said the Indonesian project was one of the last the Trump Organization signed up before his father became president and the group had chosen not to take on new overseas deals to “avoid even the impression of any kind of impropriety”.  The Trump Organization has a contractual obligation to finish off deals it had previously signed, he said.  Any notion that because of a development, President Trump might be influenced to change U.S. policy is “totally asinine”, Trump Jr told reporters. “I’d like to shut that nonsense down once and for all right here.”  The U.S. President has kept ownership of his global business empire, but handed off control to his two oldest sons through a trust while in office, an arrangement watchdogs say does not go far enough to prevent conflicts of interest in the White House. Asked if the U.S.-China trade war might have any influence on Trump projects, Trump Jr said: “There’s literally zero influence in one decision-making process as it relates to the other.”  MNC Chairman and CEO Tanoesoedibjo said his group had not received any financing from China for the Trump-related project. It has previously been in talks with Chinese banks for loans but that was for a separate theme park it was developing, he added. The two upcoming Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia will be developed in stages within three years and MNC plans to invest $1.7 billion, Tanoesoedibjo said. The projects will include hotels, villas and golf courses. They will be developed by MNC and managed by the Trump Hotel Collection, a unit of the Trump Organization. Tanoesoedibjo ran for Indonesia’s vice president in the 2014 elections and subsequently founded his own political party, which contested Indonesia’s general elections in 2019. His party has put forward his daughter, 32-year-old Angela Tanoesoedibjo, for a cabinet-level position in Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s government, media reports say.  As a business partner of Trump, Tanoesoedibjo has previously said he believes his relationship with the U.S. President could help ties between nations.  Indonesia has been in negotiations with Washington over preserving its special tariff treatment for some Indonesian exports under a program for poor and developing countries. "
Trump says he wants a full investigation into Epstein death,"August 13, 2019 /  4:28 PM / 2 months ago","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he wants a “full investigation” into the circumstances surrounding financier Jeffrey Epstein’s death at a federal detention facility in New York City while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. “Basically what we’re saying is we want an investigation. I want a full investigation, and that’s what I absolutely am demanding. That’s what our attorney general, our great attorney general is doing. He’s doing a full investigation,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey. Trump made the comments after U.S. Attorney General William Barr earlier vowed to carry on the Epstein investigation even after the financier’s death and ordered the Justice Department’s inspector general to look into the matter.

"New Trump rule targets poor and could cut legal immigration in half, advocates say","August 12, 2019 /  1:22 PM / 2 months ago","(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration unveiled a sweeping rule on Monday that some experts say could cut legal immigration in half by denying visas and permanent residency to hundreds of thousands of people for being too poor. The long-anticipated rule, pushed by Trump’s leading aide on immigration, Stephen Miller, takes effect Oct. 15. It would reject applicants for temporary or permanent visas if they fail to meet high enough income standards or if they receive public assistance such as welfare, food stamps, public housing or Medicaid. “The Trump administration is trying to bypass Congress and implement its own merit based-immigration system. It’s really a backdoor way of prohibiting low-income people from immigrating,” said Charles Wheeler of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network Inc. The rule is part of Republican Trump’s efforts to curb both legal and illegal immigration, an issue he has made a cornerstone of his presidency. After the rule was announced, the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) said it would file a lawsuit to stop it from taking effect. The group’s executive director said the rule was racially motivated. The state attorneys general of California and New York threatened to sue. The 837-page rule, seeking to target those who could become “public charges” in the United States, could be the most drastic of all the Trump administration’s policies targeting the legal immigration system, experts have said. It could deny visas to people for not making enough money or who are drawing public benefits. The government estimates the status of 382,000 immigrants could immediately be reviewed on those grounds. Immigrant advocates fear the real number could be much higher, especially if the rule is extended to the millions of people who apply for U.S. visas at American consulates around the world. The State Department already changed its foreign affairs manual in January 2018 to give diplomats wider discretion in deciding visa denials on public charge grounds. In the fiscal year that ended last September, the number of visas denied on those grounds quadrupled compared to the previous year. “This is an end run around Congress to achieve through executive fiat what the administration cannot get through Congress,” said Doug Rand, co-founder of Boundless, a pro-migrant group that helps families navigate the U.S. immigration system. The rule is intended to scare immigrants away from using public benefits to which they are legally entitled, Rand said, adding that a study by Boundless found it could eliminate more than half of visa applicants. A 2018 study by the Migration Policy Institute found 69 percent of already established immigrants had at least one negative factor against them under the administration’s wealth test, while just 39 percent had one of the heavily weighed positive factors. Other immigrant advocates have expressed concern the rule could negatively affect public health by dissuading immigrants from using health or food aid. The Trump administration estimates its rule will save $2.47 billion annually in spending on public benefits. The rule is derived from the Immigration Act of 1882, which allows the U.S. government to deny a visa to anyone likely to become a “public charge.”  Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said at a White House media briefing that the law has always required foreign nationals to rely on their own resources, with help from relatives and sponsors, but the term “public charge” was never clearly defined. “That is what changes today with this rule,” Cuccinelli said. The new rule defines public charge as an immigrant who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months within any 36-month period. The definition of public benefits is cash aid including Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), most forms of Medicaid, and a variety of public housing programs, officials said. “The principle driving it is an old American value and that’s self-sufficiency,” Cuccinelli said in a Fox News interview. Whether someone is public charge will be determined on a variety of positive and negative factors. A positive factor would be earning 125 percent of the poverty line, which is $12,490 for an individual and $25,750 for a family of four, while earning less would be a negative factory. Critics have decried the effort to limit legal immigration for lower-income people affront to the ideals of the United States highlighted by the inscription on the Statue of Liberty that reads “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Trump aide Miller, asked in 2017 about whether the administration’s policies countered that inscription, said the words were not original to the monument. Cuccinelli was also asked about the inscription at the White House on Monday and said: “I do not think, by any means, we are ready to take anything off the Statue of Liberty.”  In early 2018, Trump rejected a bipartisan effort in Congress to reform the immigration system. The effort became embroiled in controversy over accusations by a Democratic senator that the Republican president disparaged African and Caribbean nations with a vulgarity in regard to their immigrants. Trump was reported to have asked why the United States could not get more immigrants form northern Europe. Trump has denied using that language and said he wanted immigrants to come the United States from all nations. "
Johnson & Johnson settles Ohio lawsuits to avoid federal trial,"October 2, 2019 /  12:10 AM / 24 days ago","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday it will pay $20.4 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, allowing the U.S. healthcare giant to avoid an upcoming federal trial seeking to hold the industry responsible for the nation’s opioid epidemic. J&J became the fourth drugmaker to settle claims ahead of the Federal Court trial against multiple manufacturers and distributors in Cleveland scheduled for later this month. The case is considered a bellwether for more than 2,600 lawsuits by state and local governments that are pending nationally.  “The settlement allows the company to avoid the resource demands and uncertainty of a trial as it continues to seek meaningful progress in addressing the nation’s opioid crisis,” J&J said in a statement. “The company recognizes the opioid crisis is a complex public health challenge and is working collaboratively to help communities and people in need,” it added. Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. J&J which formerly marketed the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, said the settlement includes no admission of liability. The company will pay $10 million to Cuyahoga and Summit counties, reimburse $5 million of their legal and other expenses and provide $5.4 million to non-profit organizations that run  opioid-related programs in the counties. Mallinckrodt Plc finalized a $24 million settlement with the same two counties on Monday. Endo International Plc and Allergan Plc also settled with the two counties in August to avoid going to trial. The remaining defendants in the Oct. 21 federal trial include McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Henry Schein Inc.  OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP succumbed to pressure from the lawsuits and filed for bankruptcy protection in September.  Some plaintiffs’ lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998. Earlier in the year, an Oklahoma judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers.  "
Job done - Tesco boss to quit next year,"October 2, 2019 /  6:16 AM / 24 days ago","LONDON (Reuters) - Tesco (TSCO.L) boss Dave Lewis, credited with saving Britain’s biggest retailer from collapse in 2014, will step down next summer after declaring its turnaround complete, handing over to a relative unknown catapulted into one of the sector’s top jobs. Celebrating its 100th anniversary, Tesco is five years into a recovery plan launched by Lewis after an accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading. Successor Ken Murphy, a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O), will become the second outsider to lead Tesco, following in the footsteps of former Unilever (ULVR.L) executive Lewis.     Like Lewis, 52-year-old Irish national Murphy has experience in the consumer goods industry, key suppliers to supermarkets, having started his career at Procter & Gamble (PG.N). “Now is the right time for me to pass on the baton; our turnaround is complete,” Lewis told reporters on Wednesday. “We’ve delivered all the metrics we set for ourselves, the leadership team is very strong, our strategy is clear and it is delivering,” he said, adding that he was not leaving for another job. The outgoing boss also dismissed Murphy’s lack of experience in the UK grocery retail industry, another parallel with Lewis at the start of his Tesco tenure. “If you look at the CEO as being the best shopkeeper in the team, it’s the wrong brief,” Lewis said. “He’s got loads of retail experience, he’s got loads of wholesale experience, he understands brands and he understands customers and he’s super smart.” News of Lewis’s departure came as Tesco beat forecasts with a 25% rise in first-half operating profit before one-off items of 1.4 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) and raised its interim dividend by 58.7%. The numbers served as a clear demonstration of the progress made since Lewis launched his recovery plan after a 2014 accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading. Shares in the group were up 0.2% at 1511 GMT. Tesco was on its knees when Lewis joined but has since met all his turnaround goals, including a key margin target of earning between 3.5 pence and 4 pence of profit for every pound customers spend. The first-half profit margin was 3.67%. “Put quite simply he is the bloke that saved Tesco, which should go down as an enormous achievement in British retail history,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.  “Murphy has big shoes to fill.” Shares in Tesco, which has a 27.4% share of Britain’s grocery market, have risen 6% since Lewis started in September 2014. The FTSE 100 index, meanwhile, has risen by 8.5%. Lewis, however, noted that Tesco’s shares had risen by about 40% since the full extent of the accounting irregularities were revealed in October 2014. Lewis overhauled Tesco’s relationship with suppliers, lowered prices, simplified product ranges and improved store standards. Jobs have also been cut, including 4,500 announced in August. The 54-year-old also pursued growth by buying wholesaler Booker for nearly 4 billion pounds, forming a global purchasing alliance with Carrefour (CARR.PA) and launching discount format Jack’s. Tesco chairman John Allan said Lewis had told him about his planned 2020 departure a year ago, kicking off a succession process that also considered internal candidates. Allan said that Charles Wilson, the Booker boss once seen as the frontrunner to succeed Lewis, did not want to be considered. Murphy ticks a lot of boxes for Tesco. He led the turnaround of Alliance UniChem in Italy, then shared the top operations job at Boots UK & Ireland before going on to become executive vice president, chief commercial officer and president of global brands at Walgreens Boots Alliance. Murphy left that position at the end of 2018, retaining a consultancy role with the U.S. retailer. “We wanted a combination of experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind and a track record in commercial and brand,” Allan said. He denied that Murphy’s appointment signaled a new international push from Tesco, which has retrenched from countries such as South Korea and Turkey under Lewis. Given contractual commitments to Walgreens, Murphy’s precise start date will be announced in due course. He will join on a basic annual salary of 1.35 million pounds, slightly less than the 1.25 million pounds Lewis earned in 2018-19.      Tesco is also stepping up its store opening program, doubling its UK online capacity and revamping its Clubcard loyalty scheme. It is also buying wholesaler Best Food Logistics. Though Tesco said it has made a strong start to the year, UK like-for-like sales dipped 1% in its second quarter, partly reflecting a tough comparison with the same period last year,  when a heatwave and the men’s soccer World Cup boosted demand. Lewis said that being CEO of Tesco was “all consuming” and when he leaves he would take time out with his family before considering his next move. He said he did not want to be labeled as the man who saved Tesco, insisting “there are 450,000 people who have turned around the business”. "
German businesses urge EU to protect them after latest WTO decision,"October 2, 2019 /  3:23 PM / 24 days ago","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s DIHK chambers of commerce on Wednesday urged the European Union to act strongly in order to protect their interests in a tariff row between the EU and the United States, reacting to the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) latest decision. “It is important that the EU unanimously and decisively protect European economic interests,”  DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said in a statement.

Britain says tariffs are no answer to Airbus dispute after WTO ruling,"October 2, 2019 /  3:18 PM / 24 days ago","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said tariffs were in no-one’s interest and should not be applied to the UK after a ruling by the World Trade Organization on Wednesday that the United States could target $7.5 billion of imports from the European Union over illegal subsidies for planemaker Airbus. “The UK government is clear that resorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US. We are working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes,” the British government said after the WTO’s decision. “We are also seeking confirmation from the WTO that the UK has complied fully with WTO rulings regarding support to Airbus, and should not be subject to tariffs.” "
Website that allowed Huawei phones to install Google apps taken down,"October 2, 2019 /  7:06 AM / 24 days ago","(Reuters) - A China-based website that allowed for manual installation of Google’s Android apps on Huawei’s newly launched Mate 30 devices went offline on Wednesday after a security researcher highlighted the “backdoor” to sidestep a U.S. ban. The link to the website, LZPlay, surfaced about 10 days earlier on social media site reddit.  “This GMS (Google Mobile Services) installer is ad-free, well-designed, and ONLY works for Huawei devices,” wrote a user. Launched two weeks earlier, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s Mate 30 phone uses an open-source version of Android without falling foul of the U.S. ban, but the devices do not come with pre-installed applications such as Google Maps. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration effectively blacklisted Huawei in mid-May, alleging it is involved in activities that compromise national security, a charge the company denies. Google was among the first U.S. companies to suspend business with Huawei, hobbling the company’s smartphone business outside China as the tech giant lost access to updates to Google’s Android operating system.  LZPlay used an undocumented “backdoor” in Huawei’s mobile device management software to install Google software, a security researcher wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.  “At this point, it is pretty obvious that Huawei is well aware of this LZPlay app, and explicitly allows its existence,” said researcher John Wu.  “Although this ‘backdoor’ requires user interaction to be enabled, the installer app, which is signed with a special certificate from Huawei, was granted privileges nowhere to be found on standard Android systems,” he said. A Huawei spokeswoman denied any relationship with LZPlay.     “Huawei’s latest Mate 30 series is not pre-installed with GMS, and Huawei has had no involvement with www.lzplay.net,” she said. Google and Wu were not immediately available for comment. A search of internet registration records showed that LZPlay website was registered in July.  It was not immediately clear who took down the website.  Huawei announced its own mobile operating system, dubbed Harmony, in August. But analysts are skeptical that it is yet a viable alternative to Android.  "
France ready to hit back if U.S. sanctions EU imports: minister,"October 2, 2019 /  2:48 PM / 24 days ago","PARIS (Reuters) - France is ready to retaliate if the United States goes ahead with trade sanctions on EU imports, its finance minister said on Wednesday after Washington won WTO backing for the measures. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said it would be “an economic and political mistake” if the U.S. went ahead, after the World Trade Organisation ruled that the U.S could target $7.5 billion of EU imports over illegal subsidies for planemaker Airbus.  “We will be ready to respond firmly with our European partners,” Le Maire said in a statement. “A friendly resolution to the Boeing/Airbus dispute is the best solution, and all the more so given that Europe could impose sanctions on the United States next year,” he added.

Explainer: The jet subsidy row that threatens transatlantic trade war,"October 2, 2019 /  11:50 AM / 24 days ago","(Reuters) - The United States will learn on Wednesday the annual value of European Union goods it is allowed to target with tariffs as part of a 15-year-old dispute at the World Trade Organization over illegal subsidies to the world’s largest planemakers. Here is what’s at stake. What is the dispute about?     The United States and EU accuse each other of paying billions of dollars in subsidies to Boeing (BA.N) and European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) in a pair of cases dating back to 2004. It’s the largest dispute tackled by the Geneva-based WTO, which has backed some of the claims and rejected others. The disputed subsidies include cheap government loans to Airbus from Britain, France, Germany and Spain and Washington State tax credits supporting Boeing. Planes affected include the Boeing 787 and Airbus A380. What does the law say? The WTO tries to resolve disputes on two types of subsidy: 1) “Prohibited subsidies” are viewed as the most damaging and are always illegal. They are tied directly to exports or the use of local goods instead of imported ones. Despite initial successes, neither side made this charge stick in the core case. 2) “Actionable subsidies” cause harm or “adverse effects” to another country or its industry, but the burden of proof is higher and rules for compliance are less severe. They are only illegal if the complaining nation can prove it was harmed. Such subsidies dominated the thousands of pages of evidence and will drive any retaliation rights awarded to both sides. Who won? By many accounts, the lawyers and multiple expert witnesses. Costs of the cases are estimated to top $100 million. In the cases themselves, both sides have won partial WTO rulings but nobody can agree which side came out on top. Each has said its own subsidies were smaller or less harmful than those abroad. Both say they have removed any harmful aid, but the WTO says neither has complied fully.  Now WTO arbitrators must decide on mutual claims of billions of dollars of harm inflicted on each side by “actionable subsidies” in order to determine the amount of tariffs allowed, starting with U.S. sanctions on EU goods. How big are the tariffs? The United States seeks tariffs on EU goods with an annual trade value of $11.2 billion. The EU seeks tariffs on U.S. goods worth around $10 billion. People close to the case say the WTO is set to allow Washington to impose around $7.5 billion in tariffs. The EU will find out how much it can impose next year. Which goods are vulnerable? WTO rules allow counter-measures to be applied to any goods but both sides will be under pressure from domestic importers to be selective, especially when hitting non-aircraft industries. Both sides included planes, helicopters, wine, foods and  leather goods on their provisional target lists. Both lists exceed the value of tariffs sought, so will have to be reduced. What happens next? A report from WTO arbitrators authorizing the United States to impose tariffs will be made public on Wednesday. This must be signed off by the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body.  Its next regular meeting is due on Oct. 28 but the United States could request a special meeting no earlier than 10 days after the arbitrators’ report is published. The U.S. Trade Representative is meanwhile expected to move quickly to issue a final list of European goods it wants to target, a U.S. source said. Can the EU retaliate? Under WTO rules, the EU cannot retaliate directly but it is expected to win permission to impose its own tariffs when its parallel case catches up in 2020. There has been some EU talk of reviving a $4 billion war chest of tariffs from an earlier case, to be used at once, but this is sure to provoke a new debate.     Can a transatlantic tariff war be avoided? There have been various overtures about talks, but none has been successful. The dispute is moving from a phase in which the industry and the WTO judges took center stage to a political phase widely seen as less predictable. Several sources say the United States, believing it is winning a tariff dispute with China, is ready to act, but some analysts still see a delay. The EU hopes to persuade the WTO to reopen a procedure to let it demonstrate compliance with earlier rulings. The United States opposes this and doubts exist about whether the EU initiative can delay sanctions. What does it mean for air fares? That depends on what sanctions are used and how airlines pass on their costs. Placing tariffs on Airbus or Boeing aircraft would push up airline costs in targeted countries and could raise fares, some airlines say. But proponents of tariffs say enforcement of WTO decisions would ultimately remove trade-distorting support and lower aircraft prices and fares. "
"Timeline: Highlights of the 15-year Airbus, Boeing trade war","October 2, 2019 /  11:52 AM / 24 days ago","(Reuters) - The World Trade Organization is poised on Wednesday to open the door to hefty U.S. tariffs on European goods over illegal subsidies for Airbus, pushing a 15-year-old row over support for plane giants to the center of fraught global trade relations. The WTO has found the world’s two largest planemakers received billions of dollars of unfair subsidies in a pair of cases dating back to 2004 and is expected to allow both sides to impose tariffs, starting with the U.S. Here are highlights of the feud that has spawned thousands of pages of rulings, triggered threats of tit-for-tat tariffs on goods from plane parts to whisky and left both sides claiming victory while racking up an estimated $100 million in costs. The U.S. seeks talks with the European Union and Airbus (AIR.PA) host nations Britain, France, Germany and Spain over alleged unfair subsidies via government loans. Washington also terminates a 1992 U.S.-EU agreement covering support for Airbus and Boeing (BA.N). The EU responds by filing a complaint on U.S. aid for Boeing. The WTO launches twin probes into public support for Boeing and Airbus after bilateral negotiations fail.  Airbus announces a new A350 jetliner for which it will seek further government loans from host nations. The WTO issues an interim ruling that some European aid provided to Airbus violated a ban on export subsidies - a type  of aid deemed most harmful and therefore automatically banned. The WTO demands a halt to unfair aid for jets including the Airbus A380 superjumbo. It says some government loans for the jet amount to “prohibited” export subsidies. But it rejects a U.S. request to include aid for the newer A350 in the case.  The EU loses an appeal and is given until December to comply. However the WTO drops its finding that the A380 loans are in the “prohibited” category, softening its earlier ruling.  The planemakers clash over the scope of the WTO finding. Boeing says the WTO faulted $18 billion of subsidies to Airbus including $15 billion in loans. Airbus says the amount of subsidy embedded in the loans is far smaller, but neither side can publicly back up its claims since details are redacted.  In the EU’s counter-case alleging $19 billion of support for Boeing from the U.S. government, NASA and various states and municipalities, a separate WTO panel partially backs the EU and rules against aid for Boeing worth at least $5.3 billion. WTO appeal judges broadly uphold the ruling against U.S. support for Boeing.  Both sides say they have complied with the WTO’s rulings, while accusing the other side of failing to do so. This latest disagreement kicks off a new compliance phase in the dispute, including appeals, that lasts another six years. Boeing announces the twin-engined 777X and agrees to build it in Washington state shortly after the local legislature agrees $8.7 billion in new tax breaks. The EU opens a second front in the trade battle by launching a separate complaint against the 777X tax breaks granted by Washington state and this time chooses a faster, all-or-nothing approach by targeting them purely as “prohibited” subsidies - without the usual fallback of a second, softer claim. After a year-long lull in the main dispute, the WTO says the EU failed to comply with its earlier rulings on Airbus. It also agrees for the first time to target aid for the new A350 but rejects U.S. calls to put this in the “prohibited” category. In November, the WTO rules tax breaks surrounding the development of the Boeing 777X - the subject of the EU’s second case - did fall into the more severe “prohibited” category.  WTO appeal judges reverse the ruling that the 777X tax breaks are in the “prohibited” column, bringing an abrupt halt to the EU’s second case after only two and a half years - a quick turnover by the standards of the main legal battle. The EU’s original case against aid for earlier Boeing projects - including an earlier version of the same tax breaks - continues. In that main EU case, the WTO largely clears the United States of maintaining unfair support for Boeing but says it has failed to withdraw the earlier Washington State tax breaks.  The EU appeals this decision, but the WTO does not change its stance in a follow-on ruling, published the same year. In May, the WTO again rules that the EU has failed to halt all subsidies to Airbus and that these continue to harm Boeing. The United States threatens sanctions on billions of dollars of European products. Both sides enter arbitration to determine the scope of tariffs.  In March, the WTO says the U.S. has again failed to halt subsidized tax breaks to Boeing in Washington state. Once again, the two sides disagree widely in public over the amount of subsidy faulted by the WTO. In April, the U.S. issues a list of $21 billion of EU products from which any WTO-approved tariffs could be drawn, ranging from planes to food and handbags, to counteract $11.2 billion of harm it says EU subsidies cause the U.S. each year.  The EU issues its own $20 billion list of U.S. imports that could face tariffs for damage from U.S. subsidies.  In June, U.S. sources said they are open to negotiations on an “enforceable mechanism” that could allow Airbus to receive some government funding on commercial terms while addressing the issue of Washington State tax breaks. Both sides accuse the other of refusing to negotiate any settlement. In July, the U.S. adds $4 billion of items to the basket of products from which any tariffs against the EU could be drawn. In September, WTO arbitrators back a U.S. request to impose tariffs on billions of dollars of European goods, according to people familiar with the case.  A parallel decision on EU counter-tariffs is due in 2020. "
Parade of Democratic 2020 hopefuls push for momentum in Iowa,"August 9, 2019 /  7:43 PM / 2 months ago","CLEAR LAKE, Iowa (Reuters) - A cavalcade of Democratic presidential hopefuls on Friday tried to turn a few precious minutes before Iowa voters into the momentum needed to catapult their campaigns in the pivotal state.  A rite of passage for Democratic presidential candidates, the annual “Wing Ding Dinner” featured five-minute speeches from almost two dozen contenders seeking the party’s nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. Iowa’s caucuses in February kick off the Democratic nomination process and can provide a candidate with crucial early momentum. Despite the fact that many of the candidates urgently need to differentiate themselves among the horde, most of them trained their fire at Trump, not each other.  Some said Trump had inflamed social tensions with anti-immigrant and racially charged rhetoric, helping prompt mass shootings in Texas and Ohio last weekend that left 31 dead. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, accused Trump of “coddling white nationalists.” The suspect in the El Paso shooting reportedly posted a hate-filled manifesto directed at Latinos before the massacre. Former Vice President Joe Biden said Trump “offers no moral leadership. He has no interest in unifying this country.” Trump, he said, has adopted a political strategy of “hate, racism and division.” Former U.S. Congressman Beto O’Rourke, who is from El Paso, did not speak at the event, but appeared in a video accusing Trump of fostering “hatred, racism and intolerance.” Tim Ryan, a U.S. congressman from Ohio, urged Congress to pass an assault weapons ban.   “People are dying on the streets of this country, being killed by weapons made for the battlefield,” Ryan said. “This country will never be safe until we get these weapons of war off the streets.”  There were some signs of the ideological and generational tensions within the party. Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a moderate, decried sweeping progressive proposals that he said were “written for press releases.” But when progressive U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren championed her plan to provide “Medicare for All” and levy a tax on the nation’s wealthiest, she received loud cheers. Buttigieg took a subtle jab at Biden, who often touts his work as vice president under President Barack Obama. “We can’t look like we’re the party of back to normal,” Buttigieg said. “What we have now isn’t working, but normal wasn’t working either.” There were also references to Iowa’s economy, where farmers have been caught in the fallout from Trump’s decision to slap tariffs on Chinese goods. “Trade war by tweet is not working for our farmers,” Warren said.  After the event, Cynthia Donovan, 62, of Sioux City, Iowa said she was most impressed by Buttigieg and Warren.  Donovan, who has not chosen a candidate to support, said she was “looking for somebody who can unify. Somebody who can change some of the damage that this current administration has done on trade, immigration and humanity.” The event, a fundraiser for the state Democratic Party that serves up piles of chicken wings, attracts activists and organizers in the Midwestern state whose support can bolster a presidential bid. As the state that holds the first nominating contest each election cycle, Iowa plays an outsized role in picking presidential nominees. Only the top finishers in Iowa’s February caucuses will likely survive to continue their candidacies. Underscoring the state’s importance, several 2020 candidates made Iowa their first presidential campaign stop this year. That included Biden, who said he was not taking his front-runner status for granted as he returned to Iowa this week. U.S. Senators Kamala Harris of California and Senator Warren of Massachusetts both embarked this week on bus tours across the state to try to galvanize their supporters.    Throughout the weekend, some 20 candidates will also take turns appearing at the Iowa State Fair, ascending the infamous “soapbox” to deliver their pitch to voters and take questions. "
Democratic presidential contenders demand action on guns,"August 10, 2019 /  1:05 PM / 2 months ago","DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contenders on Saturday urged Congress to take action to curb gun violence following mass shootings last weekend in Texas and Ohio that left 31 dead. Speaking at a hastily convened forum in Iowa, they called for the imposition of universal background checks on gun buyers, so-called “red flag” laws, and ultimately a ban on military-style assault weapons. They also said they believed the long-standing debate on gun violence in America was shifting in favor of stronger restrictions. “We are going to make change. We are going to pass gun safety laws in this country,” said U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.  The candidates took questions from gun-control advocates and shooting survivors at a program sponsored by Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In the shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, the gunmen used semi-automatic weapons with high-volume magazines.  Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, called for those weapons to be taken off the streets.  “They have no basis in our neighborhoods in peacetime in the United States of America,” Buttigieg said. Buttigieg was among a group of more than 200 mayors who sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, this week urging him to cancel the August recess and summon lawmakers back to Washington to vote on gun-control legislation. Several 2020 candidates highlighted how they would use the executive powers of the presidency to pursue gun-control measures if Congress again fails to act. Warren said she would impose increased background check requirements and more reporting on multiple gun purchases, and expand age restrictions to limit teenage access to guns. She said she would also push to do away with the filibuster, which would allow gun legislation to pass the Senate by a simple majority vote. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who has said if elected she would give Congress 100 days to put a gun control bill on her desk, said they need to have “the courage to act.” “It’s not like we are waiting for a good idea, all of the good ideas have been had ... we do not lack for ideas,” she said.  U.S. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado - where 12 were killed in a high-profile mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999 and another 12 were killed and 70 injured during a 2012 massacre at a movie theater - said he would “galvanize every single federal agency” to treat gun violence as a “public safety crisis.” Iowa is a key focus of campaigning because in February the state will hold the first nominating contest in the Democratic presidential primaries ahead of the November 2020 presidential election. Many have called for measures such as an assault weapon ban, universal background checks and other gun control reforms long stymied by partisan fighting in Washington. Democrats have criticized Republican President Donald Trump’s mixed messaging this week on possible support for some gun control measures.  Trump on Friday suggested that he could sway the nation’s powerful pro-gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, to drop its opposition to gun restrictions. He also said he had assured the organization that its viewpoint would be “fully represented.”    U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota suggested on Saturday that Trump would not stand up to the group. “We have a guy in the White House who is afraid, afraid of the NRA,” she said, criticizing McConnell for refusing to bring a background check bill and other legislation to the floor for a vote. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said, “People in America who should not own guns based on their history, will not own guns under a Sanders administration.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the current Democratic front-runner, touted his work in the Senate in the 1990s passing an assault weapons ban that has since expired.  “I’ve taken on the NRA nationally, and I’ve beaten them,” Biden said.   “Red flag” laws would allow the police to temporarily confiscate guns from people deemed by a judge to be a threat to themselves or others.   Candidates also want to close the so-called “boyfriend loophole,” which permits convicted domestic abusers to continue to purchase firearms if they were not married to their victims. U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who could not attend Saturday’s forum due to a funeral, dedicated his seven-minute allotment at a Democratic fundraising dinner on Friday night to gun violence, noting that 2020 rival Beto O’Rourke was not present due to one of last week’s shootings being in his home town of El Paso. Media magnate Bloomberg has pledged to use his well-funded political action committee in next year’s elections to defeat candidates who resist gun-reform legislation. If the current push for new restrictions fails, as has happened in the past, Bloomberg said, “We have make sure all those who stood in the way face the consequences.” "
Hollywood studio cancels 'The Hunt' movie release after criticism,"August 10, 2019 /  10:57 PM / 3 months ago","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Universal Pictures on Saturday canceled the release of “The Hunt,” a satirical thriller about a group of Americans who are captured to be hunted and killed for sport, following apparent criticism by President Donald Trump and a recent series of mass shootings. The Comcast Corp division had held back on marketing the film, slated for release on Sept. 27, after the shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, last week. It gave no reason for the cancellation. A Universal Pictures representative did not return an email seeking comment. “We stand by our filmmakers and will continue to distribute films in partnership with bold and visionary creators, like those associated with this satirical social thriller, but we understand that now is not the right time to release this film,” Universal said in a statement. Trump, taking to Twitter on Friday, criticized “liberal Hollywood” and an unnamed film with a pending release.   “The movie coming out is made in order to inflame and cause chaos,” Trump tweeted. Trailers released online for the film depicted a group of wealthy villains orchestrating the open-field hunting of several Americans held against their will. The film came from Blumhouse Productions, which has produced a number of popular horror films such as “The Purge” and “Get Out.” A Blumhouse representative did not immediately respond to calls on Saturday. The Hollywood Reporter, citing details in the film’s screenplay, reported earlier this week that a character at one point called the people being hunted “deplorables.” In 2016, then Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said half the supporters of her Republican rival Trump belonged in a “basket of deplorables” of people who were racist, homophobic, sexist, xenophobic or Islamophobic. Since then, some Trump supporters have used the term “deplorables” as a badge of honor. Trailers for “The Hunt,” which featured heavy use of firearms, circulated online in media reports as the United States was dealing with the aftermath of a number of mass shootings, including in El Paso where 22 people, many of them Hispanic, were killed.  The accused gunman in El Paso confessed while surrendering and told police he was targeting “Mexicans,” according to a police affidavit released on Friday. "
