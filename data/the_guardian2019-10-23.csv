New gene editing tool could fix most harmful DNA mutations,"‘Prime editing’ more precise than Crispr-Cas9, but still needs time before use on humans",Ian Sample,2019-10-21T16:27:23+0100,"Scientists have raised fresh hopes for treating people with genetic disorders by inventing a powerful new molecular tool that, in principle, can correct the vast majority of mutations that cause human genetic diseases.The procedure, named “prime editing”, can mend about 89% of the 75,000 or so harmful mutations known to mangle the human genome and lead to conditions such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anaemia, and a nerve-destroying illness called Tay-Sachs disease.The landmark work opens the door to a new era of genome editing, but scientists caution that more research is needed before it can be safely used in humans. Beyond proving its safety, another major hurdle is how to deliver the molecular machinery to cells that need it in sufficient amounts to treat a disorder.“This first report of prime editing is the beginning rather than the end of a longstanding aspiration in the life sciences to be able to make any DNA change in any position of a living cell or organism, including potentially human patients with genetic diseases,” said David Liu at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts.The ability to rewrite the genetic code is one of the most striking scientific advances of recent years. The most common approach, known as Crispr-Cas9, has been likened to “molecular scissors” which home in on a particular DNA sequence and then cut it in two. The procedure allows scientists to disable specific genes and even correct harmful mutations by providing cells with fresh strands of DNA with which to repair the cut.Crispr-Cas9 is not perfect, however. Often, it leads to cells with a haphazard mix of edits, including extra chunks of DNA called insertions, or missing chunks of genetic code called deletions. These are less of a problem when scientists are working on cells in a dish, because those that are affected can be thrown away. But when genome editing is used to rewrite faulty genes in people’s lungs, hearts and other tissues, far more precision is needed.Andrew Anzalone, also at the Broad Institute, created prime editing with Liu by giving Crispr-Cas9 an overhaul. The new system homes in on its target as before, but instead of chopping the DNA in half, it nicks it, and then writes a new section of DNA into the specified position.Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists describe how they made 175 different DNA edits to human cells with impressive precision. In one demonstration, they corrected mutations that cause the inherited blood disorder, sickle cell anaemia. In another, they removed the four extra DNA letters in a particular gene that cause Tay-Sachs disease, a rare condition that destroys children’s nerves and usually proves fatal by five years old.Before prime editing, it was impossible to make such a range of DNA changes in so many different cell types without leaving behind insertions, deletions and other genetic detritus that can interfere with the workings of the edited cell.“You can think of prime editors as being like word processors capable of searching for target DNA sequences and precisely replacing them with edited DNA sequences,” Liu said. “Potential impacts include being able to directly correct a much larger fraction of the mutations that cause genetic diseases, and being able to introduce DNA changes into crops that result in healthier or more sustainable foods.”Robin Lovell-Badge, a geneticist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said prime editing looked “very exciting” and would be useful for exploring what genes do, making animal models of human genetic disorders, and improving animal and plant agriculture. Because the procedure can make changes that occur naturally in plants, at least some prime-edited crops should not be regulated as “genetically modified”, he added.But much more work needs to be done before prime editing can be used in humans, Lovell-Badge stressed. “As the authors themselves point out, these are new methods and effort will be needed to develop them to show that they are sufficiently safe and efficient. So far the authors have conducted experiments on just a few human cell types, which is far from being enough.”While the efficiency of the edits – about 50% in some cases – would be good enough for scientists conducting basic research, he questioned whether it would be useful for scientists working on live animals. “Nevertheless, I am excited about the methods which certainly hold promise and I expect we will see many applications that use these or next generation methods based on them.”"
"Can you solve it? The four points, two distances problem",A dot-to-dot puzzle with a difference,Alex Bellos,2019-10-21T07:10:18+0100,"Today’s question is probably the shortest I have ever set:Find all the ways to arrange four points so that only two distances occur between any two points.In other words, how many ways are there to draw four dots on a piece of paper such that whichever two dots you choose, the distance between these two points is one of two values?I’ll give you one solution for free, the most obvious one, in which the points are arranged in a square:The four blue lines are one length, and the two green ones are another length. (With four dots, there are six ways to chose a pair of dots, so there are six ‘distances’ between dots.)I learned of this puzzle from maths juggler Colin Wright, who learned it from puzzle maven Peter Winkler. What’s beguiling about the problem is not just the satisfying brevity of the statement, but the deceptiveness of the answer.“Nearly everyone misses at least one [solution], and for each possible solution, it’s been missed by at least one person,” said Winkler.I think it’s a lovely problem because it embraces many levels of difficulty. If you struggle with geometry, you’ll be overjoyed to find one or two other solutions. (There are more.) The business end of the problem, however, is proving that you have found every solution.I’ll be back with the solutions at 5pm UK time today. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS. Although do discuss how you might attack the problem. Is there a ‘simple’ strategy that gets them all or is it just down to intuition and trial-and-error?UPDATE: Solution now available here.Clarifications: The four points must be distinct. That is, no point is allowed to be superimposed on another point. For each solution, we exclude all reflections, rotations and different sizes of that solution. Also, if the two distances that occur between any two of the four points in one solution are a and b, then the two distances that appear in another solution are not necessarily a and b.I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.My new book So You Think You’ve Got Problems? is out on November 7. It’s a puzzle book, but also a book of true stories and mathematical ideas. The 200 puzzles I selected all, in different ways, contain an element of surprise.

Dr Sarah E Hill: ‘We have a blind spot about how the pill influences women’s brains’,The social psychologist’s new book tackles the tricky subject of how oral contraceptives may affect women’s minds,Zoë Corbyn,2019-10-19T14:00:28+0100,"At a time when women’s reproductive freedoms are under attack, any suggestion that the birth control pill could be problematic feels explosive. But Sarah E Hill, a professor of social psychology at the Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas argues we need to talk about how oral contraceptives are affecting women’s thinking, emotions and behaviour. How the Pill Changes Everything: Your Brain on Birth Control is her new book about the science behind a delicate subject.Some US states have recently made it harder to get an abortion and the Trump administration is doing its best to chisel away at access to birth control. Is your book trying to dissuade women from using the pill?My institution was founded as a Christian school, but it doesn’t have a particular religious bent now. My goal with this book is not to take the pill away or alarm women. It is to give them information they haven’t had up until now so they can make informed decisions. The pill, along with safe, legalised abortions, are the two biggest keys to women’s rights. But we also have a blind spot when it comes to thinking about how changing women’s sex hormones – which is what the pill does – influences their brains. For a long time, women have been experiencing “psychological” side-effects on the pill but nobody was telling them why.The backlash we are seeing against the pill, particularly with millennial women walking away from it, I think is because women haven’t felt right on it and have grown weary of doctors patting them on their heads and telling them they are wrong. The more information women have, the more it will bring them back to the pill.How exactly does the pill affect women’s brains?The pill works mainly by mimicking the second half of a woman’s monthly ovulatory cycle, in which the hormone progesterone is dominant. Its primary ingredient is artificial progesterone – so-called progestin – which shuts down the brain signal that prompts egg development. But that also means the ovaries aren’t producing oestrogen, the hormone which dominates the first half of a woman’s natural cycle. And oestrogen does some of our favourite things to our brains and bodies, making us feel sexier and more energetic. While most pills include some synthetic oestrogen – primarily to offset progestin’s unpleasant side-effects – women can feel the lack.A less well-understood mechanism is that progestins, which are often created by changing the molecular structure of testosterone, aren’t an exact match for our progesterone receptors. This means they can potentially stimulate other receptors, including those for testosterone, leading to masculinising effects, and for cortisol, which over time can dysregulate stress response. The stress hormone profile of pill-taking women, research suggests, is similar to people who have experienced chronic stress. Other research has found effects on the immune system, learning and memory.We know a lot about the small but serious health risks associated with the pill – things like stroke and blood clots. Why have we been kept in the dark about the effects on the brain?Until very recently, there has been little research. And the research that is out there doctors often aren’t aware of because it isn’t being published in the medical journals they look at, but rather in psychology and neuroscience journals. Then society has taboos about talking about it. The best defence against the sexist notion that women’s hormones make them less rational than men seemed to be to deny hormonal involvement in the brain. And the pill is so useful, no one is motivated to examine it too critically. But our hormones, especially our sex hormones, are a key part of what creates the experience of feeling like ourselves. And talking critically about the pill doesn’t mean that the benefits aren’t going to outweigh the cost. It’s not antithetical to women’s rights to talk about this stuff.Some women are going to experience big changes while others are going to have noneHow does the pill potentially affect women’s choice of mate?Oestrogen is known to nudge women’s preferences when it comes to their romantic partners to favour qualities that are associated with masculinity and higher testosterone: square-cut jaws, broad shoulders and brow ridges, for example. But research suggests pill-taking women – in their state of artificial progesterone dominance and lacking a cyclical oestrogen urge – seem to prefer the faces of men who are less masculine. The implication is that if a woman chooses her partner when she’s on the pill and then goes off it – it might lead to relationship dissatisfaction because she no longer finds herself as attracted to the person. It is a possibility that women should at least keep in mind. What about the mood changes women report on the pill?Being on the pill is associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed with anxiety and depression, though there are some women who report the pill stabilises their moods. The association was particulary high in young women aged 15-19 and their suicide risk is also more than twice that of non-pill takers. A dysregulated stress response is likely part of the picture, but another driver seems to be low levels of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone – a breakdown product of progesterone that acts as a natural sedative. In pill-taking women, the research suggests, levels are significantly lower than in naturally cycling women. Women starting the pill should keep a mood journal or tell a friend to keep an eye on them, especially if they have a personal or family history of mood-related symptoms. For young women, the pill may not be worth the trade-off if it is being used for reasons other than to prevent pregnancy – for example to clear acne or regulate periods.How big are the effects you are talking about?They are relatively small. But at an individual level, some women are going to experience big changes while others are going to have absolutely none. Each woman should know about the research that’s out there so they can monitor themselves and troubleshoot.There are over 100 different formulations of pill along with multiple other hormonal birth control options. Should we treat them the same?The signalling is going to be different. Progestins divide into four different generations each with a somewhat different molecular structure. Each pill can also have a different ratio of progestin to artificial oestrogen. Right now, the research that exists rarely divides women based on the type of progestin they are on, let alone the ratios. We need to push science to start looking at this.Should women seek alternatives to the pill?I am not making recommendations to any individual woman. Each knows what her own life goals are and how her body feels. But I do advise women to be strategic in their use of the pill. Understand the psychological trade-offs and then decide whether or not you want to use it. For a lot of women, the answer is still going to be yes, but now they choose knowing that information. With all the different formulations out there, I am confident women who want to use the pill are going to be able to find one that works for them. For women who are looking for something which doesn’t have hormones in it, the copper IUD is one of the most failsafe.Are you concerned that raising these issues might turn women to less effective methods of birth control that could leave them with unwanted pregnancies?It is the last thing I want to have happen. I’m hoping we can use this moment to educate ourselves, but still recognise how important it is to protect ourselves from unwanted pregnancy. Not being pregnant when you don’t want to be pregnant – for me the benefits of that far outweigh almost any brain changes the pill can cause.You say the issue of birth control is not yet solved. So what would solve it? Better pills, a male pill, or something new entirely?Ideally we want contraception that’s really safe and effective that doesn’t monkey with anyone’s brain. Maybe that means more investment in the copper IUD. Or maybe it is something yet to be invented. But we need the imagination of the best researchers on this issue. The pill works so well and is so easy, we’ve become complacent. And in the meantime, we need more and better research to understand what we’ve got.• How the Pill Changes Everything: Your Brain on Birth Control is published by Orion (£19.99).

"Scores more heart attacks and strokes on high pollution days, figures show",Data reveals acute impact on people’s health and the strain it puts on emergency services,Fiona Harvey,2019-10-21T00:01:09+0100,"Scores of children and adults are being rushed to hospital for emergency treatment on days of high pollution in cities across England, figures show.Each year emergency services see more than 120 additional cardiac arrests, more than 230 additional strokes and nearly 200 more people with asthma requiring hospital treatment on days of high pollution compared with the average on days of lower pollution.The data, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain that poor air quality is putting on already stretched NHS emergency resources.Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said: “These new figures show air pollution is now causing thousands of strokes, cardiac arrests and asthma attacks, so it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency. Since these avoidable deaths are happening now, not in 2025 or 2050, together we need to act now.”Previous studies have found spikes in hospital admissions and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air.The researchers defined high pollution days by dividing the year in two based on levels of pollution and comparing the number of cases of the relevant illness in the higher pollution half of the year with the number of similar cases on each day in the lower half.The data, collated by King’s College London (KCL), covers London, where there are 338 more emergencies a year on higher pollution days compared with low pollution days, Birmingham (65 a year), Bristol (22), Derby (16), Liverpool (28), Manchester (34), Nottingham (19), Oxford (10) and Southampton (16).Much of the recent research on air pollution has focused on the lifelong effects of chronic exposure, including cognitive decline, stunted growth in children and premature death. However, it can also bring on serious illness more immediately.Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Many people may not realise how dangerous air pollution at high levels can be, and that it can trigger heart attacks, strokes and asthma attacks as well as having long-term health effects. These figures will be a wake-up call for city leaders to take the strongest possible action.”The government has pledged to tackle air pollution in its environment bill, proposals for which were laid out after the Queen’s speech. Campaigners are concerned that the measures proposed are too vague and too weak.Polly Billington, the director of UK100, a network of local government leaders across England that have pledged to shift wholly to clean energy by 2050, said: “We would like to see World Health Organization air pollution standards included in the bill, as they are widely seen as gold standard, with a legally binding timetable to meet them, as that creates certainty and enables long-term planning. The absence of significantly increased powers for local leaders, together with a lack of reference to the need for adequate funding, are the big holes in the bill that will hold action back.”On Wednesday the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and UK100 will hold an international clean air summit with the World Health Organization (WHO) director general, Tedros Adhanom.Heather Walton, a health expert with the environmental research group at KCL, said the study was intended to provide more detail than others that have tended to concentrate on the effects of air pollution on life expectancy, such as estimates that pollution contributes to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK.By homing in on hospital admissions for cardiac arrests, strokes and asthma, the researchers were able to provide a clearer picture of the acute impacts on people and how emergency services are affected. “This provides additional evidence of the important need for further action to reduce air pollution,” Walton said.Bates said clean air zones were needed, but also measures to cut all traffic “because all vehicles produce deadly fine particle air pollution from brake and tyre wear. This way the air pollution health crisis and the climate emergency can be addressed together, helping to make our cities and towns healthier and more attractive.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and tackle pollution so people can live longer healthier lives. Our landmark environment bill will set ambitious, legally binding targets to reduce fine particulate matter and increase local powers to address key sources of air pollution.“We are already working hard to reduce transport emissions and are investing £3.5bn to clean up our air, while our clean air strategy has been praised by the WHO as an example for the rest of the world to follow.”Last week Europe’s environmental watchdog found that little or no progress had been made across Europe on cutting levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which is one of the most dangerous forms of pollution because it can lodge deep in the lungs and penetrate the bloodstream."
Melting glaciers reveal five new islands in the Arctic,Russian navy discovers yet-to-be-named islands previously hidden under glaciers,,2019-10-22T16:27:51+0100,"The Russian navy says it has discovered five new islands revealed by melting glaciers in the remote Arctic.An expedition in August and September charted the islands, which have yet to be named and were previously hidden under glaciers, said the head of the northern fleet, Vice-Admiral Alexander Moiseyev.“Mainly this is of course caused by changes to the ice situation,” Moiseyev, who headed the expedition, said at a press conference in Moscow. “Before these were glaciers; we thought they were (part of) the main glacier.Melting, collapse and temperature changes led to these islands being uncovered.”Glacier loss in the Arctic in the period from 2015 to 2019 was more than in any other five-year period on record, a United Nations report on global warming said last month.Russia has opened a string of military and scientific bases in the Arctic in recent years, with interest in the region growing as rising temperatures open up shipping routes and make hitherto inaccessible mineral resources easier to exploit.This summer’s expedition to two archipelagoes – Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya – involved a team of 60 people, including civilians from the Russian Geographic Society, and was the first onboard a rescue towboat instead of an icebreaker.Video of expedition members encountering an angry walrus that attacked their inflatable landing craft went viral last month.“The two months this year when we held our expedition to Franz Josef Land can be described as warm,” said Denis Krets, commander of the northern fleet’s expedition force. “We were very lucky because we could land on islands where not every year the shore and the inshore water is free of ice.”During the expedition, the defence ministry announced it had found five new islands in Vize Bay off Novaya Zemlya, a vast mountainous archipelago with two main islands. The islands had previously been seen on satellite images but the expedition was the first to see them.It also said it had also confirmed the existence of an island that had been previously mapped as a peninsula of Hall Island, part of the Franz Josef Land archipelago, west of Novaya Zemlya.Moiseyev said names for the new islands were “upcoming”.“Of course each island will receive a name but first you have to lay out the case for it,” he said."
UK to use finance meant for green energy to support fracking in Argentina,Documents show government’s plans to use money from £1bn 2017 deal to prioritise support of major oil companies,Jillian Ambrose,2019-10-22T12:04:40+0100,"The UK is planning to invest in Argentina’s controversial oil shale industry using a £1bn export finance deal intended to support green energy, according to government documents seen by the Guardian.UK Export Finance, the government’s foreign credit agency, promised in 2017 to offer loans totalling £1bn to help UK companies export their expertise in “infrastructure, green energy and healthcare” to invest in Argentina’s economy.Instead official records, released through a freedom of information request, have revealed the government’s plan to prioritise support for major oil companies, including Shell and BP, which are fracking in Argentina’s vast Vaca Muerta shale heartlands.One government memo, uncovered by Friends of the Earth, said that while Argentina’s clean energy sector was growing, it was “Argentina’s huge shale resources that offer the greatest potential” for the UK.The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: ""The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.""One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change. Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.The briefing note was prepared before a key meeting between the UK government’s trade envoy to Latin America, the UK ambassador to Argentina and Argentina’s energy minister in February this year.Tony Bosworth, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the world hurtling towards catastrophic climate change, and parliament declaring a climate emergency, it’s outrageous that the UK government is continuing to back huge fossil fuel developments abroad.”Separate records, also uncovered by Friends of the Earth, revealed that there had been no fewer than 13 meetings between the UK and oil companies operating in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta hydrocarbon reservoir since the beginning of last year.The companies include Shell, Andina Resources, Phoenix Global Resources and Pan American Energy (PAE), a subsidiary of BP. They have contributed donations amounting to more than £40,000 to fund birthday celebrations for the Queen held at the British embassy in Bueno Aires over the past two years. There have been no meetings with renewable energy companies, according to the records.Argentina has become a magnet for major oil companies after discovering the world’s third largest shale reserves in the world. It hopes to replicate the US energy revolution by encouraging oil companies to exploit the reserves within the Vaca Muerta region despite strong opposition from local communities.A Guardian investigation this month revealed that the fracking industry had already caused irreversible damage to the ancestral homeland of Argentina’s indigenous Mapuche people after an oil fire burned for more than three weeks next to a freshwater lake in Vaca Muerta.Argentina delivered its first-ever export of light crude and liquified natural gas from Vaca Muerta earlier this summer, five years after local community protest was quashed by authorities using teargas and rubber bullets.The UK’s loans to support work in Argentina have been modest to date, but are expected to rise as Argentina’s burgeoning shale industry increases production. One of the largest provisions has been for £346,000 to support the UK company working with BP’s PAE in the 2017-2018 financial year.The government’s plan to support Argentina’s shale industry comes after an investigation revealed an eleven-fold increase in support for fossil fuels over the past year to almost £2bn.The plans are strongly opposed by MPs on the environmental audit committee, which branded the UK’s foreign fossil fuel investments as the “elephant in the room” undermining the UK’s climate leadership.The UK government legislated earlier this year to commit to a zero-carbon economy by 2050, and is preparing to host the UN’s next major climate talks in Glasgow next year. The government’s climate efforts will be led by a new sub-committee within the cabinet office to be headed by the prime minister.Friends of the Earth warned that Boris Johnson must show global leadership ahead of the Glasgow UN summit by putting environmental responsibility and decarbonisation at the heart of every government policy – both at home and abroad.“Boris Johnson’s pledge to lead the world in slashing climate-wrecking pollution will be meaningless if his government continues to back the exploitation of massive oil and gas developments in Argentina,” Bosworth said.A UKEF spokesperson said “The UK has a wide range of economic and commercial interests in Argentina. In support of this UKEF can provide its support for exports on a commercial basis across all sectors; it does not ringfence support for a specific industry. UKEF welcomes the opportunity to support all viable UK exports including in the renewables and green growth sectors to Argentina”. UKEF did not offer evidence that it had met any renewable energy developers in Argentina."

"Ocean acidification can cause mass extinctions, fossils reveal","Carbon emissions make sea more acidic, which wiped out 75% of marine species 66m years ago",Damian Carrington,2019-10-21T20:00:36+0100,"Ocean acidification can cause the mass extinction of marine life, fossil evidence from 66m years ago has revealed.A key impact of today’s climate crisis is that seas are again getting more acidic, as they absorb carbon emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists said the latest research is a warning that humanity is risking potential “ecological collapse” in the oceans, which produce half the oxygen we breathe.The researchers analysed small seashells in sediment laid down shortly after a giant meteorite hit the Earth, wiping out the dinosaurs and three-quarters of marine species. Chemical analysis of the shells showed a sharp drop in the pH of the ocean in the century to the millennium after the strike.This spike demonstrated it was the meteorite impact that made the ocean more acidic, effectively dissolving the chalky shells of many species. Large-scale volcanic activity was also considered a possible culprit, but this occurred over a much longer period.The oceans acidified because the meteorite impact vaporised rocks containing sulphates and carbonates, causing sulphuric acid and carbonic acid to rain down. The mass die-off of plants on land after the strike also increased CO2 in the atmosphere.“We show ocean acidification can precipitate ecological collapse,” said Michael Henehan at the GFZ German research centre for geosciences in Potsdam, who led the study. “Before we had the idea, but we did not have the empirical proof.”The researchers found that the pH dropped by 0.25 pH units in the 100-1,000 years after the strike. It is possible that there was an even bigger drop in pH in the decade or two after the strike and the scientists are examining other sediments in even finer detail.Henehan said: “If 0.25 was enough to precipitate a mass extinction, we should be worried.” Researchers estimate that the pH of the ocean will drop by 0.4 pH units by the end of this century if carbon emissions are not stopped, or by 0.15 units if global temperature rise is limited to 2C.Henehan said: “We may think of [acidification] as something to worry about for our grandchildren. But if it truly does get to the same acidification as at the [meteorite strike] boundary, then you are talking about effects that will last for the lifetime of our species. It was hundreds of thousands of years before carbon cycling returned to normal.”The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analysed sediments that Henehan encountered by chance, during a conference field trip in the Netherlands. The sediments, which straddle the moment of the impact, lie in caves that were used by people hiding from the Nazis during the second world war. “It was so lucky,” said Henehan.The rocks contained foraminifera, small-shelled marine organisms. “In the boundary clay, we managed to capture them just limping on past the asteroid impact. But you can see their shell walls were much thinner and poorly calcified after the impact,” he said.It was the knock-on effects of acidification and other stresses, such as the “nuclear winter” that followed the impact, that finally drove these foraminifera to extinction, he said: “You have the complete breakdown of the whole food chain.” He said oceans also faced additional stresses today, from global heating to widespread pollution, overfishing and invasive alien species.Phil Williamson, at the University of East Anglia, who was not involved in the research, said: “It is relatively easy to identify mass extinction events in the fossil record, but much harder to know exactly what caused them. Evidence for the role of ocean acidification has generally been weak, until now.”He said caution was needed in making the comparison between the acidification spike 66m years ago and today: “When the asteroid struck, atmospheric CO2 was naturally already much higher than today, and the pH much lower. Furthermore, large asteroid impacts cause prolonged darkness.”Williamson added: “Nevertheless, this study provides further warning that the global changes in ocean chemistry that we are currently driving have the potential to cause highly undesirable and effectively irreversible damage to ocean biology.”Henehan said the generally lower ocean pH 66m years ago might have made shelled organisms more resilient to acidification. “Who knows if our current [marine] system is as well set up to cope with sudden acidification?”"
'Racism dictates who gets dumped on': how environmental injustice divides the world,"Five luminaries explain the concept of ‘environmental justice’ and reveal why, alongside the climate crisis, it is one of the most pressing issues of our time ",Nina Lakhani,2019-10-21T11:00:25+0100,"Today the Guardian is launching a year-long series, Our Unequal Earth, investigating environmental injustices: how ecological hazards and climate disasters have the harshest impacts on people of color, native tribes and those on low incomes.The most egregious examples include the lead poisoning crisis in Flint, Michigan, petrochemical pollution in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, and today’s series launch story, about an entire river that stops at the US-Mexico border, leaving ordinary Mexicans without water. Each of these cases has also prompted inspiring community activism.Our new environmental justice reporter, Nina Lakhani, asked five luminaries of the movement to explain “environmental justice” in their own words. They reveal why, alongside global heating and the extinction crisis, it is one of the most pressing issues of our time.Q: How did the environmental justice movement begin?I started working on environment and race in 1978/79 by collecting landfill data for a landmark civil rights lawsuit filed by my wife in Houston, Texas, against the city and the state. This study found that between the 1930s and 1978, 82% of all the waste in Houston was dumped in black neighborhoods, even though only 25% of the population was black. This was not random or isolated; it was targeted and widespread across the southern states and the nation. We lost in court but the concept of environmental racism was born.The seminal Environmental Justice principles adopted by the National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991 built on this [legal case] and became the foundation for social justice movements across the world. Even so, the same discrimination and racism continues to dictate who gets dumped on and who gets resources to mitigate floods, wildfires and other disasters. Of course those with wealth and political clout do best; if you have money you can buy bottled water or move house. The poor cannot go anywhere. Q: How are native communities affected by environmental discrimination?We cannot talk about environmental injustice without understanding the historical context of colonization and capitalism. The federal government put us on reservations on land they believed to be worthless, but many turned out to be rich in “resources”. This means we’re in the way of profits. In most cases we don’t want these megaprojects coming in and destroying our land and water, but it happens anyway. The situation is even worse for our brothers and sisters in the global south where people are silenced, disappeared and killed to make money with no hope of justice. I grew up in a community full of environmental injustices without knowing it. So many people I knew – young and old, men and women – got cancer, including me during my second year in college. I thought this was normal. Our territory is contaminated by the coal industry, uranium mining, over-fertilization and oil. But environmental injustice is a tangled web, it’s about so much more than pollution. Whenever there’s a new megaproject, the area is overwhelmed by men, there’s an influx of money and a rise in organized crime. After the oil boom in 2007, the number of missing and murdered indigenous women increased, and so did drugs. Gangs came and recruited our young people to sell drugs and many of these young men are now in jail or dead. Q: What role does the state play in creating environmental inequalities?Environmental injustice is about [the state] creating sacrifice zones where we place everything which no one else wants. The justification is always an economic one, that it makes sense to build chemical plants on so-called cheap lands where poor people and people of color live, but which are only cheap because all the wealth and economic opportunities have been stripped out. The people who live in these areas are unseen, unheard and undervalued. Environmental justice is about communities being able to reclaim their power, like Spartanburg in South Carolina, which received a $20,000 EPA environmental justice grant [to help clean up contaminated industrial sites], which it leveraged to almost $300m [from public and private sources, to build housing, a job training facility and health centers on the rehabilitated lands].It took a long, long time to build trust with communities, create statutes and programs, which are now being dismantled. The cuts to the EPA proposed by the Trump administration are about protecting the industries which supported Trump’s campaign, and power and discrimination. It’s about showing communities of color and poor communities the administration can do whatever it wants to them because their lives don’t matter.Q: The fight for ‘climate justice’ has become central to the environmental justice movement. Why are you and so many young people getting involved? Climate justice has mobilized young people because there’s something in it for everyone. Whether you care about animals, science, pollution, racism or sexism, all these issues are intertwined with the climate crisis in the worst possible way. Poor people and people of color are much more likely to die in climate disasters than rich people. This means addressing racism, colonialism and patriarchy, because inequalities do not exist in a vacuum, and neither does the climate crisis. It’s the result of all the other societal evils.For me, the climate crisis has been looming over my entire life – and future. Three things happened in 2017 which motivated me to act: the US leaving the Paris agreement, Hurricane Maria destroying Puerto Rico and the wildfires in Canada, which created a thick layer of smog over Seattle that felt apocalyptic. At the beginning my dream with the #ThisIsZeroHour campaign was to mobilize a lot of people for a youth climate march, but it’s got bigger and bigger and we now have a hundred chapters. So far it has been very US-focused but that’s changing. Q: What did we learn from the Flint scandal, in which 100,000 residents were exposed to excessive lead from their tap water?The Flint scandal showed the American people and the world that access to clean water in the US is not always a given. It showed that we have testing methods that are flawed, and we need them fixed, and that sometimes the people who are paid to protect us don’t always do what is in our best interests. It has become my personal mission to make sure we get the Lead and Copper Rule [a federal regulation which limits the concentration of these heavy metals in public drinking water] changed so it protects people like it’s supposed to. I want everyone to know that as of today the EPA has not kept its promises to fix the laws, and still allows states to cheat on water testing.Q: How can people get involved in the struggle for environmental justice?I was an ordinary citizen compelled to take action after watching my children break out in rashes, scream in agony from taking a bath, unexplained illnesses, losing their hair and being told the problem was specific to my house even though the same things were happening to children all over Flint.I made the decision to teach myself about how water is treated, about federal laws and about how to properly test water, because listening to governmental officials lie to my face disgusted me. When situations like this happen, everyday people need to protect themselves. They need to follow their gut if they feel something is wrong. They need to unite because together we are stronger.Sit down in your groups and communities and figure out people’s strengths. You will have defeats – use those as learning experiences. You will have victories, rejoice when those happen. Our environment plays a huge role in our health and future generations’ health, so it is our duty as ordinary people to protect it and fight back. We can make a difference.To contact Nina Lakhani, the Guardian’s new environmental justice reporter, e-mail nina.lakhani@theguardian.com."
Fowl language: Amazonian bird's mating call noisiest in world,White bellbird’s call reaches same volume as pneumatic drill during courtship ritual,Daniel Grossman,2019-10-21T16:20:16+0100,"A bird in the Amazon has shattered the record for the loudest call to be recorded, reaching the same volume as a pneumatic drill.The white bellbird, which lives in the mountains of the north-eastern Amazon, was recorded at 125 decibels (dB), three times louder than the next bird in the pecking order, the screaming piha.Mario Cohn-Haft, an ornithologist at the National Institute of Amazonian Research and the author of a paper published in the journal Current Biology, captured a male white bellbird specimen in the Brazilian state of Roraima in 2017.It was about 30cm (12in) long from beak to tail, said Cohn-Haft. He dissected it in the field, removing the skin and some organs to prepare it to be added to his collection. Something caught his eye under the bird’s pure white feathers: a muscular, sculpted chest. “It had a six pack,” he said, with tissue five times thicker than that of most birds its size.Cohn-Haft enlisted the help of Jeff Podos, an animal behaviour specialist at the University of Massachusetts and a co-author of the paper, to study the white bellbird. They suspected that the bird’s muscular physique might explain its earsplitting song: the male sings an explosive two-toned cry.Cohn-Haft and Podos returned to Roraima and crept up to within 40 metres (130ft) of white bellbirds singing from bare branches. They had brought a directional microphone and a precision audio recorder. In order to make accurate measurements, they had to make recordings with the birds facing them, with no intervening obstacles.The scientists also had front row seats to watch the birds’ bizarre courtship rituals. The female alights on a branch about a metre from the male, which promptly begins singing the louder of the two songs in its repertoire. Cohn-Haft said the male faces directly away from the potential mate for the first of the song’s notes. Then, in a fraction of a second, he swivels around and yells the second note “right in her face”.“She knows it’s coming,” said Cohn-Haft, because just before the second note she flutters back a few metres. The male has a long black wattle hanging down from the top of his head that whips around when he turns his head. “If she didn’t know any better she’d get it in the face,” he said.The bird’s song was recorded at 125dB, which Cohn-Haft and Podos say raises many questions. For starters, said Podos, “how can they do this without going deaf?” The researchers suggested the unusual call may be the result of sexual selection. Cohn-Haft speculated that plentiful food in the bellbird’s mountain habitat had allowed the species to become unhitched from strict obedience to the dictates of survival of the fittest.“Survival is easy enough, so these birds are free to develop traits that, whimsically or not, are attractive to each other.” He said these traits had more in common with the “beauty” of a song or a dance than utilitarian behaviours such as hunting or tools for fighting such as teeth and claws.“This is an example of sexual selection gone wild,” said Podos.He said there was no particular scientific benefit to identifying the most deafening birdsong, any more than there was to identifying the cheetah as the animal kingdom’s swiftest runner. But he said scientists garnered important insights from nature’s extremes. “It’s a good place to understand the limits of what nature can offer,” he said."
Renewable energy to expand by 50% in next five years - report,Energy agency says solar power will drive faster than forecast growth in renewables,Jillian Ambrose,2019-10-21T06:00:23+0100,"Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy.The International Energy Agency (IEA) found that solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years.Its latest report predicts that by 2024 a new dawn for cheap solar power could see the world’s solar capacity grow by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. Overall, renewable electricity is expected to grow by 1,200GW in the next five years, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US.“This is a pivotal time for renewable energy,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. “Technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are at the heart of transformations taking place across the global energy system. Their increasing deployment is crucial for efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution, and expand energy access.”The Guardian reported earlier this month that a renewable energy revolution could end the world’s rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies.Renewable energy sources make up 26% of the world’s electricity today, but according to the IEA its share is expected to reach 30% by 2024. The resurgence follows a global slowdown last year, due to falling technology costs and rising environmental concerns.However, Birol warned that the role of renewables in the global energy system would need to grow even faster if the world hopes to meet its climate targets.The report said growing climate ambitions in the European Union and the US played the biggest role in driving the IEA’s forecasts higher, but it will be China which leads the way in rolling out wind and solar energy projects.The IEA expects solar energy to play the biggest role in jumpstarting fresh growth in global renewable energy because falling costs are already below retail electricity prices in most countries.The cost of solar power is expected to decline by a further 15% to 35% by 2024, spurring further growth over the second half of the decade.The appetite of energy-hungry businesses and factories is expected to be the biggest driver of the solar power boom as company bosses exploit falling costs to help cut their energy bills.But the number of home solar panels is also expected to more than double to reach around 100m rooftops by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, California, the Netherlands and Austria.Even after the “spectacular” growth expected for solar over the next five years, panels will cover only 6% of the world’s available rooftops, leaving room for further growth.“Renewables are already the world’s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” Birol said.He warned that although the potential for solar power was “breathtaking” the rapid rollout could disrupt electricity markets unless regulators and utilities adapt."
"Scores more heart attacks and strokes on high pollution days, figures show",Data reveals acute impact on people’s health and the strain it puts on emergency services,Fiona Harvey,2019-10-21T00:01:09+0100,"Scores of children and adults are being rushed to hospital for emergency treatment on days of high pollution in cities across England, figures show.Each year emergency services see more than 120 additional cardiac arrests, more than 230 additional strokes and nearly 200 more people with asthma requiring hospital treatment on days of high pollution compared with the average on days of lower pollution.The data, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain that poor air quality is putting on already stretched NHS emergency resources.Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said: “These new figures show air pollution is now causing thousands of strokes, cardiac arrests and asthma attacks, so it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency. Since these avoidable deaths are happening now, not in 2025 or 2050, together we need to act now.”Previous studies have found spikes in hospital admissions and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air.The researchers defined high pollution days by dividing the year in two based on levels of pollution and comparing the number of cases of the relevant illness in the higher pollution half of the year with the number of similar cases on each day in the lower half.The data, collated by King’s College London (KCL), covers London, where there are 338 more emergencies a year on higher pollution days compared with low pollution days, Birmingham (65 a year), Bristol (22), Derby (16), Liverpool (28), Manchester (34), Nottingham (19), Oxford (10) and Southampton (16).Much of the recent research on air pollution has focused on the lifelong effects of chronic exposure, including cognitive decline, stunted growth in children and premature death. However, it can also bring on serious illness more immediately.Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Many people may not realise how dangerous air pollution at high levels can be, and that it can trigger heart attacks, strokes and asthma attacks as well as having long-term health effects. These figures will be a wake-up call for city leaders to take the strongest possible action.”The government has pledged to tackle air pollution in its environment bill, proposals for which were laid out after the Queen’s speech. Campaigners are concerned that the measures proposed are too vague and too weak.Polly Billington, the director of UK100, a network of local government leaders across England that have pledged to shift wholly to clean energy by 2050, said: “We would like to see World Health Organization air pollution standards included in the bill, as they are widely seen as gold standard, with a legally binding timetable to meet them, as that creates certainty and enables long-term planning. The absence of significantly increased powers for local leaders, together with a lack of reference to the need for adequate funding, are the big holes in the bill that will hold action back.”On Wednesday the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and UK100 will hold an international clean air summit with the World Health Organization (WHO) director general, Tedros Adhanom.Heather Walton, a health expert with the environmental research group at KCL, said the study was intended to provide more detail than others that have tended to concentrate on the effects of air pollution on life expectancy, such as estimates that pollution contributes to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK.By homing in on hospital admissions for cardiac arrests, strokes and asthma, the researchers were able to provide a clearer picture of the acute impacts on people and how emergency services are affected. “This provides additional evidence of the important need for further action to reduce air pollution,” Walton said.Bates said clean air zones were needed, but also measures to cut all traffic “because all vehicles produce deadly fine particle air pollution from brake and tyre wear. This way the air pollution health crisis and the climate emergency can be addressed together, helping to make our cities and towns healthier and more attractive.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and tackle pollution so people can live longer healthier lives. Our landmark environment bill will set ambitious, legally binding targets to reduce fine particulate matter and increase local powers to address key sources of air pollution.“We are already working hard to reduce transport emissions and are investing £3.5bn to clean up our air, while our clean air strategy has been praised by the WHO as an example for the rest of the world to follow.”Last week Europe’s environmental watchdog found that little or no progress had been made across Europe on cutting levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which is one of the most dangerous forms of pollution because it can lodge deep in the lungs and penetrate the bloodstream."
How to explore the world without harming it: Guardian climate pledge 2019,Guardian travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprint,Andy Pietrasik,2019-10-19T08:30:19+0100,"We recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on individuals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels; to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes; to meet people with different ideas and perspectives; to try out alternative lifestyles; to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes; to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the Guardian’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now diving instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."
"Farming could be absorber of carbon by 2050, says report","Veganism and trees could help stop agriculture contributing to global heating, study says",Fiona Harvey,2019-10-21T16:00:36+0100,"If one in five people in richer countries went near-vegan, and threw away a third less food than they currently do, while poor countries were assisted to preserve their forests and restore degraded land, the world’s agricultural systems could be absorbing carbon dioxide by 2050 instead of adding massively to global heating as they do at present.Tree-planting and improving the fertility of soil through better farming practices would also be needed, according to a study of global forests, farming and food systems published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Managing agricultural and other land in a more environmentally sound manner could take the world nearly a third of the way towards meeting the Paris agreement goals. “These [measures] are feasible now and deliver many other benefits,” said Stephanie Roe, environmental scientist at the University of Virginia and lead author of the paper.“Recent reports on the state of our forests and food systems show a worrying lack of progress in the land sector, and our window of opportunity to deliver on the Paris agreement is getting smaller. However, I remain optimistic because we have all the tools we need, as well as increasing public pressure and political will to turn things around.”The changes would also allow for healthier diets globally, improve livelihoods in poor areas, preserve wildlife and flora, and make for higher water and air quality. Many of the measures suggested, such as cutting food waste and shifting from excessive meat consumption, would also save money. For example, improving soil management through organic farming practices would cost about $57bn (£43.9bn) but save nearly $2tn over the period, according to one estimate used in the study.Land accounts for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, or 11 gigatons of carbon dioxide a year. With the right measures, according to the study, it would act instead as a carbon sink absorbing 3 gigatons from the atmosphere a year by 2050. That could give some scope for other sectors such as aviation to continue to use limited amounts of fossil fuels while staying within the global carbon budget needed to avoid a temperature rise of more than 1.5C (a rise of 2.7F) above pre-industrial levels.The authors set out a roadmap for the six large-scale measures they propose, including: reducing deforestation, peatland burning and mangrove destruction by 70%; restoring forests, peatlands and coastal mangroves to generate enough carbon dioxide saving to cancel out China’s annual emissions; planting trees to save as much carbon dioxide as that emitted by the EU.Improving farming practices, including moving to more organic practices, would mean better soil management that could cut carbon dioxide equal to India’s annual emissions. Consumer food waste in rich countries and big developing countries could be cut by a third, while the losses from food production in poor regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia could be cut drastically through simple measures such as more refrigeration and better transport. Moving a fifth of people to plant-based diets in developed and emerging countries, particularly the US, the EU, China, Brazil, Argentina and Russia, is seen as possible by 2030. These near-vegan diets would involve consuming less than 2,500 calories a day and no more than 60g of animal protein.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sThe physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.”Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.Jonathan Watts, Garry Blight and Pablo GutiérrezProf Thomas Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab, who was not involved with the study, said: “This is an excellent review of the many carbon drawdown solutions that the land can provide. There are immense benefits of restoring natural ecosystems like forests, wetlands and peatlands. Managed ecosystems can also be critical through effective agroforestry, biochar techniques and regenerative agriculture that can increase soil carbon sequestration. The review also reveals the considerable uncertainty and challenges that we face in realising this carbon drawdown potential, highlighting the need for more quantitative research into the scale and dynamics of carbon storage on land.”Developing nations are hoping that the forthcoming UN meeting on the climate emergency, COP25 in Santiago, will encourage rich countries to focus on helping them cut emissions through better land use and management of the oceans. A spokesperson for the UK’s Department for International Development said: “Cutting carbon emissions by helping developing countries change how they use and farm land is a priority for UK aid. We are fighting illegal deforestation and supporting poor farmers to make their practices greener. By making farming practices more efficient, we reduce the amount of land needed to produce food.”Nancy Harris of the World Resources Institute, a co-author of the study, said: “The longer we delay action to protect forests, the more difficult it will be to achieve the Paris agreement targets and the more we will need to rely on unproven negative emission technologies.”"
Artist creates deepfake birdsong to highlight threat to dawn chorus,Somerset House exhibit will feature natural birdsong being taken over by artificial sound,Dalya Alberge,2019-10-20T12:41:22+0100,"The dawn chorus is one of the wonders of the natural world, but a discordant note will be struck when a soundtrack of hundreds of birds is heard in London this month. The chiffchaffs, great tits, redstarts, robins and thrushes almost sound like the real thing, but they have been created by a machine as part of a major art installation warning of an apocalyptic world where Britain’s bird population has been allowed to diminish.The synthetic bird sounds are the creation of the artist Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg, who has worked with scientists at an AI company more used to researching Donald Trump deepfake videos to create the work. Through the installation, opening on 31 October within the vaulted chapel of Somerset House’s Embankment Galleries, Ginsberg says birdlife is under threat from modern urban lifestyles, with the cacophony of city life taking its toll.Birds sing to warn of danger, woo mates and establish territory. Against light and noise pollution, they struggle to be heard, risking vocal injury, while mating patterns are also disrupted, leading to falling populations.In the installation, a natural dawn chorus is taken over by the sound of artificial birds. With the sound designer Chris Timpson of Aurelia Soundworks, the artist has combined recordings of real birds with machine-generated responses, which are distinguishable by the machine-like distortion.Ginsberg said: “We chose species that would be found in an urban area … All are affected by the encroachment of sound and light pollution. Even building shapes affect how birds sing.“My work has been about our relationship with nature … I want the piece to ask difficult questions. What would we replace [birds] with and what do we lose? It will make us feel uncomfortable … but the piece will be enjoyable to listen to.”She added: “Urban birds such as sparrows, blackbirds and great tits have been found to sing higher, louder, and earlier, putting them at risk of predators. Near airports, blackbirds sing for longer and modify their song. Research has shown the chorus starting 23.8 minutes earlier in those environments.”This year, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) released a track of pure birdsong to raise awareness of the loss of over 40 million birds from the UK in just 50 years. It warned that the sound could be lost for ever as 56% of species in the UK were in decline.Ginsberg, who studied at Cambridge University and the Royal College of Art, has exhibited worldwide, including at the MoMA in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. She creates artworks, writings and curatorial projects that focus on ecology and technology. An earlier collaborative project resurrected the smell of extinct flowers, extracting DNA from a pressed hibiscus specimen.She has collaborated with Faculty, a London-based AI company, one of the leading researchers into AI-generated deepfakes of humans and of ways to combat their misuse. They worked with an NGO called Alliance of Democracies, set up by the former Danish prime minister and Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, to highlight the threat to democratic elections posed by political misinformation in the form of AI-generated deepfakes of politicians making controversial or inflammatory statements. As part of that work, Faculty built an AI deepfake Donald Trump and also worked on a detector to help people identify when a piece of audio or video is fake.The company also runs a fellowship programme for science PhDs, during which they can work on an AI project for a company, charity or, as in this case, an artist.By adapting a technique known as the generative adversarial network (GAN), which has been used to generate lifelike fake images of human beings, they have been able “to learn and generate” the songs of different bird species.Ginsberg said: “Not much work has been done with sound so far. We’re feeding thousands of individual recorded bird solos into the system to generate increasingly realistic clips of birdsong.”Synthetic sounds will be mixed with real sounds of species such as blackbirds, goldfinches, flycatchers and wood pigeons to create a 10-minute version of a dawn chorus.She said: “It will start with one bird singing, a natural bird – we’re choosing a redstart, which is normally one of the first birds to sing. That bird will sing his song solo. Normally the redstart would sing and he’d be saying, ‘I’m in this tree, I’m here,’ and another redstart would sing back. Instead, we have a machine singing back to him.”The work, titled Machine Auguries, will be accompanied by a light installation that mimics the rising dawn, beginning with “a blue-grey, silverly predawn light”, according to Ginsberg.Commissioned by Somerset House and A/D/O by Mini, Ginsberg is among a number of international artists showcased in the exhibition 24/7: A Wake-Up Call for Our Non-Stop World."
The new workwear: has the suit finally died?,Hardly anyone wears a suit to work now. How did we all get so scruffy? And what about all those lovely ties? Richard Godwin charts the demise of looking smart,Richard Godwin,2019-10-20T08:00:51+0100,"One afternoon about a decade ago, I was standing at a pub urinal not far from my old newspaper office when the man standing next to me opened up a conversation.“A tie, huh?” (He was American.) “Never take a job where they make you wear a tie.”He was in his mid-30s, wearing expensive-looking trainers, jeans and a sweatshirt. I was in my mid-20s, wearing my standard workwear: some nicely cut trousers, a decent white shirt, probably some black Chelsea boots and, yes, a tie that I would have taken some care selecting.I tried to explain that I liked my job. And I wasn’t forced to wear a tie, I chose to wear a tie. I liked ties! I liked how the French actor Romain Duris paired his tie with a high-collared leather jacket in the movie The Beat That My Heart Skipped. I liked how those old Italian dudes wore their ties on the Sartorialist blog. I liked how I never used to wear a tie and now I did and that meant I was a grown-up. I liked how people sometimes went: “Ooh, looking sharp,” and they definitely hadn’t said that a few years before, when I thought a Sparta Prague football shirt was the way to communicate how cosmopolitan and discerning I was.I even liked buying ties. So easy – one size fits all – and potentially bargainous. I had a fancy peacock silk one that my then-girlfriend-now-wife had bought me from Liberty, but also a weirdly chic green blobby-stripy one we found in an old flea market in Florence for about €2. But hang on – why am I justifying myself to a random toilet person? Who starts a conversation in a urinal?The kind of man who never wore a tie, clearly. The kind of man who refused to see the tie as anything other than a corporate noose around my neck. The kind of man whose workwear vision would ultimately prevail.For the American Neckwear Toilet Evangelist clearly had a better grasp of the future than I did. To wear a tie in 2019 is only marginally less eccentric than turning up to work dressed in chainmail. Formalwear, in general, is increasingly the preserve of dandies and defendants.According to market analysts Kantar, sales of suits are down 7% year-on-year, ties are down 6% and blazers down 10%. Marks & Spencer is cutting back on its formalwear; Moss Bros, the suit specialist, has issued three recent profit warnings. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs – whose bankers were once renowned for their Armani suits and Gucci loafers – announced a move to a “flexible dress code”. A company-wide memo cited the “changing nature of workplaces generally in favour of a more casual environment”. Other financial firms have since followed suit as the banks seek to emulate the “whatever” dress codes of the tech companies.The suit in turn has become “a uniform for the power- less”, according to the American site Vox – only worn by people impelled to do so. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wears a suit when he testifies before Congress. When he is in control, he wears the Silicon Valley uniform of T-shirts and jeans – and don’t think that isn’t its own form of power-dressing, a way of saying: “I’m not going to play by your rules.” Boris Johnson’s calculatedly dishevelled appearance is another way of communicating that, too. However, it’s his special adviser, Dominic Cummings, whose dress is emblematic of the age, somehow – a contemptuous mish-mash of athleisure, dadwear and public school signifiers: the grey Levi’s hoodie with workshirt poking out; the hurriedly grabbed tote bag; the quilted gilet. This mess is what the people voted for, he seems to be saying. Deal with it.I am now in my mid-30s and I don’t work in a London newspaper office any more. I am freelance and I do a lot of my writing in a co-working space in Bristol where I moved a couple of years ago, amid nut-butter influencers and CBD start-ups and 20-something digital marketing types who say things like: “Yeah, a third of my capital is in crypto.” It’s kind of fun. But I have never even attempted to wear a tie there. Bristol isn’t really a tie sort of city. Not having been called to testify before Congress recently (what have I been doing with my life?), I haven’t worn a suit for a while either. The grown-up accoutrements I collected in London – the vintage mother-of-pearl cuff links, the Brooks Brothers shirts, the Paul Smith socks – I sort of left behind. If you want to know the truth of it, I’m writing this in slightly mildewy jogging bottoms and luminous orange Adidas running shoes. And it doesn’t necessarily feel like a liberation.Clearly, I am not the only person readjusting to the new workwear rules. Dan Rookwood, formerly US editor of the menswear site Mr Porter, was once rarely seen without at least eight items of exquisite tailoring. He has recently taken a job as creative director at Nike, moved from New York to Portland, and adjusted his attire accordingly. “I now have the best wardrobe I’ve ever had – a proper walk-in wardrobe, where I can see all my clothes,” he says. “But what it shows me is that I can’t wear the vast majority of it any more. It’s all made-to-measure suits and shirts and ties and bench-made shoes that I just can’t see myself wearing outside the occasional wedding as the winds of style have changed. It’s like a museum.”Rookwood notes that the shift away from formal is industry-wide. “Men’s fashion changes more slowly than women’s fashion. But if you look at what men were wearing in 2014 compared to 2019, it is markedly different. This is a big change. We’re just not as buttoned up as we were.” The emphasis has moved from fine tailoring to luxury streetwear; from Milan and London to New York and Los Angeles; from Don Draper on the front of GQ to Kanye West on the sneaker site Highsnobiety. Louis Vuitton last year appointed West’s old associate Virgil Abloh as the artistic director of its menswear collection. Abloh made his name with the Chicago sneaker brand Off-White, where his stated mission was to add an “intellectual layer” to streetwear. While in the past, a woven silk tie from Brioni sent a subtle cue about status, now it’s more likely to be limited-edition Yeezys. There is a whole new set of rules to fall foul of – as the billion-heir Kendall Roy discovers in the HBO TV series Succession when he fails to impress some prospective clients by wearing a pair of Lanvin calfskin sneakers to a meeting.Rookwood feels that suits and all that will come around again – “everything comes back, eventually, in fashion” – but I’m not so sure. There’s a feeling of permanence in this shift, a once-and-for-all changing of the guard. You might cherish an idea of a father taking his son out to buy his first suit. Now a father is more likely to ask his son where to get a limited-edition Supreme hoodie. In any case, today’s 40- and 50-somethings grew up in a world of hip-hop and punk and trainers and tees. It’s what they know.Besides, when I survey a few not-particularly-fashion-y friends, they seem OK with the new relaxed dress codes. No, hardly anyone wears a suit to work any more. And no, hardly anyone mourns this loss. It’s just easier, freer and more comfortable to wear, say, a checked shirt and chinos. And if you happen to spill mayonnaise on your Urban Outfitted crotch while snarfing an al-desko sandwich, there’s usually no need to visit a dry-cleaner either. Economy comes into play. One friend notes that if you spend £100 on a suit, you will end up with a rubbish suit, but if you spend £100 on trousers and a shirt, you can look sharp and distinctive. He does keep a suit in the office, just in case he needs to go and meet that sort of client. But it’s become the sartorial equivalent of a fax machine; a faintly arcane piece of equipment reserved for specific uses.It wasn’t supposed to be like this, notes the American style writer David Coggins. “If you look at the men who wear formalwear well, they always look incredibly relaxed and ultimately comfortable. That’s what style is: it’s having a sense of ease with yourself in any situation.”The idea of tailoring wasn’t about following trends – massive collars one season, tiny ones the next, etc – it was to find something that worked for your shape, your build, your outlook. It was a process that required a certain self-knowledge. I suppose there’s no reason why luxury streetwear shouldn’t provide the same journey. I mean, when Frank Ocean sings about Nikes, it sounds like a meaningful relationship. But one thing that troubles me about this new power-dressing is the emphasis on branding, labels, items that cost hundreds of pounds not because an apprenticed tailor has spent a long time crafting it, but simply because that’s what the market says this thing is worth. Enforced sneakerdom is its own tyranny.Coggins suggests we have come to place too high a value on comfort as a society. “It used to be accepted that you would go through stages of slight discomfort to have an education. So you would read difficult books, or you’d sit through some operas, and maybe the first time you didn’t like it, but you would learn to like it – or at least appreciate what it is at stake. Now there’s this thought that comfort is everything. People dress as if they’re at home all the time, and they act like they’re at home when they’re in public. It’s why people lie down on the floor in airports and Facetime in restaurants and put their feet up on train seats.”There’s another aspect of this that troubles me. One of the pleasures of wearing a suit to work, for me, was shedding it when I got home. Now there is less distinction between work and home, on and off, public and private. I might be answering a work email at 10.37pm, I might be having a nap at 3.07pm, I might be tapping away in a café a 11.45am on a Sunday while families brunch around me.Some freelancers I consult cherish the freedom of working in their pyjamas – “If you can’t motivate yourself without a literal suit on, maybe freelancing is not for your temperament,” says one. Another notes the environmental cost of maintaining a full office wardrobe with a different outfit each day. But others warn against the entropic lure of Uniqlo stretch jogging bottoms.Freelancers warn against the entropic lure of Uniqlo stretch jogging bottomsPersonally, I’m usually in some smart-casual-compromise outfit that is neither truly smart nor truly casual. Maybe some overly formal trousers and some underly white Stan Smiths. Maybe a canvas tote bag with my laptop in it, or a shirt that could use an iron – but am I going to iron a shirt for the school run?I am more often than not in trainers. I find brogues or loafers make a huge clomping noise on the laminate floor of my co-working space. And when I come up to London, I’m often, literally, running between meetings. I can’t help thinking that the move towards trainers as acceptable workwear has a lot to do with the fact that work is now so much a question of inputs and outputs; life is just hectic; we’re expected to “perform” like athletes. But the trainer is also the footwear of the retired, the overleisured, the underemployed.In Nikolai Goncharov’s 1859 novel Oblomov, the dressing gown worn by the title character – khalat in Russian – becomes a symbol of the turpitude of the archetypal 19th-century “superfluous man”. There is even a word in Russian – khalatnost, “dressing-gown-ness” – to describe the condition. I wonder what the 21st-century equivalent would be. Sneakerness? Jerseyness? Dressing-down-ness?I say I never wear a suit and tie any more. The one exception was a recent 20-year university reunion which required all of the men to dress in “lounge suits”. Everyone remarked on how they never wore suits and ties these days. Everyone spent the evening complimenting one another. And everyone, I sensed, enjoyed looking their unashamed best. What if you never had the chance to look your best again? What kind of future would that be?

Tomatoes are good for sperm count – if only I had known that years ago,A man’s worry seems to be hardwired – as if being fertile constitutes a meaningful measure of masculinity,Adrian Chiles,2019-10-09T18:07:22+0100,"I read that tomatoes might be good for a fella’s sperm count. Sperm’s always been a worry for me, ever since the day of the 1978 FA Cup final. I’ll spare you the goriest of the details, but the long and, er, short of it is that I fell off my bike going to my nan and grandad’s house to watch the match and sustained serious injuries to my pudenda. Fifteen stitches were required to sew my boyhood up, but I made it home in time for kick off, which is all I cared about. I was only 11, after all.My parents had other worries. I don’t know whether some doctor at casualty at Corbett hospital in Stourbridge had said anything, but they were concerned about how my fertility might be affected. Mercifully, having begat two children 20 years later, all seemed to be in fair working order. And almost 20 years after that, I found myself doing a radio item about the National Sperm Bank. This involved having my own stuff analysed. Having breezily agreed to do this, I found myself in a small room in a fertility clinic in London trying to conjure up a sample, with a colleague called Steve standing outside holding a microphone.“Now,” said the white-coated woman when I handed her the vessel, “when I bring your results, are you sure you’re OK for it to be recorded? Many men are sensitive about it.” Why would I care? My procreating days were well behind me. Except suddenly I did care; the concern seemed to be hardwired, as if being pointlessly fertile constituted some meaningful measure of masculinity.Silly really. My heart bled for the blokes who had struggled with this for real. How much anxiety must those walls have witnessed?It took ages for the woman to reappear. She had a studiedly neutral look on her face. “Can I just check your age again?” she said. She made a couple of notes and then announced that, for men of my age, the World Health Organization reckons 15m sperms per millilitre is the average. With deadpan authority she then told me I was rolling with no fewer than 32m of the things and they were quite active, or something. I felt great relief and, absurdly, no small amount of pride. I was walking an inch taller as I strode out of that clinic. And this feeling grew and grew all day.That evening I was on a long motorway drive. Anytime I overtook a female driver, I made sure my window was up, lest one of my 32m had slipped out earlier and was lurking around me looking for an egg to fertilise.However, it wasn’t long before I was put in my place. During the course of the live show from the National Sperm Bank in Birmingham, I met a guy from Northfield, south of the city, who was one of the star donors. “What kind of numbers you posting, mate?” I asked airily, waiting to slap my 32m on the table between us. “Eighty-five million,” he replied. Enough said. My sperm might not have that much going for them after all, but I’ll say this much for my virility: anyone who can do a three-hour live show from a sperm bank must be doing something right."
"‘I’d say I had a mastectomy, and my mates would go: “But you’re a man!”’","Breast cancer affects far fewer men than women. But that’s no reason to ignore warning signs that include lumps, sores, discharges and bleeding",Sirin Kale,2019-10-07T08:00:44+0100,"Andy Manson’s wife, Michelle, had to force him to go to the doctor. Manson, a broadband engineer from Reading, had been experiencing a stabbing pain in his left nipple for months. But he ignored it until December 2013, when it got so bad that Michelle insisted. “She said: ‘I don’t know what you’re playing at!’” Manson remembers.The speed with which the GP referred him to the breast clinic at the Royal Berkshire hospital was Manson’s first inkling that something was wrong. “You figure it’s more than just a pain,” Manson, now 48, remembers. He was right. He had stage four breast cancer that had spread to his lymph nodes. Six years on, following a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Manson’s cancer is in remission – and he is hugely thankful he listened to his wife. “I was lucky,” he admits. “I didn’t go to the doctor as quickly as I should have, but I got away with it and – touch wood – I’m in the clear.”Often mistakenly viewed as a women-only disease, breast cancer can, and does, strike men, including Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé’s father, who went public with his diagnosis last week.According to research from Breast Cancer Now, about 370 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK (versus 55,000 women). Most will get the diagnosis between the ages of 60 and 70. Like women, they are more likely to develop it if they are obese.Because men are more reluctant to visit GPs – and because of the misconception that only women can get breast cancer – their breast cancer is typically more advanced by the time it is diagnosed. “When men have a suspicious lump in their chest, they often disregard it,” says Prof Valerie Speirs of the University of Aberdeen, a cancer biologist who specialises in male breast cancer. “This means they usually present at a later stage than women and the cancer can be more difficult for clinicians to treat, because it’s spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.”“Men need to be breast aware,” says Grete Brauten-Smith, a clinical nurse specialist for Breast Cancer Now. She advises men to look out for breast lumps, which can be painless or close to the nipple, inverted nipples, sores on the chest or nipples that won’t heal, swelling under the arm or in the chest area, or nipple discharge, which may also be bloody. “It’s so important that they check their breast tissue, get to know any changes and report them to their GP.”“It was such a shock,” Doug Harper, 57, from Plumstead, says of his breast cancer diagnosis. “I remember telling my mates and them saying: ‘What do you mean? Men can’t get breast cancer.’” Like Manson, Harper was cajoled into visiting the GP in January 2012 by his wife, after mistakenly thinking he had a cyst on his nipple. “She said: ‘Go to the doctor – this is getting annoying.’” When he took off his T-shirt, the doctor’s entire demeanour changed. Jokingly, Harper asked the doctor if it might be cancer. “He said: ‘It could be.’ I said: ‘Oh God.’”Male breast cancer sufferers will find themselves in a system designed for women. When he was recovering from his mastectomy at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich, Harper’s wardmates asked what procedure he was in for. “I’d say I had a mastectomy for breast cancer, and they’d say: ‘That can’t possibly be right.’”He was given the leaflet of a support group, but the wording only referred to female patients. Men attending breast cancer clinics will often be pegged as supportive partners, rather than patients. “You sit in the mammogram waiting room, and you’re the only bloke there,” Manson says. “You feel like people are looking at you, thinking you shouldn’t be there.”At present, men are excluded from breast cancer clinical trials, although the situation is improving. “There’s more research into breast cancer in men than there was before. People are starting to realise that male breast cancer needs to receive the same kind of attention that female breast cancer has for years,” Speirs says. More work still needs to be done. “I’d like there to be more awareness of male breast cancer. Everything is a sea of pink.” (The international symbol for breast cancer is a pink ribbon.)Having breast cancer as a man can be isolating in other ways. The cancer drug Tamoxifen’s side effects can include impotence, which men may find embarrassing or difficult to talk about. After being diagnosed in January 2012, Harper didn’t meet another man with breast cancer until July of that year, when he took part in a charity event.“I made a beeline for him,” he remembers. “I just wanted to talk with someone else who had been through the same as me.” (Breast Cancer Now runs a matching service to connect male breast cancer patients with other men with the condition.)Recently, when he was going for a routine mammogram – his cancer is in remission – Harper saw a young man in his 20s being screened. He wanted to pass on his details, but decided against it in case he alarmed him. “I’ve always wondered how he got on.”"

I’m crazy about my girlfriend but I can’t maintain an erection,"We see each other rarely, and I want to make each time special. But then this happens …",,2019-09-24T10:00:12+0100,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for five months and I’m absolutely crazy about her. She lives abroad, so when we see each other we want to make it special. Everything about our sex life is amazing, until it comes to intercourse, when I can’t maintain an erection. It’s really getting me down and, to be honest, I don’t feel like a man. I think to myself: “What if she thinks it’s her?” and I tell her it’s not, but I just don’t know what it is. I find her so sexually attractive and I just want to show her how much – but when this happens, I’m just so embarrassed. Any help would be massively appreciated.Long-distance relationships can be maintained well, but there are frequently accompanying anxieties and pressures. It is understandable that you would consider every moment you have together as special and important, but this creates enormous performance anxiety for you, which can negatively affect any man’s erectile capacity. Help her to understand this fact, and decide together to try to have very relaxed, easy sex that is simply pleasure-focused rather than goal-oriented. Stop expecting fabulous sex the moment you see each other, and instead plan some non-sexual fun such as dinner or an outing to give yourselves time to warm up. When you feel fully relaxed, approach lovemaking without any expectations. If you set out to please and arouse her in non-penetrative ways – and seek her feedback regarding this – you will take the pressure off your wish for erections “on demand”.• Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.• If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

Why I worry about men who marry women 40 years younger than them,65-year-old Dennis Quaid is engaged to 26-year-old Laura Savoie – which will be his fourth marriage and continue an interesting pattern,Poppy Noor,2019-10-22T18:12:08+0100,"Dennis Quaid, a 65-year-old man who already looks like his own waxwork, yesterday announced his engagement to Laura Savoie. At 26, she already looks like every one of his three ex-wives – if none of them ever aged. And while I do think we should all be able to date anyone we like as long as it’s consensual, I do worry about him a little bit.In general, I worry about any man who chooses to date a woman 40 years younger – mainly because she will always outperform him in sports, but also because it’s awkward when people can’t tell if your companion is your daughter or your wife.Quaid’s first wife, the actor PJ Soles, of Carrie fame, was three years older than him when they married and no one batted an eyelid. When Quaid married his second wife, also a blond actor – Meg Ryan, heard of her? – everyone wished them well. Ryan is eight years younger than Quaid.If once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and the third time is a pattern, perhaps we should have seen the next one coming – a bit like a Russian doll.At the tender age of 50, Quaid married his third wife, Kimberley Buffington, then 34, and the couple had twins. Could anyone have guessed what happened next?Well, probably. Quaid is well-known for his starring role as the father of twins in the Parent Trap. As actor Elaine Hendrix, who played his 26-year-old fiancee in the Parent Trap pointed out, the real life script had already been written: in the movie, Quaid’s character, the father of twins, splits from his wife and gets engaged to a 26-year-old blond woman.Watch out for those twins. 👯‍♀️ https://t.co/Rloat1gLCyNow, I hear some of you already: so what if Quaid is now marrying a 26-year-old? Maybe she is wise beyond her years, or maybe Quaid is just immature. That’s not to mention that his new young fiancee has the free will to marry whomever she likes – it would be unfeminist not to point this out, right?I agree that as long as they’re happy, we should be happy for them. But if Quaid keeps on consecutively marrying younger and younger, then disregarding the math in this case would be reckless.As one very astute commentator has pointed out, the trend foretells a very worrying future for Quaid’s future engagement prospects.“His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger. His fourth wife will be forty years younger.”The logical end to this pattern? “Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet.”His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger.His fourth wife will be forty years younger.

When it comes to blusher don’t be bashful,"Not just for the young, rouged cheeks can revitalise your complexion",Funmi Fetto,2019-10-20T06:30:46+0100,"There is something “girlie” about blusher. Hence, there is an idea it has an age limit. Total nonsense, of course, as shown at Chanel AW19. Yes, it has youthfulness written all over it, but it is magic for a complexion that needs resuscitation. Nailing technique, shade and texture is key. For definition, without the faff of contouring, circular strokes of a powder blush on the cheekbones blended up and out is best. For ease, less density and a freshness that is unsurpassed, go for a cream. Pinks are flattering – paler shades, paler skin; deeper shades, deeper skin – but orange will give you a warm glow.

Back in the day, this modern epidemic was limited to insomniacs and new mothers. I can remember lacking a decent snooze for so long that I understood why sleep deprivation was used as a form of torture. Nowadays, everyone is functioning on little sleep. Arguably, it’s because we are all so ‘busy’. Busyness has become a status symbol for our age. We are always ‘on’ and it’s becoming impossible to switch off. And that’s why our cortisol levels (the stress-producing hormone) are through the roof. For better sleep, the experts recommend removing electronic devices from the bedroom, exercising during the day and managing your circadian rhythm – the body’s internal clock – by reducing our exposure to bright lights at least three hours before bed. I’ll add another tip. Get yourself a ‘sleep mist’. I know, it sounds ridiculous and a bit basic, but it really helps. This one has blended essential oils – neroli, chamomile, lavender and geranium, all known for their sleep-enhancing properties – in a distilled flower water concoction. Half an hour before bed I go to town and spray it everywhere for good measure. Sleep comes quick and goes deep.

I thought I knew about feminism – then I started work in a women’s prison,"I wanted to teach the inmates about female empowerment.

I had the word “FEMINIST” written in black marker pen across the front of my homework diary aged 15, along with an anti-war sticker that incongruously involved a cupcake. I had graduated from the “girl power” of my primary school years to reading Germaine Greer on a beanbag in the college library. I felt sorry for the girls in sixth form getting Brazilians, who, unlike my enlightened self, clearly hadn’t clocked that waxing was a tool of patriarchal oppression. I studied feminist theory, went to feminist gatherings and listened to feminist podcasts. I had spent several evenings sitting cross-legged at a “collective” organised by other middle-class, university-educated women talking about intersectionality and Frida Kahlo. By the time I graduated from university, I had firmly absorbed a list of the correct ideas and words that I needed to be a “proper feminist” (but was probably not someone you wanted to invite to a dinner party).In 2015, two years after graduating, I began a job working in a high-security women’s prison. I had read enough statistics and policy reports before I started to know that women in prisons were in desperate need of a little female empowerment. But what I quickly learned was that my feminist education had a thick wedge of information missing: namely, the part where it connected to actual women being very fundamentally oppressed because of their gender. Confronted by someone whose cervix had been plugged with four egg-sized capsules of crack cocaine on the behest of a controlling boyfriend who would reap the profits, I found it difficult to work out quite how my Frida Kahlo T-shirt and mansplaining radar were going to help things.I quickly learned that my feminist education had a thick wedge of information missingWomen in prison are a group statistically likely to be on the wrong side of almost any curve: to have grown up in areas of deprivation and be victims of childhood sexual exploitation, sexual and domestic violence, domestic homicide and homelessness. Half of women in prison are there for committing a crime to support someone else’s drug habit – almost always a man’s. For some, this crime is selling sex from pavements, or soliciting; for plenty of others it is professional shoplifting, known as “grafting”. This means pocketing anything from fillet steak to mascara to be resold round the houses. In the months leading up to Christmas, shopping lists are collected in pubs for toys and gifts to be stolen on request and sold cut-price. Women are sent out on these grafting missions because they are seen as less conspicuous than men.Needless to say, I was very green in my first few months in prison. I worked between the education and chaplaincy departments and the majority of my time was spent running art classes to help women with their personal development and self-expression.I had been helping to run a soup kitchen, and lived at a community house where we gave homeless people emergency shelter in our spare room, so I had naively thought the problems would feel familiar. It was so different, though, when those issues – unstable housing, addiction and abuse – were condensed in the prison, packed into classrooms and three metre by two metre cells.In one session, we asked the women to make an A3 map of their lives from torn-up magazines. The collage would show a road that meandered from their past experiences to future goals. Almost every road began with bottles of vodka, syringes and shadowy characters, and almost every one ended with symmetrical houses and white wedding dresses and Laura Ashley sofas. I had spiked the magazine pile with my partner’s railway-modelling magazines and glossy Sunday supplements in the hope of inspiring something different – a new job, an interesting hobby, some travel, perhaps? – but to little avail. “What else would you be doing in the future?” I asked Cathy*, looking at the scenes of domesticity she aspired to. “You’ve been writing some beautiful poetry about your experiences,” I told her. “I could help you get them published as part of a campaign for prison reform.”Cathy was about my age (29) but since leaving the care system had only known the control of either a man or the state. She, like many others, was a shoplifter and was frequently in and out of prison for theft and drug possession. “It will be finding ‘the one’ that will get me out of my mess,” she said. “He will look after me and keep people away who come round trying to sell me gear [heroin] again.”Cathy’s was an oft-told story. She had been prevented from seeing her children by social services because she couldn’t stop seeing an abusive partner. He kept coming round and, against her best judgment, she opened the door.What I wanted to say was that she didn’t need a man to straighten her life out for her, that she had “everything she needed inside of her” (life advice that works best when Instagrammed over a picture of a thin white girl walking into a sunset).In time I came to realise that she was probably right. Ambition and independence are a good deal further up the hierarchy of need than security. It’s pretty realistic to assume that the quickest way to ward off a coercive and abusive man is to find another man who is kinder and stronger to stand in the way.Prison changed my attitude to sex work, too. The jail had just appointed its first female governor and she was keen to put feminism on the agenda for International Women’s Day that year. My projects (I had previously hosted a lecture by a non-binary Mars astronaut, run a workshop on gender-neutral pronouns and started a choir that sang protest songs) that would have been met with eye-rolls before her arrival were now enthusiastically scheduled: a showing of the film Made in Dagenham followed by a debate on the gender pay gap. The learning and skills department was running a concurrent visit from a local museum, featuring artefacts from the suffragette movement.I had engaged with ideological debates on the topic of sex work before, of course I had. I knew that to question whether sex work is really like any other work would make you a dreaded “swerf” (sex worker exclusionary radical feminist) and – like the patriarchy – is an attempt to control what women do with their bodies. People don’t need rescuing, the theory goes, they need rights and unions.I had assumed that sex work was well paid. Most women could only keep 10%Phoebe was the first to speak after I had introduced the topic of equal pay and sexism in the workplace. She was, as many of the women in prison were, “on the game”. She worked as an escort, managing her business online, so she could charge her own prices and didn’t need to rely on a pimp. She was fairly new to the jail, and had been transferred from a big city prison, ruffling the other inmates with her manicured nails and diamante sliders. “I don’t think women get it worse at all,” she said. “We get doors opened, bought presents, we got everything we need to get what we want right here.” She ran her hand down the length of her body and winked. “You can’t do that if you’re a man.”She directed her comments pointedly to the woman next to her. Lesley was the kind of sex worker we more often see in prison, known as a “survival sex worker”, someone on the game because they have no other choice. Lesley sold £6 blowjobs from street corners to fund her and her partner’s heroin addictions, the signs of which showed on her face, with hollowed cheeks and yellowed teeth. Before I worked in prisons, I had assumed that sex work must be quite well paid per hour – that even those with a pimp could surely enjoy a 60:40 split of the takings. This was wishful thinking. Although there are plenty of women like Phoebe, they are less likely to end up in jail, meeting people like me. Most of the women I met were getting more like 10%, or being paid in drugs and housing rather than cash. The almost universally male pimps often have a group of women in their employ and rake in the takings in return for protection. In other words, it’s a racket. Survival sex work has a worse gender pay gap than almost any other industry. “Does anyone disagree with Phoebe?” I asked. There was a silence, then Lesley piped up. “I don’t see anyone’s boyfriends having to go out on the game,” she said. Phoebe rolled her eyes. “No one’s making you, babe. And no one is setting your prices that low either.” I started to sense that there was some sort of argument from the wing going on here that I was not aware of, and the spat was working its way into our discussion in the guise of a price war. “You’re bringing everyone’s prices down with what you charge on the pavement, you slut.” By this point, they had both got up. “We do the same thing,” Lesley shouted. “Don’t you go thinking you’re better than me.” By this point, I had lost the room. Security had arrived. And the questions I had planned about unionisation and female solidarity were drowned out by more immediate concerns.It was not the International Women’s Day I had planned. But as happened so often in my time in prison, the theories and beliefs I came in with sat uncomfortably next to the nuance of the reality. The majority of sex workers I met in prison, who arrived with bruises and track-marks, would rather have been doing anything else. They needed their rights protected, sure, but they also wanted a route out. The reality was not simple. It rarely is.I learned that my idealism had made me treat feminism like a club rather than a journey. My self-congratulatory, cross-legged-femcast feminism was not flexible enough to accommodate the volume of women’s conflicting experiences, thoughts and feelings in the prison.The truth is that some women want to start a business, and others would like the safety and security provided by giving control to a trustworthy man, at least for now. Some sex workers want unions, others want an escape route. For feminism to be at all useful, it has to be uncomfortable. It has to include people whom it would be easier to leave out: women who say they’re not feminists; who think they need a man to save them, or who say they fancy Piers Morgan.Working in prison messed up my ideas of what feminism should be. It didn’t invalidate the ideas I had learned and fought for, it just disrupted the clean lines, leaving me with unresolved tensions and fewer opinions. I went into prison thinking that I would be able to use feminism to help empower women, and to reform a system. Instead I met women who taught me about feminism, and saw myself change instead.* Women’s names have been changed.• Jailbirds: Lessons from a Women’s Prison by Mim Skinner is published by Seven Dials (RRP £16.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020 3176 3837.

Team older feminist: am I allowed nuanced feelings about #MeToo?,"After #MeToo, I wondered if my real problem with young feminists was how little they seemed to need us older ones. As far as I could see, they didn’t even want to know us",Meghan Daum,2019-10-16T06:00:15+0100,"I remember a woman who screamed like a feral animal. She was leather tan and sinewy. Spiked bleached blonde hair, sculpted biceps, low-slung cargo pants with Doc Martens, veins bursting from her neck, eyes bugging from her drawn face.She stood on the sidewalks of New York City with a folding table covered with poster-size images from hardcore pornography: women wearing dog collars, women on leashes, women leaned over and viewed from behind, their backs crosshatched with scars. Much of the time she displayed a blowup of the famous Hustler magazine cover showing a naked woman being fed upside down into a meat grinder.“This is what your husbands are masturbating to,” she shouted in a barking monotone. “Wake up, women! Don’t be passive! Sign the petition!”Most everyone turned away or just kept walking. This was back in 1990. I was 20.To be 20 years old in 1990 in New York City was, as far as I was concerned, to own the world. I owned practically nothing of material value back then, but somehow this was all part of a magical transaction in which I knew I’d eventually get ahead even if it seemed, for the moment, like I could barely keep up. The city was still a wild kingdom, a stone-and-steel fortress with rage burning inside. The crack epidemic was long under way and also a long way from ending. Aids was everywhere – ravaging the bodies of the visibly ill and beckoning from public service announcements that preached condoms or death. The graffiti was only beginning to come off the subway cars.Every man, woman and, yes, many children (including those commuting to fancy prep schools) had been mugged or knew someone who had. Every woman knew what it was like to be creepily rubbed against by some dude in a crowded space, and when this happened many of us either jammed our elbows into his abdomen or rolled our eyes and moved away.One time, as I walked down a mostly empty Columbus Avenue around midnight, a man walked up to me – a redheaded, bearded man perhaps 10 years my senior – reached his hand out, and shoved me just below my left collarbone. It was a fairly hard shove, and I almost lifted my arm to shove him back. Instead, the moment passed and I just looked at him in disgust and confusion as we both continued along our way. I remember feeling grateful that the situation hadn’t escalated into anything worse.What I don’t remember is connecting the incident to anything like what would now be called institutionalized misogyny. This was not systemic oppression of women. This was simply life in the big city.Today, the angry, ranting woman with the folding table is gone from the sidewalk. In her place are millions of angry women marching in the streets and, even more so, ranting online. We are tiny pixels coalescing into a giant portrait of rage in all its definitions.Twenty years after the redheaded man shoved me on Columbus Avenue, men were going down like bowling pins against the unstoppable forces of #MeToo. What could you call the fall of 2017 other than the Fall of the Fall of Man. It was a season of hurricanes and rapid soil erosion, namely the mudslide that began with Harvey Weinstein and quickly pulled more men down with it than anyone could reasonably keep up with.Or maybe that’s the wrong metaphor. Maybe it wasn’t a mudslide as much as a giant oil spill from the tanker on which contemporary western society had been carrying its assumptions about male behavior. Like fossil fuels themselves, this behavior had long been construed as a necessary evil, one for which any purported cure seemed as futile and flimsy as a reusable shopping bag. (Hit him with your stiletto if he gets handsy! Make him get in touch with his feelings! Pry his eyes open and force him to read the Scum Manifesto!)I’m not going to even try to summarize the events of that fall or list the men who went down in the spill of #MeToo. Entire books will be written about that movement, the best of which probably can’t be embarked upon until enough years have passed to allow authors even a modicum of perspective. What I can tell you about the fall of 2017 is that it coincided with a downward slope of my youth that was far steeper than I had any grasp of at the time.The autumn of 2017 marked my second year back in New York City after being away for the better part of two decades, most of it in California. Though I’d left California in 2015 in the wake of irremediable, if mercifully amicable, marital separation, it had taken nearly two years to officially get divorced, and this new status carried a sting whose effects sometimes proved paralytic. How could I have imagined that replacing the license plates on your car could feel like a death? (Somehow I’d managed to keep my car registered in California until the last possible minute.) Who knew that shopping for a new health insurance policy could make you feel like you’re on a plastic pool raft floating aimlessly in the Dead Sea? (OK, I guess everyone knows that.)I’d left New York when I was nearly 30. I was now 47. Whereas my chief experience of the city was that of a young woman, I was now faced with re-entering it as a middle-aged one.It wasn’t just that I had been young in New York; New York was my youth. It was the place where I’d spent my entire 20s. It was the place where I figured out what kind of person I wanted to be. That’s a different thing from actually figuring out how to be that person, and it took leaving New York to accomplish that task, but as they like to say in California, setting your intention is the most important phase of the journey.New York was the backdrop for my earliest triumphs and stupidities. It was the first and last place I ever lived where on any given night you could step outside and feel like absolutely anything could happen, that the course of your life could shift like a subway train switching from the local track to the express.It was the place where I had my first real job, my first grown-up boyfriend, my first martini, my first call from a debt collector, my first call from a hospital pay phone telling me someone was in serious trouble. It was the site of my earliest rough drafts and rough treatments, the ones visited upon me as well as the ones I inflicted on others. Now that I had returned, it was as if my 20s were being handed back to me in used condition. What a strange remnant to hold in your hand; what a bittersweet walk down memory’s plank.Here I was again, a girl alone and on the town. I was my most primordial self, a girl who was rabidly ambitious in some ways but inexplicably lazy in others. I was a girl who technically hadn’t been a girl for the better part of 30 years but who nonetheless felt a strange remove from the word “woman”, which seemed to convey a poise and seriousness I hadn’t yet attained.I may have been in my mid-40s, but I was still all jokes and hammy self-deprecation, still unable to accept compliments, still flirting with men by defaulting to my best Diane Keaton in Manhattan impression, even though it had been decades since I was attracted to the kind of men who were attracted to that.I was all the things I’d been when I was young except for the young part. I had a nicer apartment, a little more money, and a little more professional recognition. I had a dog (this I’d longed for in my 20s the way some women long for babies) and a car that I had to move for alternate-side street cleaning. But my days were more or less the same. I sat at my desk and drank coffee. I did my work when I could, but more often I stared into space and wondered what would become of my life. I surfed the internet at a connection speed that would have been unimaginable in 1995.In part because of that connection speed, the space I stared into most of the time wasn’t my own physical space but some unholy rotation of social media, news media and floating junk courtesy of cyberspace. By the time Donald Trump entered office, I probably spent at least three-quarters of my waking hours with my head in this space. By the time #MeToo reached full force, my brain no longer felt connected to my body. At times, my brain no longer felt associated with my brain as I’d once known it. There were moments in which I couldn’t remember the names of people I’d been acquainted with for years.In intense, animated conversations with friends and colleagues, I’d find myself revving up to some sort of grand insight and then suddenly sputtering out mid-sentence, like a rollercoaster propelled halfway up a loop but unable to make it all the way around. Bunched up in my desk chair, I would stare at the computer screen for hours, hunting for words as though tracking lions on safari and practically sweating from the exertion. More than a few times I wondered if I was experiencing some form of dementia.I once read that there’s scientific proof of a correlation between increased nostalgia and creeping senility. And since returning to New York, I’d been soaking in nostalgia. Everywhere I went, my 20s played in my head like a song stuck there permanently. Every neighborhood, every subway station, in some areas every street corner, echoed with some memory from that time. There was John’s pizzeria on Bleecker, where, at 21 and playing hooky from college upstate, I sat with a man – a boy, really – who both was and wasn’t my boyfriend and listened to him reminisce about his old girlfriend, who, he said, was “sexy without being pretty, if that makes any sense”.There, among the slabs of buildings of Midtown Sixth Avenue, were the offices of more temp jobs than I could count: banks, law firms, insurance companies, each with its own mini kitchen and passcode-protected employee restrooms. There, at 57th and Broadway is a Duane Reade pharmacy that was once Coliseum Books, a place where the feral woman had often stood and yelled: “Sign the petition!”I remember being dumped on Delancey Street, kissed on Charles Street, having a strange and short-lived personal assistant job in a musty apartment on Sutton Place.I remember standing on the corner of Eighth Avenue and 49th Street as hail rained down like shellfire one summer night following a long, somewhat drunken dinner with an older man in a powerful position whose meal invitations I dreaded but nonetheless felt obliged to accept.Those meals had started out as business lunches but then migrated into semi-business dinners. During these dinners, the man would tell me certain details about his personal life, which was in a state of acute crisis. I didn’t particularly want to be there but I accepted the invitations because there was in this transaction the implicit notion that he could help my career, albeit in a rather vague, abstract way. I accepted them so because not doing so felt like a kind of professional self-sabotage, as foolish and irresponsible as missing deadlines.At no time did the man make an ultimatum or proposition me directly. I never felt like I was being sexually harassed and obviously no one was kidnapping me from my apartment and forcibly escorting me to the Oyster Bar, where the man would sit waiting for me, smoking probably the fourth of 15 cigarettes he’d smoke that night. I’ll cop to a certain psychological gamesmanship on my part as well. I’d occasionally bum a cigarette from him, an act that gave me a sense of distance and control but that surely read to him as an intimate gesture.At least a few times, after I probably had one too many glasses of wine, I became rather suggestive and flirtatious, inquiring into his personal life, seeing how much I could get him to disclose as he got drunker. I did this in part as a defense mechanism. The more we talked about him, the less we talked about me. But I also did it because I wanted to mess with his head, and I was young enough then to think that doing so would serve as some kind of tacit punishment for his behavior.The truth, of course (which anyone but a young twerp would have the wisdom to realize), was that messing with his head was its own reward for him. I wasn’t censuring his behavior as much as reinforcing it. As for my own, I’ve been cringing about it ever since.Looking back, it would be easy to say I behaved like this out of some instinctive subordination to the man’s power. There’s an element of truth to that, but there’s also an angle at which the situation could be viewed as quite the opposite. From this angle, I behaved the way I did because in some ways the power imbalance between the two of us was tipped in my favor.I was young and the man was twice my age. He may have had professional power over me, but it was limited and in no way unilateral. In fact, thanks to the personal details I’d siphoned out of him, I probably could have placed one phone call and made his life very difficult. And so I carried on with my coquettishness until somehow the meals became fewer and farther between and then finally ended, probably because he took up with someone else. I carried on this way because my life was an open horizon and his was an overstuffed attic.I behaved this way because I must have known on some unconscious level that, at 25, I had more of a certain kind of power than I was ever going to have in my life and that I might as well use it, even if the accompanying rush was laced with shame.This was the summer of 1995. Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill had come out that June, and I listened to it pretty much on constant repeat through August. One night, after doing my silly routine with this man and riding the subway home in self-disgust, I sat in my room and played Jagged Little Pill and then wandered into the kitchen to talk to my roommate. I remember grumbling to her about my dinner companion, complaining about his lechery while conveniently omitting the parts when I’d dramatically exhaled on my cigarette, looked him straight in the eye, and said something devastatingly witty and possibly a tiny bit dirty. (I’d like to add that I winked, but that wouldn’t past the truth test, since I’m physically unable to wink.)Instead I said: “God, what a perv.”“Sounds annoying,” my roommate said. “But hey, you keep showing up. You must be getting something out of it.”I behaved this way because I must have known that, at 25, I had more power than I was ever going to have in my lifeDuring the Fall of the Fall of Man, I thought a lot about the showing up I’d done over the years. Every woman seemed to be taking this kind of inventory. It was like a novel everyone was reading, one with a plot that seemed easy enough to follow but whose underlying themes and messages amount to an abstruse thicket of personal projection and postmodern obfuscation.Like any sentient being, I’d been shocked and disgusted by the Weinstein revelations and saw no reason to equivocate about the reliability of his accusers or the severity of his punishment. But as the list of perpetrators piled up and the public censure piled on, the conversation around #MeToo (lacking a specific category, each new scandal was not a story or an issue but a “conversation”) began to split down generational lines.The first incident to put this divide in notably sharp relief involved a secret Google spreadsheet called the Shitty Media Men list. This was an anonymously sourced, living document meant to warn women about certain men in the media business, mostly publishing, who were known for inappropriate sexual or sexually charged behavior.It included all kinds of men, from powerful editors to freelance writers, and described alleged misdeeds that ranged from “weird lunch dates” to inappropriate flirting to stalking to physical violence and all-out rape. And though the list was never officially published and disappeared from Google Docs almost as quickly as it emerged, enough screenshots were taken that the perpetrators became common knowledge almost immediately.Within hours of the list’s discovery, the chief line of inquiry around it, even more so than “Who started it?”, was whether infractions like “weird lunches” should be lumped in with crimes like rape. Unsurprisingly, I found myself on the side of the oldsters who were deeply troubled not just by this “lumping” (again, there seemed to be only one operative word, and in this case it was “lump”) but by the idea that anonymously sourced accusations could be made against publicly named people without warning or any sort of due process.“This is so wrong!” my same-age friends and I ranted. “You can’t just do this! These millennials don’t get it!” We said this as we forwarded the screenshots among each other, gawking at the names we recognized.“Weird lunch!” I said to more than one person. “Welcome to publishing! I’m going to write a memoir about my early days in New York and call it Weird Lunch.”And as the “conversation” lurched along and the narrative of the “generational divide” became the default narrative, I found myself reminded of this passage of time on a daily, even hourly, basis. When a scandal broke involving the actor and comedian Aziz Ansari, I felt that my membership on Team Older Feminist was so official that I might as well take out a charge card at Eileen Fisher and call it a day (though has anyone under 40 ever used a “charge card”?)And so the ground began to shake around the fault line. The older feminists scolded the younger ones for not being tough enough to take care of themselves. If the construction worker whistles at you, give him the finger! If the drunk guy sitting next to you at the wedding reception gets fresh, kick him in the shins!In turn, the youngsters chastised the oldsters for enabling the oppressive status quo with cool-girl posturing. We shouldn’t have to suppress our humanity by letting insults roll off us! We shouldn’t have to risk our safety with physical violence because patriarchal norms have taught the drunk wedding guest he can act like that!Neither side was entirely wrong, of course. But both sides were talking past each other in ways that suggested there was no meeting in the middle. In the New York Times, Daphne Merkin identified a gulf between what women said publicly about #MeToo and the eye-rolling that went on in private. “Publicly, they say the right things, expressing approval and joining in the chorus of voices that applaud the takedown of maleficent characters who prey on vulnerable women in the workplace,” she wrote. “In private it’s a different story. ‘Grow up, this is real life,’ I hear these same feminist friends say.”In the Atlantic, Caitlin Flanagan, whose tendency toward a certain impish prudery has never made her popular among young feminists, wrote that the Ansari fracas, at least the version of it chronicled on Babe.net, constituted “3,000 words of revenge porn”. She decried the helplessness of “a whole country full of young women who don’t know how to call a cab”.On cable news, the HLN anchor Ashleigh Banfield looked straight into the camera and addressed “Grace” directly.“What you have done in my opinion is appalling,” said Banfield, calling the allegations “reckless and hollow” and charging Grace with having “chiseled away at a movement that I along with all of my sisters in the workplace have been dreaming of for decades”.This being cable news, Banfield’s producers invited Katie Way to appear on the show. And this being the digital era, Way declined the offer not with a “no thanks” but by popping off an email that called Banfield a “burgundy lipstick bad highlights second wave feminist has-been” and noted that “no woman my age would ever watch your network”.As I watched all of this whiz past me on my computer screen, sharpened by the reading glasses I’d lately been forced to wear, I wondered if my real problem with young feminists was how little they seemed to need us older ones. As far as I could see, they didn’t even want to know us.At 25, I not only wanted to know people like Daphne Merkin and Ashleigh Banfield, I wanted to be them. There were hundreds of women in my imaginative orbit – some of them over 50 or possibly even 60 – whom I felt this way about. I knew none of them, but I wanted to be all of them. Together, they formed a great phalanx of wise elders whose only duty to me was to be themselves. My duty, in turn, was to watch and learn. By which I mean that was my duty to myself.But something was different back then. I shared a planet with those elders. We occupied the same universe. We breathed the same air. The same cannot be said for the relationship between my generation and those that are coming up behind us.The world has changed so much between my time and theirs that someone just 10 years younger might as well belong to a different geological epoch. To a young person, someone like me is not so much an elder as an extinction. Is it any wonder, then, that older generations’ contributions to the conversation are, at best, a kind of verbal meteor shower, the flickering, nattering remains of planets that haven’t existed for eons?So this is where I find myself. Amid my exasperation and confusion, I have wandered into a devastating but oddly beautiful revelation: my generation will be the last to have known the world in its analog form. As a result, we’ve grown old before actually getting old. We’ve become dinosaurs before we’re even 50.And it’s here, from this primitive-creature vantage point, that I find myself pressed up against yet another revelation: the questions we face now when it comes to men and women are questions that arose a split second ago. Modern humans have been around for about 200,000 years. Civilization as we know it has been churning away for perhaps 6,000 years. Until the birth control pill came along in 1960, we were all essentially prisoners of nature, with women’s conditions being markedly worse, sometimes obscenely so.Until 1960, the idea that women could compete with men in the job market, that men should do housework, that women had any purpose in life higher than having babies and men had any purpose higher than financially supporting those babies or going to war to protect them, was something close to unthinkable.That we have come so far in so little time is a marvel. That we should expect all the kinks to have been worked out by now is insane.In the scheme of things, the 59 years that have elapsed between 1960 and today is a nanosecond, a flash of time so imperceptible that it has passed in increments of billions by the time you have read this sentence. It was already nearly 30 years ago that the feral woman was out there with her folding table yelling: “Sign the petition.” It was already nearly 30 years ago that, as far as I was concerned, I owned the world. It feels like yesterday. Then again, every day feels like yesterday. Every day becomes yesterday before you know it.Copyright 2019 by Meghan Daum.

F1’s attempt to host grand prix in Miami hits hump in the road,Plan announced this week to host race in Florida city faces opposition from some local people due to its impact and noise,Giles Richards,2019-10-17T10:00:18+0100,"“A vacuum humping a goat”. Well, try and banish the picture, if that is possible, but consider instead the sound. An unholy conjugation of machine and animal from which Formula One would surely like to keep its distance.This description of the sound of F1 cars is not the aural sculpture the sport wants associated with its expansion in North America. Yet said development, in the form of this week’s announcement of an agreement in principle to host a race in Miami, may yet see the delightfully colourful phrase bandied around for a while longer.Since taking over the sport in 2017 the owners, Liberty Media, have sought to add to the lone USGP in Texas. Their original plan to put on a race in Miami was stymied earlier this year by objections over its impact on business, traffic and residents at the proposed bayfront site in downtown.However, on Tuesday Sean Bratches, F1’s commercial director,and the CEO of the Miami Dolphins, Tom Garfinkel, issued a joint statement covering the new plan to host a race in the Miami Gardens district, near the Dolphins’ Hard Rock stadium.“We are thrilled to announce that Formula One and Hard Rock Stadium have reached an agreement in principle to host the first-ever Formula One Miami Grand Prix at Hard Rock Stadium,” it read. “With an estimated annual impact of more than $400m and 35,000 room nights, the Formula One Miami Grand Prix will be an economic juggernaut for South Florida each and every year.”The project, aimed for the calendar in 2021, has been backed by the Dolphins’ franchise and stadium owner, Steve Ross. He is expected to cover costs, including an estimated $40m to build the circuit and its immediate infrastructure.The layout is set to make use of the car parks and land surrounding the stadium. It is far from the glamour of the bayfront but requires fewer grants of approval from public bodies. It does, however, include a stretch of public road to the south of the stadium on Northwest 199th street. Which is one reason this is not yet a done deal.In September residents appraised of the proposal immediately expressed concern. The Miami Herald reported that homeowners commissioned a report on the impact of the race. The acoustics expert Colby Leider who compiled it warned that the noise would reach over 120 decibels, compared it to a jet plane taking off and – bravo Colby, for your critique of the modern F1 sound – cited the quote, originally made in an article from thedrive.com, that goats and vacuum cleaners would be getting it on. En masse.Public pressure put paid to F1’s first shot at Miami and it has not gone away. The race still requires the approval of the Miami-Dade County Commission. County Commissioner Barbara Jordan opposes hosting it at the stadium and, having met residents, has not changed her opinion.“It solidified my position as a no, in terms of something this community does not want,” she said. The Herald reports that the Miami Gardens Mayor, Oliver Gilbert, also opposes the race.Members of the community were out on Sunday protesting on 199th street. Leading the activists was the former Miami-Dade Commissioner Betty T Ferguson, who made her point to 7 News Miami. “Even more people will be affected negatively by a race like this than even in the downtown area,” she said. “Because you’re talking about a stadium that is surrounded on all four sides by bedroom communities.” It would, she added, be “environmentally devastating”.Regardless, Garfinkel remains optimistic. “Imagine people coming to this region from around the World in May,” he tweeted. “Multiple passing zones and world-class clubs and amenities. Barcelona, Monaco … Miami … make it happen.”Which raised another potential corollary of making it happen. With 22 races next season, Miami would make 23 in 2021, pushing to the limit teams already loth to add meetings. F1’s sporting director, Ross Brawn, said this week it was looking at reorganising race weekends so teams and drivers can arrive a day later, specifically because of the increase in meetings. Which may work or there may still be some pushback and it would be Barcelona – a race in May and only on a contract until 2020 – that may find itself under threat.Some business leaders, especially in hospitality and tourism, are understandably bullish about the advantages of hosting in Miami with the grand prix being likened to hosting a Super Bowl every year. Which is a comparison no doubt not being made by accident. F1 has already described how it wants its races at “destination cities” to represent Super Bowl-style events.Whether it finally achieves that in Miami lies first in the hands of the county commissioners. Another rejection would be a severe blow for Liberty Media, their juggernaut derailed by the threat of noisy humping."
'Mozart would have made video game music': composer Eímear Noone on a winning art form,The Irish composer and conductor – who’s worked with film director Gus Van Sant and on World of Warcraft – talks passionately about making game music,Keith Stuart,2019-10-22T07:01:11+0100,"Eímear Noone got into composing and conducting video game music by accident. One day, while studying music at Trinity College Dublin, a fourth-year student came to the bar she was drinking in with members of the college chapel choir and offered them a few quid to help with the orchestration on a project of his.“I have a vivid memory of sitting on a studio floor somewhere in Dublin writing choral parts with my pals and then singing them,” she says. “Six months later, my brother calls me in a complete tizzy and says, ‘Did you work on Metal Gear Solid?’ I was like, ‘No!’ He says, ‘Well, I’m looking at your name on the screen credits right now.’ And sure enough, the session she had contributed to for beer money was the soundtrack to Hideo Kojima’s blockbuster adventure game. “Years later, I was at the Bird’s Nest in Beijing conducting this very piece of music,” she says. “It’s just a bizarre life.”Noone is now a successful composer for films and video games, having contributed scores for directors such as Gus Van Sant and Joe Dante, and for games such as World of Warcraft, Diablo III and Hearthstone. In November, she will present her second series of High Score, Classic FM’s programme dedicated to game music. Underappreciated outside of game fandom for years, the genre now has dedicated orchestras playing sold-out concert tours around the world. And Noone is a passionate advocate to explore and explain the unique elements of the form.There is, naturally, a foundational similarity between game and film scores: they are both composed to accompany and accentuate screened action. But while a film score needs to accompany a two-hour linear experience with specific cues and events, video game music must be present for many hours of play. Most open-word action adventures, such as Assassin’s Creed Origins, Witcher 3 and Final Fantasy XV, offer more than 100 hours of narrative, but many players will spend much longer exploring their worlds.Music has two roles in games: it accompanies the noninteractive cinematic sequences that set up the story and occur throughout a game (sort of like short animated movie sequences) and they provide background music while you play. “Cinematic are scored very similarly to a movie or an animated film,” says Noone. “The composer will be given an animatic, which could be anything from a fully rendered sequence to just stick figures on screen. But the edit is pretty close to what it’ll be in the end.“But when music needs to respond to changes the player makes in the world, we employ a kind of loop system. We use a recording method known as striping – we might record the strings separately, for example, but we’ll compose in a way that the strings on their own provide a functioning piece of music. Then, if our character triggers something in the world, perhaps a battle, we can land the wood winds or brass on top of that to increase the intensity. Each part must be self-contained yet work with others – you need to be able to kick in the brass, kick in the percussion, whenever its triggered by gameplay. It’s like a Rubik’s cube puzzle! This is the kind of thing Mozart would have enjoyed – he loved puzzles. Mozart would have loved making game music.”Noone also points out that video game scores help establish the reality of the world the player is about to explore: the instruments used, the style of music, the pace and tempo all work with the art and design to give the players clues about how the universe functions. “The composer has to put you in the headspace of the world, emotionally and intellectually,” she says. “Often these are fantasy worlds, but to ensure they make sense they must have their own rules – and the composer must abide by them. I had a fan contact me once who said ‘I was just listening to the score of World of Warcraft and there are electric guitars! There are no electric guitars in Azeroth!’ But these rules are important – they help make an authentic fantasy world.”For Noone, the most satisfying part is composing the themes that accompany the player throughout the interactive experience. “In-game music is where the composer gets the most freedom – it’s where we creates the big themes,. This is where a lot of the music we perform live with orchestras comes from; it’s the big identifiable themes that players associated with the game and with the characters.“Take the music of Koji Kondo – as soon as you hear the theme from Legend of Zelda, you’re right back in the game, you’re back in the time period in your life that you played it and you’re back with the people you played it with. It’s like hearing a great pop song playing over and over again on the radio – it encapsulates that time for you, it’s in bars, it’s in shops … and with video game music, you live with that soundtrack for the entire time you’re playing the game. It’s not two hours, it’s however long you spend in that game, which can be years.“Game soundtracks become the soundtracks to people’s childhoods, the soundtracks to their second childhoods and their children’s childhoods! More people are listening to orchestral music through video games than ever before in the history of recorded music.”Noone moves on to another difference between film and video game music: they follow different trends. “In film, there’s a stylistic trend at the moment away from the big theme,” she says. “Directors talk a lot about texture. But it seems that video game directors still embrace the big theme, and that’s good for composers because we want to write something more involving.”She is passionate and defensive about game music and its merits. I ask her if the medium, with its lush symphonic orchestration, is kind of old-fashioned – if you compare it to where modern instrumental music is going? I bring up Elgar and his use of big sweeping themes as an example of where game music seems to be and she smiles broadly. “Actually, this is a really good example because when Elgar was writing that music it would have been really uncool – it’s very emotional, it’s visual but at the time there was a lot of atonal music, things were changing, going into serialism even – and Elgar was writing these big lush emotional tunes – how dare he?!”So it’s quite radical for video game music to be overtly lush and emotional? “This is the music of the 21st century,” she says. “Look, we do have atonal music in video games – listen to Garry Schyman’s BioShock score, for instance. I just sat on a panel with Krzysztof Penderecki and his influence is all over horror games. It’s all about the context. There’s a gorgeous mobile game Contre Jour – it’s very visually different, and the piano score is reminiscent of the score to Amélie. I hear the influence of Glass or Reich in lots of what you might consider more traditional classically influenced scores – especially Steve Reich’s Proverb, the vocals on that. Ethereal vocals are definitely part of the video game music style.”For the next season of High Score, Noone has lined up some themed features dealing with specific elements of game music. One show is all about Japanese soundtracks, from the seminal work of Nobuo Uematsu and Yoko Shimomura, who operate in the western orchestral tradition, to J-pop-inspired Masato Nakamura, composer for Sonic the Hedgehog, who is part of the band, Dreams Come True. She also has a programme dedicated to nostalgia, looking back at the earliest works of composers such as Nintendo’s Koji Kondo, who started out on arcade games in the mid-1980s. Before the arrival of CD-Rom technology in the early 1990s, game soundtracks had to be programmed directly to sound chips, with only a very limited amount of memory available.Noone thinks this process was vital in forming the unique sound of game scores. “The reason some of these themes endure, especially Koji Kondo’s, is he had to sit down and painstakingly programme the themes in note by note – so every note mattered – he had to really seriously plan it. If you look at Beethoven’s manuscripts you’ll see him start with a complex theme and then cut that back and he ends up with the opening of the fifth symphony. Similarly, Koji had to refine and chisel down – and that’s why the themes from Mario and Zelda endure: they had to be simple but effective and meaningful.”Noone’s programmes then are going to be an interesting listen for game and music fans who want to understand why scores sound the way they do – and she can be amusingly honest about how game scores (just like film scores) have tropes and techniques that composers will rely on again and again. “If I’m going to be really simplistic, we all know instantly that when the chord of C major goes to F sharp major then back to C major, there’s a spaceship about to fly over head,” she laughs.“Flat five one or sharp four one is a spaceship flying over. That’s it. Every time.”• Eímear Noone presents the new series of High Score from 9 November at 9-10pm on Classic FM."
Alison Balsom in Gabriel review – trumpets get lost in translation,"Barbican Hall, London As actor, singer, compere and musician, Balsom drives this reimagining of Samuel Adamson’s celebration of Purcell, but the venue impedes its drama",Martin Kettle,2019-10-22T15:49:04+0100,"When Gabriel was first staged at Shakespeare’s Globe six years ago, reviewers of this heady mix of Henry Purcell’s music and a sequence of short plays set in 1690s London were captivated by it. Some of the essential parts of what is now subtitled “an Entertainment for Trumpet” have made the journey intact across the Thames into this energetic reimagining of the piece in the Barbican Hall, but too much has also been lost in the translation between venues.The unavoidable reason for this is that the Globe and the Barbican are very different stages. So are their atmospheres, performance dynamics and publics. None at all of this is in the Barbican’s favour, because the Globe’s earthy immediacy is impossible to recreate and the performers have an uphill task making the kind of audience connections in the concert hall that come naturally in the theatre’s more disrespectful space.In the Globe, moreover, the cast were in period costume, whereas at the Barbican they are in defiantly casual modern dress. This changes the nature of the enterprise. Dominic Dromgoole’s direction takes time to establish a performance logic. Samuel Adamson’s short plays slip lightly between the brief life of the disabled boy heir to the English throne, the transgressive sexuality of a star court soprano and the backstage entanglements of a staging of The Fairy Queen. But a deeper sense of history is thin, and the turbulence of the times is barely touched on.In the end, this version of Gabriel is largely dependent on the music, which is alertly overseen by Harry Bicket and the English Concert, and in which the singers Elizabeth Watts, Tim Morgan and Gwilym Bowen all excel.But it is Alison Balsom, now artist-in-residence at the Barbican’s Milton Court, who is the essential protagonist of the whole evening, as well as the driving force behind this recreation. She is rarely off the stage. She performs as actor, singer and compere and her playing of the trumpet music of Purcell (and briefly of Handel) is at once unearthly, plangent and stirring. Balsom’s commitment to her art goes a long way to persuading one that this new version of Gabriel works.In the end, though, it is an honourable failure.

Britten and Russia review – masterful tributes to a lifelong friendship,"Snape Maltings, AldeburghBritten’s partnership with Shostakovich formed the backbone of the weekend, with solo cello suites played with almost casual brilliance by Alban Gerhardt ",Andrew Clements,2019-10-21T15:50:13+0100,"In 1960, Benjamin Britten attended a concert in London given by the Leningrad Philharmonic, which included the UK premiere of Shostakovich’s First Cello Concerto, played by Mstislav Rostropovich.Shostakovich was there too, starting a friendship with Britten that lasted until his death, while the British composer went on to write five works for the cellist. Those pieces were the backbone of Aldeburgh Music’s Britten and Russia weekend, which ended with a re-creation of the historic 1960 concert, for which Jac van Steen conducted the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (BBCNOW).The most substantial of Britten’s pieces for Rostropovich was the Cello Symphony of 1964 and, with Alban Gerhardt as the soloist, it formed the centrepiece of the previous day’s programme from van Steen and BBCNOW, which also included Shostakovich’s 10th Symphony. If all Britten’s cello works are elusive in one way or another, then the Symphony seems the most mysterious of them – a concerto in all but name, in which the soloist seems engaged in a constant battle to establish his individuality. It suits Gerhardt’s unshowy mastery perfectly.Earlier the same day, in a recital he’d shared with the impressive soprano Julia Sitkovetsky, who sang Prokofiev and Rachmaninov with pianist Roger Vignoles, Gerhardt had played the first and third of Britten’s solo cello Suites. If the first suite is quite clearly modelled on Bach’s six examples, then the third seems formally as original as the Cello Symphony, a series of nine movements that are effectively a giant set of variations on a collection of Russian themes. Gerhardt played both of them with an almost casual brilliance, wearing his virtuosity as lightly as anyone could; it’s hard to think of a better cellist around today.BBCNOW concerts are broadcast on Radio 3 on 22 October and 25 October."
Post-Brexit Britten? The CBSO's guide to touring,"The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra has just returned from touring an all-British programme in Germany - possibly its last tour as a member of the EU. From new repertoire to cold beer, its chief executive offers his 10 post-Brexit touring tips",,2019-10-21T12:35:43+0100,"The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra has just returned home from an eight-day tour of Germany. Our music director, Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla, conducted all-British programmes of music in Dortmund, Cologne, Baden-Baden and in a four-day Hamburg residency at the city’s spectacular new concert hall, the Elbphilharmonie. (At which venue, our visit coincided with the annual window clean, an expert job that involves hanging on ropes and pulleys up to 108m above the ground. Tom Cruise scaling the Burj Khalifa in Mission Impossible has nothing on these guys.)German train services are fast, frequent and clean, and for the three long journeys up and down the country, we went by rail without a hitch. Almost. A cancelled train found 100 of us without seat reservations on a very full later service. With no wifi and hardly any 4G signal on much of the journey, it was a good job that the views out of the window – especially when following the course of the Rhine – were so splendid.This was the first of 10 international tours planned across our centenary celebrations between now and summer 2021. But it was also potentially our last tour before the UK leaves the EU.Having just passed an anniversary of my own – 20 years as the orchestra’s chief executive and a veteran of 61 European tours during that time – I thought I could offer some observations on taking British music to Europe, in the age of Brexit.1. Beyond a few very well-known works, it is generally difficult to persuade European promoters to let us bring British music on tour. We brought a grand sweep of our musical history, from Purcell to George Benjamin and a new work by Thea Musgrave, by way of Ruth Gipps and an unfamiliar Walton as well as Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Britten and Tippett – which felt particularly important at this point in time. So much of this music is played too rarely in the UK, never mind outside it – and we were delighted to find audiences who seemed genuinely curious to encounter new names and sounds.2. Elgar’s Cello Concerto is one of only two pieces from this selection that we have toured previously in my time at the CBSO. I never tire of it, and a few weeks short of the centenary of its disastrous premiere, it sounds as fresh as ever (especially as played by rising star Sheku Kanneh-Mason), its lyrical melancholy identifying it as Exhibit ! one of the most characteristic strands in British music.In the pre-concert talk in Dortmund, the first question was “What would Britten and Tippett have thought of Brexit?”3. I took some convincing from Mirga that Vaughan Williams’s achingly beautiful Tallis Fantasia would work well at the end of a programme, played without a pause following George Benjamin’s Ringed by the Flat Horizon. In fact it worked brilliantly, and the Vaughan Williams gathered a whole new aura by being moved from its usual place as a concert opener. Sometimes it takes an outsider’s perspective to shed new light on music that we thought we knew.4. Tippett’s A Child of Our Time – a meditation on the events of Kristallnacht as a symbol for hatred between communities, and a plea for peace and understanding – has never felt more relevant. The audience in Dortmund joined in with the CBSO Chorus to sing two of the spirituals, as our Birmingham audience had the previous week. And in Hamburg we recorded the oratorio for CD release – the work’s first new recording in more than a decade.5. Germans are as obsessed with Brexit as we all are (and probably better informed). In the pre-concert talk in Dortmund, the first question was “What would Benjamin Britten and Michael Tippett have thought of Brexit?” As their representative on earth (for that moment only), I answered that both were leftwing internationalists and showed through their music that it was possible both to have a patriotic immersion in English music and culture, while also displaying an openness to the wider world.6. When our soprano for the Tippett fell ill on the day of the Hamburg concert, we had just a few hours to find a replacement who; (A), was free; (B), knew the work, and (C), could get to Hamburg in time to rehearse and sing that evening. This proved to be a Venn diagram of vanishingly small overlaps. We were very lucky that Claire Booth satisfied all three criteria, racing at a few minutes’ notice from her home to Heathrow to catch the last possible flight out. At the moment this requires no visas, work permits or other paperwork. Next month, who knows? We have heard a lot about just-in-time delivery of car parts, but last week my main concern was for just-in-time sopranos.7. With around 15 nationalities represented in the orchestra, a mix of employed and freelance musicians, and a mix of UK residents and overseas guests, the end of freedom of movement will impose at best a massive new amount of paperwork and at worst make touring financially and operationally so tricky as to become unviable. The movement of musical instruments post-Brexit is equally concerning. Quite aside from the possibility of long delays at ports – especially in the case of a no deal outcome – there is a major issue around the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Lots of the rare materials used in musical instruments (for example, tortoiseshell or ivory in bows) cannot be moved in and out of the EU without the appropriate certification – which was generally not supplied when the instruments were bought. The Association of British Orchestras has been lobbying the UK government on this (as on all the issues), but it is perhaps inevitably some way down the latter’s list of priorities.German promoters understand the way to a musician’s heart. Every player is handed a cold beer as they leave the stage8. Whatever happens with Brexit, we need to maintain and increase cultural dialogue and openness with our European partners. A conversation in Cologne with composer Miroslav Srnka – for whom a composing residency in Aldeburgh was a powerful experience earlier in his career – brought this home to me very strongly. He, like so many, wants to remain connected to the UK more than ever, and there remains in principle a huge openness among European promoters and artists to keep working with UK partners, as long as conditions make it viable.9. From Monty Python to Danny Boyle’s 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, everyone loves a bit of quirky British exceptionalism. In our case that came in the form of our encore – Mirga’s arrangement of Henry VIII’s Pastime With Good Company, featuring a four-part chorus of CBSO players, supplemented by rhythmic grunts from our percussionists and the droning bagpipes section, into which I was drafted to provide “extra weight”. This showed once again that one of the best things we can offer audiences is the element of surprise – and we provoked more than a little laughter as well as a rousing cheer at the end.10. German promoters really understand the way to a musician’s heart. In Cologne and Dortmund (as well as one of the Hamburg concerts), every player is handed a cold beer as they leave the stage. Some traditions are too good to ever disappear, Brexit or no Brexit."
Why Barenboim is the Ring master of our age,"The chance to see a complete Ring cycle is all too rare these days. Martin Kettle reports from Berlin’s Staatsoper, where Daniel Barenboim might be hidden from view, but his Wagner is revelatory",Martin Kettle,2019-10-20T18:01:08+0100,"There was a time when it was unusual for a season to pass in a British opera house without the complete Ring being performed. The first Ring cycle to be mounted in postwar Britain was premiered in 1949 at Covent Garden. Thereafter (with the sole exception of 1952), the Ring, or parts of it, was an annual fixture at the Royal Opera House for two decades. Finally there was a fallow year in 1969. By this time, however, Sadler’s Wells Opera (later English National Opera) was building its own cycle, sung in English. The Ring – or parts thereof – continued to be performed most seasons into the 1980s at both houses, with Welsh National Opera and Scottish Opera also mounting Rings and - just as significantly - touring them around Britain.Little of this period of plenty remains today. This is not to downplay some important recent Ring cycles, such as those put on by Opera North and Longborough festival, or the concert performances at the Proms and elsewhere, let alone the cycle directed by Keith Warner for Covent Garden in 2007 and revived in 2012 and 2018. But the gaps are increasingly large and obvious. Though there are many different causes for this change, the steady decline in Britain’s public subsidy to the opera sector is certainly one of the most decisive in making Wagner’s opera cycle an increasing and sometimes very expensive rarity on our stages. The result is that younger newcomers to the Ring are no longer able to get access to this most important and ambitious of 19th century European musical art works.Today, if you are British and want to see a Ring cycle, you must travel abroad. This might be far from easy and certainly far from cheap, but just as sports fans now routinely head overseas to watch their favourites, so an admittedly smaller number of Wagner lovers now make the journey to overseas Rings too. British visitors were much in evidence at in Berlin this autumn. It is likely that numbers will also be travelling to Paris’s Opéra-Bastille and Chicago’s Lyric Opera in 2020, where new Ring cycles are scheduled.The chief attraction of this autumn’s Berlin Ring was the chance to hear the finest Wagner conductor of the modern era performing the work in his company’s renovated theatre for the first time. Daniel Barenboim has been conducting the Ring half a lifetime. His Bayreuth festival cycle of 1988, directed by Harry Kupfer, established him as the Ring master of his generation. Several notable conductors honed their trade as his assistants, including Christian Thielemann, Antonio Pappano and Philippe Jordan. Now 76, Barenboim has been conducting Guy Cassiers’ production since 2010, both in Berlin and Milan (several in those casts there took part in Barenboim’s 2013 Proms cycle). Until now, however, he has not performed it as a cycle at the historic Berlin State Opera theatre on Unter den Linden, which reopened after an eight-year renovation in late 2017, and of which he is music director.Barenboim remains invisible, Bayreuth-style, in the Staatsoper pit throughout the four parts of the Ring. He takes his bow democratically surrounded by the entire Berlin Staatskapelle orchestra on the stage. But there is never any doubting his commanding grasp and leadership. Where other conductors maybe allow the dynamics to soar too loudly or the musical line to descend into generalities, Barenboim’s control is tight but flexible, and consistently full of contrast, while never losing the musical flow or drawing attention to itself. It is like hearing the work afresh.The result is a rich illumination of orchestral detail and layering that is too often blurred in other performances, and is particularly successful in Das Rheingold. Under Barenboim, scenes which in less skilful hands can be formulaic, like the opening scene of Rheingold or the closing duet in Siegfried, acquire new dramatic clarity, meaning the big moments in Götterdämmerung are reached with a sense of inevitability.The conductor’s art achieved its profoundest climax at the end of Die Walküre, where Barenboim masterly observed Wagner’s often ignored pianissimo markings in the orchestra as Wotan leaves Brünnhilde for the last time. The effect was to express Wotan’s despair, defeat and eclipse in passages of revelatory orchestral restraint, a lesson to all Wagner conductors.Cassiers’s production does not come close to matching Barenboim’s achievement. It is contemporary but also conservative. There is no old-school naturalism, but the treatment also eschews the radical conceptualising that is meat and drink to many European Ring cycles. There are no crashed aeroplanes or biting crocodiles, both of which have featured in recent Rings. The use of dancers intermittently seems to underline important cruxes in the narrative and can broaden the expressive scope, but it is often merely distracting and ultimately lacks conviction. The production represents a dimly lit reversion to the decluttered postwar “new Bayreuth” aesthetic, and at times this Ring is more like a semi-staged concert performance. This can, though, have advantages, since it keeps the focus on the musical drama. It is hard to remember a Ring that so effectively centres on the transition from Wotan’s corrupted world to Brünnhilde’s role as the world’s redeemer.The Berlin cast, a mix of newer and fresher voices with some Barenboim veterans, is close to being as good as you will hear these daysThe Berlin cast, a mix of newer and fresher voices with some Barenboim veterans, is close to being as good as you will hear these days. Michael Volle’s Wotan, in particular, is a commanding interpretation, beautifully sung in full voice and articulated without the slightest bark. Iréne Theorin’s Brünnhilde is tireless, accurate and thoroughly up to the job, though the vocal vibrato gets in the way sometimes and she is the chief sufferer from the hampering that is inflicted by Tim van Steenbergen’s costumes. Andreas Schager is the best Siegfried of the current era. Strength in depth is underlined by redoubtable Wagnerians such as Jochen Schmeckenbecher as Alberich, Anja Kampe as Sieglinde, Ekaterina Gubanova as Fricka and Anna Larsson as Erda. The lovelorn giant Fasolt is even sung by 74-year-old Matti Salminen, who sang the role for Colin Davis at Covent Garden 45 years ago and was part of the Patrice Chéreau Ring at Bayreuth in 1976. But it is Barenboim’s show. He can’t go on conducting the Ring forever. But is he does so again, I’ll be there."
The Mask of Orpheus review – travesty of a production is nothing to laugh about,"Coliseum, LondonIt’s been three decades since Harrison Birtwistle’s challenging opera has been staged. Musically this might be excellent, but the gaudy and self-indulgent staging does nothing to illuminate the work’s complexities",Andrew Clements,2019-10-20T13:12:24+0100,"When English National Opera presented the premiere of The Mask of Orpheus at the Coliseum in 1986, I doubt many of us in the audience thought we would have to wait 33 years to see it on stage again. In the meantime both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, other productions of what was acknowledged as the defining work of Harrison Birtwistle’s early career and a landmark in 20th-century British opera, had regularly been promised, only for plans to be abandoned sooner or later, because of the sheer financial and technical challenges of realising them.But now this monumental work is back at the Coliseum, the centrepiece of ENO’s Orpheus season. For that, at least, much thanks. Those who were not around to experience the work in 1986, or the concert staging performance at the Royal Festival Hall 10 years later, will need to catch this version, if only to experience the magnificence of much of the music, which is an immense achievement for conductor Martyn Brabbins and everyone else involved. But those who have fond memories of the original production, might be advised to stay away from what in most other respects is a travesty of what Birtwistle and his librettist Peter Zinovieff envisaged, and of what the work represents.The production is the work of ENO’s departing artistic director Daniel Kramer, and let’s hope it is the last of his shows to be seen there. For this is a wilful parade of self-indulgence, with set designs by Lizzie Clachan translating the action to a sleek modern apartment, and costumes by Daniel Lismore that might be more appropriate in a Rio carnival procession or on the Mexican Day of the Dead. It’s a gaudy display, which does nothing to tease out the complexities of a work that presents the Orpheus story as a bundle of contradictory myths where events are repeated and linear time abandoned, and in which the three main protagonists, Orpheus, Euridice and Aristaeus, are each represented on stage by two singers and a mime, representing the person, the myth and the hero. Instead, Kramer simply adds business of his own, cluttering the stage with irrelevancies. Rather than austere, penetrating ritual, all we get is camp and bling, combined with an apparent insistence on adding comedy to the action, so that the judges of the dead and the furies become a troupe of vaudeville caricatures.At least Brabbins and the second conductor James Henshaw clearly know what they are doing. The immense, writhing power of Birtwistle’s orchestral writing, and the sheer originality and beauty of the electronic interludes that he and composer Barry Anderson realised at IRCAM in Paris, emerge with startling, abrasive clarity. It’s all been meticulously prepared, and if Peter Hoare in the main role of Orpheus the Man can’t make his character as compelling as Philip Langridge did in the original production, it’s still an immense, tireless performance. He sets the standard for the rest of the cast, including Daniel Norman as Orpheus the Myth, Marta Fontanals-Simmons as Euridice the Woman, James Cleverton as Aristaeus the Man, and Claron McFadden as the Oracle of the Dead.None of them disappoint, yet such musical excellence seems to be a low priority for the current ENO regime. Half the press release for the first night was devoted to the company that supplied the glass crystals adorning many of the costumes, and which apparently “star” in the production, while two models wearing Lismore’s designs paraded through the foyer before the performance. Is this the kind of thing that matters most at the Coliseum now?• At the Coliseum, London, until 13 November."
Hong Kong's orchestra wins people vote at Gramophone Awards,Chief executive promises to take the award back to the region’s people - ‘who need it in these difficult times’,Imogen Tilden,2019-10-16T22:03:09+0100,"Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra has been named orchestra of the year at the 2019 Gramophone Awards. The category is the only one of the classical music magazine’s awards open to public vote; the orchestra and its Music Director Jaap Van Zweden triumphed in a shortlist of ten international orchestras, largely because of their ambitious and critically acclaimed recording of Wagner’s Ring cycle.Chair of the board of governors YS Liu thanked the Hong Kong government for their unfailing support since 1974 [the year the orchestra became fully professional]. “Please visit us. It is not as bad as you see on TV,” he said. HK Phil Chief executive Benedikt Fohr promised to “bring the award back to our people. They deserve it. They need it, especially in these difficult times.”The group is the first Asian orchestra to win the award, a fact noted by its Dutch-born conductor Van Zweden, who has been its Music Director since 2012. “Music can empower the individual and society. We can inspire people with our music in all corners of the world,” he said, in a pre-recorded video message of thanks.The Recording of the Year went to French pianist Bertrand Chamayou for his disc of Saint-Saëns piano concertos. Another pianist, Vikingur Ólafsson, was honoured with the Artist of the Year title. The fast-rising Icelandic musician, whose recording of Bach transcriptions won him the top prize at BBC Music magazine’s awards earlier in the year, was praised for having the gift of “making something familiar feel entirely his own, drawing you into a world where no other interpretation seems possible.”Other awards went to Scottish guitarist Sean Shibe for his “bracingly original” softLOUD: music for acoustic and electric guitars - the first time music for electric guitar has featured at the Gramophone Awards. Dame Emma Kirkby won the Lifetime Achievement Award; and Polish countertenor Jakub Jozef Orlinski was the recipient of the Young Artist of the Year Award.Editor-in-chief James Jolly hailed a ‘vintage year’ in the classical recording industry. “The way we listen to music may be changing dramatically, but one thing remains constant – the high-quality of the music-making,” he said."
The week in classical: Don Pasquale; Rigoletto; Zauberland – review,"Royal Opera House; Glyndebourne, East Sussex; Linbury theatre, LondonEverything revolves around Bryn Terfel’s tremendous, tragicomic Don Pasquale; Verdi holds his own in a concept-laden Rigoletto. And second-guessing Schumann…",Fiona Maddocks,2019-10-19T12:00:23+0100,"On its polished surface, Donizetti’s Don Pasquale (1843) is a criss-cross of stock comic characters: rich, ageing bachelor-lech; poor, feckless nephew; glamorous minx of a widow; scheming doctor. With its lampooning and cruelty, it isn’t easy to love. How can we laugh when a young woman slaps an old man, a gesture so shocking the music stops, bright harmony and bustling orchestration shriven into abrupt retreat. Discomfort is part of the work’s gleaming weaponry. The Royal Opera’s new production, directed by Damiano Michieletto, conducted by Evelino Pidò and starring one of opera’s all-time greats, the Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel, recognised these tensions, at times nastily, at others disarmingly. I warmed to this piece, after long avoidance, for the first time.Michieletto and his designer Paolo Fantin have borrowed from the language of cinema, the go-to source for so many updated opera productions: two this week alone featuring director’s chair, film studio paraphernalia and wheel-on classic cars (see also Rigoletto below). The pinging and dinging of smartphones – even the doddery Don can read an SMS – are absorbed into the aural and visual narrative. Fantin’s skilful set, with neon-outline roof and some clever business with doors, conjures a vulgar world of greed and bad taste, in which Norina – here a makeup artist to the celebs – revels. Soon, in her mock marriage to Pasquale, she’s the one in glitter and furs, steamrolling her “husband”, and his house, into a wholesale makeover.The quartet of singers, not always secure vocally but collegiate as a team, had to work hard in an open set that offered little acoustic support. They interacted deftly around Terfel’s towering, minutely detailed Pasquale, his role debut. As he moves into a new phase of repertoire, his voice remains russety and focused, even when he’s required to manipulate a hand-held puppet and sing a breakneck patter song. His crumpled realisation that he has been duped, that the game of love is over, was lacerating in its pathos.Markus Werba’s leather-jacketed Doctor Malatesta, robust and sly, and Olga Peretyatko in her Royal Opera debut as the gorgeous vixen Norina, appeared to have their own magnetic relationship. What were they up to? She’s supposed to be in love with earnest Ernesto (Ioan Hotea). It all enriched the generic, sour #MeToo odour. The production, first seen in Paris earlier this year, is uneven. Yet the music wins out, vibrantly and effervescently. Pidò, a bel canto authority, conducted with crispness and finesse. Donizetti gives little to the chorus (well sung here) but demands much of the orchestra, with lavishly accompanied recitatives and many conspicuous solos. Throughout, the ROH players more than delivered.If Michieletto and co added a few extra strands to Don Pasquale, Glyndebourne tour’s new staging of Verdi’s Rigoletto constructed an entirely different carapace. The tragedy of the hated jester and his beloved daughter, based on Victor Hugo’s Le roi s’amuse, is one of opera’s simpler plots. Christiane Lutz, making her directorial debut in a work that is also a first for Glyndebourne, introduces so many complications that it becomes almost unrecognisable: we’re in 1920s Hollywood, complete with Rigoletto-as-Chaplin, two doppelgängers whose identities are never entirely clear, and a dumbshow enactment suggesting suicide, baby snatching and incest.Luckily, under the baton of Thomas Blunt, there was sterling quality in the orchestra, chorus and cast, with the baritone Nikoloz Lagvilava magnificent and burly in the title role. Matteo Lippi’s Duke was well judged: loud, brash, showing off those top notes as if they were rippling muscles. Gilda, tenderly sung and acted by Vuvu Mpofu, is often compared to an angel. Accordingly, she wears large white wings (sometimes). Christian Tabakoff’s sets, with lighting by Benedikt Zehm and projections by Anton Trauner, looked attractive, though Rigoletto’s house, where he keeps his daughter under lock and key, had more the feel of an open prison. Good ideas were weighed down by literalness. If all can be streamlined by the time it reaches the main festival, it may work. Catch it on tour, with Donizetti’s softer comedy, L’elisir d’amore, and Handel’s dazzling Rinaldo, until December.In a UK premiere at the Linbury theatre, two outstanding performances, by the soprano Julia Bullock and pianist Cédric Tiberghien, gave unity to a fractured evening. Zauberland, directed by Katie Mitchell, attempts to forge Robert Schumann’s 1844 song cycle Dichterliebe (poems by Heinrich Heine) to new songs by the composer Bernard Foccroulle with texts by Martin Crimp. The starting point is Schumann’s excision, from his original manuscript, of four songs, leaving the 16 we know. This is described in the programme as an “unsolved mystery” though it might well be termed “artist’s prerogative”.Whichever, the Foccroulle-Crimp songs, engaging in themselves – delicate, imagery-rich and often sensuously melismatic – threw no light on the Schumann. A promising storyline involving a young pregnant woman, forced to leave Syria and travel to Germany, is suggested chiefly by atmosphere. Because of poor sightlines in the Linbury I missed most of the action, but Mitchell’s preference for symbolic, patterned repetition meant gaps could be filled by guesswork. Listening to Bullock and Tiberghien, attendant and redundant mysteries aside, made absorbing sense.Star ratings (out of five)Don Pasquale ★★★★Rigoletto ★★★Zauberland ★★★Don Pasquale is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 2 NovemberRigoletto is at Glyndebourne, East Sussex, until 2 November, then tours to Canterbury, Milton Keynes, Liverpool, Woking and Norwich until 7 December"
Tosca review – Scottish Opera's opulent staging still has plenty to say,"Theatre Royal, GlasgowIts three central performers make this latest revival of a 40-year-old production feel vital and engaging.",Rowena Smith,2019-10-17T19:10:41+0100,"Scottish Opera’s venerable production of Tosca belongs to a different era of opera staging, when faithful recreation of scene was more the order of the day, rather than radical reinterpretation. That said, Anthony Besch’s production, here receiving its umpteenth revival in four decades, has aged remarkably well. Peter Rice’s hyper-realistic sets, which bring the opulence of church/palace/fortress to the stage in loving detail, still look splendid, and if Besch’s decision to update the action to fascist-era 1940s Italy doesn’t seem as radical now as it did 40 years ago, then it is still a choice with something to say about the nature of power and corruption.If there is a drawback to such an opulent, old-fashioned staging it is the risk it encourages “stand-and-deliver” performances. This was somewhat apparent in the opening night of this production, particularly in the first act, which felt rather static. Gwyn Hughes Jones delivering Cavaradossi’s aria as an old-school set piece wasn’t a problem; however the ensuing violence, particularly when Roland Wood’s Scarpia and his police thugs hassle Paul Carey Jones’s Sacristan, was not believably threatening. And for all its pomp and splendour, Swiss Guards, Cardinals and even a cameo appearance from Il Duce himself, the first-act climax, where Scarpia’s secular moment of triumph is juxtaposed with the religious celebrations, didn’t entirely come off. There was the feeling of the performers finding their way as the menace and drama of the subsequent acts came across as vital and engaging.But for all the sumptuous visuals of the production, this opera succeeds or fails on the strength its three central performers. Scottish Opera has assembled an impressive cast headed by Natalya Romaniw. She was an expressive Tosca, petty and coquettish, vulnerable and vengeful by turn and vocally utterly secure. There was a hint of the pantomime villain to Wood’s splendidly oily, malevolent Scarpia, literally sniffing the air as if aroused by Tosca’s disdain. As Cavaradossi, Hughes Jones came into his own in the final act, his farewell impassioned and noble. Underpinning it all was the Orchestra of Scottish Opera and conductor Stuart Stratford who gave a lithe, responsive reading of Puccini’s score.• At Theatre Royal, Glasgow, until 26 October. Then touring until 23 November."
"Zauberland review – after horrors, a feeling of 'so what' remains","Linbury theatre, London Crimp, Foccroulle, Mitchell and Schumann combine their considerable forces to tell a shocking story, inspired by the Syrian conflict, that fails to have the impact it should",Andrew Clements,2019-10-16T17:00:24+0100,"A young, pregnant woman flees the violence of Aleppo, leaving her family and husband behind. She settles in Cologne, where she can pick up the threads of her career as an opera singer, and where her daughter is born. Sometime later, she dreams of singing Schumann’s song cycle Dichterliebe, and that performance becomes entwined with memories of her life in Syria and the horrors of her escape.That’s the starting point for Zauberland, composer Bernard Foccroulle and writer Martin Crimp’s “Encounter with Schumann’s Dichterliebe”, staged by Katie Mitchell. First seen in Paris in the spring, the production is touring Europe and the US with soprano Julia Bullock as the protagonist. It is a strange, unsatisfactory piece.Foccroulle has written 16 songs to Crimp’s often banal English texts in a neo-expressionist, post-Schoenbergian style, complementing the Heine settings of Schumann’s sublime cycle. The Schumann is performed first, with the narrative flipping between past and present, between what the woman has left behind and her new life with her daughter in Zauberland – the magic land of the west epitomised by Schumann’s romanticism.Four actors (one female, three male) flesh out the scenario, taking the other parts in the woman’s story, moving her around, constantly undressing and dressing her. Shrouded corpses are wheeled on; a bride who dances across the stage is later seen being doused in petrol; snow falls at one point; display cases containing naked Barbie dolls appear at another. The performance is immaculate – Mitchell’s stagecraft is as precise as usual – but given the subject matter it is almost shockingly unmoving.And, despite Bullock’s tirelessly fine performance, Cédric Tiberghien’s cool, elegant account of Schumann’s accompaniments and Foccroulle’s dense, demanding piano writing, a feeling of “So what?” remains.• At the Linbury theatre, London, until 18 October."
The Sixteen/Britten Sinfonia review – MacMillan's mysticism misses its mark,"Barbican, LondonThere was impeccable singing and playing, but James MacMillan’s substantial new works disappointed",Erica Jeal,2019-10-16T11:01:20+0100,"In the Portuguese village of Fátima a century ago, three shepherd children claimed to have been told by the Virgin Mary to expect a miracle; months later, a desperately war-weary crowd duly witnessed the sun moving and changing colour. This is the event commemorated by James MacMillan’s The Sun Danced, commissioned by the organisation behind the Shrine of Fátima to mark its centenary and here receiving its first UK performance, conducted with conviction by Harry Christophers. It was paired with MacMillan’s new Symphony No 5, Le grand Inconnu, a substantial, ruminative meditation on the Holy Spirit that premiered at this summer’s Edinburgh festival.That’s a lot of Catholic mysticism, and these were less easy for the undevout to buy into than some of MacMillan’s other recent choral works. In The Sun Danced, with texts in Portuguese, Latin and English, Mary Bevan was the gleaming soprano soloist voicing the Virgin, often doubled by a single instrument, which gives them an air of certainty; there is no room for doubting these visions. MacMillan uses a stageful of musicians with brilliant sonic imagination one minute, frustratingly prosaic literalism the next – take the evocative breathing effects that open Le grand Inconnu, flattened out five minutes later when the noise of an actual wind machine is added to the full orchestral mix.The performers – the Britten Sinfonia and the extended choral forces of the Sixteen – were impeccable, in this and the two openers: Arvo Pärt’s Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten, played with throbbing intensity, and Britten’s own Hymn to St Cecilia, sung with pinpoint agility. But the two big works, illustrating rather than interrogating their texts, felt like a step backwards for MacMillan since his powerful 2016 Stabat Mater."
Home listening: a fond farewell from the Hilliards and Jan Garbarek,"A live album captures the bestselling collaboration on their final tour. Plus, another superb recording from St John’s, Cambridge",Fiona Maddocks,2019-10-20T05:30:45+0100,"• Who would have guessed that a British male-voice quartet and a Norwegian saxophonist would form a lasting union. It’s now 25 years since the Hilliard Ensemble and Jan Garbarek joined forces at the suggestion of ECM’s founder-impresario, Manfred Eicher, to release Officium, one of the cult label’s bestsellers. Garbarek and the Hilliards gave their farewell concerts together in 2014. Remember me, my dear (ECM) is the fruit of that last tour.The wide-ranging programme follows their established recipe of early, contemporary and improvised music, recorded to achieve heightened resonance, embellished with Garbarek’s poetic soprano sax, at times jaunty, at others possessing the imperative cry of a shofar. The ebullient rhythms of Pérotin’s Alleluia Nativitas, and its segue into Hildegard of Bingen’s O ignis Spiritus, then Garbarek’s We are the Stars makes a typically compelling sequence. The title song – anonymous Scottish 16th century – is a heartfelt finale. Not for purists, but offering its own singular and hard-won purity.• Andrew Nethsingha, director of music at St John’s College, Cambridge since 2007, has helped give an already distinguished - and distinct, in its richly expressive sound - collegiate choir new profile with several themed albums. The latest, Magnificat (Signum Classics), features English settings of the two evening canticles – the Magnificat (“My soul doth magnify the Lord”) and Nunc dimittis (“Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace”) – by Charles Villiers Stanford, Kenneth Leighton, Herbert Sumsion, Herbert Howells, Gabriel Jackson and Michael Tippett.The music forms a web of connections: Stanford taught Howells, who had a spell as organist at St John’s but whose heart was in his native city, Gloucester, where he was friends with his fellow organist-composer Herbert Sumsion. Nethsingha explains all in his interesting liner note. The Tippett, opening with an arresting organ fanfare (organist Glen Dempsey), sounds the most inventive and brilliant, while the Howells and Jackson, like the rest of the disc beautifully sung, capture a wintry mood of dusk and meditation.• In his three-part A Singer’s World, the German baritone Benjamin Appl shares his passion for lieder, as performer and listener.

Dame Ethel Smyth: Mass in D review – brick-throwing suffragette's sumptuous lost work,"(Chandos)The BBCSO and Sakari Oramo give Smyth’s era-defying mass the grand recording it deserves, alongside the overture to her opera The Wreckers",Erica Jeal,2019-10-17T15:00:24+0100,"Here’s Sakari Oramo filling in another gap in the British repertoire, one that you probably didn’t even know was there. Depending on your favourite story about her, Ethel Smyth is the brick-throwing suffragette conducting her fellow Holloway inmates with a toothbrush, or the bisexual society lady sketched by John Singer Sargent, or the rebellious young woman who defied her father to study composition at the Leipzig Conservatory but who dropped out because she didn’t think the teaching was up to much. Her Mass in D, premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in 1893 but almost absent from the choral society conveyor belt since, is as grand in scope as one might expect from such a woman. It’s gratifying to find it getting the kind of recording it deserves from forces who can do justice to its ambition.Smyth later said that writing the mass “sweated out” any thoughts she was harbouring of converting to Catholicism, and the atmosphere is operatic rather than devout – and so on this disc the stirring, seaswept overture to The Wreckers, her best-known opera, makes for an excellent prelude. In the mass itself, Oramo follows Smyth’s request to place the exuberant Gloria at the end, so it sounds structured for the concert hall rather than the cathedral. The opening Kyrie sets a scene full of tension, with music serious enough to be asking mercy for any amount of sin; but there’s a hint of consolation towards the end of the movement, and the Credo bursts on in an eruption of joy – the most striking of several dramatic plays of light and shade. The four vocal soloists are a little far back in the mix, and there are fleeting moments when one wants more fullness of tone from the two men, but the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus are on excellent, sumptuous form, and this recording should win the mass many new fans.There are more discoveries to be had, on a smaller scale, in Her Voice, the Neave Trio’s album of distinctive and distinguished chamber works by Louise Farrenc, Amy Beach and Rebecca Clarke. But for sheer enjoyment, try the folk-classical group Kottos’s new release Songs & Dances, in which they take pieces by composers including Bartók, Vaughan Williams and Vivaldi and reimagine them for a quartet of accordion, bouzouki, recorder and lyrical cello. It’s all effortlessly musical, and somehow gets to the heart of everything in joyous fashion."
Home listening: a world premiere recording for… Puccini,"Mark Elder conducts a star cast in the original one-act version of Le Willis. Plus, a thrilling new account of Bluebeard’s Castle",Fiona Maddocks,2019-10-13T05:30:42+0100,"• Opera Rara, half a century old next year, is a goldmine for anyone on a quest for rarities. You don’t expect Puccini to be among its composers, yet its latest release is the world premiere recording of his first opera, Le Willis (1884), in the original one-act version. Based on the legend of the sylph-like Vila, who appear in the ballet Giselle, it is better known in its 1889 two-act revision, called Le Villi (music from which is included here).Unlikely to be staged, this is the ideal way to explore Puccini’s youthful gift for lyricism and melody and to hear how, even in his early 20s, despite the static drama, he could shape a duet into a heartfelt emotional episode. The conductor is Opera Rara’s former artistic director, Mark Elder, with Ermonela Jaho in the title role and Arsen Soghomonyan as her faithless lover, Roberto, deftly accompanied by the London Philharmonic Orchestra.• Bartók wrote one opera, as dark and disturbing as any, in one act and an early 20th-century masterpiece: Bluebeard’s Castle. He dedicated it to his first wife, who might rightly have felt disturbed: Judith insists her new husband, Bluebeard, opens the door of his castle he has kept locked, only to encounter three former wives and meet her own doom. There’s no shortage of fine recordings – Bernard Haitink with the Berlin Philharmonic, Anne Sofie von Otter and John Tomlinson; Valery Gergiev with the LSO, Elena Zhidkova and Willard White – but this new version on Chandos from the Bergen Philharmonic, with Michelle DeYoung (heavy on vibrato but thrilling and expressive) and John Relyea (urgent, resonant, outstanding), conducted by Edward Gardner, a keen Bartók interpreter, is a deserving addition. The Bergen players capture all the score’s chill and terror, the glitter of the treasury, the dazzling magnificence of Bluebeard’s kingdom, the chirruping horror and sighs before the lake of tears: an agonising, vivid account.• Catch up with the BBC World Service’s The Arts Hour, in which the conductor Antonio Pappano discusses his life and career, especially his recent experience of working with the National Youth Orchestra of the United States."
Morton Feldman: Piano review – connecting the dots on a modern master,"Philip Thomas (Another Timbre, five CDs)Thomas’s authoritative playing shows why Feldman’s keyboard music is some of the most important of the last century",Andrew Clements,2019-10-10T15:00:22+0100,"Morton Feldman wrote for the piano for most of his composing career, and the 46 pieces included in Philip Thomas’s collection – the most extensive survey of this music to date, including several works recorded for the first time – provide a thread through its changing emphases and stylistic shifts. The earliest here is an untitled piece from 1942, just one minute long and composed when Feldman was 16; the latest is Palais de Mari from 1986, the year before his death.Thomas has been studying and playing Feldman for a quarter of a century, and his lengthy essay accompanying these discs, in which, as well as the pieces themselves, he discusses different approaches to interpreting this fascinatingly varied music, is an essential addition to the performances. As he points out, recordings of both of the biggest works here, the 90-minute Triadic Memories from 1981, and the hour-long For Bunita Marcus, written four years later, already run into double figures, and he admits to having had doubts about adding to those numbers. But including them as part of a much more comprehensive set made sense, for it enabled him, as he writes, “to find out how one piece rubs against another, where the contrasts and points of contact are.” The pieces that Thomas has omitted, and his reasons for doing so, are clearly explained, too.What we have here, then, is an authoritative presentation of some of the most important keyboard music of the second half of the 20th century. If the works here from the late 1940s and early 50s reveal the importance of John Cage on Feldman’s music – it’s quite easy to imagine works such as the Illusions of 1949, or the Three Dances from the following year, being played on a prepared piano – then very soon after that Feldman’s personal voice becomes totally recognisable, in its restraint, fastidious voicing and meticulously calculated harmonies, whether the scores are indeterminate, or notated conventionally or graphically.Between 1964 and 1977, Feldman wrote nothing for solo piano, but the piece with which he broke that silence, baldly titled Piano, is one of the most remarkable in the whole set. Though it is far less well-known than the larger scale works that followed it, Piano seems to exploit every facet of the instrument – its range of tone and touch, harmonics and resonance – more comprehensively than anything else Feldman wrote. It provides a perfect demonstration of Thomas’s mastery and understanding of this music too, alive to every inflection and subtle change of colour, and to every challenge it presents."
‘Do or die’: Australian cycling in limbo amid landmark reform,"Opposition to governance unification, along with the high voting thresholds, risks derailing nation-wide changes",Kieran Pender,2019-10-21T18:00:40+0100,"Cycling in Australia faces unprecedented upheaval, with voting underway to unify the 19 separate entities responsible for the sport across the country. While the proposed restructuring is intended to facilitate better outcomes for elite and recreational cyclists, create “one voice” for advocacy and improve the sport’s financial position, resistance to the reform risks leaving cycling in disarray.“This is a real opportunity to create significant change for the better,” says Scott McGrory OAM, an Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist who now works as a race director. “Doing nothing is, quite simply, stupid. This is a ‘do or die’ moment for Australian cycling.”In 2018, federal agency Sport Australia commissioned a governance review from Ernst & Young, with the support of the three national sporting organisations: Cycling Australia, BMX Australia and Mountain Bike Australia. The consultancy’s subsequent 128-page report identified that cycling is “fragmented in its structure, strategy and delivery”. The division of cycling into three disciplines, with two possessing constituent state and territory organisations, left individual entities with “few assets, restricted revenue opportunities and limited capacity”.This year, the three NSOs proposed a complete unification, merging the three cycling disciplines, and the 19 constituent bodies, to form “AusCycling”. Among the suggested benefits of this model are a single racing licence, improved commercial and advocacy outcomes, and more resources as a result of efficiencies. Sport Australia has also promised A$2.5m if the merger proceeds.“This proposal is about making cycling as strong as it can be,” CA chief executive Steve Drake tells Guardian Australia. “I have always loved cycling – I want to see it prosper. This is the way it can.”The three NSOs have promised that no jobs will be lost as a result of the merger, except the three chief executive roles. “It was never going to be possible for the CEO of, say, CA to be the CEO of AusCycling, because it would be a perceived as a CA takeover.” A new, external CEO will be sought to lead the unified organisation.While staffing levels are expected to remain static or even grow, organisational synergies and improved negotiation power are expected to substantially improve the sport’s financial position. EY estimated an annual saving of about A$2m; the NSOs have indicated all savings will be reinvested.“We want to remove duplicated systems and avoid wasted effort,” says Drake. “At the moment we have 19 legal entities with 19 boards. While all directors are volunteers, for any board you have compliance requirements, audits etc – all of that takes time. That effort that is not needed. Collectively, we are a sport with turnover of about $28m across all the entities. Having 19 boards and over 100 directors does not make sense at our scale.”Voting across the various national, state and territory entities is due to begin in the coming weeks. For the proposal to pass, 75% of MTBA’s individual members and six of the eight constituent bodies of CA and BMXA respectively must approve the unparalleled governance overhaul (each with a 75% majority of their own). Voting rights at state level are predominantly, although not universally, controlled by local clubs.Not everyone is in favour of unification. Several states have expressed concerns with the plan. When the NSOs scheduled roadshows in September in Adelaide, Darwin, Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Launceston, Perth and Mackay to discuss the proposal with stakeholders, Western Australia’s WestCycle suggested that they should not visit Perth. The NSOs went anyway. “It was a lively debate,” says Drake. WestCycle was contacted for comment.This opposition, along with the high voting thresholds, risks derailing comprehensive, nation-wide governance reform. Drake admits the unification may proceed even without unanimity from state and territory bodies, or even with only two of the three NSOs.“There are lots of permutations,” he says. “But AusCycling would not come into operation until the second quarter of 2020, so there would be opportunity for a state body who voted no to change their view, or for constituent clubs from that state to join directly.”If the proposal is approved, it is expected that unification will not be finalised until just months out from the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Drake insists that Australia’s medal prospects are unaffected.“There is no risk of disruption to high performance, whether the unification proceeds or not,” Drake says. “We have been very mindful of keeping the high performance business away from the distraction of the process.”Ahead of the critical voting period – which should conclude by 19 December – Drake is optimistic. “Any process of change can be challenging, but the level of support seems to be going up by the day,” he says. “People have been talking about something like this since 1994, and it has not yet happened. It will be a huge opportunity missed if we do not proceed.”One stakeholder in favour of change is McGrory. “This is the best chance we have to create growth and opportunities for everyone that pedals a bike of any kind,” he says. “I only hope that anyone who is still uncertain at AusCycling can look at this with an open mind.”"
I can't stand my best friend's alpha male boyfriend. Do I tell her?,"When you’ve chosen the wrong person, sometimes other people can help you see it. But honesty rarely works, says Eleanor Gordon-Smith",Eleanor Gordon-Smith,2019-10-23T00:18:41+0100,"I don’t like my friend’s boyfriend. He’s been quite rude and makes no effort. From his behaviour, it seems he favours an “alpha male” position and doesn’t like to be contradicted, even in a very trivial way. Is it awful if I can’t stand my best and oldest friend’s partner? I’m sure he adores her but I fear she deserves better. Can I express something along these lines or do I risk putting her in a difficult situation? Is it imperative we try to get along with our friends’ partners?I, like you, have heard dozens of versions of the story that begins with “she chose the wrong man” and ends in tears. If we’re honest with ourselves we might even have been the protagonist in a few. It puts the truth to Sartre’s old remark that hell is other people. Hell is also, and especially, the people we put up with because they love the people we love.There are two questions here. One is whether you should say something by some kind of moral principle, and the other is whether you can pragmatically get any foothold in her mind by saying it.The problem is that in more or less all the stories you and I already know about the girl who chooses the wrong person, it’s very seldom the intervention of other people that gets her to see it. Sometimes it is. But very rarely. More often she has to go through a whole lot of heartbreak and self-discovery and betrayal before she sees what everyone else sees.The psychoanalyst Alfred Adler suggested that people often find complicated ways to cause themselves suffering, because there’s an underlying need that that suffering answers. Maybe we find ourselves with manipulative people because we don’t want to make our own decisions; maybe we find ourselves with cruel people because we believe we deserve suffering.I don’t know whether something like that is going on for your friend, and she might not either, but ask yourself deeply and truthfully, do you think there’s any chance she really doesn’t realise he’s a jerk? Or is it that right now, for her reasons, his specific brand of jerk is just what she needs?If that’s what’s going on then there’s another question for you: what kind of friend do you want to be? Are you the one who points out what underlying pain she might be outsourcing to this guy? Or are you the one who lets her unravel in her own way, confident you’ll be there to help her pick up her unspooled self at the other end? Only you can answer that.Then there’s the moral question. There’s an old principle due to Immanuel Kant: “Ought implies can.” The question of whether you ought to try to get her to see this guy’s bad character depends on whether you really think you can – and even if you can, whether you want to, or whether you prefer to let her see it in her own way. Friendship asks all kinds of peculiar, unconditional things of us. Perhaps now you’re in a position to offer her the kind of genuine, patient love that this guy doesn’t seem to.*************************************Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

Why I worry about men who marry women 40 years younger than them,65-year-old Dennis Quaid is engaged to 26-year-old Laura Savoie – which will be his fourth marriage and continue an interesting pattern,Poppy Noor,2019-10-22T18:12:08+0100,"Dennis Quaid, a 65-year-old man who already looks like his own waxwork, yesterday announced his engagement to Laura Savoie. At 26, she already looks like every one of his three ex-wives – if none of them ever aged. And while I do think we should all be able to date anyone we like as long as it’s consensual, I do worry about him a little bit.In general, I worry about any man who chooses to date a woman 40 years younger – mainly because she will always outperform him in sports, but also because it’s awkward when people can’t tell if your companion is your daughter or your wife.Quaid’s first wife, the actor PJ Soles, of Carrie fame, was three years older than him when they married and no one batted an eyelid. When Quaid married his second wife, also a blond actor – Meg Ryan, heard of her? – everyone wished them well. Ryan is eight years younger than Quaid.If once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and the third time is a pattern, perhaps we should have seen the next one coming – a bit like a Russian doll.At the tender age of 50, Quaid married his third wife, Kimberley Buffington, then 34, and the couple had twins. Could anyone have guessed what happened next?Well, probably. Quaid is well-known for his starring role as the father of twins in the Parent Trap. As actor Elaine Hendrix, who played his 26-year-old fiancee in the Parent Trap pointed out, the real life script had already been written: in the movie, Quaid’s character, the father of twins, splits from his wife and gets engaged to a 26-year-old blond woman.Watch out for those twins. 👯‍♀️ https://t.co/Rloat1gLCyNow, I hear some of you already: so what if Quaid is now marrying a 26-year-old? Maybe she is wise beyond her years, or maybe Quaid is just immature. That’s not to mention that his new young fiancee has the free will to marry whomever she likes – it would be unfeminist not to point this out, right?I agree that as long as they’re happy, we should be happy for them. But if Quaid keeps on consecutively marrying younger and younger, then disregarding the math in this case would be reckless.As one very astute commentator has pointed out, the trend foretells a very worrying future for Quaid’s future engagement prospects.“His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger. His fourth wife will be forty years younger.”The logical end to this pattern? “Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet.”His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger.His fourth wife will be forty years younger. Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet. https://t.co/J4agZTE4hF"
Match of the day: meet the people who helped their ex find new love,"You may find the idea of setting up your ex-partner with a date ridiculous – but, for some, it couldn’t be more natural",Sirin Kale,2019-10-22T10:00:55+0100,"After Elliot broke up with his girlfriend Kelly, they stayed friends. Why wouldn’t they? The breakup had been amicable; after dating for a year and moving in together, they started squabbling over silly things and figured they were better off apart. They were on a night out in April last year with their friendship group when Elliot, a 27-year-old childcare worker from Lancashire, bumped into Tom, an old work colleague. They made small talk for a bit, before going their separate ways. But Tom had caught Kelly’s eye, and the next day she called Elliot with an unusual request: could he set them up on a date?Elliot wasn’t opposed to the idea, but there was a problem. “I said: ‘I have no idea who you’re on about!’” he remembers. “We’d had such a brief conversation that it didn’t stick in my memory.” A few days later at work, Elliot’s team leader mentioned Tom’s name. “I thought: ‘That’s who she meant!’ I texted her saying: ‘It’s this guy.’” Kelly and Tom started messaging; Elliot even helped her craft the initial, flirtatious texts. It worked: Kelly and Tom now live together.There are countless articles online about how to find love after a breakup – or win your ex back, if that’s what you want. Helping an ex-partner find love with someone new is an entirely different and much rarer phenomenon. But it happens. This month, New Zealand couple Damien and Whakarongotai Nikora’s Facebook statuses went viral. They had posted announcing their split, and both had included a personal ad on behalf of the other. The pair, who were married for 21 years, titled their posts: “Why you should date my ex.” “If you get the chance to date her, lucky man,” wrote Damien of Whakarongotai.Most people – at least those whose relationships were not abusive or vitriolic – want their exes to be happy. But actively working to help your ex find love? It is unusual, particularly in monogamous circles. Some of Elliot’s co-workers struggled to understand his actions. “They said: ‘I’d hate to see my ex getting with someone else.’ But I thought, why? You’re not together any more. Why should that concern you?”An advantage of setting up your ex is that you know their quirks and foibles better than almost anyone else, and can vet prospective partners for compatibility. “You know your exes, and you know your friends, so you can basically tell what sort of people they will like in relationships and what they do like and don’t like,” says Andrea Campos, 25, a lawyer from London. Two years ago, she was on holiday with a female friend in Dubai when Campos’s ex-boyfriend messaged her. He had seen her friend in the photos Campos had been sharing, and found her attractive.“I said: ‘Do you want me to play Cupid?” Campos says. He agreed. They dated for a short while, but nothing long-term came of it. She doesn’t view her actions as remarkable. “I’m not a jealous person. If I think people will get on, I’ll introduce them. You want the people you care about to be happy, and if you think they’d be happy together, you might as well help.”Although it might seem tempting to launch into your address book and begin setting up your former flames and friends, a word of caution: it is not a risk-free exercise. Perhaps you will discover that you are not over them or, if the resulting relationship turns sour, you may get caught up in the fallout. But if you are thinking of setting up your ex with someone new, the first thing to do is check they are happy with it before you do. “It’s healthy to hope an ex-partner goes on to form other healthy relationships,” says Ammanda Major, a therapist with the relationship charity Relate. “But it depends on whether your ex wants you to do that. Otherwise, you’re treating them like a commodity, and selling them on.”Ask yourself why you’re trying to set up your ex. Are you genuinely motivated by feelings of altruism, or are you doing it to assuage guilt, or to prove a point? “If you ended the relationship and don’t want them to feel bad about it, you might think that fixing them up with someone new will take their mind off it,” Major says. “But it can be disrespectful to what you had, if it can quickly be overcome by being set up with someone new.” Above all, respect a firm no. “We all think we know best and so-and-so might be perfect for them. But doing things without someone’s permission is never a good idea.”Setting up your ex with someone new is an acid test for whether you are truly over that person. If the thought fills you with horror, you may still have feelings for them. “You have to be honest with yourself,” says Christina Gale, 27, who lives in London and works in social media. “If you’re funny about an ex, you’ve obviously still got feelings. If you’ve moved on, why wouldn’t you want to see them in a new relationship? I’m not a jealous person. I think everyone should be able to find love.”Setting up her friends with her exes has become Gale’s signature move. “I’ve done this so many times!” she laughs. “I date people and think, actually, you’d be better suited to someone else I know.” One ex sticks out: they had been together for six years, but ended things amicably. He had started hanging out with another woman – as friends – but Gale was convinced it could be something more. “I went to her and said: ‘Do you think he’s good-looking? She said: ‘Yeah!’” Gale let him know – and they started dating.Not everyone can understand a decision to set up an ex. “I have straight friends that say I’m crazy,” says Leo Camanho, 23, a student from Rio de Janeiro. “They say: ‘You’re so mature; how can you do this?’” He set up his ex-boyfriend Lucas with his best friend, Fabio, after he and Lucas broke up. He thinks setting up your exes is more common in queer circles. “In Rio, if you’re not friends with your ex, you don’t have any exes, because everyone dates everyone here.” After Fabio and Lucas started dating, they came to Camanho for his blessing. “I said: ‘Totally, you are both friends of mine, I love you both, go and be happy.’”In New York’s queer scene, 28-year-old Remy Duran is a legend. The reality-TV star became known across the city for his little black book – in reality, a mobile phone full of contacts, with subfolders categorising sexual preference – that he uses to connect ex-partners looking for love (or sex). Duran didn’t set out to be New York’s answer to Cilla Black: his matchmaking was an incidental byproduct of his dating life. As he dated his way around New York, his social circle grew, and former partners would hit him up for advice if there was someone they had their eye on.“People would be like: ‘Do you know that person? I’ve wanted to hook up with them for ever. And I’d be like: ‘Sure, I don’t own them, you can totally see them!’” His matchmaking is primarily altruistic – he wants to ensure people are having a good time. But there is also a deeper motivation. “It feels liberating,” Duran says. “You don’t own anyone, and it gives you a sense of closure.” He has set up at least 20 former partners, ranging from hookups to ex-boyfriends. So far, so good. “They say thank you,” says Duran. “I don’t think I’ve had any complaints.”Polyamorous people may be more relaxed than monogamous people about helping their exes date someone new. One polyamorous person, who prefers to remain anonymous, says: “I don’t see it as ‘setting people up’. I mean, they’re poly, they bang whoever; I just introduced them.” But outside of polyamory, setting up your ex with someone new is the ultimate affront to a monogamous dating culture that views ex-partners as possessions, rather than autonomous beings with free will. “We live in a possession-based culture where we see human beings as objects,” Elliot says. “You – you’re mine. Monogamous relationships can be like that. Even after you break up, people can’t let go of that sense of ownership. But I don’t think relationships should be possessive in that way.”Sometimes, setting up your ex with a friend happens so organically, it feels like an act of God. When Joanna Delooze was 20, she dated a man named Aaron. On one of their dates, Aaron mentioned that he had a list of qualities he looked for in a potential spouse. Delooze, who is now 55, made Aaron show her his list. “I read it and said: ‘I’m not joking, but with the exception of one thing, my roommate Linda ticks every single box on your list.’” She laughs. “It was completely her! If I was a guy, and this was my list, I’d date my roommate.”Delooze was absolutely right: Linda and Aaron have been together for 35 years and have six children. She is delighted to have helped engineer their happiness. “I see pictures of their family and all their kids and how they’re still together and I think it’s just great.”Some names have been changed"
I can only climax from oral or manual stimulation. Is this normal?,"I enjoy sex, and have had long-term partners, but I have never experienced an orgasm from penetration",Pamela Stephenson Connolly,2019-10-22T08:00:59+0100,"I’m a 35-year-old woman and have never been able to orgasm from penetration. I have had a few partners, some long-term, and I enjoy sex, but can only climax from oral/manual stimulation. Is this normal? Sometimes it’s hard to explain to a partner that I do enjoy it if they do it right (they think there’s something wrong with them or me if I don’t climax from penetration). And sometimes with a newer partner I’m too embarrassed to ask for what I really need. But I don’t want to fake it.For you – and for most women – the most heightened sensations of sexual pleasure emanate from stimulation of your clitoris. Vaginal penetration will only bring you to orgasm if the nerve endings in your clitoris are sufficiently engaged. But many people do not know this, and the politics of sex and gender have meant that incorrect beliefs have prevailed, and feelings of inferiority and frustration remain widespread. There is nothing wrong with you; your sexual response is completely normative. From now on, take charge of your pleasure. Try to find ways to receive more direct clitoral stimulation during intercourse, perhaps manually (your partner’s hand or yours) or through experimenting with different positions, styles or toys. But if you prefer, just relax and allow yourself to be brought to orgasm separately the way you like. Educate your partners and show them exactly what you need. In most cases they will be grateful for the clear instruction, and you will more profoundly appreciate them – and yourself.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

Why Helen Mirren’s Catherine the Great is a sexual revolutionary,"In her portrayal of the much younger queen, the actor is reminding us that many women continue to enjoy sex as long as men do",Jane Martinson,2019-10-22T07:59:54+0100,"The majestic Helen Mirren is showcasing how much more straightforward it is for a woman to play at being royal than it is to marry into royalty.Even better, by playing, at the age of 74, the title role of HBO’s Catherine the Great, Mirren is portraying a woman “half her age”, while simultaneously reminding the world that many women actually like sex. And continue to do so as long as men do. Shocker.We have grown so used to wrinkly old men being found fabulously attractive by young women on screen that we even have a term for it: the Woody Allen syndrome. Yet Mirren, who literally pants for her key ally, Grigory Potemkin, on screen, is very unusual – I can’t think of any other female septuagenarians showing flesh on screen (unless they are playing a corpse).That Mirren is a generation older than the 50-year-old Jason Clarke, who plays Potemkin, is one thing, but the fact that she genuinely seems to be wanting – nay craving – post-menopausal sex is the real surprise.It is unprecedented and has drawn comparisons from some reviewers with other TV hits that subvert sexual power play – the lesbian love triangle in The Favourite, for instance, or Gentleman Jack.The power shift of Catherine the Great comes because she was a monarch. There still aren’t quite as many of those who are women as there are men, but maybe, as the stories we see on screen become more diverse, we will see many more brilliant older women playing romantic roles against younger men. Then we can call it the Helen Mirren syndrome."
How we met: ‘I’m a staunch Brexit critic – but it did lead to us falling in love’,"Tom Browne, 43, and Nara Falcón, 36, have been together since 2018. They have a baby daughter",Nell Frizzell,2019-10-21T14:15:38+0100,"Tom and Nara met in a queue last year. “I’d spent three years living in the UK,” jokes Ireland-born Tom. “I’d picked up some of your ways.” Forced to relocate to Madrid because of Brexit, he had been in town only three weeks and had a friend visiting from Dublin, so he was ticking off some of the local attractions.“We’d done most of the tourist stuff, so we ended up in El Retiro park, queueing to go on a boat ride,” he says. Waiting in front of them was Nara. “There was a vibe from the start. Nara is beautiful and has this warm personality that I could see when she was talking to her friend, even though I couldn’t understand the words she was saying. She’s gorgeous, open and friendly.”His ice-breaker was hardly the stuff of romcoms. “We were in the queue, exchanging glances, and I think I said something very basic like: ‘Do you know how long we have to wait?’ It wasn’t exactly a Hollywood opener.” He and Nara, who is Mexican, and their friends Paula and John decided to hire a boat as a foursome. “I trapped her for an hour on a little rowing boat, so she had to listen to all my nonsense,” Tom says. “My friend John and I did most of the rowing. We were showing off a little bit, I suppose.” The lake is small enough that you can cover it in half an hour, but they were there for an hour. “We took the piss a little bit.”The attraction was mutual and immediate. “I was trying to stop myself, of course, and take it step by step,” says Nara. “But it was the perfect timing. When we met, I was single. Also, for me, Tom was so perfect that I was surprised he was single. Everything was just perfect.” After their time on the lake, the quartet went to a bar for tapas and a drink. “Paula and John were enjoying it, too,” says Tom. “But it was clear as day, I’d say, that Nara and I were falling in love.”Tom, an engineer, works for an EU project called Galileo, which is why he had to move from Southampton to Madrid. “I am a staunch Brexit critic,” he says. “I think it’s a regressive idea and too divisive, but in this case it did lead to falling in love. It’s a cliche and all of that, but it was instant and amazing. If I’d written a list of all the characteristics of the perfect girl, she ticked every single one.”The couple had been together for about four months when Tom was due to fly to Thailand for a month-long Thai boxing training camp in the middle of the forest. “I didn’t know if I should cancel, because we’d only just got together,” says Tom. “But Nara is a synchronised swimmer – she was once on the Mexican Olympic team – and appreciated the importance of an active, physical, adventurous life.”“I basically said: ‘This is your personality, this is who you are, if you don’t go and do it I’ll kill you,’” Nara laughs.Although he had not met Nara’s parents by this point, Tom got in touch with her father, Carlos, to ask if he could fly to Mexico and surprise her at Christmas, after he’d finished in Thailand. “He said that I was making her daughter very happy, that I’d be welcome any time. He gave me the nicest reaction,” says Tom. “Both parents were so lovely.”It was quite a journey. “I went from Madrid to Thailand, then from Thailand to China, China to Canada and finally Canada to Mexico. They were the only flights that weren’t €10m.” By flying so slowly through so many time zones, he managed to have three Christmas Eves and two Christmas Days. When he arrived, Nara’s father collected Tom from the airport while Nara was in bed, somehow managing to keep the entire thing secret. “When I came back to the house she was asleep,” says Tom. “I think her cousin has it on video, but she just didn’t know what was going on.”Almost exactly nine months after that surprise reunion in Mexico, Tom and Nara’s daughter, Chloe, was born in hospital in Madrid. “I can’t wait to tell Chloe this story of how we met,” says Nara. “I think she’ll love it.”Want to share your story?

I can’t come to terms with my boyfriend’s female friendships,"You must master your jealously or it will play havoc with your relationship, says Mariella Frostrup",Mariella Frostrup,2019-10-20T07:30:50+0100,"The dilemma My partner of three years sent a female colleague a pornographic joke, and I can’t get over it. He said they’ve been friends since school days, but it doesn’t sit right with me. He can’t explain why he did it, apart from banter, and he thought she would find it funny. He’s said it won’t happen again and he made an error of judgment. Ten days before this he invited a female golfing colleague to his house for a curry (albeit with his male lodger). It sends out the wrong message, and if he feels this is acceptable, what else is he capable of? My mind is running riot. I know I have trust issues – my ex was unfaithful at least six times, and the reason I found out about the pornographic text was because I checked his phone. He’s the love of my life and he feels the same. There has always been strong chemistry between us and I don’t want to let my past get in the way, but I’m really struggling.Mariella replies Poor you. Having endured the ravages of paranoid (and sometimes not so paranoid) jealousy in my youth, I know how agonising it can be. Luckily, it’s a debilitating condition that most of us manage to control over time. Allowed to flourish, jealousy becomes your master, sapping emotional energy and any hope of happiness.Last time I checked, a romantic union is sustained on the basis of mutual trust and desire. No partnership can survive the scrutiny, strictures and control you’re enforcing. This will lead to the very deceit you’re fearful of, based on the reasonable desire on your partner’s part to have freedom of choice when it comes to his friendships. Hooking up isn’t about placing your beloved in lockdown. It’s about finding someone you can open up to, who enhances your life experience and whom you place in pole position in your affections. That doesn’t mean they should enter a state of purdah, curtail all encounters with the opposite sex, strike friends bearing proscribed genitalia from their address book and only make single-sex social engagements.Risqué jokes and a curry are not the cliff edge of salacityWe know that love is an irrational collision of pheromones and feelings, an arbitrary emotional reaction to another human being. Jealousy is also irrational, but deserves inclusion as envy’s cousin on the list of seven deadly sins. Jealousy is born of fear, laced with insecurity and topped with a heady mix of personal, often historic foibles that make every case unique.Sending a long-term friend a pornographic joke may raise questions about your boyfriend’s sense of humour, but that doesn’t make it an entrée to an affair. Having supper with a sporting colleague is perfectly reasonable behaviour – and even more so in the company of a flatmate. Most of us no longer live in a society where every encounter with the opposite sex is a match-making moment – and how much better off we are for that. Here in the 21st century, those who are sexually compatible also regard each other as equals, work shoulder to shoulder, and play and party together. And we do all that without it having to end in sexual intercourse – often enjoying interactions more because of that.You ask what else your partner is capable of if he can send risqué jokes and share curries with golfing friends, as though those two activities represent the cliff edge of salacity. I’d argue that there’s nothing healthier than a man who still considers other women his friends, while choosing you to be his lover. You’ve already identified the real problem you are struggling with and it’s one of trust. Like innocence, it’s something we should assume and place in others until, and only if, they prove themselves not to be worthy of our assumptions.Your insecurity, currently playing havoc with your imagination, is damaging your ambition for a healthy relationship and is, ironically, the element most likely to prevent you achieving it. Affectionately referred to as a “little green monster”, jealousy is not, in fact, benign. It’s expansive, both in the person feeling it and in its ability to wreak destruction in our romantic lives. So, whether with expert help or a decided determination to overcome your pattern of distrust, I would urge you to tackle it. Obviously, I can’t promise that your partner will be faithful for ever and, as I don’t know him, I can’t even confirm he’s worthy of your trust. I do know, however, that a relationship built on suspicion, where your energy is focused on policing your partner rather than enjoying him, is a relationship doomed to disaster.With the best will in the world, your surveillance powers aren’t omnipotent, and if your man is intent on enjoying extra-curricular activities, he’ll find a way. What a squandering of your time and energy it is to focus on curtailing them. You’d be far better developing a great and irresistible relationship rather than invading your boyfriend’s privacy and keeping tabs on who he mingles with when he’s not in your eyeline. Your toxic levels of jealousy are as likely to destroy your relationship as any infidelity. Obsessive control is neither healthy nor tolerable and the sooner you deal with the origins of your trust issues the better for all concerned.If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.

My partner’s ex texts him every day. Should I be worried?,"People stay in touch with exes for all sorts of reasons. Some do it to bolster their ego, says Annalisa Barbieri",Annalisa Barbieri,2019-10-18T15:01:55+0100,"Two years ago, I started a relationship with a wonderful older man, but from the beginning something seemed a little off. After we celebrated our first anniversary, I had the shameful impulse to ask to see his phone. He agreed. There I saw what was bothering me: a previous girlfriend had been texting him every day, and he had been replying: photos, kiss emoticons, five-minute-long voice messages. It had been going on every day for the year we had been together.They apparently had an intense, somewhat problematic, two-year relationship, but she moved abroad. He says they were going to break up anyway. I felt they were being disrespectful towards me and towards themselves, putting all this energy into something that had theoretically ended and not allowing new relationships to fully blossom. He said they texted because they remained good friends, that’s all. That is hard for me to believe. He said he was not aware this could be so damaging to me. He told me he had stopped messaging her so often and that, for him, it made no difference.A year has passed and everything is great. However, I still have moments of doubt. He travels a lot and works in the same field as his ex, sometimes travelling to the same places. I can’t help but imagine emotionally charged encounters, if not more. Does my insecurity have some sort of foundation, or I am making a bit too much of this?I wonder what made you ask to see his phone after a year? And I wonder what made you write now?I think we can become insecure when we know something’s not right, and that some people make us feel more insecure than others. We tend to lack confidence in situations, or people, when we feel information is being withheld and we don’t know the full story – so we fill in the gaps with our own imagination.I would have liked to know a bit more about your past relationships and if you’ve always been like this. If so, then it’s worth looking at why relationships make you feel insecure. Or maybe this is your first serious relationship and you don’t have exes, so you can’t understand why people stay in touch with theirs. When I found out my first boyfriend still occasionally saw his ex, I couldn’t understand why, either. But people stay in touch with exes for all sorts of reasons, some of them benign and some not so much. Some people like to have their exes on the back-burner to bolster their ego. I’ve known men like that.Five-minute-long voice messages and texts every day is quite a commitment, however: does he lavish the same attention on all his friends? What’s the context? I’m also intrigued that he’s older, has experience of relationships, but doesn’t seem to think that being in touch with his ex might bother you. Plus, so much texting yet it “made no difference to him”? Then why do it? I think he’s being disingenuous.Gavin de Becker writes (brilliant, fascinating) books about how we ignore our intuition, often to our detriment. It has made me realise the power of intuition, which social conditioning has largely taught us to ignore for fear of seeming silly or paranoid. We don’t feel we can trust our instincts, so often look for proof instead – as you did with your boyfriend’s phone.In De Becker’s book The Gift Of Fear, he writes about giving a talk and asking how many people in the audience had children. Then he asked: “How many of you have left your children with a babysitter?” And finally he asked: “How many of you aren’t absolutely sure about your babysitter?” A few hands went up. So he said: “What are you doing here? Go home.”This isn’t really about who your boyfriend is in contact with or not; it’s about the fact that you feel something isn’t quite right. Pay attention to that feeling and explore it. There may be nothing going on, or you may just feel doubtful about him and have pegged all those doubts on to this one thing. For this relationship to have a future, you need to be able to trust him with your fears and know he will try to understand them; he should not only respect them, he should assuage them. A relationship where you doubt both him and yourself will eventually exhaust you. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

I can only climax from oral or manual stimulation. Is this normal?,"I enjoy sex, and have had long-term partners, but I have never experienced an orgasm from penetration",Pamela Stephenson Connolly,2019-10-22T08:00:59+0100,"I’m a 35-year-old woman and have never been able to orgasm from penetration. I have had a few partners, some long-term, and I enjoy sex, but can only climax from oral/manual stimulation. Is this normal? Sometimes it’s hard to explain to a partner that I do enjoy it if they do it right (they think there’s something wrong with them or me if I don’t climax from penetration). And sometimes with a newer partner I’m too embarrassed to ask for what I really need. But I don’t want to fake it.For you – and for most women – the most heightened sensations of sexual pleasure emanate from stimulation of your clitoris. Vaginal penetration will only bring you to orgasm if the nerve endings in your clitoris are sufficiently engaged. But many people do not know this, and the politics of sex and gender have meant that incorrect beliefs have prevailed, and feelings of inferiority and frustration remain widespread. There is nothing wrong with you; your sexual response is completely normative. From now on, take charge of your pleasure. Try to find ways to receive more direct clitoral stimulation during intercourse, perhaps manually (your partner’s hand or yours) or through experimenting with different positions, styles or toys. But if you prefer, just relax and allow yourself to be brought to orgasm separately the way you like. Educate your partners and show them exactly what you need. In most cases they will be grateful for the clear instruction, and you will more profoundly appreciate them – and yourself.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

I can’t come to terms with my boyfriend’s female friendships,"You must master your jealously or it will play havoc with your relationship, says Mariella Frostrup",Mariella Frostrup,2019-10-20T07:30:50+0100,"The dilemma My partner of three years sent a female colleague a pornographic joke, and I can’t get over it. He said they’ve been friends since school days, but it doesn’t sit right with me. He can’t explain why he did it, apart from banter, and he thought she would find it funny. He’s said it won’t happen again and he made an error of judgment. Ten days before this he invited a female golfing colleague to his house for a curry (albeit with his male lodger). It sends out the wrong message, and if he feels this is acceptable, what else is he capable of? My mind is running riot. I know I have trust issues – my ex was unfaithful at least six times, and the reason I found out about the pornographic text was because I checked his phone. He’s the love of my life and he feels the same. There has always been strong chemistry between us and I don’t want to let my past get in the way, but I’m really struggling.Mariella replies Poor you. Having endured the ravages of paranoid (and sometimes not so paranoid) jealousy in my youth, I know how agonising it can be. Luckily, it’s a debilitating condition that most of us manage to control over time. Allowed to flourish, jealousy becomes your master, sapping emotional energy and any hope of happiness.Last time I checked, a romantic union is sustained on the basis of mutual trust and desire. No partnership can survive the scrutiny, strictures and control you’re enforcing. This will lead to the very deceit you’re fearful of, based on the reasonable desire on your partner’s part to have freedom of choice when it comes to his friendships. Hooking up isn’t about placing your beloved in lockdown. It’s about finding someone you can open up to, who enhances your life experience and whom you place in pole position in your affections. That doesn’t mean they should enter a state of purdah, curtail all encounters with the opposite sex, strike friends bearing proscribed genitalia from their address book and only make single-sex social engagements.Risqué jokes and a curry are not the cliff edge of salacityWe know that love is an irrational collision of pheromones and feelings, an arbitrary emotional reaction to another human being. Jealousy is also irrational, but deserves inclusion as envy’s cousin on the list of seven deadly sins. Jealousy is born of fear, laced with insecurity and topped with a heady mix of personal, often historic foibles that make every case unique.Sending a long-term friend a pornographic joke may raise questions about your boyfriend’s sense of humour, but that doesn’t make it an entrée to an affair. Having supper with a sporting colleague is perfectly reasonable behaviour – and even more so in the company of a flatmate. Most of us no longer live in a society where every encounter with the opposite sex is a match-making moment – and how much better off we are for that. Here in the 21st century, those who are sexually compatible also regard each other as equals, work shoulder to shoulder, and play and party together. And we do all that without it having to end in sexual intercourse – often enjoying interactions more because of that.You ask what else your partner is capable of if he can send risqué jokes and share curries with golfing friends, as though those two activities represent the cliff edge of salacity. I’d argue that there’s nothing healthier than a man who still considers other women his friends, while choosing you to be his lover. You’ve already identified the real problem you are struggling with and it’s one of trust. Like innocence, it’s something we should assume and place in others until, and only if, they prove themselves not to be worthy of our assumptions.Your insecurity, currently playing havoc with your imagination, is damaging your ambition for a healthy relationship and is, ironically, the element most likely to prevent you achieving it. Affectionately referred to as a “little green monster”, jealousy is not, in fact, benign. It’s expansive, both in the person feeling it and in its ability to wreak destruction in our romantic lives. So, whether with expert help or a decided determination to overcome your pattern of distrust, I would urge you to tackle it. Obviously, I can’t promise that your partner will be faithful for ever and, as I don’t know him, I can’t even confirm he’s worthy of your trust. I do know, however, that a relationship built on suspicion, where your energy is focused on policing your partner rather than enjoying him, is a relationship doomed to disaster.With the best will in the world, your surveillance powers aren’t omnipotent, and if your man is intent on enjoying extra-curricular activities, he’ll find a way. What a squandering of your time and energy it is to focus on curtailing them. You’d be far better developing a great and irresistible relationship rather than invading your boyfriend’s privacy and keeping tabs on who he mingles with when he’s not in your eyeline. Your toxic levels of jealousy are as likely to destroy your relationship as any infidelity. Obsessive control is neither healthy nor tolerable and the sooner you deal with the origins of your trust issues the better for all concerned.If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.

Why I worry about men who marry women 40 years younger than them,65-year-old Dennis Quaid is engaged to 26-year-old Laura Savoie – which will be his fourth marriage and continue an interesting pattern,Poppy Noor,2019-10-22T18:12:08+0100,"Dennis Quaid, a 65-year-old man who already looks like his own waxwork, yesterday announced his engagement to Laura Savoie. At 26, she already looks like every one of his three ex-wives – if none of them ever aged. And while I do think we should all be able to date anyone we like as long as it’s consensual, I do worry about him a little bit.In general, I worry about any man who chooses to date a woman 40 years younger – mainly because she will always outperform him in sports, but also because it’s awkward when people can’t tell if your companion is your daughter or your wife.Quaid’s first wife, the actor PJ Soles, of Carrie fame, was three years older than him when they married and no one batted an eyelid. When Quaid married his second wife, also a blond actor – Meg Ryan, heard of her? – everyone wished them well. Ryan is eight years younger than Quaid.If once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and the third time is a pattern, perhaps we should have seen the next one coming – a bit like a Russian doll.At the tender age of 50, Quaid married his third wife, Kimberley Buffington, then 34, and the couple had twins. Could anyone have guessed what happened next?Well, probably. Quaid is well-known for his starring role as the father of twins in the Parent Trap. As actor Elaine Hendrix, who played his 26-year-old fiancee in the Parent Trap pointed out, the real life script had already been written: in the movie, Quaid’s character, the father of twins, splits from his wife and gets engaged to a 26-year-old blond woman.Watch out for those twins. 👯‍♀️ https://t.co/Rloat1gLCyNow, I hear some of you already: so what if Quaid is now marrying a 26-year-old? Maybe she is wise beyond her years, or maybe Quaid is just immature. That’s not to mention that his new young fiancee has the free will to marry whomever she likes – it would be unfeminist not to point this out, right?I agree that as long as they’re happy, we should be happy for them. But if Quaid keeps on consecutively marrying younger and younger, then disregarding the math in this case would be reckless.As one very astute commentator has pointed out, the trend foretells a very worrying future for Quaid’s future engagement prospects.“His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger. His fourth wife will be forty years younger.”The logical end to this pattern? “Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet.”His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger.His fourth wife will be forty years younger. Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet. https://t.co/J4agZTE4hF"
I can't stand my best friend's alpha male boyfriend. Do I tell her?,"When you’ve chosen the wrong person, sometimes other people can help you see it. But honesty rarely works, says Eleanor Gordon-Smith",Eleanor Gordon-Smith,2019-10-23T00:18:41+0100,"I don’t like my friend’s boyfriend. He’s been quite rude and makes no effort. From his behaviour, it seems he favours an “alpha male” position and doesn’t like to be contradicted, even in a very trivial way. Is it awful if I can’t stand my best and oldest friend’s partner? I’m sure he adores her but I fear she deserves better. Can I express something along these lines or do I risk putting her in a difficult situation? Is it imperative we try to get along with our friends’ partners?I, like you, have heard dozens of versions of the story that begins with “she chose the wrong man” and ends in tears. If we’re honest with ourselves we might even have been the protagonist in a few. It puts the truth to Sartre’s old remark that hell is other people. Hell is also, and especially, the people we put up with because they love the people we love.There are two questions here. One is whether you should say something by some kind of moral principle, and the other is whether you can pragmatically get any foothold in her mind by saying it.The problem is that in more or less all the stories you and I already know about the girl who chooses the wrong person, it’s very seldom the intervention of other people that gets her to see it. Sometimes it is. But very rarely. More often she has to go through a whole lot of heartbreak and self-discovery and betrayal before she sees what everyone else sees.The psychoanalyst Alfred Adler suggested that people often find complicated ways to cause themselves suffering, because there’s an underlying need that that suffering answers. Maybe we find ourselves with manipulative people because we don’t want to make our own decisions; maybe we find ourselves with cruel people because we believe we deserve suffering.I don’t know whether something like that is going on for your friend, and she might not either, but ask yourself deeply and truthfully, do you think there’s any chance she really doesn’t realise he’s a jerk? Or is it that right now, for her reasons, his specific brand of jerk is just what she needs?If that’s what’s going on then there’s another question for you: what kind of friend do you want to be? Are you the one who points out what underlying pain she might be outsourcing to this guy? Or are you the one who lets her unravel in her own way, confident you’ll be there to help her pick up her unspooled self at the other end? Only you can answer that.Then there’s the moral question. There’s an old principle due to Immanuel Kant: “Ought implies can.” The question of whether you ought to try to get her to see this guy’s bad character depends on whether you really think you can – and even if you can, whether you want to, or whether you prefer to let her see it in her own way. Friendship asks all kinds of peculiar, unconditional things of us. Perhaps now you’re in a position to offer her the kind of genuine, patient love that this guy doesn’t seem to.*************************************Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

The British Tribe Next Door review – why did no one put a stop to this?,Scarlett Moffatt and her Gogglebox clan have flown to Namibia to teach the Himba tribe to iron and climb stairs. How has this implicitly racist idea made it to our screens in 2019? ,Lucy Mangan,2019-10-22T22:15:15+0100,"I often think, when something new is delivered to our screens, of all the forces that have had to combine over the weeks, months, sometimes years to get it there. From the first stirrings in a dramatist’s mind or the first steps of a documentary maker nosing out a story, and on through the eternally mysterious journey of creation, their ideas are gradually forming until arriving, finally, at the last stage of fruition – the bureaucratic hoops through which all must jump. Commissioners to entice and enthuse, lawyers to please, notes to take in, paperwork to fill out, the long chain of decisionmakers to be appeased, satisfied and made comfortable, until finally the show is given a slot and aired to the masses.This, at least, is what I presume happens. But then programmes such as The British Tribe Next Door turn up and suddenly all certainties are gone, exploded into nothingness by a series – not even a one-off – that sends a suburban British family to live next door to a group of indigenous people in the Namibian desert to see what cultural hijinks ensue. And it is happening here, on Channel 4, in essence a public service broadcaster, and now, in the year of our Lord 2019.It is … exactly as it sounds. The suburban family are the Moffatts, the County Durhamites from Gogglebox, who are perfectly pleasant, inoffensive people distinguished mainly by their eldest daughter, Scarlett, who has both a sense of humour and the rare and charming ability to put her thoughts into TV-friendly words as she is having them. They are taken to Namibia – younger daughter Ava-Grace barely lifting her head from her phone no matter how many breathtaking herds of wildlife pass their jeep – to live for a month with the semi-nomadic Himba people in Otjeme. You might not have expected the programme makers to take the gimmickry this far, by building an exact replica of the Moffatt house there, but other than that there is nothing you would not have suspected.The Himba women who visit the house are staggered, and possibly appalled, by the 20,000 Moffattian possessions it contains (“Why do you need so many things for one person?” one asks, gazing round Scarlett’s cushion-covered, shoe-stuffed bedroom), fascinated and seemingly envious of the dishwasher and washing machine and baffled by the amount of housework that matriarch Betty still finds to do. The men reckon termites will take the lot in a few months.There are some truly fascinating moments that reveal (to the uninitiated in the ways of semi-nomadic tribes in the Namibian desert, among whom I count myself) unsuspected depths to the cultural chasm. The first women to visit the house are perturbed by the idea of having a second floor and then absolutely flummoxed by stairs – “Are we climbing? Will we fall?” – and intrigued by the hall mirror. “I thought there was someone on the other side. It’s like water on the wall.”But it is not enough to justify a series. And even less so a series that – despite what I’m generously going to assume were best efforts in the other direction – fails to avoid putting the tribe in the service of providing teachable moments to the Moffatts – and Scarlett in particular. The reaction in the mirror becomes the story of Scarlett’s insecurities about her body, as does the tribespeople’s desire that she wear their traditional dress.None of this is the Moffatts’ fault. Scarlett’s unfiltered responses serve her well (“I don’t want to offend them,” she says on her way back to the house after a failed attempt to explain why she is not happy about wearing the topless dress, “or make them think I don’t appreciate what they’ve done, because I do …”) but the makers have put them in what seems to me to be an implicitly racist format, working within a tradition that has historically not treated indigenous people well or respectfully, even if there is nothing overtly racist about this specific instance. At the very best, you could say it is a massively flawed premise executed as well as you could hope. At worst, you could say very, very differently. But apparently nobody, at any point in that long, long line of folk responsible between concept and fruition, did."

And the only winner appears to be Neumann, who is reportedly stepping back from the corporate crisis he created with a lucrative deal that will hand him $1bn from the sale of his shares plus a $185m “consultancy fee” and a $500m line of credit.Under the terms of a rescue deal first reported by The Wall Street Journal, SoftBank, the Japanese investment firm that is WeWork’s largest shareholder, will now take control of the company.The bailout deal will once again slash the valuation of the company. Once valued at as much as $65bn, WeWork is now thought to be worth $8bn – less than the $10bn SoftBank had invested in the company before the rescue package. It is an investment that has tarnished the reputation of one of the world’s biggest tech investors.The payout to Neumann comes as WeWork weighs up sacking about 2,000 people. The redundancies are on hold while WeWork refinances but are expected soon and have triggered widespread bitterness among WeWork’s 15,000 employees. Many had expected to become millionaires when the company floated but now face losing their jobs. WeWork did not immediately return calls for comment.Neumann, whose previous business ventures included a business selling women’s shoes with collapsible high heels and baby romper suits with reinforced knees, started his office rentals company in 2008 as an “eco-friendly co-working space” in Brooklyn, New York, with co-founder Miguel McKelvey.As a new generation of tech entrepreneurs looked for office space, the company grew rapidly, financed by SoftBank and other blue chip Wall Street investors including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase.By the end of June this year, WeWork had grown to a business with 528 locations worldwide with 527,000 tenants – or “members” as WeWork calls them.For Neumann, We – as the company is known – was a trailblazer for a new era.“The 90s and early 2000s were the ‘I’ decade,” Neumann told The Daily News back in 2011. “The iPhone, the iPod — everything was about me. Look where that got us? In a terrible recession. The next decade is the ‘We’ decade, where collaboration is the future of innovation.”The firm takes long-term leases on office buildings, then adds the WeWork aesthetic, such as beer taps on each floor, skateboard ramps, communal areas, a jungle of potted plants and a party atmosphere. It then rents the spaces out on a short-term basis. The company is the largest private sector tenant in both London and New York, and rents space to businesses varying from single freelancers to corporations such as HSBC.The last time SoftBank injected money into the business, it was valued at $47bn, despite vast losses that have totalled $3bn in the last three years. Earlier this year some bankers predicted WeWork could be worth as much as $65bn, which would have valued Neumann’s stakeat $14bn.However, after the publication of the share sale prospectus already sceptical investors began to question We’s business model, its huge losses and Neumann’s sometimes eccentric behaviour.Apart from his belief that WeWork could “solve the problem of children without parents”, Neumann has mused that he could one day become immortal, expand his business into communal living spaces and schools, and become the world’s first trillionaire.Neumann is married to Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, a former actor and cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow. Paltrow Neumann acted as her husband’s “strategic thought partner” and was instrumental in launching an ill-fated primary school, WeGrow, that offered daily Beatles sing-a-longs, meditation sessions and billed itself as a “conscious entrepreneurial school”. The Manhattan school, part of a planned chain and which charged up to $42,000 a year, will close this year.Investors were scared off by losses of close to $700m in the first half of 2019, $1.6bn in 2018, almost $900m in 2017, and more than $400m in 2016. Neumann also intended to retain special voting shares which would have kept control of the company even after the share sale, and allowed him to dismiss dissident directors. Investors were also unimpressed by news that Neumann had cashed out $700m of his shares ahead of the sale.The backlash led to the IPO’s cancellation and he stepped down as chief executive last month when it became clear the firm could run out of cash in November.Under the terms of the rescue deal, Marcelo Claure, SoftBank’s chief operating officer, would become chairman. The Japanese conglomerate would end up owning 60% to 80% of WeWork under the proposal, which includes $5bn of new debt, as well as injecting $1.5bn in equity and an offer to buy up to $3bn of existing shares.There is a rival funding package also on the table, from JP Morgan Chase, worth $5bn. That deal includes $2bn of unsecured debt. The board will decide on Tuesday which one to accept."
"Brexit effect on UK economy may be worse than thought, says CBI","Survey finds majority of factory owners have cut investment, as insolvencies hit six-year high",Phillip Inman,2019-10-22T19:03:16+0100,"A wave of corporate insolvencies, company profit warnings and a gloomy forecast of manufacturing investment over the next year has sparked concerns that Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK economy more than previously estimated.A survey by the business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) found that the prospect of leaving the EU’s customs union and single market without a deal had led a majority of factory owners to cut back investment for the coming year.With fewer than 10 days before the Brexit deadline of 31 October, respondents to the survey said they were planning to scale back their purchases of new machinery and IT equipment over the next year at a rate not seen since the 2008 financial crisis.Meanwhile, the number of companies going bust in the last three months jumped 35% on the previous quarter to the highest level since 2013. Analysis of official insolvency figures by the accountancy firm KPMG found that the construction industry was the worst affected, putting it just ahead of the retail sector as the source of most corporate insolvencies in 2019.The hotel group Whitbread, building supplies firm Travis Perkins and car dealer Pendragon also unveiled profit figures dented by customers’ Brexit fears.Whitbread said business bookings were down as companies reined in costs ahead of the Brexit deadline while Pendragon lost sales as consumers cut back on buying big ticket items, including cars.Both the construction and manufacturing sectors have entered a prolonged recession, leaving the services sector to keep the economy afloat over the last year.Speaking to the Guardian, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the latest figures showed that Brexit uncertainty would have long-lasting effects on most companies, but especially manufacturing firms after years of low or zero investment in their businesses.“The Tories’ disastrous mismanagement of our economy and their botched Brexit process has undermined our manufacturing base. Along with the mismanagement of our public finances, the reputation the Tories falsely claimed for economic competence has been completely shot. They are seen for what they are: a group of incompetent blusterers,” he said.The CBI said Brexit uncertainty, shrinking order books and a slump in global trade were blamed for the worst outlook in 10 years for the manufacturing sector with the car industry and transport equipment sectors cutting back at the fastest rate.Business optimism across the industry was also affected, hitting its lowest level since the referendum vote in 2016, according to the CBI’s industrial trends survey, while optimism about exports for the year ahead deteriorated by the greatest degree in 18 years.Tom Crotty, the group director of petrochemicals group Ineos and chair of the CBI’s manufacturing council, said it was concerning that “manufacturers’ investment intentions across buildings, machinery and skills are at their worst since the dark days of the financial crisis”.He said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit still hung over the industry, preventing companies from making decisions to retool their factories or spending money on training staff.The gloomy outlook follows months of fruitless lobbying by manufacturers for the government to agree the closest possible alignment with the EU as part of any Brexit deal.More than half of all UK goods are exported to the EU’s 27 other members, excluding gold, and manufacturers have consistently argued that higher barriers with the EU in the form of tariffs or customs checks would hit their profits.However, the government has pressed ahead with a cleaner break from the single market and customs union run by the EU, leaving only Northern Ireland inside the customs union for the purposes of trade.The survey of 258 manufacturing firms found that firms were more downbeat about their prospects in the three months to October than in the previous three-month period.Firms’ expectations for investment in buildings in the next year reached a balance of -44% while investment in plant and machinery covering the next 12 months dropped to a balance of -34%. Training budgets were cut to leave the balance at -28%.The CBI said its survey, which offsets the number of respondents saying they plan to expand against the number that say they plan to cut back, revealed that all three balances were at their weakest levels since the financial crisis.Adding to a string of figures indicating that industry was in the midst of a long recession, the CBI said job losses were accelerating at the fastest rate since 2010, adding that firms were anticipating an even sharper increase in layoffs the following quarter.﻿"
UK to use finance meant for green energy to support fracking in Argentina,Documents show government’s plans to use money from £1bn 2017 deal to prioritise support of major oil companies,Jillian Ambrose,2019-10-22T12:04:40+0100,"The UK is planning to invest in Argentina’s controversial oil shale industry using a £1bn export finance deal intended to support green energy, according to government documents seen by the Guardian.UK Export Finance, the government’s foreign credit agency, promised in 2017 to offer loans totalling £1bn to help UK companies export their expertise in “infrastructure, green energy and healthcare” to invest in Argentina’s economy.Instead official records, released through a freedom of information request, have revealed the government’s plan to prioritise support for major oil companies, including Shell and BP, which are fracking in Argentina’s vast Vaca Muerta shale heartlands.One government memo, uncovered by Friends of the Earth, said that while Argentina’s clean energy sector was growing, it was “Argentina’s huge shale resources that offer the greatest potential” for the UK.The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: ""The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.""One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change. Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.The briefing note was prepared before a key meeting between the UK government’s trade envoy to Latin America, the UK ambassador to Argentina and Argentina’s energy minister in February this year.Tony Bosworth, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the world hurtling towards catastrophic climate change, and parliament declaring a climate emergency, it’s outrageous that the UK government is continuing to back huge fossil fuel developments abroad.”Separate records, also uncovered by Friends of the Earth, revealed that there had been no fewer than 13 meetings between the UK and oil companies operating in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta hydrocarbon reservoir since the beginning of last year.The companies include Shell, Andina Resources, Phoenix Global Resources and Pan American Energy (PAE), a subsidiary of BP. They have contributed donations amounting to more than £40,000 to fund birthday celebrations for the Queen held at the British embassy in Bueno Aires over the past two years. There have been no meetings with renewable energy companies, according to the records.Argentina has become a magnet for major oil companies after discovering the world’s third largest shale reserves in the world. It hopes to replicate the US energy revolution by encouraging oil companies to exploit the reserves within the Vaca Muerta region despite strong opposition from local communities.A Guardian investigation this month revealed that the fracking industry had already caused irreversible damage to the ancestral homeland of Argentina’s indigenous Mapuche people after an oil fire burned for more than three weeks next to a freshwater lake in Vaca Muerta.Argentina delivered its first-ever export of light crude and liquified natural gas from Vaca Muerta earlier this summer, five years after local community protest was quashed by authorities using teargas and rubber bullets.The UK’s loans to support work in Argentina have been modest to date, but are expected to rise as Argentina’s burgeoning shale industry increases production. One of the largest provisions has been for £346,000 to support the UK company working with BP’s PAE in the 2017-2018 financial year.The government’s plan to support Argentina’s shale industry comes after an investigation revealed an eleven-fold increase in support for fossil fuels over the past year to almost £2bn.The plans are strongly opposed by MPs on the environmental audit committee, which branded the UK’s foreign fossil fuel investments as the “elephant in the room” undermining the UK’s climate leadership.The UK government legislated earlier this year to commit to a zero-carbon economy by 2050, and is preparing to host the UN’s next major climate talks in Glasgow next year. The government’s climate efforts will be led by a new sub-committee within the cabinet office to be headed by the prime minister.Friends of the Earth warned that Boris Johnson must show global leadership ahead of the Glasgow UN summit by putting environmental responsibility and decarbonisation at the heart of every government policy – both at home and abroad.“Boris Johnson’s pledge to lead the world in slashing climate-wrecking pollution will be meaningless if his government continues to back the exploitation of massive oil and gas developments in Argentina,” Bosworth said.A UKEF spokesperson said “The UK has a wide range of economic and commercial interests in Argentina. In support of this UKEF can provide its support for exports on a commercial basis across all sectors; it does not ringfence support for a specific industry. UKEF welcomes the opportunity to support all viable UK exports including in the renewables and green growth sectors to Argentina”. UKEF did not offer evidence that it had met any renewable energy developers in Argentina."
Just Eat in £4.9bn takeover battle as Prosus makes hostile bid,Bid rejected as online food delivery group presses ahead with merger with Takeaway.com ,Sarah Butler,2019-10-22T17:39:58+0100,"A £4.9bn takeover battle has broken out for Just Eat as the investment group Prosus launched an all-cash offer in an attempt to scupper the food delivery group’s planned merger with its Dutch rival Takeaway.com.Tech investment firm Prosus, which is part of South African conglomerate Naspers, held talks with Just Eat but, after failing to reach agreement on terms, said it had decided to go directly to shareholders – a process known as a hostile bid.Bob van Dijk, the chief executive of Prosus, said it had been considering a bid for Just Eat for some time. Prosus already owns a stake in the listed German food delivery group Delivery Hero and controls Brazil’s iFood and India’s Swiggy.Just Eat was the top riser on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday, with shares soaring 24% to 728p after Prosus announced its 710p-a-share bid. The Prosus offer is a fifth higher than the value of the all-share Takeaway.com bid which was announced in July.Some analysts suggested the offer was “cheeky” and opportunistic as it followed a fall in the share price of Just Eat after disappointing trading figures released this week. A fall in Takeaway.com’s stock has also reduced the effective value of its agreed all-share bid by nearly 20% since it was launched.However, Van Dijk said: “This is not opportunistic. We have been thinking about this asset for a long time and we know the team [at Just Eat] as we have been partners together in Brazil [in iFood].”“What we offer is a significant premium to what’s on the table [from Takeaway.com]. It offers certainty and we think shareholders should have the opportunity to form a point of view. We think they are going to be positive. The hostile labelling is a convention but we don’t see this as hostile.”The Prosus boss said he would be talking to Just Eat shareholders in the coming weeks and hoped to continue “constructive discussion” with the company’s board. “We can provide Just Eat with everything it needs to achieve significant growth,” Van Dijk added.However, the Prosus bid was swiftly rejected by Just Eat, which said it was pressing ahead with the Takeaway.com deal. It published documents laying out the takeover timetable, including a shareholder vote required to approve the deal on 2 December.“The board of Just Eat has considered the terms of the Prosus offer and believes that it significantly undervalues Just Eat and its attractive assets and prospects both on a standalone basis and as part of the proposed recommended all-share combination with Takeaway.com,” the company said in a statement.Just Eat said it had “fully engaged” with Prosus but had already rejected initial proposals of 670p and 700p a share.Shareholder Cat Rock, which owns a 3% stake in Just Eat, said the Prosus bid “dramatically undervalues” the company.Just Eat’s success was built on an ordering website that linked restaurants with customers. It has recently branched out into deliveries, responding to competition from Uber Eats and Deliveroo.Prosus said it would provide “substantial investment” to help Just East grow its own delivery business.The Prosus move comes only a day after Just Eat disappointed investors with its latest financial results. Its revenue growth slowed to 25% in the third quarter, down from 30% in the first half, raising fears that it is losing market share to rivals.Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: “The Prosus offer is in many ways very cheeky and even more low-ball – it’s still under the 731p initial offer from Takeaway.com and, while it has been rejected, will certainly up the ante and could force Takeaway.com into raising its offer as it looks in a weakened position due to the stock’s decline.”"
Deliveroo's highest paid director gets 57% pay rise despite losses,Will Shu understood to be unnamed person who also received £8.3m in share options,Sarah Butler,2019-10-22T19:00:34+0100,"Deliveroo’s highest paid director, understood to be the co-founder Will Shu, received a near 57% increase in basic pay and £8.3m in share options last year, despite widening losses at the food delivery firm.Shu, a former investment banker who set up Deliveroo from his London flat in 2013, appears to have received £250,000 in 2018, up from £159,532 a year before. The total pay package as the highest paid director also included a share-based award of stock options, convertible into shares or cash on the sale of the business, worth £8.3m. Deliveroo would not confirm it was Shu, but the individual’s pay record matches previously confirmed pay for him.The options award was part of £20.7m in share-based payments to “key management personnel” listed in Deliveroo’s accounts.Deliveroo’s share awards were revealed in accounts published at Companies House after Deliveroo reported a loss of £232m last year despite a 72% rise in sales to £476m.They were made amid rumours of a takeover by the US online firm Amazon. British regulators are investigating whether a large investment by Amazon into Deliveroo could harm consumers.The company, which in 2018 doubled the number of towns and cities it operates in, now works with 60,000 delivery riders, all of whom are “self-employed contractors” without a guaranteed minimum wage, holiday pay or sick pay.The Deliveroo rider Greg Howard, who is secretary of the couriers and logistics arm of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, said: “While year-on-year Will Shu continues to give himself inflation-busting pay rises, working conditions and pay for riders have never been worse.”He said the number of rider strikes was on the rise amid anger about pay and conditions. While Deliveroo claimed riders are paid £10 an hour, IWGB said costs such as equipment and insurance, as well as lower rates outside peak hours, mean riders earn much less.Deliveroo said that all staff had been handed share options because it “wants all employees to share in the success of the company”. Riders are not included in the share awards because they are “self-employed”.Deliveroo said: “Deliveroo’s rapid expansion is helping restaurants reach new customers, increase their sales and grow their business.”"
Accountancy profession 'complicit in Thomas Cook failure',"Rachel Reeves, chair of business committee, says legal reform needed",Julia Kollewe,2019-10-22T12:58:12+0100,"The chair of an influential parliamentary committee has launched a blistering attack on the accounting industry, accusing it of being complicit in the failure of Thomas Cook, Carillion and other firms, and called for urgent reform of the sector.Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said: “I wonder how many more company failures, how many more egregious cases of accounting do we need? We’ve had BHS, we’ve had Carillion, we’ve had Patisserie Valerie and now we’ve had Thomas Cook. How many more do we need before your industry opens its ideas and recognises that you are complicit in all of this and that you need to reform?”She added: “We can’t rely on you to do the right thing and legislation is needed. We need tougher regulation because your industry is not willing to make the changes needed. Reform is long overdue and the evidence today makes it clear that that moment has got to come and got to come soon otherwise we’ll have more business failures and you will be complicit in those.”Reeves was speaking as MPs on the committee grilled bosses from PricewaterhouseCoopers and EY, which both audited Thomas Cook’s accounts, and questioned them about potential conflicts of interest. Both firms also did other lucrative work for the collapsed travel company, as well as providing auditing services.MPs heard that PwC was paid £21m for providing consultancy and non-audit work for Thomas Cook between 2007 and 2016, which included advising the company on pay for its executives. EY, which took over from PwC in 2017, provided non-audit services totalling £2.4m.Hermione Hudson, PwC’s head of audit, said there are now “significant restrictions” on other work that can be done by a firm’s auditor. She insisted: “I don’t think doing those non-audit services would have impacted the quality of the audit work, but I do think it’s very important that we do have a trusted audit profession.”Reeves asked Hudson whether advising Thomas Cook’s remuneration committee on executive bonuses at the same time as auditing the business, in hindsight, was the right thing to do. Hudson replied: “At the time it was appropriate [but] we wouldn’t do it today even if it were permitted by the rules.”MPs also questioned the auditors about Thomas Cook’s use of exceptional items – one-off costs – that were stripped out of the main income statement, and why they signed off the accounts. Hudson acknowledged that £1.8bn of exceptional items over eight years was “a large number”. Both PwC and EY said they had repeatedly challenged Thomas Cook’s management on the use of exceptional costs.The auditors were also asked why the travel company carried more than £1bn of goodwill – the intangible asset of an acquired company which measures things like reputation, customer base and brand value – on its balance sheet for years, despite its problems, and why it was not written down gradually, rather than being slashed abruptly this year.Richard Wilson, an audit partner at EY, admitted that “with hindsight” the writedown should have come sooner. The £1.1bn writedown of its MyTravel package holiday division pushed Thomas Cook into a £1.5bn first-half loss in May.MPs questioned why Wilson had signed off the firm as a going concern in March, when it had amassed debts of £1.6bn. “Going concern” is an accounting concept that means a company can keep operating for the foreseeable future, usually the next 12 months. He said he did this on the assumption that it secured £300m from its lenders.However, six months later Thomas Cook collapsed into liquidation, with the loss of 9,000 UK jobs and leaving hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers stranded abroad.Diana Holland, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, told MPs in a separate session that there was little support for Thomas Cook workers who had lost their jobs, and that no emergency hardship fund had been set up.Martin McTague, policy chairman at the Federation for Small Businesses, said Thomas Cook had a “lousy payment record” and waited 78 to 90 days before paying suppliers. “They never were a good payer but they got successively worse.”"
ExxonMobil faces trial over allegations of misleading investors on climate crisis,New York lawsuit alleges company was ‘exposed to far greater risk from climate change than investors were led to believe’,Oliver Milman,2019-10-22T17:02:07+0100,"ExxonMobil is to face trial in New York City on Tuesday, accused of misleading investors over the business risks caused by regulations aimed at addressing the climate crisis.The oil and gas giant has been taken to court by New York’s attorney general for allegedly covering up the costs it will incur from government rules designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.This represents just the second time a climate case has gone to trial in the US.Exxon has long been a target for environmentalists, not only for being a major contributor to the climate crisis but also over revelations that it knew for decades that burning oil and gas would dangerously heat up the planet, only to obfuscate and even deny this to the public.A slew of lawsuits across the US have sought to hold major oil companies to account over the climate crisis. The New York case is different in nature as it essentially revolves around investor fraud. From 2010, Exxon told the public it had assigned a price to carbon to account for how government regulation would affect its business. However, it privately used a much lower figure, allowing it to make carbon-heavy investments such as in the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, that would appear much less profitable otherwise.The lawsuit, now led by the New York attorney general, Leticia James, alleges Exxon ran a “longstanding fraudulent scheme”.“Exxon in effect erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate change regulation and had factored those risks into its business operations,” the lawsuit states.“As a result of Exxon’s fraud, the company was exposed to far greater risk from climate change regulations than investors were led to believe.”Exxon has said the allegations are false and it expects to be exonerated in court.An Exxon spokesman said that it properly applies two different metrics – a “proxy cost”, intended to reflect the impact of all climate policies on global demand, and a greenhouse gas cost which relates to actual levies placed on fossil fuel projects in a certain jurisdiction.“The New York attorney general’s case is misleading and deliberately misrepresents a process we use to ensure company investments take into account the impact of current and potential climate-related regulations,” the spokesman said. “ExxonMobil applies proxy costs and GHG costs precisely as disclosed and takes both into account to help make sound business decisions and meet its fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders.”James declined the opportunity to comment further, although her office wrote to the court in August to complain that Exxon was trying to discourage potential witnesses by swamping them with demands for documents.“I do think this is an extremely important case in that it focuses on the climate risks posed to Exxon through its own accounting processes,” said Michael Burger, a climate law expert at Columbia University. “The lawsuit is seeking to ensure this company and others are on notice that climate change matters materially for business purposes, as it should.”Exxon is one of just 20 fossil fuel companies responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era, Guardian-commissioned data has found. The Texas-based company has contributed nearly 42bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since 1965."
Energy suppliers could face tougher financial checks,Ofgem considers barring fast-growing UK firms from taking on too many customers,Jillian Ambrose,2019-10-22T16:44:37+0100,"Energy suppliers could be blocked from taking on too many customers under proposals designed to ensure fast-growing companies are financially fit to handle expansion.Ofgem, the industry regulator, plans to run financial health checks on growing energy startups before they reach a certain number of customers after more than a dozen company failures in the sector in the past two years.If the suppliers fail the test they will be barred from taking on more customers and forced to prove they are financially fit before growing past the next threshold.Ofgem said it would put the checks in place before a supplier reaches 50,000 customers, and again at 150,000 and 250,000. The next threshold would be set between 500,000 and 800,000.The regulator may also demand that suppliers write a “living will” that sets out how they would continue to provide customers with a good service as well as an “orderly exit” if it cannot survive in the market.Mary Starks, an executive director at Ofgem, said the plans would create more accountability in the energy market and reduce the risk and cost of further collapses.The tougher standards for existing energy providers follow proposals to raise entry requirements for new suppliers to stem the rise of unsustainable firms.The regulator encouraged a large number of startups to enter the market to increase competition and drive better customer service. However, it exposed customers to a raft of unsustainable energy suppliers, many of which gave poor customer service before going bust.Fourteen suppliers have crashed out of the market since January 2018. In August, thousands of homes and hundreds of companies were left without an energy provider when Solarplicity collapsed.Matt Vickers, the chief executive of Ombudsman Services, said the crackdown was good news for consumers. He said he supported Ofgem’s plans because there had been spikes in complaints about fast-growing energy companies that were unprepared for rapid growth.Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the proposals would limit the cost to consumers of failed suppliers and provide better protection.“Our research estimates that recent supplier failures led to an additional £172m being added to bills. Most of these costs arose from companies leaving behind unpaid industry bills for renewable schemes,” she said.“The government should legislate to require suppliers make these payments more regularly, and further limit the costs to consumers when these companies fail.”"
Berlin state cabinet agrees five-year rent freeze,Proposal to counter rising housing costs still requires approval by state parliament,,2019-10-22T12:32:26+0100,"Berlin’s state cabinet has agreed on a rent freeze for five years to counter rising housing costs in the German capital.The city’s leftwing coalition government wants to freeze the rent for apartments built before 2014, according to a report by the German news agency dpa.Only a minority of Berliners own their homes or apartments and rent has been rising sharply in recent years, forcing many to move outside the city.The city had been a low-rent mecca for many years, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened the gates to the economically depressed former communist east of the city. This gave rise to an influx of artists and others seeking a more bohemian way of life.The proposal to freeze rents needs approval by the state parliament."
Ban on UK flights to Sharm el-Sheikh lifted after four years,Flights to Egyptian resort were stopped after Russian airliner was brought down by bomb,Gwyn Topham,2019-10-22T12:21:18+0100,"British holidaymakers could be soon returning to Sharm el-Sheikh after the UK government lifted restrictions on flights to the Egyptian resort.Commercial flights to the airport were banned in November 2015, soon after a Russian Metrojet airliner that had departed from Sharm el-Sheikh was brought down.International investigators concluded a bomb was smuggled onboard, putting the airport’s security procedures under suspicion.The government said improved security procedures, and close cooperation between the UK and Egypt on aviation security, meant commercial airlines could now be allowed to operate flights.Sharm el-Sheikh had previously been one of the most popular holiday destinations with Britons, in particular for the chance of winter sun at the biggest Red Sea resort.Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: “We look forward to services to Sharm el-Sheikh resuming and lifting the restriction is the first step in that process.“The safety and security of British nationals remains our top priority and this decision follows close cooperation between our aviation security experts and their Egyptian counterparts, and improvements in security procedures at the airport.“We will now work closely with airlines who wish to resume flights to and from the airport.”The holiday firm TUI is among those expected to start resuming flights as soon as practicable, although the first services are likely to be in summer 2020, at the earliest.The travel association Abta welcomed the move. A spokesperson said: “Sharm el-Sheikh has been a very popular destination for UK holidaymakers in the past, before the restrictions were in place. The news is also positive for the local economy in this region of Egypt that is reliant on the benefits travel and tourism bring.”The destruction of Metrojet flight 9628 on 31 October 2015 killed 224 people, mainly Russian holidaymakers. Tens of thousands of Russian, German and British tourists were still in the resort and were brought home on specially approved flights carrying only hand luggage during the subsequent security operation.Germany lifted its flight ban the following year but Britain has only permitted flights to other Egyptian airports until now."
Pro-deal MPs try to force Johnson to seek EU customs union,At least five MPs put names to amendment that could result in PM pulling EU bill,Rowena Mason,2019-10-22T13:23:38+0100,"Boris Johnson could see his Brexit legislation amended to require him to negotiate a customs union with the EU, after at least five pro-deal MPs said they would support this option.The MPs – two former Conservatives, Nick Boles and Ken Clarke, plus at least three pro-deal Labour MPs, Melanie Onn, Gareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth – have put their names to a measure giving the government a mandate to negotiate a customs union.The amendment to the Brexit bill would not change the UK’s proposed treaty with the EU, so Johnson has the option of accepting the amendment and then going into an election arguing to overturn it.However, two Tory insiders told the Guardian it would be extremely difficult for Johnson and his Eurosceptic hardliners to accept any mandate for a customs union and it would be more likely for him to pull the bill and seek a general election.Johnson’s chances of passing the EU withdrawal agreement bill through the House of Commons are on a knife-edge.If at least five pro-deal MPs vote for it, then the chances of a customs union amendment passing later this week look fairly high. However, it could hinge on the actions of a handful of independents and the Democratic Unionist party, as well as the Liberal Democrats and SNP who have historically voted for remain and second referendum options rather than soft Brexit ones.Labour has said it will back an amendment in favour of a customs union and accepts that one proposed by backbenchers has the best chance of cross-party success.No 10 said Johnson would not accept a customs union. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, told the BBC now was not the time to discuss Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU and matters such as the customs union.“This is a piece of legislation which simply puts into effect in UK law what the prime minister has managed to negotiate. The critical thing is the future relationship will be subject to a negotiating mandate that will be debated and voted on in the House of Commons,” he said.“Those MPs who have concerns about issues such as that [the burden on businesses sending goods to Northern Ireland] or the customs union ... they will have the ability to discuss and vote on that later on, once we have left the European Union.’Jenrick added: “Those MPs who want to deliver Brexit will be voting with the government today.”"
The Just Eat takeover battle is promising a delicious showdown,With two big rival offers on the plate the food delivery giant can afford to sit back and await another helping,Nils Pratley,2019-10-22T19:31:04+0100,"It’s still feels slightly odd that Just Eat, which only recently seemed to be a smartphone app plus a few blokes on mopeds, is a FTSE 100 company. But it’s time to acknowledge modern munching habits. Just Eat is now the target of two takeover bids, the latest being £4.9bn in hard cash. That definitely makes it a grown-up business.The gatecrashing bidder is Prosus, the Amsterdam-listed offshoot of South African giant Naspers, and it must start as a favourite to prevail. A cash bid normally beats an all-share offer, which is all that is being pitched by Takeaway.com, also out of the Netherlands. As the saying doesn’t quite go, a pizza in the hand is worth two in the oven.Yet one suspects this scrap has a long way to run. For now, Just Eat’s board is sticking with the Takeaway offer, even though it’s worth only 594p a share versus 710p from Prosus. Its official line is that Just Eat is “a strategic asset” and shareholders should contemplate the long-term winnings that could accrue from a combination with Takeaway.That argument isn’t entirely optimistic. For investors who truly believe half the western world will soon be eating its dinner out of disposable boxes, it would make sense to hang around for the ride. Under the Takeaway terms, Just Eat investors would own 52% of a combined entity that would still be listed in London; and Jitse Groen, Takeaway’s founder and reputed whizz of the sector, would be in charge. It’s a plausible future.Yet Just Eat’s loyalty to its first suitor is surely open to revision at any moment. The current stance looks more like an invitation to both bidders to raise their offers. It’s unclear if Takeaway could go to, say, an ownership split of 60:40, but it will now have to think about it.As for Prosus, it can definitely go higher. It is a €108bn investment beast with eyes on global domination in food delivery. It already knows Just Eat via a partnership in Latin America and, if it really intends to throw capital at the sector to squash the growing threats from Deliveroo and Uber Eats, this is its moment.Sit back and await an entertaining showdown. We haven’t see the real bids yet. More than likely, someone will end up overpaying.Adam Neumann must be a genius after all. He’s getting $1.7bn (£1.3bn) to stay away from the financial chaos he created at WeWork, which is one hell of a going-away present. The arrangement even includes a $185m “consultancy” fee, which is presumably window dressing for agreeing to surrender the super-charged voting rights that were a governance outrage in the first place.Naturally $1.7bn, which may net down to closer to $1bn by the time Neumann has cleared his debts across Wall Street, is a small fraction of what the co-founder’s stake would have been worth had WeWork managed to get itself listed in New York. Plan A imagined the shared office company being valued at $47bn-plus. Under the terms of bailout from SoftBank, that figure has shrunk to $8bn.Still, from Neumann’s point of view, he’s emerged as a billionaire from a business that lost $1.6bn last year, has an unproven business model and was rapidly running out of cash. It’s not a bad return for him.He has Masayoshi Son, founder of SoftBank, to thank. One can only assume the Japanese outfit is bailing out WeWork because it would be even more embarrassing not to. Softbank had already invested $10bn, so had to be seen to try to recover its mistake.It is possible, of course, that WeWork, after some brutal cost-cutting and a re-modelling of the business plan, could emerge eventually as a conventional property group, minus Neumann’s nonsense about “elevating the world’s consciousness”. On day one, though, SoftBank’s willingness to carry on looks more like an exercise in postponing pain.Son and SoftBank still, apparently, hope to raise $100bn for another “Vision” investment fund to make big bets on businesses of tomorrow. Really? After this? There’s no accounting for the risk appetites of some sovereign wealth funds but the WeWork debacle ought to be enough to kill thoughts of Vision 2.Wall Street investors spotted WeWork’s overblown claims and terrible governance as soon as it read the IPO prospectus. SoftBank had the inside track for years and still threw cash at the company. That’s more than a mere blemish on the investment record."
Astros lose World Series opener to Nats after sordid week off the field,"As one of the finest pitchers in Major League Baseball lost for the first time since 22 May, the fallout lingered from a distasteful off-field episode",Tom Dart,2019-10-23T05:19:41+0100,"You can play indoors and still be under a cloud.On the field, the Washington Nationals conjured a surprise victory in the first game of the World Series as the aura of invincibility around the Houston Astros’ Gerrit Cole was punctured by the power of Juan Soto, the 20-year-old slugger. But as one of the finest pitchers in Major League Baseball lost for the first time since 22 May, the fallout lingered from a distasteful off-field episode.Sports Illustrated’s Stephanie Apstein reported that after the American League Championship Series-clinching win over the New York Yankees last Saturday that sent the Astros to the World Series, “assistant general manager Brandon Taubman turned to a group of three female reporters, including one wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and yelled, half a dozen times, ‘Thank God we got Osuna! I’m so fucking glad we got Osuna!’ The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized.”While a member of the Toronto Blue Jays last year, Roberto Osuna, the Houston closer, allegedly assaulted the mother of his child. Charges were dropped after the woman decided not to testify, but MLB suspended Osuna for 75 games. The Astros, Apstein wrote, saw the opportunity to acquire an asset on the cheap, and in trading for the pitcher without giving up much of value, “used assault as a market inefficiency”.The Astros’ initial rebuttal was preposterous, especially since Osuna had pitched poorly and blown a two-run lead: “[Taubman’s] comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else”. It also accused Sports Illustrated of “fabricating” the story.This was spin in the old-fashioned them-against-us genre, a closing of ranks in the clubhouse - but also a very modern and familiar attempt at media manipulation. Gaslighting instead of apologising; when accused of misconduct, especially by a woman, deny, smear and yell fake news, because truth is fungible now and victory belongs to the brazen.After the account in the article was corroborated by multiple reporters, Taubman issued a statement conceding that he “used inappropriate language for which I am deeply sorry and embarrassed”, but insisting that his “overexuberance” was “misinterpreted”. Astros owner Jim Crane said the team takes domestic violence seriously, while the league equivocally said it would “interview those involved before commenting further”. There was no apology for the original statement, while Taubman concluded with, “I am sorry if anyone was offended by my actions.” If?For all the brilliance and appeal of star players such as Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa, Alex Bregman, and the genial manager, AJ Hinch, the incident has made some wonder if the Astros are auditioning for the role of baseball’s Evil Empire now that the Yankees have endured a decade without reaching the World Series.The episode has left Houston open to accusations that they care little about domestic violence or the truth; that this club, painstakingly built for success using cutting-edge data analytics and bold big-money trades, has a culture that marries toxic locker-room banter with boorish arrogance redolent of Silicon Valley’s tech bro excesses.Tuesday’s game, at least, was great fun. Minute Maid Park is among the best of baseball’s boxes; drawbacks include those carbuncles at the corners, the Chick-fil-A “fowl poles”, and decisions to keep the roof closed even on days such as Tuesday, when the weather is perfect. But that rarely-retracted roof helps keep the deafening crowd noise pinging around the ballpark. So the sound of silence in the rocking orange madhouse was especially striking when Ryan Zimmerman, the first baseman who has been with the Nationals since they emigrated from Montreal in 2005, launched a 413ft home run off Cole in the second inning.Though the Nationals had a week of rest after their 4-0 National League Championship Series stroll past the St Louis Cardinals, the Astros – winners of the World Series for the first time in 2017 – entered the series as heavy favourites, with Cole’s imperiousness a big factor. He had allowed a solitary run in his past three postseason starts, all wins.Yet on the biggest stage, he stumbled. Though the Astros raced into a 2-0 lead courtesy of Yuli Gurriel’s two-run double off Max Scherzer in the first inning, their lead was erased by the fourth through Zimmerman and then an even bigger solo blast from Soto, up to the train tracks above left field.After overcoming adversity against the Milwaukee Brewers and Los Angeles Dodgers in previous rounds to give the capital city its first Fall Classic since 1933, there is a zany quality to these Nationals, a subversive streak that complements their obvious talent. When Adam Eaton drove in a run in the fifth and Soto added a deep two-run double, Washington held a 5-2 lead, reduced in the seventh through a solo Springer home run. Springer, a postseason home run machine, drove in another run in the eighth with a double that almost cleared the right field fence as the Nationals’ bullpen wobbled, but did just enough for a 5-4 win.Houston host Washington again on Wednesday in the best-of-seven series as the Astros try to – as their slogan goes – Take It Back. All things considered, it’s a sentiment that should apply to more than their quest for the World Series trophy."

Roast at 200C/gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft and their skins lightly browned in places.Finely chop 2 tbsp of tarragon leaves and the same of basil. Mash 150g of goat’s cheese with a fork and then stir in 100g of crème fraîche. Add the chopped herbs and a little pepper then chill until needed.When the tomatoes are ready, remove them from the oven and transfer to a serving plate. Toss 100g of samphire into the tomato roasting juices in the tin then add next to the tomatoes on the serving plate. Spoon the herbed cheese into a small bowl then serve with pieces of crusty white baguette to soak up the juices. Enough for 2.To get the full sweet, sharp and smoky flavour of the tomatoes, roast them until their skins start to blacken here and there. Serve them hot, straight from the oven to contrast with the chilled whipped cheese.The tomatoes can be replaced by aubergines. Cut them into large cubes, then add to the roasting tin with the thyme and olive oil and bake for a good half hour or so, turning them as they burnish and soften.

Bitter-sweet memories: Rachel Roddy's recipe for marmalade cake,Hand-me-down recipes come inseparably steeped in memories – such as this recipe for marmalade cake from an old friend that became etched into the family biography,Rachel Roddy,2019-10-21T12:00:28+0100,"The other day I opened a book to find a sentence, and a bit of paper fell out. As the square piece of block pad glided to the floor like a dead moth, I recognised it as a recipe for a ring cake written out for me not long after coming to Italy, about 14 years ago. I remember making the recipe several times, before using it as a bookmark that was left at page 76. What I don’t remember or recognise is whose neat writing it is.My memory lapse is frustrating. Sharing a recipe is an open-handed act, one made even more tangible if the person sharing has taken the time physically to write it out, maybe with notes, which is a small labour in these copy-and-photograph times.Even if the recipe given is never made, I want to remember where the Post-It lemon pudding or back-of-envelope braised chicken came from. And if the recipe becomes part of my cooking life, it is no different from a recipe from a book or famous chef: it absolutely must have that person attached to it, like a name tag sewn into a collar. Then, every time the recipe is made, the person and your relationship to them, whatever it was, is remembered. Even if it means you have to relive a tired exchange about authenticity, or be reminded that Mario subsequently left his wife for his secretary, recipes have names: Mario’s red-wine risotto; my elegant neighbour Vera’s creme caramel; Lise from Bavaria’s liver and apple.Shared name-tagged recipes are also a way of marking time. Years ago, I organised my mum’s loose recipes, gluing the loose-leaf pages and lips of envelopes into a book and noting where and who they came from. The book is now a sort of collective biography of our family – a strained one.Freda Coleman was a neighbour in the late 1970s, and her marmalade cake marks the margarine years. It was, and is, an ideal cake for a family with congenital marmalade dependency: a rich pound batter into which you stir orange marmalade, which bakes into a bitter-sweet cake. The icing is as good as the cake, which you zig- zag over the top where it then sets into a hard lattice that can be pulled off, although hopefully not from the entire cake as once happened.Part of the pleasure of a cake is the smell as it bakes: marmalade bakes into an almost toffee-like sweetness, and hopefully a bit of peel at the bottom of the cake catches and the smell of that, like dark treacle, assaults your senses.Recipes are only recipes, but they can become fixed points in our lives around which other things move: with them, we can measure time, places, people. Freda’s cake – now our family cake – is one such recipe. If I could only remember the name of the person who gave me the recipe that fell out of the book, that would have a name tag too. Until then, it is just a ring cake. Both cakes are good, but the marmalade triumphs for its amber chunks of peel and icing which, because cake is 50% pleasure, 50% habit, I still want to pull off before eating a slice.This is a cake of four equal parts, plus marmalade (thick-cut or thin, you decide). It is a preference based on habit, but a loaf tin (lined with parchment) seems the best tin for this cake.Prep 10 minCook 40 minMakes 1 loaf110g margarine or butter, at room temp110g sugar2 medium eggs110g self-raising flour4 heaped tbsp marmalade50g icing sugarHot waterBeat together the butter and sugar until soft and creamy. Beat in the eggs, followed by the flour, before stirring in three tablespoons of marmalade.Scape the mixture into a loaf tin lined with parchment. Bake at 170C (150C)/335F/gas 3 for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is puffed up and cracked, and a strand of spaghetti comes out clean.Leave to cool for 30 minutes, then lift the cake from the tin.To make the glaze, loosen the remaining tablespoon of marmalade with a little hot water, then brush the cake.Make a thick icing by mixing the icing sugar with just a little water, and zig-zag it over the cake, letting it dribble down the sides."
A South African shepherd's pie: Thomasina Miers' family recipe for bobotie,"An intriguing recipe handed down by Tommi’s mischievous nanna Mimi – a sort of South African, spicy version of shepherd’s pie called bobotie ",Thomasina Miers,2019-10-21T12:00:25+0100,"My maternal grandmother was known for being a tiddlywinks demon, having the naughtiest twinkle in her eye and, whenever she went home to South Africa, for disappearing into the bush to hang out with Zulu tribespeople – the people with whom she seemed to feel most at home. Her stories of her time there were always captivating, and of the recipes she made that were both homely and exotic, this was one of the best.Don’t be put off by the long list of ingredients – this is essentially a South African shepherd’s pie, only easier, with some lovely spicing thrown in.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 6-8Butter, for greasing4 tbsp olive oil3 onions, peeled and choppedSalt and black pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped2 bay leaves1½ tsp mustard seeds2 tsp curry powder½ tsp chilli flakes1 tsp turmeric1 ½ tsp garam masala1kg beef or lamb mince100ml red-wine or cider vinegar100g flaked almonds120g raisins50g fresh breadcrumbs75g fruit chutney (I like Tracklements’ Country Garden Chutney)For the topping3 eggs500ml whole milk3 bay leavesGrease a large baking dish and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. Warm a large, wide casserole pot over a medium heat and, when hot, add three tablespoons of oil.Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and sweat for 10 minutes, until soft. Stir in the garlic, bay leaves and spices and cook for another three to four minutes, until fragrant. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. When hot, season the meat with salt and pepper, and brown in the pan in two or three batches, breaking up the meat with a spoon and cooking until caramelised and dark. Once all the meat is browned, return the onion mixture to the pan and add the vinegar, almonds and raisins.Turn the heat down to low and simmer for five minutes, to allow the flavours to mingle. Take off the heat, stir in the breadcrumbs and chutney and check the seasoning. Transfer to the baking dish, smooth over with the back of a spoon and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes.To make the topping, beat together the eggs and milk and pour over the meat. Scatter over the bay leaves, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden and the custard just set. This is delicious served with brown rice and some greens.Leftover flaked almonds make the best biscuits. I love florentines, or you could mix them with honey and a little butter for a crunchy topping for shortbread. Leftover bobotie makes a killer filling for a jacket potato, so don’t eat it all at once."
Nigel Slater’s autumn recipes to take time over,"Spiced rice and pumpkin, comforting beef rib and potato, raspberry mille-feuille: layered recipes, contrasting autumn flavours",,2019-10-21T08:00:41+0100,"I am on the brink of lighting the first fire of the year. In fact, by the time you read this, I shall probably have done so. And with the cooler weather comes a different type of eating. Slower and (slightly) more complex, the sort of cooking that keep us a little longer in the kitchen but also at the table. Food to linger over.Lasagne aside, the most famous of layered recipes is probably biryani, where meat and rice is pressed down in a pot with onions and spices and often enclosed in a pastry crust. To say it’s a lot of work is an understatement. It is one those dishes I tend to leave to restaurant cooks.A somewhat simpler version can be made without meat, and without the pastry crust. I did a version this week, layering saffron rice with mashed pumpkin and spiced onions that took a good hour, but without the inevitable fuss of the classic.Serves 4onions 2 mediumgroundnut oil 4 tbspginger 60gchilli flakes 1 tsppumpkin 1.5kgwhite basmati rice 300gsaffron 2 pinchesgreen cardamom pods 12peppercorns 8bay leaves 4cinnamon 1 stickbeetroot 200gPeel and roughly chop the onions. Warm 3 tablespoons of the oil in a deep pan then add the onions and cook over a low to moderate heat. Grate the ginger and stir into the onions with the chilli flakes, and let them continue cooking until the onions are soft and golden brown – a good 25 minutes.Peel the pumpkin, cut into large pieces, then steam for 15 minutes till soft. Drain and mash with a vegetable masher or fork. Stir in black pepper and a little salt.Wash the rice in warm water: put the rice in a large bowl with plenty of warm water, stir the rice around in the water with your hand, pour off the cloudy water, then repeat twice until the water is almost clear. Drain the rice, put in a medium-sized saucepan with enough water to cover by 3cm. Add the saffron and whole cardamom pods, peppercorns, bay leaves and cinnamon stick, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the water simmers, then cover tightly with a lid. Leave to cook for 10 minutes.Remove the rice from the heat and leave to rest without removing the lid. Coarsely grate the beetroot and set aside. Lift the lid from the rice and stir briefly with a fork to separate the grains.Now assemble the dish. Pour the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the dish then add one third of the rice followed by a third of the pumpkin. Scatter a third of the onions over the pumpkin then half of the beetroot. Now continue layering until all the rice, pumpkin, onion and beetroot is finished.Bake for an hour at 200C/gas mark 6.Crab and avocado is a comfortable marriage, needing only something crisp to press all my bells at once. (I often serve carta di musica with mashed avocado and white crab meat.) I sometimes dice cucumber finely and fold it into the avocado cream too. A layer of crunch amid the smooth green cream and flakes of seafood.You can make a modern version of the seafood cocktail by layering mashed avocado, cucumber and crab meat – I use both the brick-red brown meat and the snowy needles of sweet white flesh. It can look beautiful in a wine glass, especially when the layers are put together loosely rather than tightly packed. A squeeze of lime wouldn’t go amiss and I like to put in some coriander too, a herb very much at home with both crab and avocado.Serves 4avocados 3 ripelime juice 4 tbsp red chilli 1 large cucumber ½white crab meat 250gbrown crab meat 250gcoriander leaves 3 tbsp, choppedPeel and stone the avocados, then put the flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Squeeze in the lime juice. Halve, seed and finely chop the chilli then add to the avocado and process it all to a smooth, pale green paste.Peel the cucumber, core with a teaspoon and discard the seeds, then cut first into thick strips then into small cubes and fold into the avocado cream.Check the white and brown crab meat for any remaining shell, then fork the chopped coriander through the white meat.Loosely layer the avocado and white and brown crab meats in four glasses or small dishes, chill for half an hour and serve.The first time I met the mixture of filo, spinach and feta was aboard a ferry bound for the Greek islands circa 1980 and I have loved it ever since. For all its cellophane wrapper and dubious age, I wolfed my flaky pastry parcel gratefully and have used the combination in tarts, salads and little pies ever since. (Try brushing a sheet of filo with melted butter then sprinkling it with sea salt and dried thyme. Bake till crisp, then shatter the cooked pastry and scatter over a salad of spinach leaves and feta.)This time, a roll-up of chilli-flecked spinach and melted cheese baked inside the filo. The rolled layers of vegetables, cheese and pastry formed a simple lunch with a salad of tomato, black olive and basil.Serves 6spinach 600gdill 30gfeta 400gmozzarella 375gdried chilli flakes 2-3 tspbutter 105gfilo pastry 6 sheets (about 250g)nigella seeds 2 tsppoppy seeds 2 tspsesame seeds 2 tspSet the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Wash the spinach, then, with the leaves still wet, place it in a large saucepan over a moderate heat. Cover tightly with a lid and let the leaves cook in their own steam for a minute or two till wilted. Tip them into a colander and squeeze out any moisture.Roughly chop the spinach and the dill and mix them together. Coarsely grate the feta and mozzarella into the spinach and dill, then season with black pepper and the chilli flakes. Melt the butter in a small pan.Place a sheet of filo on a work surface or chopping board. Brush generously with some of the melted butter. Place a second sheet on top, butter it, then repeat with a third sheet. With the longest edge towards you, shape half of the filling in a long sausage, along the nearest edge.Roll the pastry away from you, covering the filling and forming a long cylinder. Transfer to a baking tin.Now repeat with the remaining three sheets of pastry and the remaining filling. Place the second roll close to the first. Brush with the last of the butter then sprinkle with the nigella, poppy and sesame seeds.Bake for about 20 minutes till the pastry is pale gold, then serve immediately.It was the first properly cold morning of autumn when we set about making this deeply comforting dish. Layers of potato and cheap, bone-in meat for a night when the chestnut leaves are piling up in the lane outside the house. The hands-on cooking time here is minimal, involving little more than the slicing of onions and Maris Pipers, but the unattended cooking time, when the recipe gets on with things itself, is a good two hours. The dish is all the better for that, the flavours deepen and the separate elements – the meat, stock and potatoes – become, deliciously, as one.During the layering of meat and potatoes I like to tuck in the stripped rib bones, and in so doing extracting every last bit of goodness and savour from them. On the side, a crisp white cabbage salad, perhaps (olive oil, white wine vinegar, dill), and some bread with which to sponge up the herb-stippled juices.Serves 6 beef short ribs 1.4kgolive oil 4 tbsponions 3 mediumthyme 8 sprigsrosemary 4 bushy sprigsbay leaves 4black peppercorns 8beef stock 2 litreslarge potatoes 1kgCut the beef into ribs. Warm the oil in a large, deep-sided pan, then brown the ribs all over, taking care as they may spit and pop. Turn the ribs over with kitchen tongs as they colour, removing them to a plate when their fat is golden.Peel and thinly slice the onions then put them into the pan in which you have just browned the beef, adding the thyme, rosemary, bay and peppercorns, and lower the heat to moderate. Let the onions cook, giving them the occasional stir, for about 20 minutes, until they are soft and light gold.Return the beef ribs to the pan, together with any juices from the plate, then pour over the beef stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the liquid quietly putters, partially cover with a lid, and leave for 1 hour or until the meat can easily be cut from the bones.Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Remove the ribs from the pan and pull the meat from the bones. Slice the potatoes thinly, using a mandoline if you have one, a large cook’s knife if not. In a large, shallow baking dish or roasting tin, layer the potatoes and the meat and onions, seasoning each layer as you go with salt and black pepper, then pour over the stock from the pan.Bake for an hour to 90 minutes, until the potatoes are soft and giving.As much as I like the idea of the classic layered mille-feuille I feel it only works when the pastry is very dark, thin and crisp and the filling involves a few sharp fruits to contrast the soft, billowing blandness of the cream. Raspberries, blackberries and blackcurrants then, rather than peaches and strawberries. You can go further with the contrasting textures by adding crushed brittle or almond or pistachio praline to the whipped cream. The cream is best when beaten until only just thick enough to spread.Serves 8caster sugar 125gshelled pistachios 125gpuff pastry 320gdouble cream 500mlraspberries 250gTo decorateicing sugar 3 tbspraspberries 125gYou will need a small, lightly oiled baking sheet and two large baking sheets, one of which is lined with baking parchment.Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 8. Put the sugar in a non-stick shallow pan over a low to moderate heat. Watch very carefully as it melts, then, when it is golden, add the shelled pistachios. As the sugar darkens to a deep bronze, tip the mixture out onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and leave to cool.Roll out the pastry to a rectangle measuring 28cm x 33cm. Transfer to the baking sheet lined with baking parchment. Place a second sheet of parchment on top, then cover with the second large baking sheet. Place a heavy roasting tin on top then bake for 15-20 minutes.Remove the roasting tin, baking sheet and top layer of parchment, then continue to bake for a further five minutes or until the pastry is deep golden brown and very crisp.Break the pistachio brittle into large pieces and reduce to coarse crystals using a food processor. If you prefer, pound the brittle to crumbs with a pestle and mortar.Whip the cream until thick. Crush the raspberries with a fork and fold them into the cream together with three quarters of the crushed nut brittle. Cut the pastry in half lengthways and trim the edges, crushing the trimmings to crumbs with a knife.Place one of the two sheets of pastry on a serving dish or board. Spoon the cream, fruit and nut filling on top, smooth the surface flat pushing the cream right to the edge of the pastry, then cover with the second piece of pastry. Press down lightly on the cake with your hands or a baking sheet to settle the layers of cream and pastry.Smooth the edges flat with a palette knife, then cover the sides with the reserved pastry crumbs, pushing them in with the knife.To decorate, mix the reserved brittle with the icing sugar, then scatter over the top of the cake. Place the remaining raspberries along the top and serve.@NigelSlater"
Nigel Slater’s crab and harissa croquettes and white chocolate and lemon buns recipes,"Delicious bite-sized morsels, savoury and sweet",Nigel Slater,2019-10-20T10:30:53+0100,"I go on about the pleasures of sharing, but there is something appealing about having a little something to yourself. A golden croquette, hot from the pan, to wolf in one go. Or perhaps a dainty bun of choux pastry filled with cream, its surface tacky with chocolate fondant…I splashed out on some dressed crab this week, padded out the snow-white needles of flesh with a few breadcrumbs, rolled them into balls and deep fried the lot. Toothsome, an old fashioned and totally appropriate word for a crisp morsel of crab with the faintest hint of brick-red harissa, but you couldn’t really think of them as a meal. We passed a batch of them round in a basket while drinking beers and eating thin slices of deep maroon, fat-marbled ham. No forks were necessary, although a napkin or two wouldn’t have gone amiss. Should you feel they would make supper, roll each one into the size of a plump scallop and serve with a tangle of green beans, lightly steamed then tossed in a shallow pan of finely chopped bacon and its glorious fat.In my house, puddings and pastries are on the menu. Crumbs of comfort in a world gone madI should mention that I put mayonnaise in my crab croquettes and I do know it sounds a little odd, but I have been doing so for more than 20 years. The addition does more than bind the crab and crumbs – it is partly responsible for the soft, silk-like texture of the filling.Perhaps to take our minds away from other events, I made a tray of sweet choux pastries, too, filled not only with cream but with nuggets of chopped chocolate. In my house, puddings and pastries are back on the menu with a vengeance. Crumbs of comfort in a world gone mad.If I have time, I will often prepare a crab myself, cracking the shell and tugging out the flesh with a skewer. It’s a deliciously messy job for a Saturday morning. That said, for fritters and these golden-shelled croquettes, it is worth considering the ready-picked fresh crab sold in tubs. I suggest the crisp panko crumbs, available in supermarkets and Japanese shops, for their ease and lightness. You can use fresh breadcrumbs, dried in the oven until crisp, if you prefer.Serves 4white crab meat 450gpanko crumbs 125gspring onions 3parsley leaves 7g (a handful)coriander leaves 7g (a handful)eggs 2grain mustard 1 tbspharissa 2 tspmayonnaise 120gYou will also need oil for deep fryingPut the crab and breadcrumbs into a large mixing bowl. Finely slice the spring onions, then chop the parsley and coriander leaves. Add all three to the crab and mix gently.In a second bowl, break the eggs and beat lightly to mix yolks and whites, then blend in the mustard, harissa and mayonnaise. Stir into the crab gently combining crab, crumbs and seasoning.Shape the crab mixture into 20 balls, each weighing approximately 45g, rolling them lightly in your hands, floured if necessary. Let the balls settle for 20 minutes in the fridge.Pour enough oil into a pan in which to deep fry the croquettes and heat to 180C on a kitchen thermometer. Place one of the croquettes on a draining spoon and lower into the oil – it should crackle immediately – followed by 5 or more of the others, taking care not to crowd the pan. Keep an eye on the heat – you need it to remain fairly static. Fry the croquettes for 2-3 minutes until golden, lift out and drain on kitchen paper then repeat with further batches until the mixture is finished. Serve hot, with halves of lemon or lime.A bun filled with cream and nibs of chocolate, finished with a gossamer-thin coating of lemon icing. A frivolous thing, a treat for a Sunday afternoon.

Transfer the paste to the bowl of a food mixer and add the beaten eggs, a little at a time, beating at a fast pace with a flat paddle attachment. When you have a thick, creamy, sticky dough, place 8 generously heaped tbsp of the mixture on the prepared baking sheet.Bake the buns for approximately 25 minutes, until well risen and crisp, then remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Finely chop the chocolate and set aside. Using a chilled bowl, whip the cream, until thick enough to spoon into the buns. Very gently fold in the chocolate and the lemon curd. Pierce a hole in each bun using a chop stick or small knife then push in the cream with a teaspoon. If you have a piping bag, use that. Set the buns back on the wire rack. Sift the icing sugar into a bowl, stir in the lemon juice then spoon over the buns and leave to set.The Observer publishes recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide"
Yin and yang: what's the difference between a shallot and an onion?,"Though recipes frequently use them interchangeably, shallots are a different beast from onions – and you can even use them in desserts",,2019-10-19T20:00:40+0100,"Let’s be clear: a shallot is not an onion. You could be forgiven for thinking they are the same, and substituting them for onions in a recipe. Very few recipe writers will specify shallots for this reason, myself included sometimes. It’s so much more convenient just to say “onion”.Editors will say to me: “No one will know the difference, so why fuss?” But you should fuss, because shallots have a completely different flavour profile. Shallots are yin to the onion’s yang.I grew up thinking shallots and onions were the same, too. In Thai, shallots were referred to as hohm. I should have realised something was up, as the literal translation is “fragrant”.No one in their right mind would sniff a raw onion and call it fragrant. If you sniff a shallot, however, I could understand that. It’s still going to make your eyes water, but it is not as pungent. Shallots are more delicate and aromatically perfumed, much sweeter to eat raw.Randy Moon, one of the “Four Horsemen” behind my favourite wine bar in NYC (with a killer menu, too) says onions are a crucial base note to dishes that require a long cooking time. Some of the world’s greatest dishes have onions as a starting point. Meanwhile, shallots are the top note.“Everything in its place and a place for everything,” is what mise en place means, and that’s the motto for all self-respecting cooks and chefs. There’s a place for shallots, and a place for onions.Use shallots raw in a salad and they will sing harmoniously with your other veg; use onions when making a stew. Shallots when you require finesse, onions when you need weight.Shallots are in the allium family (Allium cepa, if we’re being pedantic) and look very much like onions. But, surprisingly, they’re more closely related to garlic than onions. Shallots grow like garlic, with clusters of offsets genetically identical to their mother bulb, whereas onions are a loner bulb, and easier to grow from seed.Shallots come in a few different forms. Most common in Australia are the French red eschallot. Long and tapered, they’re daintily pretty. Cuter still are the petite Asian shallots. They are clumpier and fiddlier to peel, but the extra sweat is worth it. Their colour varies from yellow to pinky grey to an eye-catching deep crimson.In the last decade, they’ve become easier to find in Australia. The first time I came across them, my eyes bulged. It was at a Vietnamese-owned farm in Darwin, where massive piles were being cured. I bought as many as I could fit in my suitcase to take back to my kitchen in Sydney, where I gleefully used them in place of everything calling for an onion in Asian recipes.Onions aren’t common in south and south-east Asian culinary traditions. When chefs and cooks come to Australia, where onions are plentiful, they sigh in relief. Peeling a box of onions is a walk in the park compared with peeling a box of itty bitty shallots. That’s why in restaurants, Asian ones included, you will nary see a shallot, even if it is traditionally called for. But don’t be put off from using them at home. The rewards are many.Upon cooking, shallots excrete a lot less moisture than onions, which makes them a better choice to fry until crisp. You can buy them ready-fried in Asian grocers, but why not make it a Sunday afternoon meditative experience? The benefits of that session will be a hundredfold.Store-bought fried shallots are often rancid, and fried using dubious sources of palm oil. Making it yourself, you can use a much better quality oil. My current obsession is macadamia oil, which has a fantastically high heating point and great health benefits too. Macadamia oil is rich in oleic acid and monounsaturated fatty acids, and it’s high in omegas three and six. When combined with the high levels of polyphenols and flavonoids (anti-oxidants) from the shallot, it’s practically a superfood flavour bomb.Fried shallots are incredibly versatile. You can use them as a garnishing flourish on anything you like to finish a dish. Pasta, noodles, rice, soups, vegetables, meat … even dessert. Seriously.That’s what Thais do. It’s not weird … not at all.I used fried shallot recently in the dessert course of a dinner I cooked in New York, a royal cuisine dish called som chun: iced fresh fruit, perfumed with a floral aromatic syrup, bergamot, fresh ginger, sliced macadamias and finished with crisp fried shallots.Try it this summer. It teeters on the balance between fresh sweetness from seasonal fruit and savoury flavour from the shallots.Just don’t try it with onions. It wouldn’t be the same.Fried Shallots6 shallots500ml macadamia oilGrey salt to seasonGet into the zone, with nowhere to be but peeling and finely slicing the shallots. You don’t need to halve them before you slice, as once they fry up they will shrink.On the highest element, heat the oil in wok or frying pan for about five minutes. Gently nudge the shallots into the oil and watch it bubble away. Turn down the heat to low-medium. Resist the urge to push it around for approximately five minutes.Then get at it using a wooden paddle or spatula and stir the shallots around the pan constantly. Stand by the stove, focus on your breathing and inhale the smell of allium delight. If you don’t want your entire house to smell like shallots, I highly advise you to turn on the hood to the highest extraction and open your windows.Once the shallots start to turn a golden brown, take them off the heat and drain into a steel mesh colander, lined with a few paper towels. Have a stainless steel bowl underneath the colander to catch all the oil. Cool the shallots down, then toss a teaspoon of salt into them. Stored in an airtight container, you can keep them refrigerated for up to six months.Keep the oil separately in another jar and use it for salad dressings or as a finishing oil for absolutely anything and everything. These will become your favourite pantry staples. They are for me."
From coconut curry to hoppel poppel: Yotam Ottolenghi’s family recipes,"A diverse heritage has led to Yotam’s eclectic toolkit of international hand-me-down recipes, from Germany via the American Midwest to Malaysia",Yotam Ottolenghi,2019-10-19T09:30:22+0100,"The food legacy handed down to me by my parents is probably best embodied by hoppel poppel, a leftovers dish featuring potato, onion, sausage and egg, all mixed together into a glorious hodgepodge. It’s a kind-of bubble and squeak, and comes from my mother’s German heritage but, with pork sausage at its core, it couldn’t be more distasteful to the two other cultures that dominated my early years in Israel: Jewish and Arabic.It also didn’t work at all for my father, a proud Italian and a master of refined understatement in the kitchen. The beauty of today, though, is that I get to choose my childhood favourites from a whole range of formidable and delicious traditions.This soup is a speciality of my father’s. It uses the tiniest amount of potato to thicken the base while still keeping the soup light and fresh. My dad would buy in pickles to garnish his, but I’ve made my own quick one here. You can go either way.Prep 20 minChill 1 hr-plusCook 30 minServes 4 as a light lunch2 cucumbers, 1 sliced into ¼cm-thick rounds, the other roughly choppedSalt and black pepper2½ tbsp white-wine vinegar1½ tsp caster sugar1 medium (130g) maris piper potato, peeled and cut into 1½cm cubes2 leeks, cleaned, trimmed and roughly chopped (250g net weight)350g Greek-style yoghurt80g ice cubes20g roughly chopped parsley2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed3 tbsp olive oilIn a medium bowl, toss the sliced cucumber with a teaspoon and a half of salt, then tip into a colander and set it back over the bowl. Leave to sit for 20 minutes, to draw out as much liquid as possible, then push down gently on the cucumber and transfer to a clean bowl; discard the salty liquid. Add the vinegar and sugar, toss to mix, then leave to pickle for 30 minutes while you get on with the soup.Put the potato and 700ml water in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once it’s simmering, add the leeks and cook for eight minutes, or until the vegetables have softened. Drain and leave to cool for 15 minutes.Transfer the leeks and potatoes to a blender, add the yoghurt, ice, parsley, garlic, two tablespoons of olive oil, 100ml water, all the chopped cucumber, 150g of the pickled cucumber and a tablespoon and a half of its pickling liquid, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, then blend until very smooth. Transfer to the fridge to chill for about an hour, or longer if you want to get ahead.To serve, divide between four bowls, top with the remaining pickled cucumber (discarding its liquid) and drizzle with the last tablespoon of oil.My mother made this, a Berliner dish that became very popular in the American midwest, with leftover cooked potatoes. The meat element can be sausage (any sausage, really) or bacon, and she’d serve it with a tomato and cucumber salad dressed with lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic. Prep 20 minCook 30 minServes 48 large eggs2 tbsp double cream5g chives, cut into 1cm lengths, plus 1 tbsp extra to garnishSalt and black pepper40g unsalted butter2 tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled, halved and cut into ¼cm-thick slices250g cooked waxy potatoes (eg, charlottes), peeled and cut into roughly 2cm cubes200g frankfurters, cut at a slight angle into ½cm-thick slices1 green pepper, stem, pith and seeds removed, cut into roughly 1½cm cubes (130g net weight)80g mozzarella block (ie, low-moisture mozzarella), roughly gratedIn a bowl, beat the eggs, cream, chives, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper and set aside.Melt 30g of the butter with all the oil in a large, nonstick saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry the onion, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned – about six minutes. Add the potato and frankfurters, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and fry, again stirring occasionally, until everything is starting to brown and crisp up – another five or so minutes. Stir in the green pepper and cook, shaking the pan often, until it softens and everything is nicely coloured – about seven minutes.Turn down the heat to medium, add the last 10g butter and swirl the pan to melt. Pour in the egg mix, sprinkle on the cheese and cook for about three minutes, gently folding over the mixture here and there with a spatula, though without mixing everything completely together. Sprinkle over the extra chives and serve directly from the pan.My mum’s favourite cookbook was Myra Waldo’s The Complete Round-The-World Cookbook from 1954. It would take her to all corners of the globe, and we were her guinea pigs. This sweet, coconutty dish became her favourite, and ours, too. It’s not one bit authentic, but it is addictive. Serve with plain or sticky rice.

Tip into a bowl, and set aside one tablespoon to garnish.Meanwhile, put the ginger, garlic, turmeric, chilli, star anise, coriander seeds and three tablespoons of water in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz to a coarse paste, scraping down the sides a few times as you go.Heat the oil in the same saute pan on a medium-high flame and, once hot, fry the onion, stirring now and then, until softened and lightly browned – about seven minutes. Add the spice paste and cook for another two minutes, until fragrant. Add the chicken, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is no longer pink on the outside – another seven minutes or so – then stir in the lime zest, jam, coconut milk, 120ml water and the toasted coconut. Bring the mix up to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover the pan and leave to cook for 40 minutes. Remove the lid, turn up the heat to medium and cook, stirring now and then, for seven minutes more, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick and rich. Stir in the lime juice.Transfer to a shallow serving platter and drizzle with the extra coconut milk. Sprinkle with the reserved toasted coconut and the coriander leaves, and serve warm.

How to make the perfect pasta e fagioli - recipe,"Could food come any more comforting than a hearty bowl of pasta and beans? But which beans, and which pasta, to use?",Felicity Cloake,2019-10-16T12:00:19+0100,"Described by Ligurian-born chef Lucio Galletto in his book The Art of Pasta as “one of the few dishes that unify Italy”, pasta and beans (pasta e fasoi, he says in the north, pasta fazool if you’re Dean Martin) is “peasant food of the most warming and comforting kind”, according to Russell Norman. It’s also one of those recipes with as many versions as there are cooks, differing not only, Gennaro Contaldo observes, from region to region, “but also among families”.Such hearty, starchy dishes were once an important part of everyday diets all over Europe, beans being both easy to grow and to store – indeed, the rather austere rule of St Benedict allotted monks a pint of beans and a pound of bread a day – and though these days we all have access to more exotic fare, it’s hard to deny their attractions as a thrifty, satisfying stomach-filler. But if you don’t have a treasured recipe handed down from your nonna, what’s the best way to enjoy pasta e fagioli?Perhaps unsurprisingly, this universally popular dish can be made with a number of different beans – Marcella Hazan calls borlotti, “brightly marbled in white and pink”, the “classic” variety in her Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, recommending the fresh sort when in season. When cooked, she says, “its flavour is unlike that of any other bean, subtly recalling chestnuts”. Outside their summer season, dried, as used by Anna, one of the nonnas in the new Pasta Grannies book, and Norman in his book Polpo, are a “wholly satisfactory substitute”. Contaldo recommends tinned in his Pasta Perfecto!, though, “time permitting”, you could use dried “if you prefer”; Galletto’s recipe, “alla montanara”, deploys dried “large white beans, called fagioli di Spagna in Italian”, and, I assume, butter beans in English.Happily, I find fresh, candy-spotted borlotti without too much trouble, and can confirm that they are truly worth tracking down (or planting for next year): plump and nutty, they’re a quite superior product to the dried kind. However, as the season draws to a close, they’re not the most practical recommendation. Tinned work just fine, especially if you’re in a hurry (Contaldo’s recipe can be on the table in half an hour), but dried are a better alternative, simply because you can flavour them as you like during cooking, and use the cooking water to make a really beany broth, of which more later. If you do use tinned, loosen the water in the tin with chicken or vegetable stock.Norman cooks his beans with onion, garlic and rosemary, while nonna Anna and Galletto pop in carrot and celery. The sharpness of garlic doesn’t feel quite right here for some reason, but the other vegetables are a great pairing with the earthiness of the beans, giving them a fuller, more rounded flavour.Both Hazan and Contaldo mash some of the cooked beans into the broth to thicken it, which seems an eminently sensible idea, making the whole dish even more emphatically beany – on which note, though Galletto’s butter beans work just fine, we find they lack the flavour of the borlotti – even Hazan’s suggested kidney beans would probably be a more interesting option. So often relegated to a supporting role, beans should be the star ingredient in this dish.Infusing the beans alone is not enough; all the recipes I try include a soffrito, or a base of fried onion, often with carrot and celery, too, sometimes with garlic and, in the case of Galletto, red chilli as well, which is then combined with the beans and their broth. Some, including Contaldo and Anna, add pancetta and crumbled sausage, and some such as Galletto use prosciutto – this dish is pretty delicious without meat, but if you do eat it, a little pork fat is rarely a bad thing for flavour. Pancetta is the easiest way to achieve this, but for a more substantial, almost ragù-like soup, Anna’s sausage version is a winner with my testers. Otherwise, I’m going to keep the soffrito fairly simple by adding more in the way of onion, celery and carrot to give the dish a breadth of texture as well as taste: chilli, garlic, celery leaves and so on are entirely up to you.Tomatoes are very much optional – they play no part at all in Contaldo’s recipe – but, simmered down until they become one with the beans, they do add a pleasant dose of umami. Indeed, if you’re really keen on them, try Norman’s version, which stirs in a rich, long-simmered tomato sauce to create a creamily robust tomato and bean soup that is surely the very definition of a cockle-warmer, whatever that is in Italian.Hazan loosens her soup with beef stock and Contaldo with vegetable, but I’m going to stick with the bean cooking liquid, so the predominant flavour is that, rather than meat or aromatics. If you would like to use stock, a neutral chicken would be my preference for omnivores.Make it as thick or as thin as you like: according to Contaldo’s sister Adriana, “the real pasta e fagioli should have a thicker consistency” but I’d be very surprised if there weren’t millions of Italians prepared to argue the exact opposite.Naturally, there’s no consensus here, either. Norman writes: “I have seen this made with tagliatelle, bigoli and penne, none of which seems right to me. I like the pasta to be roughly the same size as the beans,” which means small dried macaroni. Contaldo calls for fresh egg tagliatelle or pappardelle, cut into 7cm lengths, Galetto for maccheroncini, ditalini or broken spaghetti, and Hazan and Anna both make their own in the form of maltagliati, or fresh egg pasta lozenges, and cresc’tajat respectively.The latter, a speciality of Le Marche, is, according to the woman behind the Pasta Grannies book and project, Vicky Bennison, “a fine example of frugal cooking. It used to be made with leftover polenta and served with stewed wild greens or beans, which is what Anna made for us.” I squidge cold polenta with flour, then roll it out and cut it into diamond shapes before cooking it in boiling water – it has a satisfying solidity about it that we all love, and if you happen to have any leftover polenta knocking about, I commend the idea to you. Otherwise, this being a simple, frugal dish, use whatever dried pasta you have to hand; I think the slight chewiness is a more pleasurable with the soft beans than the fresh kind, but whatever floats your boat. Personally, I’m not keen on short lengths of spaghetti (so hard to pick up), so I use Norman’s macaroni.Galetto also uses potatoes, cooking them and the pasta in the residual heat of the broth. My spuds are still crunchy even after the allotted two hours, but I like the idea of them if you’re looking to bulk the dish out even further: some days are just three-starch days.If you’re feeling fancy, Norman’s garlic and rosemary oil is a lovely, punchy way to finish the dish, but for me it’s all about comfort, so I’m making like Marcella and adding a knob of butter and a sprinkling of parmesan. And a great big spoon.Prep 10 minSoak 8 hrCook 90 minServes 4175g dried borlotti beans2 celery sticks2 carrots1 large onionSprig of rosemary (optional)2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil75g fatty pancetta, diced (optional)2 tinned plum tomatoes 175g small macaroni, or other dried pasta25g butter15g grated parmesan or pecorinoSoak the beans in plenty of cold water for about eight hours, then drain. Put in a large pan with one each of the carrots and celery sticks, both snapped in half, and half the onion.Cover with cold water by about 3cm, bring to a boil, then skim the top. Add the rosemary, if using, turn down the heat and cook until the beans are tender (this should take around an hour, depending on their freshness). Make sure the beans are always covered with water, so top up as necessary.Towards the end of the cooking time, peel and cut the remaining onion, carrot and celery into fairly fine dice, keeping the onion separate.Heat the oil in a wide, high-sided pan over a medium-low heat and saute the onion until soft and golden, then add the carrot and celery, and do the same. Add the pancetta, if using, and fry until it releases its fat, then stir in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the spoon.Once the beans are cooked, remove and discard the vegetables and rosemary, and scoop out a ladleful of the beans. Mash these with a little of their cooking water to make a paste, then stir into the soup with all the whole beans and enough of the cooking water to make a thick soup.Let the soup simmer gently while you cook the pasta in salted boiling water in another pot until al dente.Stir the drained pasta into the soup along with the butter, cover, take off the heat and leave to sit for five minutes. Season to taste and serve with a sprinkling of cheese.• Pasta and beans: up there with beans on toast for comfort, or too much of a good thing starch-wise?

Nigel Slater’s autumn recipes to take time over,"Spiced rice and pumpkin, comforting beef rib and potato, raspberry mille-feuille: layered recipes, contrasting autumn flavours",,2019-10-21T08:00:41+0100,"I am on the brink of lighting the first fire of the year. In fact, by the time you read this, I shall probably have done so. And with the cooler weather comes a different type of eating. Slower and (slightly) more complex, the sort of cooking that keep us a little longer in the kitchen but also at the table. Food to linger over.Lasagne aside, the most famous of layered recipes is probably biryani, where meat and rice is pressed down in a pot with onions and spices and often enclosed in a pastry crust. To say it’s a lot of work is an understatement. It is one those dishes I tend to leave to restaurant cooks.A somewhat simpler version can be made without meat, and without the pastry crust. I did a version this week, layering saffron rice with mashed pumpkin and spiced onions that took a good hour, but without the inevitable fuss of the classic.Serves 4onions 2 mediumgroundnut oil 4 tbspginger 60gchilli flakes 1 tsppumpkin 1.5kgwhite basmati rice 300gsaffron 2 pinchesgreen cardamom pods 12peppercorns 8bay leaves 4cinnamon 1 stickbeetroot 200gPeel and roughly chop the onions. Warm 3 tablespoons of the oil in a deep pan then add the onions and cook over a low to moderate heat. Grate the ginger and stir into the onions with the chilli flakes, and let them continue cooking until the onions are soft and golden brown – a good 25 minutes.Peel the pumpkin, cut into large pieces, then steam for 15 minutes till soft. Drain and mash with a vegetable masher or fork. Stir in black pepper and a little salt.Wash the rice in warm water: put the rice in a large bowl with plenty of warm water, stir the rice around in the water with your hand, pour off the cloudy water, then repeat twice until the water is almost clear. Drain the rice, put in a medium-sized saucepan with enough water to cover by 3cm. Add the saffron and whole cardamom pods, peppercorns, bay leaves and cinnamon stick, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the water simmers, then cover tightly with a lid. Leave to cook for 10 minutes.Remove the rice from the heat and leave to rest without removing the lid. Coarsely grate the beetroot and set aside. Lift the lid from the rice and stir briefly with a fork to separate the grains.Now assemble the dish. Pour the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the dish then add one third of the rice followed by a third of the pumpkin. Scatter a third of the onions over the pumpkin then half of the beetroot. Now continue layering until all the rice, pumpkin, onion and beetroot is finished.Bake for an hour at 200C/gas mark 6.Crab and avocado is a comfortable marriage, needing only something crisp to press all my bells at once. (I often serve carta di musica with mashed avocado and white crab meat.) I sometimes dice cucumber finely and fold it into the avocado cream too. A layer of crunch amid the smooth green cream and flakes of seafood.You can make a modern version of the seafood cocktail by layering mashed avocado, cucumber and crab meat – I use both the brick-red brown meat and the snowy needles of sweet white flesh. It can look beautiful in a wine glass, especially when the layers are put together loosely rather than tightly packed. A squeeze of lime wouldn’t go amiss and I like to put in some coriander too, a herb very much at home with both crab and avocado.Serves 4avocados 3 ripelime juice 4 tbsp red chilli 1 large cucumber ½white crab meat 250gbrown crab meat 250gcoriander leaves 3 tbsp, choppedPeel and stone the avocados, then put the flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Squeeze in the lime juice. Halve, seed and finely chop the chilli then add to the avocado and process it all to a smooth, pale green paste.Peel the cucumber, core with a teaspoon and discard the seeds, then cut first into thick strips then into small cubes and fold into the avocado cream.Check the white and brown crab meat for any remaining shell, then fork the chopped coriander through the white meat.Loosely layer the avocado and white and brown crab meats in four glasses or small dishes, chill for half an hour and serve.The first time I met the mixture of filo, spinach and feta was aboard a ferry bound for the Greek islands circa 1980 and I have loved it ever since. For all its cellophane wrapper and dubious age, I wolfed my flaky pastry parcel gratefully and have used the combination in tarts, salads and little pies ever since. (Try brushing a sheet of filo with melted butter then sprinkling it with sea salt and dried thyme. Bake till crisp, then shatter the cooked pastry and scatter over a salad of spinach leaves and feta.)This time, a roll-up of chilli-flecked spinach and melted cheese baked inside the filo. The rolled layers of vegetables, cheese and pastry formed a simple lunch with a salad of tomato, black olive and basil.Serves 6spinach 600gdill 30gfeta 400gmozzarella 375gdried chilli flakes 2-3 tspbutter 105gfilo pastry 6 sheets (about 250g)nigella seeds 2 tsppoppy seeds 2 tspsesame seeds 2 tspSet the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Wash the spinach, then, with the leaves still wet, place it in a large saucepan over a moderate heat. Cover tightly with a lid and let the leaves cook in their own steam for a minute or two till wilted. Tip them into a colander and squeeze out any moisture.Roughly chop the spinach and the dill and mix them together. Coarsely grate the feta and mozzarella into the spinach and dill, then season with black pepper and the chilli flakes. Melt the butter in a small pan.Place a sheet of filo on a work surface or chopping board. Brush generously with some of the melted butter. Place a second sheet on top, butter it, then repeat with a third sheet. With the longest edge towards you, shape half of the filling in a long sausage, along the nearest edge.Roll the pastry away from you, covering the filling and forming a long cylinder. Transfer to a baking tin.Now repeat with the remaining three sheets of pastry and the remaining filling. Place the second roll close to the first. Brush with the last of the butter then sprinkle with the nigella, poppy and sesame seeds.Bake for about 20 minutes till the pastry is pale gold, then serve immediately.It was the first properly cold morning of autumn when we set about making this deeply comforting dish. Layers of potato and cheap, bone-in meat for a night when the chestnut leaves are piling up in the lane outside the house. The hands-on cooking time here is minimal, involving little more than the slicing of onions and Maris Pipers, but the unattended cooking time, when the recipe gets on with things itself, is a good two hours. The dish is all the better for that, the flavours deepen and the separate elements – the meat, stock and potatoes – become, deliciously, as one.During the layering of meat and potatoes I like to tuck in the stripped rib bones, and in so doing extracting every last bit of goodness and savour from them. On the side, a crisp white cabbage salad, perhaps (olive oil, white wine vinegar, dill), and some bread with which to sponge up the herb-stippled juices.Serves 6 beef short ribs 1.4kgolive oil 4 tbsponions 3 mediumthyme 8 sprigsrosemary 4 bushy sprigsbay leaves 4black peppercorns 8beef stock 2 litreslarge potatoes 1kgCut the beef into ribs. Warm the oil in a large, deep-sided pan, then brown the ribs all over, taking care as they may spit and pop. Turn the ribs over with kitchen tongs as they colour, removing them to a plate when their fat is golden.Peel and thinly slice the onions then put them into the pan in which you have just browned the beef, adding the thyme, rosemary, bay and peppercorns, and lower the heat to moderate. Let the onions cook, giving them the occasional stir, for about 20 minutes, until they are soft and light gold.Return the beef ribs to the pan, together with any juices from the plate, then pour over the beef stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the liquid quietly putters, partially cover with a lid, and leave for 1 hour or until the meat can easily be cut from the bones.Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Remove the ribs from the pan and pull the meat from the bones. Slice the potatoes thinly, using a mandoline if you have one, a large cook’s knife if not. In a large, shallow baking dish or roasting tin, layer the potatoes and the meat and onions, seasoning each layer as you go with salt and black pepper, then pour over the stock from the pan.Bake for an hour to 90 minutes, until the potatoes are soft and giving.As much as I like the idea of the classic layered mille-feuille I feel it only works when the pastry is very dark, thin and crisp and the filling involves a few sharp fruits to contrast the soft, billowing blandness of the cream. Raspberries, blackberries and blackcurrants then, rather than peaches and strawberries. You can go further with the contrasting textures by adding crushed brittle or almond or pistachio praline to the whipped cream. The cream is best when beaten until only just thick enough to spread.Serves 8caster sugar 125gshelled pistachios 125gpuff pastry 320gdouble cream 500mlraspberries 250gTo decorateicing sugar 3 tbspraspberries 125gYou will need a small, lightly oiled baking sheet and two large baking sheets, one of which is lined with baking parchment.Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 8. Put the sugar in a non-stick shallow pan over a low to moderate heat. Watch very carefully as it melts, then, when it is golden, add the shelled pistachios. As the sugar darkens to a deep bronze, tip the mixture out onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and leave to cool.Roll out the pastry to a rectangle measuring 28cm x 33cm. Transfer to the baking sheet lined with baking parchment. Place a second sheet of parchment on top, then cover with the second large baking sheet. Place a heavy roasting tin on top then bake for 15-20 minutes.Remove the roasting tin, baking sheet and top layer of parchment, then continue to bake for a further five minutes or until the pastry is deep golden brown and very crisp.Break the pistachio brittle into large pieces and reduce to coarse crystals using a food processor. If you prefer, pound the brittle to crumbs with a pestle and mortar.Whip the cream until thick. Crush the raspberries with a fork and fold them into the cream together with three quarters of the crushed nut brittle. Cut the pastry in half lengthways and trim the edges, crushing the trimmings to crumbs with a knife.Place one of the two sheets of pastry on a serving dish or board. Spoon the cream, fruit and nut filling on top, smooth the surface flat pushing the cream right to the edge of the pastry, then cover with the second piece of pastry. Press down lightly on the cake with your hands or a baking sheet to settle the layers of cream and pastry.Smooth the edges flat with a palette knife, then cover the sides with the reserved pastry crumbs, pushing them in with the knife.To decorate, mix the reserved brittle with the icing sugar, then scatter over the top of the cake. Place the remaining raspberries along the top and serve.@NigelSlater"
Meera Sodha’s family recipe for vegan Gujarati tomato curry,From western India via Uganda comes this vegan curry made irresistable when topped with crunchy fried noodles known as sev,Meera Sodha,2019-10-19T10:00:26+0100,"This is an ancient Gujarati dish from the Kathiyawad peninsula, where my ancestors are from. This recipe was carried by my great grandfather in the 1940s when he set sail for Uganda with his big ambitions and his sev sancha (a little machine that’s used to make chickpea flour noodles).The recipe travelled again decades later, in 1972, with my grandparents when they left Uganda for Britain. It was passed on to me by my mother last year, and now it’s yours for safekeeping.The recipe has stayed the same; it’s only the cook and the times that have changed.You might think that tomatoes are out of season, but the Isle of Wight’s Tomato Stall still supplies much of the UK for another few weeks yet.The sev – super-thin, fried chickpea noodles often called “nylon” sev – can easily be bought here in the UK: try the world food or ethnic aisles at bigger supermarkets, your local Indian grocer or online. Eat this with another vegetable curry (such as my potato and spinach curry), rice and/or chapatis.Prep 10 minCook 15 minServes 4 as part of a main meal3 tbsp rapeseed oil ¾ tsp mustard seeds 1 big pinch fenugreek seeds 5 fat garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1kg mixed tomatoes, quarteredSalt1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder1 tsp ground coriander ¾ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp tomato puree30-50g nylon sevFresh coriander, shredded, to serveIn a large frying pan for which you have a lid, heat the oil over a medium heat until it’s shimmering hot. Add the mustard and fenugreek seeds, leave them to pop for a minute, then add the minced garlic. Stir until the garlic is golden and getting sticky in the pan – this will take a minute, possibly two – then add the tomatoes and a big pinch of salt. Stir to combine, then cover the pan and leave everything to cook on a high heat for five minutes – it should be bubbling fiercely. Add the chilli, ground coriander, cumin, turmeric, tomato puree and a couple of tablespoons of water, if need be to loosen the mixture, cover again and cook for a further two minutes.Taste and adjust the salt or chilli, if you wish, then distribute the curry across four bowls and add a small handful of sev and a sprinkle of coriander to each. Serve as part of a meal with freshly steamed basmati rice and/or chapatis.

A South African shepherd's pie: Thomasina Miers' family recipe for bobotie,"An intriguing recipe handed down by Tommi’s mischievous nanna Mimi – a sort of South African, spicy version of shepherd’s pie called bobotie ",Thomasina Miers,2019-10-21T12:00:25+0100,"My maternal grandmother was known for being a tiddlywinks demon, having the naughtiest twinkle in her eye and, whenever she went home to South Africa, for disappearing into the bush to hang out with Zulu tribespeople – the people with whom she seemed to feel most at home. Her stories of her time there were always captivating, and of the recipes she made that were both homely and exotic, this was one of the best.Don’t be put off by the long list of ingredients – this is essentially a South African shepherd’s pie, only easier, with some lovely spicing thrown in.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 6-8Butter, for greasing4 tbsp olive oil3 onions, peeled and choppedSalt and black pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped2 bay leaves1½ tsp mustard seeds2 tsp curry powder½ tsp chilli flakes1 tsp turmeric1 ½ tsp garam masala1kg beef or lamb mince100ml red-wine or cider vinegar100g flaked almonds120g raisins50g fresh breadcrumbs75g fruit chutney (I like Tracklements’ Country Garden Chutney)For the topping3 eggs500ml whole milk3 bay leavesGrease a large baking dish and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. Warm a large, wide casserole pot over a medium heat and, when hot, add three tablespoons of oil.Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and sweat for 10 minutes, until soft. Stir in the garlic, bay leaves and spices and cook for another three to four minutes, until fragrant. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. When hot, season the meat with salt and pepper, and brown in the pan in two or three batches, breaking up the meat with a spoon and cooking until caramelised and dark. Once all the meat is browned, return the onion mixture to the pan and add the vinegar, almonds and raisins.Turn the heat down to low and simmer for five minutes, to allow the flavours to mingle. Take off the heat, stir in the breadcrumbs and chutney and check the seasoning. Transfer to the baking dish, smooth over with the back of a spoon and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes.To make the topping, beat together the eggs and milk and pour over the meat. Scatter over the bay leaves, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden and the custard just set. This is delicious served with brown rice and some greens.Leftover flaked almonds make the best biscuits. I love florentines, or you could mix them with honey and a little butter for a crunchy topping for shortbread. Leftover bobotie makes a killer filling for a jacket potato, so don’t eat it all at once."
Welsh cakes and bara brith: Anna Jones’ family recipes,"A distinctly Celtic flavour to the hand-me-down recipes of Anna’s family, with a teatime treat of Welsh cakes and fruit cake – or bara brith ",Anna Jones,2019-10-18T12:00:54+0100,"Some families have a wealth of handed-down recipes, carefully written into notebooks with welcome splatters and curling corners. My family does not. My dad is one of 12 brothers and sisters, so my nan (or, “mam”) didn’t have time to go to the corner shop, let alone write down a recipe.On my mum’s Irish, Catholic side, there was just my grandma, and while she and my mum both loved food, their life in a bedsit on a budget meant neither of them were keen cooks. So my food inheritance was simple Sunday roasts, egg and chips, and the odd treat: chocolate bars, fruit pies and – the favourite – Welsh cakes. Another treat was always a slice of fruit cake, which even as a kid I loved. This bara brith comes from my husband’s mum, Sian, but I’ve taken a few liberties with the recipes to update them with flavours I now love. Recipes to me are like a food tapestry, with new threads being added as the old ones fray.Traditionally, these are made with raisins and a little bit of nutmeg. You could stick to these flavours if you like, but I love them with a hit of citrus, sour cherries and vanilla. They are best eaten warm, and can be heated for a couple of minutes in an oven, pan or even in the toaster.Prep 20 minCook 25 minMakes around 20350g plain flour2 tsp baking powder175g unsalted butter or dairy-free spreadSea salt115g golden caster sugar, plus extra for dusting100g sour cherries1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out, or 1 tsp vanilla bean pasteZest of 1 unwaxed lemonZest of 1 unwaxed lime1 egg, beaten2-3 tbsp milkSift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Use your fingertips to rub in the butter or dairy-free spread until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then mix in the salt, sugar, sour cherries, vanilla and citrus zests. Mix in the beaten egg and two tablespoons of the milk, then bring together with your hands to form a firm dough. If it seems a bit dry, add another tablespoon of milk.Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out the dough to about 1cm thick. Use a 6cm round cutter to stamp out circles, bringing the dough back together and recutting until it has all been used up.Heat a large, heavy frying pan or flat griddle over a low heat (no need to add any oil) and cook the Welsh cakes five at a time. This should give you plenty of room to flip them over and will ensure they cook evenly. Cook for about two to three minutes each side, until deep golden.Cool the cakes on a wire rack, and dust with caster sugar and a little salt. Eat warm on the day you make them, either on their own or with butter and jam.Bara brith translates from Welsh as “speckled bread”, which I find adorable. I use Earl Grey in this recipe, because that’s the tea I like to drink, but you can use whatever black tea you like. If you’re using a less strong tea, such as Earl Grey, brew it using two teabags. Traditionally, raisins, currants and sultanas are used in bara brith, but I like to mix in dates, dried apricots and sour cherries, too. Basically, a mixture of whatever I have.Prep 20 minSoak 1 hrCook 1 hr 30 minMakes 1 x 2lb/900glarge loaf250ml strong, hot tea (I use Earl Grey)450g dried fruit (sultanas, currants, raisins, chopped dates, chopped apricots)1 organic egg, beatenZest of 1 unwaxed lemon200g dark brown sugar1 tsp baking powder200g plain wholemeal flourHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/ gas 4. Make your tea nice and strong, and let it brew for a few minutes longer than you would a cup of tea. Put the dried fruit in a large bowl, pour over the tea and leave it to soak for at least an hour – you can leave it overnight, if you like, but I find an hour is long enough.Mix the egg into the soaked fruit (reserving any remaining soaking liquid for later) and add the lemon zest: if you have soaked the fruit overnight, the liquid should be soaked up, so just add the zest.Mix the sugar, baking powder and flour in a bowl with a whisk to break up any clumps, then mix this into the fruit and eggs. If you haven’t soaked the fruit overnight, add two tablespoons of the reserved liquid and stir through.Grease a 2lb/900g loaf tin and pour in the mix. Bake for 90 minutes: it’s ready when a skewer inserted comes out clean. Eat warm with salted butter."
Liam Charles' recipe for coconut bread pudding – direct from his nan's kitchen,"Nan’s always right, and as ever she gets it spot-on with this coconut-infused bread pudding",Liam Charles,2019-10-19T11:00:25+0100,"I bake and my nan cooks. Well, I cook as well, but you know what I mean. I have to admit, there have been a few times when Nan has stepped on my territory, the baking world.Did she succeed? Of course she did – with this bread pudding. And this is why she bossed it: it’s super simple, tasty and has a few twists here and there (she added coconut to it!). Nan is the best, I tell you.Forget the spoon for stirring – Nan doesn’t always use one.Prep 20 minRest 20 minCook 1 hr 20 minMakes 16 squares500g wholemeal bread slices400g mixed dried fruit 150g desiccated coconut 100g mixed peel 2 tbsp mixed spice400ml whole milk200ml Guinness 2 tsp vanilla extract2 large eggs, beaten150g dark muscovado sugar 2 tsp fine sea saltZest of 2 oranges110g unsalted butter, melted and cooled 4 tbsp demerara sugarTear the bread into a large mixing bowl, add the dried fruit, coconut, mixed peel and spice.

Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4 and grease and line a 20cm nonstick square baking tin with baking paper.After the 20 minutes is up, stir in the melted and cooled butter, then tip the mixture into the tin, spreading evenly. Sprinkle over the demerara sugar, then bake for one hour and 20 minutes, or until firm and golden. If the pudding starts to brown too much, pop some foil over the top. Leave to cool slightly, then flip it out of the pan, cut into squares and serve with a little cream – although it’s just as nice cold."
Bitter-sweet memories: Rachel Roddy's recipe for marmalade cake,Hand-me-down recipes come inseparably steeped in memories – such as this recipe for marmalade cake from an old friend that became etched into the family biography,Rachel Roddy,2019-10-21T12:00:28+0100,"The other day I opened a book to find a sentence, and a bit of paper fell out. As the square piece of block pad glided to the floor like a dead moth, I recognised it as a recipe for a ring cake written out for me not long after coming to Italy, about 14 years ago. I remember making the recipe several times, before using it as a bookmark that was left at page 76. What I don’t remember or recognise is whose neat writing it is.My memory lapse is frustrating. Sharing a recipe is an open-handed act, one made even more tangible if the person sharing has taken the time physically to write it out, maybe with notes, which is a small labour in these copy-and-photograph times.Even if the recipe given is never made, I want to remember where the Post-It lemon pudding or back-of-envelope braised chicken came from. And if the recipe becomes part of my cooking life, it is no different from a recipe from a book or famous chef: it absolutely must have that person attached to it, like a name tag sewn into a collar. Then, every time the recipe is made, the person and your relationship to them, whatever it was, is remembered. Even if it means you have to relive a tired exchange about authenticity, or be reminded that Mario subsequently left his wife for his secretary, recipes have names: Mario’s red-wine risotto; my elegant neighbour Vera’s creme caramel; Lise from Bavaria’s liver and apple.Shared name-tagged recipes are also a way of marking time. Years ago, I organised my mum’s loose recipes, gluing the loose-leaf pages and lips of envelopes into a book and noting where and who they came from. The book is now a sort of collective biography of our family – a strained one.Freda Coleman was a neighbour in the late 1970s, and her marmalade cake marks the margarine years. It was, and is, an ideal cake for a family with congenital marmalade dependency: a rich pound batter into which you stir orange marmalade, which bakes into a bitter-sweet cake. The icing is as good as the cake, which you zig- zag over the top where it then sets into a hard lattice that can be pulled off, although hopefully not from the entire cake as once happened.Part of the pleasure of a cake is the smell as it bakes: marmalade bakes into an almost toffee-like sweetness, and hopefully a bit of peel at the bottom of the cake catches and the smell of that, like dark treacle, assaults your senses.Recipes are only recipes, but they can become fixed points in our lives around which other things move: with them, we can measure time, places, people. Freda’s cake – now our family cake – is one such recipe. If I could only remember the name of the person who gave me the recipe that fell out of the book, that would have a name tag too. Until then, it is just a ring cake. Both cakes are good, but the marmalade triumphs for its amber chunks of peel and icing which, because cake is 50% pleasure, 50% habit, I still want to pull off before eating a slice.This is a cake of four equal parts, plus marmalade (thick-cut or thin, you decide). It is a preference based on habit, but a loaf tin (lined with parchment) seems the best tin for this cake.Prep 10 minCook 40 minMakes 1 loaf110g margarine or butter, at room temp110g sugar2 medium eggs110g self-raising flour4 heaped tbsp marmalade50g icing sugarHot waterBeat together the butter and sugar until soft and creamy. Beat in the eggs, followed by the flour, before stirring in three tablespoons of marmalade.Scape the mixture into a loaf tin lined with parchment. Bake at 170C (150C)/335F/gas 3 for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is puffed up and cracked, and a strand of spaghetti comes out clean.Leave to cool for 30 minutes, then lift the cake from the tin.To make the glaze, loosen the remaining tablespoon of marmalade with a little hot water, then brush the cake.Make a thick icing by mixing the icing sugar with just a little water, and zig-zag it over the cake, letting it dribble down the sides."
From coconut curry to hoppel poppel: Yotam Ottolenghi’s family recipes,"A diverse heritage has led to Yotam’s eclectic toolkit of international hand-me-down recipes, from Germany via the American Midwest to Malaysia",Yotam Ottolenghi,2019-10-19T09:30:22+0100,"The food legacy handed down to me by my parents is probably best embodied by hoppel poppel, a leftovers dish featuring potato, onion, sausage and egg, all mixed together into a glorious hodgepodge. It’s a kind-of bubble and squeak, and comes from my mother’s German heritage but, with pork sausage at its core, it couldn’t be more distasteful to the two other cultures that dominated my early years in Israel: Jewish and Arabic.It also didn’t work at all for my father, a proud Italian and a master of refined understatement in the kitchen. The beauty of today, though, is that I get to choose my childhood favourites from a whole range of formidable and delicious traditions.This soup is a speciality of my father’s. It uses the tiniest amount of potato to thicken the base while still keeping the soup light and fresh. My dad would buy in pickles to garnish his, but I’ve made my own quick one here. You can go either way.Prep 20 minChill 1 hr-plusCook 30 minServes 4 as a light lunch2 cucumbers, 1 sliced into ¼cm-thick rounds, the other roughly choppedSalt and black pepper2½ tbsp white-wine vinegar1½ tsp caster sugar1 medium (130g) maris piper potato, peeled and cut into 1½cm cubes2 leeks, cleaned, trimmed and roughly chopped (250g net weight)350g Greek-style yoghurt80g ice cubes20g roughly chopped parsley2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed3 tbsp olive oilIn a medium bowl, toss the sliced cucumber with a teaspoon and a half of salt, then tip into a colander and set it back over the bowl. Leave to sit for 20 minutes, to draw out as much liquid as possible, then push down gently on the cucumber and transfer to a clean bowl; discard the salty liquid. Add the vinegar and sugar, toss to mix, then leave to pickle for 30 minutes while you get on with the soup.Put the potato and 700ml water in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once it’s simmering, add the leeks and cook for eight minutes, or until the vegetables have softened. Drain and leave to cool for 15 minutes.Transfer the leeks and potatoes to a blender, add the yoghurt, ice, parsley, garlic, two tablespoons of olive oil, 100ml water, all the chopped cucumber, 150g of the pickled cucumber and a tablespoon and a half of its pickling liquid, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, then blend until very smooth. Transfer to the fridge to chill for about an hour, or longer if you want to get ahead.To serve, divide between four bowls, top with the remaining pickled cucumber (discarding its liquid) and drizzle with the last tablespoon of oil.My mother made this, a Berliner dish that became very popular in the American midwest, with leftover cooked potatoes. The meat element can be sausage (any sausage, really) or bacon, and she’d serve it with a tomato and cucumber salad dressed with lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic. Prep 20 minCook 30 minServes 48 large eggs2 tbsp double cream5g chives, cut into 1cm lengths, plus 1 tbsp extra to garnishSalt and black pepper40g unsalted butter2 tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled, halved and cut into ¼cm-thick slices250g cooked waxy potatoes (eg, charlottes), peeled and cut into roughly 2cm cubes200g frankfurters, cut at a slight angle into ½cm-thick slices1 green pepper, stem, pith and seeds removed, cut into roughly 1½cm cubes (130g net weight)80g mozzarella block (ie, low-moisture mozzarella), roughly gratedIn a bowl, beat the eggs, cream, chives, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper and set aside.Melt 30g of the butter with all the oil in a large, nonstick saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry the onion, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned – about six minutes. Add the potato and frankfurters, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and fry, again stirring occasionally, until everything is starting to brown and crisp up – another five or so minutes. Stir in the green pepper and cook, shaking the pan often, until it softens and everything is nicely coloured – about seven minutes.Turn down the heat to medium, add the last 10g butter and swirl the pan to melt. Pour in the egg mix, sprinkle on the cheese and cook for about three minutes, gently folding over the mixture here and there with a spatula, though without mixing everything completely together. Sprinkle over the extra chives and serve directly from the pan.My mum’s favourite cookbook was Myra Waldo’s The Complete Round-The-World Cookbook from 1954. It would take her to all corners of the globe, and we were her guinea pigs. This sweet, coconutty dish became her favourite, and ours, too. It’s not one bit authentic, but it is addictive. Serve with plain or sticky rice. Prep 30 minCook 1 hr 30 minServes 4100g fresh coconut, finely grated50g piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped6 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped20g fresh turmeric, peeled and roughly chopped (or ½ tsp ground turmeric)1 red chilli, roughly chopped, seeds, pith and all2 tsp ground star anise1 tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar2½ tbsp sunflower oil1 onion, peeled and finely chopped (150g net weight)1kg boneless and skinless chicken thighs, each cut into 4 piecesSalt and black pepper1-2 limes – zest grated, to get 1 tbsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp2½ tbsp plum (or apricot) jam 130ml full-fat coconut milk, plus 1 tbsp extra to serve2 tbsp coriander leaves, pickedPut a large saute pan for which you have a lid on a medium heat and, once hot, dry-fry the grated coconut, stirring often, for about 20 minutes, or until golden. Tip into a bowl, and set aside one tablespoon to garnish.Meanwhile, put the ginger, garlic, turmeric, chilli, star anise, coriander seeds and three tablespoons of water in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz to a coarse paste, scraping down the sides a few times as you go.Heat the oil in the same saute pan on a medium-high flame and, once hot, fry the onion, stirring now and then, until softened and lightly browned – about seven minutes. Add the spice paste and cook for another two minutes, until fragrant. Add the chicken, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is no longer pink on the outside – another seven minutes or so – then stir in the lime zest, jam, coconut milk, 120ml water and the toasted coconut. Bring the mix up to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover the pan and leave to cook for 40 minutes. Remove the lid, turn up the heat to medium and cook, stirring now and then, for seven minutes more, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick and rich. Stir in the lime juice.Transfer to a shallow serving platter and drizzle with the extra coconut milk. Sprinkle with the reserved toasted coconut and the coriander leaves, and serve warm.

Nonna's kitchen secrets: authentic fresh pasta recipes from the Pasta Grannies,Learn the art of homemade fresh pasta from those who’ve spent a lifetime making it to perfection with these rustic Italian recipes,,2019-10-19T07:00:41+0100,"Prep 45 minRest 35 minServes 1100g 00 or plain flour1 x 55g egg without its shell (if your eggs are on the small side, add water or another yolk to bring it up to the right weight, if needed)Tip the flour on to a board and use your fingers to make a well in the centre, making sure it’s not too wide nor the rim too low. Pour the egg into the welland scramble together with a fork – they are mixed sufficiently when you lift the fork and you have a homogeneous, non-clumpy looking liquid that falls smoothly from your fork. Draw a fork round the inside of the flour wall, so a small quantity of flour falls into the egg mixture. Whisk it in, smooshing any lumps, so you gradually create a batter. Repeat until you have a mixture that won’t run all over the board, then cave in the flour walls and mix in the rest of the flour with a bench scraper by scraping the flour inwards and over the batter.Mop up any flour with your dough and give it a quick knead. If it is sticky, add a tablespoon of flour and knead again. Knead the dough for 10 minutes minimum: it should feel soft and pillowy. Think of your hands as waves: the heels of your hands push the dough away from you while your fingers pull it back. Once the dough becomes a log, turn it 90 degrees, fold it in half and continue kneading. You want to work at a brisk pace, as air is the enemy of decent pasta – it will dry it out. If the pasta feels too dry, dampen your hands with water to put moisture back into the dough. Your dough should feel silky and smooth. Put the dough in a lidded bowl, cover it to stop it from drying out, and leave the dough at room temperature for 30 minutes (or in the fridge overnight – but bring back to room temperature before you try rolling).Cup your hands over a rolling pin so your wrists nearly touch the pasta board, and flatten the dough with a pin, turning it a few degrees at a time. When it is the size of a plate, start with your hands at hip width and roll the top third of your dough (furthest away from you) by following the curve of the circle and drawing your hands inwards as you push the pin away from you. Your hands will meet in the middle. Stop the pin before it reaches the very edge. Roll the dough four times, turn the pasta from 12 o’clock to 1 o’clock and repeat, going round the clock. To get rid of the bump of pasta in the middle, flip the outer edge of pasta over the pin, hold the pasta with one hand, and put the other hand on the dough to stop it moving. Give the pin a tug with the pasta hand to create a snug fit around the pin. Roll the dough over the pin towards you. Move your hands wider, stick your elbows out and, pressing down, roll the pasta out two or three times.This will flatten the thicker central zone of your pasta. Finish with the pasta rolled up and turn it 90 degrees, opening it out across the board. Repeat this process until the sfoglia (the pasta sheet) is too large to move comfortably by hand. At this stage, you will need to Roll it up around the pin and turn it, as described above. Allow your pin to roll on its own across the dough to remove any air after you have turned it.To check it’s evenly rolled, roll up a third, hold the edges (it will fall off the pin otherwise) and hold it up to the light. Darker patches mean thicker dough and that you haven’t rolled it uniformly, so you will want to go back over these areas. Leave your pasta sheet to dry on the board for five minutes.Prep 1 hr 15 minCook 5 minMakes 32 cestini (enough for 4, as a starter)For the pasta300g 00 flour or plain (all-purpose) flour3 eggsFor the filling250g ricotta, drained weight70g grated Parmigiano ReggianoZest of 1 unwaxed large lemonTo serve30g butter2 tsp ground cinnamonMake the egg pasta as described above. Roll it out to about 1mm thick, so you can see the board beneath it. Cut into 7cm squares – Monica has a special roller to do this, but you can use a ruler and a pastry cutter.Combine all the ingredients to make the filling. Dot a teaspoon of the ricotta mixture into the centre of each square. Gather the four points together and firmly press the adjoining edges together to create four seams. Repeat until you have used all your filling.Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle canter of a simmer and lower the cestini into it with a small sieve or slotted spoon. Cook for three to four minutes.While they are cooking, melt the butter in a small pan. When the cestini are ready, don’t drain them, but scoop them out with a sieve or slotted spoon and plate them up with a couple of spoonfuls of melted butter and a dusting of cinnamon. Allow about eight per person.Prep 1 hr 15 minRest 1 hrCook 10 minServes 4For the pasta400g 00 flour or plain flour4 eggsFor the dressing4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled3 tbsp chopped fresh mint (preferably nepitella)500g fresh porcini, wild, girolle or chanterelle mushrooms, choppedSaltMake the egg pasta dough as described above. Once it has rested for 30 minutes, roll it out to the thickness of shortcrust pastry – aim for 2-3mm thick. Roll it up around your pin while you make the dressing.Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan. Add the garlic and mint, and fry for a couple of minutes before adding the chopped mushrooms. Keep frying to soften the mushrooms, season with a pinch of salt, and add 100ml water. Let this cook off, then continue frying the mushrooms until they are golden.Remove the garlic. Boil a large saucepan of water, salt it, and return it to the boil. Keeping the pasta rolled around your rolling pin, hold the pin above and near the water (don’t burn yourself in the steam). Pull pieces off and drop them in the water. For those of you who don’t want to brandish your rolling pin, simply tear off pasta strips/squares/odd shapes roughly the size of a credit card and then dump them into the boiling water.Cook for two to three minutes, depending on the thickness of your pasta pieces.Drain and add the pasta to the mushroom mixture. Give everything a good stir, toss together and serve.Prep 1 hrRest 35 minCook 25 minServes 4For the pasta300g farro flour (if you can’t find any, use spelt flour)100g 00 flour or plain flour, plus extra for rolling4 eggsFor the pancetta2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil4 thick rashers pancetta, sliced into matchsticks1 onion, peeled and diced1 red chilli, deseeded (or not if you like it fiery)125ml glass white wine400g tin chopped tomatoes (or fresh if it is the height of summer)Salt25g grated pecorino romano, plus extra to serveMake the egg pasta dough as above, and leave your pasta sheet to dry while you make the sauce. Heat the oil in a saute pan, add the pancetta and fry briskly, until the fat has been released from the meat and it’s starting to colour. Remove the pancetta from the pan, leaving the fat behind, and put it to one side.Add the onion and chilli to the pan and fry over a medium heat for seven minutes, or until the onion is soft. Deglaze the pan with the wine and keep frying while the alcohol evaporates. The steam from the pan should cease to smell winey. Add the tomatoes and pancetta, and give everything a good stir. Season with a pinch of salt. Let it bubble away while you slice your pasta.Smooth your sfoglia (pasta sheet) with a little 00 flour. Roll the pasta up like a carpet and, using a cleaver or straight-bladed knife, slice across as thinly as possible to create fine ribbons. Unroll the ribbons and toss them with your hands to give them a good airing. Keep the ribbons apart to stop them from sticking.Bring a pan of salted water to a spirited boil, and heap your pasta into the water. The tagliolini will cook quickly, in about two minutes.Remove the chilli from the sauce. Scoop the pasta out of the pan with a slotted spoon or sieve and ladle it into the sauce. Add the grated pecorino romano, toss and serve immediately, sprinkling with more cheese if you wish.Prep/rest 2 hr 5 minCook 45 minServes 6For the pasta200g 00 or plain flour200g finely ground semolina flour, plus extra for sprinkling4 eggs, plus 1 egg yolkFor the fillingCoarse sea salt1 large pumpkin, peel on, cut into 6 large chunks, seeds removed¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg100g parmigiano reggiano, grated, plus extra to serveSalt and black pepperTo serve120g butter1 handful fresh sage leaves, tornMake the egg pasta dough as above, and leave your pasta sheet to dry while you make the sauce above and let it rest. Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/gas 3. Weigh out 1kg of pumpkin and keep the rest for another dish. Cover a baking tray with a layer of sea salt, put the pumpkin pieces on the tray and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the flesh is soft. Cool, then remove the peel from the pulp. Mash the pumpkin, then stir in the nutmeg and parmigiano reggiano. Make sure the cheese is thoroughly mixed in and season well. Set aside while you make the pasta.Roll out the dough to 1mm thick – you should be able to see your hand through it. Use a pastry cutter or knife to cut 7cm squares. Put a teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each pasta square. To make a cappellaccio, fold the pasta over the filling to make a triangle. Hold one of the smaller corners between your finger and thumb and bring the opposite corner around your forefinger so the two corners meet and create the hat. Make sure the edges are firmly pressed together. Put each one on a tray covered with a cloth and sprinkle with semolina.Bring a large pan of salted water to a rolling boil. In another large pan, melt the butter over a gentle heat and add the sage leaves, allowing them to crisp up.Once the pan of water has reached a simmer, drop in the cappellacci and cook for about four minutes, before tasting one for doneness. Continue to cook for another minute or so if necessary. Drain the pasta carefully, add it to the butter and sage pan and continue to cook for another minute.To serve, gently scoop the pasta into six bowls, dividing the buttery sauce equally between them. Scatter over extra freshly grated parmigiano reggiano and serve.• Recipes from Pasta Grannies: The Secrets of Italy’s Best Home Cooks by Vicky Bennison (Hardie Grant, £20)"
Pork belly and galette: Yotam Ottolenghi’s apple recipes,"Seasonal dishes to make good use of the apple harvest, including roast pork belly and a spiced galette",Yotam Ottolenghi,2019-10-12T09:30:16+0100,"A few weeks ago, I went to my local greengrocer to buy apples to dip in honey for Jewish New Year, and ended up with a selection box from the National Fruit Collection in Brogdale, Kent.It turned out to be a deliciously sweet dip, and also a lucky dip, because I had no idea which of the 2,000-plus types of Brogdale apples I was eating – the kaleidoscope of flavours was staggering. Sadly, our shops sell only a tiny fraction of these varieties, but that’s no reason not to try to seek them out.Today’s recipes specify so-called ‘standard’ apples, but they’d all work with any type that is equally crisp, sweet and cheerful.The flavours in this dish are inspired by Filipino pork adobo, in which the meat is cooked in a sweet and vinegary, soy-based sauce. Here, I use apple juice, apple vinegar and whole apples to cut through that richness. Don’t be put off by the long cooking time – once everything’s in the oven, it’s mostly just a waiting game. Serve with plain rice.Prep 15 minCook 2 hr 30 minServes 41 whole pork belly joint (800-900g), bonelessFlaked sea salt1½ tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and cut into 6 wedges 12 garlic cloves, peeled40g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped4 whole star anise3 bay leaves90ml soy sauce250ml chicken stock250ml unsweetened apple juice (I use a cloudy variety)70ml apple cider vinegar2 tbsp caster sugar1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed3 medium Pink Lady apples (400g), cored and cut into quarters2 spring onions, thinly slicedHeat the oven to 185C (165C fan)/365F/gas 4½. Use a small, sharp knife to score the skin of the pork in a cross-hatch pattern spaced roughly 1½cm apart, then rub a teaspoon of flaked salt into the skin, push it down into the slashes.Put the oil in a large ovenproof saute pan on a medium-high heat, then fry the onion, stirring, for three minutes, just to soften. Add the garlic, ginger, star anise and bay leaves, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly coloured – another three minutes. Add the soy, stock, apple juice, vinegar, sugar and black peppercorns, and bring to a simmer.Take off the heat and lay in the pork, skin side up, taking care not to get the skin wet (it should not at any stage be submerged in liquid). Transfer to the oven, roast for 90 minutes, then remove and arrange the apples around the pork, stirring gently to coat them in the sauce and again taking care not to get any liquid on the skin. Return to the oven for 30 minutes, or until the apples have softened but still retain their shape, and the pork is deeply golden.Gently lift the pork on to a board, leave to rest for 10-15 minutes, then cut into 1½cm-thick slices. To serve, transfer the contents of the saute pan to a serving dish with a lip, lay the pork slices on top and sprinkle with the spring onions.Besides its use in today’s apple galette (see next recipe), this butter is delicious spread on hot toast or stirred into porridge or yoghurt. Alternatively, decant it into sterilised jars, because it makes a great little homemade gift for family and friends. It will keep in the fridge for a week and in the freezer for up to a month.Prep 5 minCook 3 hrMakes 1.2kg, to serve 121kg Bramley apples (ie, about 6 medium apples)1 kg Cox’s apples (ie, about 6 medium apples)700ml unsweetened apple juice (I use a cloudy variety)65ml good-quality apple cider vinegar300g golden (or normal) caster sugar1 whole vanilla pod, split and seeds scraped out2 cinnamon sticks2 fresh bay leaves1 lemon – zest pared off in 4 strips, and juiced, to get 2 tbsp ⅛ tsp saltCut all the apples into quarters, leaving the skins and cores intact, and put in a large stockpot for which you have a lid. Add the apple juice and vinegar, cover and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium, and leave to cook, lid on, and stirring once or twice, for about 20 minutes, or until the apples are completely soft and falling apart.Turn off the heat, remove the lid and leave to cool for 10 minutes. Place a fine-mesh sieve over a large saute pan, tip in the fruit and pass it through the sieve, pushing down with the back of a large spoon to extract as much puree as possible. You should end up with about 1.6kg; discard the solids left in the sieve. Add the remaining ingredients to the pan, stir to combine, then place on a medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for two hours, stirring regularly to prevent the mix scorching on the bottom, or until thickened and reduced by about half. Remove and discard the vanilla pod, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves and strips of lemon zest, and leave to cool completely before using (or pour into sterilised jars and seal).This galette came about mostly as an excuse to make the apple butter in the first recipe, though, to be honest, you don’t really need one to do that. To save time, by all means use bought-in apple sauce instead, though perhaps stir some cinnamon through it first. If you want to get ahead, make the dough up to three days in advance and keep it well wrapped in the fridge (or make it even further ahead and freeze for up to a month). Serve with a caramel sauce, as in the photograph, for extra decadence.Prep 10 min, plus rest Cook 2 hrServes 6For the dough250g plain flour1½ tsp caster sugar¾ tsp salt200g fridge-cold unsalted butter, cut into 1½ cm cubes75ml ice-cold water1 tsp apple cider vinegarFor the filling185g spiced apple butter (see today’s recipe) or bought-in apple sauce (see recipe introduction)600g granny smith apples (ie, about 4 medium apples), cored but skin-on1 tbsp lemon juice50g unsalted butter, melted1 tbsp caster sugar3 tbsp apricot jam1½ tbsp calvados (or brandy, or water)Creme fraiche, to serveFirst make the dough. Put the flour, sugar and salt in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Add the butter cubes, but without mixing them in, then freeze the bowl and its contents for 30 minutes.Tip the chilled mixture into a food processor and pulse a few times, until the cold butter breaks down to the size of peas. Add the water and vinegar, and pulse a few times more, just until the dough starts to come together. Transfer to a clean work surface and use your hands to bring it together into a cohesive dough, working quickly so it keeps nice and cold (that’s the secret to ensuring a light, flaky galette pastry). Shape into a rough round, wrap tightly to make it airtight, then refrigerate for at least two hours or overnight.Heat the oven to 210C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the dough on a well-floured surface and roll it out into a 35cm-diameter circle. Carefully lift this on to a lined baking tray and fold about 1½cm of the pastry’s edge over on itself all the way round. Repeat, so it now has a double folded rim. Crimp decoratively all around the edge, if you wish, then spread the spiced apple butter (or apple sauce) evenly over the base, avoiding the rim. Refrigerate the dough while you make the filling.Using a mandoline or sharp knife, finely slice the apples into 2mm-thick rounds. Put in a bowl with the lemon juice and toss to coat. Arrange the slices on top of the galette base in concentric circles, overlapping them slightly, until the base is completely covered. Brush the apples with the melted butter, then sprinkle with the sugar. Bake for 30 minutes, then turn the tray around and turn down the heat to 190C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until golden and the apples are catching a little at the edges. Transfer to a rack and leave to cool slightly.Put the jam and calvados in a small saucepan and heat gently to warm through, whisking to combine. Brush this mixture evenly over the apples, then slide the galette on to a serving plate or board. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the creme fraiche alongside and some caramel sauce, if you like."

Bring to a rolling boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook on a low heat for 90 minutes. Add the diced potato and continue cooking for 10 minutes, or until the potato is soft.Meanwhile, in a separate pan, cook the barley according to the packet instructions (times may vary), then drain and rinse in cold water.Lift the pork ribs out of the stockpot, shred the meat off the bones and return the meat to the soup. Stir in the cooked barley and taste for seasoning. Stir in the cream and parsley, and serve hot.Prep 15 minCook 90 minServes 44 duck legs Salt and pepper 2 tsp rapeseed oil 2 tsp dried marjoram1 whole garlic head, cut in half horizontally 1kg white potatoes25g soured cream 25g salted butter4 sliced dill pickles, to serve 2 tsp chopped fresh dill leavesTake the duck legs out of the fridge and leave to come to room temperature. Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Prick the legs all over with a sharp knife. In a bowl, mix a good twist of salt and pepper with the rapeseed oil, marjoram and the halved garlic head. Rub this mixture all over the duck legs and put them in a roasting tin. Roast for 90 minutes, then remove, cover with foil and leave to rest.While the duck is roasting, wash and peel the potatoes, and put in a pan of cold, salted water. Bring to a boil, then cook at a healthy simmer until tender, about 10-12 minutes. Drain, then pass through a potato ricer (or mash with a masher). Stir through the soured cream and butter, and keep warm.Serve the rested duck legs with the mashed potatoes and sliced dill pickles on the side, and sprinkle liberally with dill.Prep 5 minCook 1 hrServes 41kg beetroot20g butter1 tsp rapeseed oil 1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped1 tsp lemon juice Salt and pepper ½ tsp caster sugar 1 tsp flour 1 tsp chopped fresh dill leavesPut all the beetroot, unpeeled, in a pan of cold water, bring to a boil and simmer for 30-40 minutes, until soft – test for doneness with the tip of a small, sharp knife: if it slides in easily, they are done. Lift out of the water with a slotted spoon and leave to cool down. While the beetroot are still warm, carefully peel off the skin, then top and tail the roots, and grate the flesh on the fine side of a box grater.Heat a frying pan and add the butter and oil. Fry the onion for 10 minutes, or until very soft, then add the grated beetroot and lemon juice to taste.

"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for potato, parmesan and salami cakes","Crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside, these fritters are perfect with a peppery salad",Rachel Roddy,2019-10-07T12:00:52+0100,"Growing up in England in the 80s, my mum used to drive to a village in Hertfordshire called Whitwell to buy bunches of watercress from Wells farm. We had a Renault 5 with a slippery back seat and lively suspension, so we would bounce as we crossed a humpback bridge to get to the farm. Through the car window, my brother, sister and I, sticky and argumentative, would often see the backs of two of the Sansom brothers as they picked watercress from emerald-green waterbeds that had been cultivated for more than 200 years. It was farms like Wells that grew some of the millions of bunches that were carted up to London in the 1800s and 1900s. In her essay about the watercress girls, Angela Clutton writes about how it was loved by the wealthy, but needed by workers, who ate it for breakfast in sandwiches, and the poor, who ate it with nothing. She also writes about the young watercress girls and their wicker baskets of green and their early-morning cries of “Wo-orter-crease, wo-orter-crease”.Back home in the 80s, Dad would stuff watercress in his sandwiches, its soft leaves and succulent stems pungent with mustard oils, making it both a salad and a seasoning as good as mustard. It was one of the first things I remember teaching myself to eat, seeing the peppery heat as a challenge that would eventually give pleasure. Mum used to make watercress and potato soup, pan after pan of Jane Grigson’s potage de santé (soup of health) which, despite its colour and name, we absolutely loved with bread and butter.My green-tinted nostalgia and love of watercress makes it one of the edible things I miss most about living in Rome, where it is no longer cultivated, despite being an indigenous plant and favoured by the ancient Romans as a food and a medicine. Despite my living away for years, watercress is still the culinary equivalent of a lost friend, one you instinctively think to call or include, before remembering they are not around, that you will have to put rocket in your sandwich, which is all very nice, but not the same as the chlorophyll whip of watercress. Along with lancashire cheese, bacon, double cream, butter, English apples and biscuits, it is one of the first things I buy when I come back, putting it in or with whatever I can, including these Sunday-night potato cakes.A collision of Delia’s recipe for potato cakes, a Neapolitan gateau (a family-size bake of mashed potato with cheese, more smoked cheeses, egg and salami), and ping-pong ball-size, deep-fried croquettes, these are the recipe equivalent of slippers that have been left to warm in front of the fire. It is also a nicely straightforward recipe.Olive oil aids crispness, butter flavour: which is why I fry in a mixture of the two. You can serve whatever salad you wish with the cakes (or none at all), but if I am in England, watercress is a must. It is all about contrast: the crisp shell and soft-centred potato cakes, matched with the floppy leaves and succulent stems of verdant, peppery wo-orter crease.Prep 10 minCook 30 minMakes 81.2kg potatoes150g salami, diced or diced pancetta, fried1 large egg, beaten75g parmesan, grated1 tbsp chopped parsleyA grating of nutmegSalt and black pepperFine, dry breadcrumbsOlive oil and butter for shallow fryingWatercressOlive oil and red wine vinegar dressingScrub the potatoes, then boil them whole in plenty of well-salted water, until tender. Drain and leave them to sit until cool enough to peel.Either mash the potatoes, or pass them through a potato ricer or food mill. Add the diced salami or pancetta, egg, parmesan and plenty of freshly ground black pepper, and mix. Taste for salt and add more if needed.Shape the mixture into about eight, 6cm-wide patties, dip each one into milk or beaten egg, then roll in dry breadcrumbs.In a frying pan, heat a glug of olive oil and a knob of butter until it foams, then shallow-fry the patties until deep golden on both sides.Dress the watercress with salt and a dressing of olive oil and red-wine vinegar, and serve with hot potato cakes."
"Mussels, partridge and pear: recipes for an autumnal French feast","There’s a distinctly seasonal feel to Henry Harris’s Gallic feast of mussels in cider, roast game bird and blackberries, creamed cabbage with bacon, and a pear pudding ",,2019-09-21T07:00:24+0100,"Normans and Bretons are blessed with great shellfish and apples, and the latter, fermented into cider, make a great match for mussels, both for cooking and for drinking alongside. The gentle tannins of a good French ‘brut’ (dry) cider are the key to success here. When buying mussels, they should have a fresh, briny aroma, be glistening and firmly closed; there will inevitably be the odd broken or open one, which you must throw away. Preparation beyond that is simple: just tug out the “beard” (the little hairy tuft or strands that stick out of the shell). A large pan with a close-fitting lid is also essential here..Prep 10 minCook 15 minServes 4 (or 2 as a main, with frîtes)4-6 spring onions, trimmed and cut in half widthways, to separate white and green parts 50g unsalted butterSalt and black pepper350ml Breton or Normandy ‘brut’ cider2kg mussels, cleaned100g creme fraiche2 tbsp chopped parsley leaves1 loaf sourdough breadCut the spring onion whites at an angle, and finely chop the green pieces, much as you would chives.In a large casserole or saucepan, melt the butter and add the sliced spring onion whites. Season generously with pepper and cook over a gentle heat for two minutes, or until soft. Add the cider, bring to a boil and cook for two minutes more.Stir in the mussels and creme fraiche, and seal the pot with the lid. Cook for three to five minutes, giving the pan a good rattle every minute. After three minutes, check regularly – when all the mussels have popped open and look bright and juicy, turn off the heat (don’t leave them too long, as they’re prone to shrivelling, and discard any that stay shut).While the mussels are cooking, cut four thick slices from the loaf and toast them.Using a slotted spoon, lift the mussels from the pan into two large bowls. Bring the cooking liquor to a boil, add the chopped spring onion greens and parsley, and cook for 30 seconds. If you prefer a creamier mussel liquor, whisk in some more creme fraiche. Pour the liquor over the mussels and serve straight away with the toastPartridges need gentle cooking, otherwise they can go a little dry. Many a wild bird will have fed on blackberries from the hedgerows during the late summer months, so they make a natural pairing.Prep 10 minCook 1 hrServes 4For the blackberries1 tsp redcurrant jelly200ml red wine6 crushed juniper berries1 pinch chilli flakes1 pinch ground cinnamon2 small shallots, peeled and finely chopped2 dssp balsamic vinegar1 grating orange zest1 grating lemon zest1 pinch sea salt200g blackberriesFor the partridges1 x 250g packet soft unsalted butter4 partridges (or other small game birds, such as wild duck or pheasant, in which case you may need only 2 birds, depending on size; out of game season, use quail or guinea fowl)Salt and black pepper1 tsp fresh thyme leaves50ml cognacFirst make the spiced berries. Put everything bar the blackberries in a saucepan, bring to a simmer and cook for five minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half. Put the fruit in a small bowl, then pour on the hot liquid, cover and leave to cool (you can make them a day ahead, and store in the fridge, in which case take them out an hour or so before cooking, and put in a warmish spot, so they are just above room temperature when served).Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/gas 5. Rub butter all over the partridges and season very generously. Put the birds in an ovenproof pan that you can later use on the hob, pop them in the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until just cooked through (or a bit longer, if you prefer them well done). Transfer the pot to the hob on a medium heat, so the butter starts to bubble, then add another tablespoon of butter and the thyme. When the butter just starts to take on a delicate, nut-brown colour, turn off the heat and pour in the cognac – you can flambé it, if you wish, but it’s fine just to leave it to bubble until the spluttering subsides. Lift out the partridges and put in a warm place to rest for 15 minutes.Tip any resting juices into the butter pan and give it a last little burst of heat. Put the partridges on individual plates and spoon over the pan juices. Garnish with the spiced blackberries, and serve with some creamed cabbage alongside.Prep 5 minCook 15 minServes 41 savoy cabbage1 tbsp unsalted butter2 tbsp finely chopped shallot10 juniper berries, crushed4 rashers heavily smoked streaky bacon (should you be blessed with a local Polish supermarket, use the darkest, blackest smoked bacon they have)2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped or grated100ml white wine300ml double creamQuarter the cabbage, remove the dense core and cut the leaves as finely as you can.In a large, wide saucepan, melt the butter over a very gentle heat, then add the chopped shallots and juniper, and cook to soften the onions – about two minutes.Cut the bacon into the thinnest of strips, like little wisps. Stir these into the pan and cook gently for a further minute. Now add the garlic and, 30 seconds later, the wine, and bring to a boil. Add the cabbage, plenty of freshly ground black pepper and a little sea salt. On a high heat, stir constantly until the cabbage collapses into the pan. When it has all softened – after about three to five minutes – add the cream and cook vigorously, stirring, until the cream has reduced and coated the cabbage. Adjust the seasoning to taste, and serve.I adore this pudding however it is served: it can be fancy, with fanned poached pears draped over vanilla ice-cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce; but it’s equally enjoyable – and a little more straightforward – served sundae-style in a large tumbler-type glass. A firm, not-quite-ripe pear is vital – a william, conference or comice would be ideal. If you don’t make vanilla-ice cream, it’s just a case of using your preferred brand.Prep 5 minCook 35 minServes 4For the pears1 litre water 275g caster sugar1 vanilla pod, split lengthways2 strips orange zest4 firm pearsVanilla ice-cream, to serveFor the chocolate sauce75g water75g caster sugar150g 70% dark chocolateStart with the pears. In a saucepan, warm the water with the sugar, vanilla and orange zest, and stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Peel the pears, immerse them in the poaching liquid and simmer very gently until cooked through – about 25 minutes. (You could also peel, core and quarter the pears, in which case the cooking time will reduce; this also makes it easier to check that they’re cooked through.) Turn off the heat, leave the pears to cool in the syrup, until cold, then refrigerate until needed.Now for the sauce. Put the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Break the chocolate into small pieces. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the chocolate and stir until it dissolves and you’re left with a glossy sauce. Keep warm.To serve, put a good-sized scoop of vanilla ice-cream in a tumbler or bowl. Slice or dice the poached pears (removing the core first if poached whole), and add to the tumbler. Finally spoon over the warm chocolate sauce and serve without delay.• Henry Harris is chef director of the Harcourt Inns group of pub/restaurants in London."
Nigel Slater’s bavette with aubergines recipe,Grilled steak and aubergines is quick and tasty,Nigel Slater,2019-09-17T12:00:24+0100,"Cut 2 large aubergines, about 350g each in weight, into 1cm slices. Lay them on a roasting tray or baking sheet. Season. Peel and thinly slice 4 cloves of garlic, scatter over the aubergine slices then pour over 8 tbsp of olive oil.Let the aubergines cook under a moderately hot overhead grill for 7-10 minutes, turning them over as they start to soften and begin to go gold in colour.Season and lightly oil a piece of bavette steak, about 700g in weight. Place a wire rack over the aubergines then lay the bavette on top. Set the grill to high, place the steak and aubergines under the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes, then turn the steak and cook the other side.Remove the meat and rack from the roasting grill and place in a warm place, lightly covered, to rest for 8-10 minutes.Check the aubergines are thoroughly soft and golden. If they are not, then return them to the grill, turning them as necessary, while the meat rests. Toss the aubergine and any meat juices together, adding 10 large basil leaves as you go.Spoon the aubergines on to a serving plate, lay the steak on top and serve. Enough for 2.Get the grill really hot for cooking the steak. If you doubt your overhead grill, then cook it separately on a hot griddle or flash fry it in a heavy frying pan. Pour any meat juices over the aubergines.Include a few onions, sliced thinly, with the aubergine. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater"
The cut of meat that chefs love but butchers throw away,"Unbelievably, butchers often throw away less popular cuts of meat. By creating demand for them, we use fewer resources, and get to enjoy dishes like this amazing slow-roast lamb belly",Tom Hunt,2019-09-14T06:00:53+0100,"According to the UK government’s waste and resources programme, Wrap, as much as 70% of post-farm-gate waste takes place in our homes (the rest comes from manufacturing, hospitality and retail). That’s not all our fault, of course: clever marketing, BOGOF offers and bulk buys all help waste proliferate.Beyond reducing our own waste, we can also help food producers reduce theirs by changing our shopping habits. The most effective thing we can do is demand producers and retailers take responsibility for their waste by writing emails to them and our MPs; we can also shorten our food chain by wherever possible buying locally and seasonally.And then there’s root-to-fruit eating – consuming whole foods from the whole farm, including veg such as root greens and lesser-known cuts of meat such as lamb breast, which many butchers literally just throw away. This helps to create a demand for what would normally go to waste, while making our food shop more affordable.Lamb breast is a dream cut of meat savoured secretly by many chefs, not least because it’s flavoursome, affordable and thrifty – from the right butcher, you should be able to get it for a really good price.Do ask them to bone it for you, and take the bones home to help create a sauce for the meat. If you have the bones, make a trivet under the rolled lamb and add a splash of wine to cover them. Pop some potatoes and other vegetables in the oven to roast alongside the belly, to make sure the oven is used to its full capacity.400g lamb belly, boned3 sprigs fresh herbs (oregano, thyme, rosemary, etc), tough stalks removed, or a sprinkle of dried herbs4 garlic cloves, peeled2 outer cabbage leaves (optional)Sea salt and freshly ground black pepperRoast potatoes and other vegetables, to serve (optional)Green sauce, to serveHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Lay the lamb breast flat on a worktop, season with salt and scatter with a mixture of fresh or dried herb leaves. Lay the peeled garlic cloves along the centre of the breast, then roll up the lamb into a tight sausage and wrap it in one or two large outer cabbage leaves (or a piece of greaseproof paper). Roast for 30 minutes, then turn down the heat to 140C (120C fan)/285F/gas 1 and slow roast, with a pan of potatoes and some other vegetables alongside (to fill the oven), for three to four hours, until tender. Serve with the roast veg and green sauce."
Yotam Ottolenghi’s one-pot recipes,"One-pot cooking is a fuss-free way to cram flavour into grains, which will soak up the flavour of a chicken and mushroom stew, charred shallots and chilli, and a lamb pilaf with sour plums",Yotam Ottolenghi,2019-09-07T09:30:03+0100,"The advantages and joys of one-vessel cooking are many, especially when the pan also contains a grain.The addition of rice, cracked wheat or pasta, for example, takes care of the side dish question (you can add another one if you like, but you really don’t have to), so you end up with a meal to fill a family of hungry mouths. The grains are particularly delicious after slowly absorbing the aromatic liquids and juices in which they’re cooked, while releasing their starches as they plump up, and thicken the broth. I guess you could say it’s an osmosis of sorts (or a very welcome exchange): flavour in, texture and sustenance out.Iranian dried sour plums, known as aloo bukhara, are like nature’s candy; they are beautifully orange, sweet, sour and hard to resist. They are used in a variety of Persian dishes but are also great to snack on. You can find them in most Middle Eastern supermarkets, but if you can’t get your hands on any, then use dried apricots or sour cherries instead. This is a celebration dish, perfect for sharing and well worth the effort.Prep 20 minCook 55 minServes 63 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, peeled and thinly sliced (150g)6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed500g lamb mince (20% fat)½ tsp saffron threads, roughly crushed1 tsp ground cardamom1½ tsp ground cinnamon 1 tbsp dried rose petalsSalt and black pepper300g basmati rice, washed and soaked for 1-2 hours in plenty of cold water, then drained 20g dill, roughly chopped10g parsley, roughly choppedFor the sweet almonds1½ tsp olive oil4 tsp caster sugar¾ tsp ground cinnamon100g blanched almondsFor the sour plum dressing10g dill, finely chopped10g parsley, finely chopped1 green chilli, finely chopped (10g)150g dried sour plums, pitted and roughly chopped (or 100g dried apricots, quartered)3 tbsp cider vinegar60ml olive oilHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4 and line a small oven tray with baking paper. On a medium-high heat, warm three tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan for which you have a lid. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and browned – about seven minutes. Add the garlic, lamb, saffron, cardamom, cinnamon and half the rose petals, and cook, stirring to break up the mince, until no longer pink, about four minutes. Add 250ml water, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for seven minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid is absorbed.Add the rice, herbs, 520ml hot water, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and bring to a boil. Cover the pan tightly with foil, then a lid, and turn the heat to its lowest setting. Cook for 15 minutes, then set aside, still covered, for another 15 minutes.Meanwhile, make the almonds. Put the oil, sugar, cinnamon and a tablespoon of water in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring often, then add the almonds. Cook, stirring, for three minutes, then transfer to the lined oven tray and bake for 12 minutes, stirring once halfway, until golden. Leave to cool, then roughly chop. Meanwhile, mix all the dressing ingredients and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a small bowl.To serve, spread out the rice on a large platter. Top with the almonds and remaining rose petals, and spoon over the dressing.You can’t get much more than this tender chicken by way of comfort and pure deliciousness.

Transfer to a large bowl with the porcini mushrooms and 1.1 litres boiling water. Cover with a plate and leave to soak for at least 15 minutes.Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry and sprinkle all over with half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, then stuff the cavity with one lemon half.Put a large ovenproof, cast-iron saucepan, for which you have a lid, on a medium-high heat and add two tablespoons of oil. Add the chicken and cook on all sides until browned – about seven minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate, add the remaining two tablespoons of oil to the saucepan, along with the celery and onion, and cook for six minutes, until lightly golden. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for another minute, until fragrant. Return the chicken to the pan breast side up, then pour over the porcini liquid, along with all the aromatics, two teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir through the orzo, pushing some into the bird’s cavity. Cover again and bake for 20 minutes more, until the orzo is cooked and has absorbed most of the liquid.Turn up the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7, uncover and bake for 10 minutes, or until browned on top. Leave to cool slightly – 10-15 minutes.To serve, squeeze over the other lemon half, sprinkle with the parsley and serve directly from the pan, with the lemon wedges alongside.The unique smoky and nutty qualities of freekeh are amplified here with the addition of charred shallots and cascabel chillies.

Well, I cook as well, but you know what I mean. I have to admit, there have been a few times when Nan has stepped on my territory, the baking world.Did she succeed? Of course she did – with this bread pudding. And this is why she bossed it: it’s super simple, tasty and has a few twists here and there (she added coconut to it!).

Welsh cakes and bara brith: Anna Jones’ family recipes,"A distinctly Celtic flavour to the hand-me-down recipes of Anna’s family, with a teatime treat of Welsh cakes and fruit cake – or bara brith ",Anna Jones,2019-10-18T12:00:54+0100,"Some families have a wealth of handed-down recipes, carefully written into notebooks with welcome splatters and curling corners. My family does not. My dad is one of 12 brothers and sisters, so my nan (or, “mam”) didn’t have time to go to the corner shop, let alone write down a recipe.On my mum’s Irish, Catholic side, there was just my grandma, and while she and my mum both loved food, their life in a bedsit on a budget meant neither of them were keen cooks. So my food inheritance was simple Sunday roasts, egg and chips, and the odd treat: chocolate bars, fruit pies and – the favourite – Welsh cakes. Another treat was always a slice of fruit cake, which even as a kid I loved. This bara brith comes from my husband’s mum, Sian, but I’ve taken a few liberties with the recipes to update them with flavours I now love. Recipes to me are like a food tapestry, with new threads being added as the old ones fray.Traditionally, these are made with raisins and a little bit of nutmeg. You could stick to these flavours if you like, but I love them with a hit of citrus, sour cherries and vanilla. They are best eaten warm, and can be heated for a couple of minutes in an oven, pan or even in the toaster.Prep 20 minCook 25 minMakes around 20350g plain flour2 tsp baking powder175g unsalted butter or dairy-free spreadSea salt115g golden caster sugar, plus extra for dusting100g sour cherries1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out, or 1 tsp vanilla bean pasteZest of 1 unwaxed lemonZest of 1 unwaxed lime1 egg, beaten2-3 tbsp milkSift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Use your fingertips to rub in the butter or dairy-free spread until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then mix in the salt, sugar, sour cherries, vanilla and citrus zests. Mix in the beaten egg and two tablespoons of the milk, then bring together with your hands to form a firm dough. If it seems a bit dry, add another tablespoon of milk.Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out the dough to about 1cm thick. Use a 6cm round cutter to stamp out circles, bringing the dough back together and recutting until it has all been used up.Heat a large, heavy frying pan or flat griddle over a low heat (no need to add any oil) and cook the Welsh cakes five at a time. This should give you plenty of room to flip them over and will ensure they cook evenly. Cook for about two to three minutes each side, until deep golden.Cool the cakes on a wire rack, and dust with caster sugar and a little salt. Eat warm on the day you make them, either on their own or with butter and jam.Bara brith translates from Welsh as “speckled bread”, which I find adorable. I use Earl Grey in this recipe, because that’s the tea I like to drink, but you can use whatever black tea you like. If you’re using a less strong tea, such as Earl Grey, brew it using two teabags. Traditionally, raisins, currants and sultanas are used in bara brith, but I like to mix in dates, dried apricots and sour cherries, too. Basically, a mixture of whatever I have.Prep 20 minSoak 1 hrCook 1 hr 30 minMakes 1 x 2lb/900glarge loaf250ml strong, hot tea (I use Earl Grey)450g dried fruit (sultanas, currants, raisins, chopped dates, chopped apricots)1 organic egg, beatenZest of 1 unwaxed lemon200g dark brown sugar1 tsp baking powder200g plain wholemeal flourHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/ gas 4. Make your tea nice and strong, and let it brew for a few minutes longer than you would a cup of tea. Put the dried fruit in a large bowl, pour over the tea and leave it to soak for at least an hour – you can leave it overnight, if you like, but I find an hour is long enough.Mix the egg into the soaked fruit (reserving any remaining soaking liquid for later) and add the lemon zest: if you have soaked the fruit overnight, the liquid should be soaked up, so just add the zest.Mix the sugar, baking powder and flour in a bowl with a whisk to break up any clumps, then mix this into the fruit and eggs. If you haven’t soaked the fruit overnight, add two tablespoons of the reserved liquid and stir through.Grease a 2lb/900g loaf tin and pour in the mix. Bake for 90 minutes: it’s ready when a skewer inserted comes out clean. Eat warm with salted butter."
Kim-Joy's recipe for multicoloured shortbread buttons,"These vanilla-flavoured treats are easy to make, super-cute and ideal as gifts",Kim-Joy,2019-10-16T10:19:34+0100,"These make great gifts if you thread them together and package them up. You could even thread them with sweets. They are easy to make – just take care not to overwork the dough while adding the colours, as this will result in biscuits that are not as melt-in-the-mouth as they should be.Makes: 25-35 buttonsIngredients:200g salted butter85g caster sugar1 tsp vanilla-bean paste270g plain flourYellow, green and pink gel food dyes (or any colours you want)Beat together the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until smooth and fluffy. Add the vanilla-bean paste and beat again to combine.Add the flour and mix until just combined. The dough should be slightly sticky, but soft and easy to handle. Divide into three portions, and stir/knead in the gel dyes until the dough is evenly coloured. Try to work the dough as little as possible – the more you knead it, the tougher it will be.One by one, turn out the coloured doughs on to a well-floured surface and roll out to about 3mm (⅛in) thick. If necessary, wrap the three portions in clingfilm and chill for 10 to 15 minutes, or until firm enough to roll out. Use a small round to stamp out circles (you can use different-sized circles to create buttons of varying sizes, or use other shapes and patterned borders) and transfer to a lined baking tray that fits in the fridge. Use a smaller cutter to indent another circle just within the circumference of each piece of dough. Use a straw (or similar) to stamp out small circles in the centre of each piece.Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas mark 4.Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until just threatening to turn brown at the edges (smaller buttons may need to be taken out of the oven earlier). Transfer gently to a wire rack to finish cooling."
Rachel Roddy’s recipe for Bolognese rice cake,"Torta di riso is something to celebrate – a festive cake, rich with nuts, candied fruits and amaretti biscuits, all drenched in liqueur",Rachel Roddy,2019-10-14T12:00:21+0100,"I went to Bologna in March to visit my friend Francesca and learn how to make tortellini – or rather, to begin to learn. We spent much of our time in her kitchen with her parents, hand-rolling dough, then folding small squares of it into triangles before closing them round our fingertips.The rest of the time was spent walking the city known as la grassa (opulent or fat) and la dotta (learned), tracing some of the 38 kilometres of red-brick porticoes that fringe the buildings. We also visited the university (considered the first in the world), which gives the city one of its nicknames, and Francesca a job in its library. Two medieval towers act as a reassuring central axis, pivotal points around which you move, pulling your eyes up. Then, just when you feel dizzy, shop windows steady you and pull your eyes down. They are filled with things that have earned the city its other nickname: cannon-sized mortadella and salame rosa sliced open to show off just how pink they are, along with great piles of wedges of parmesan cheese. Distracting windows also contain the things I had come to find: wooden trays containing hundreds of taut tortellini the size of a chickpea. There was also the performance of tortellini-making behind glass panes, which Francesca dismissed.My eyes were also tugged by sweets. Most often by a cake called certosino, a heavyweight, densely spiced cake covered with bling in the form of huge slices of glistening candied fruit. Bologna also has jam-filled pinza, flaky-topped chocolate cake the size of a small wheel, and torta di riso, a rice cake with a top the colour of winking creme caramel. Described to me as a sort of rice pudding cake with oomph and candied fruit, the Bolognese confection is also known as torta degli addobbi, which was traditionally made during the festa degli addobbi, a parish festival when people decorated addobbi (windows) with coloured material.Over time, torta di riso has become a celebration cake for Christmas, Easter, Sunday lunches and, in its simplest form, as an everyday treat.Traditionally, the cake tin is buttered and dusted with breadcrumbs, but it can be lined with parchment, too. Adding canditi is divisive: if you don’t like it, don’t do it. Liqueur is also optional, although if you do add it, you should, as the Bolognese say, spruzzare abbondantemente (spray abundantly). Pour a glass on top of the still-warm cake. It drenches it beautifully and ensures it improves even more opulently. Surely we can learn something from that?Recipes vary, especially in the quantity of sugar (I have come across recipes ranging from 100g to 400g) and suggestions of 100g to 300g of rice. Milk varies less: almost every recipe specifying one litre. Having done some Felicity Cloake-style research, I have found 180g arborio rice works well.Let the cake cool before you take it out of the tin: straight from the oven, it is too soft, reminiscent of a pudding. After a few hours it sets firm; overnight, firmer still. Traditionally, it is drenched with liqueur – amaretto or maraschino – straight out of the oven, then cut into rombi (diamonds), which makes the slices look even more jewel-like.It reminds me of an enriched rice pudding (because I am English), which is a limiting comparison when there are versions with varying densities and sweetness all over the world. What all cakes and set puddings have in common, though, is that they change form as they rest, getting denser and richer with time. Dragged back to my roots again, I appreciate the taut, dark golden skin of torta di riso, its crusty edges and the fact that serving it the next day is the best of all.Prep 10 minRest 3 hr+Cook 1 hr 10 minMakes 12 slices1 litre whole milk180g arborio rice200g caster sugarZest of an unwaxed lemon100g ground almonds4 eggs50g amaretti biscuits (optional), crushed50g candied peel or raisins (optional)Butter, for greasingFlour or breadcrumbs, to line the tin100ml maraschino or amaretti liqueur (optional)Put the milk and rice in a pan over a medium-low heat.

Tamal Ray’s recipe for grapefruit Turkish delight,"You can adapt this traditional recipe with other fruit flavours – plus, it’s totally vegan",Tamal Ray,2019-10-12T11:00:22+0100,"As a child, Turkish delight was one of the few foods where my mum and I were at odds. She thought it a delectable treat. I found it an unpalatable hybrid of chewing gum and potpourri. It wasn’t until I tried some authentic lemon, pomegranate and orange gummy jewels at my local Turkish shop that I became a convert. I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that traditional Turkish delight is vegan, the setting agent not being gelatine, as I had assumed, but cornflour.The base recipe here is easily customised with other flavours: clementine, lemon and orange-blossom water is another favourite of mine.Prep 5 minCook 30 minServes 8Cold butter, for greasing80g cornflour400g granulated sugar600ml red grapefruit juice (from about 4 large grapefruit)1 tsp finely grated grapefruit zest3 star anise100g icing sugar, for dustingGrease a piece of tin foil with a little butter and press it into a 20cm square cake tin. Set aside while you get on with the sweets.In a large bowl, mix the cornflour with 80ml water. Leave for a few minutes to allow any lumps to dissolve. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, mix the sugar, grapefruit juice and zest, and star anise. Stir over a gentle heat until the sugar has dissolved. Add the cornflour mix and stir, turning up the heat a little. After a few minutes, the mixture will start to thicken.Remove the star anise, then continue to stir slowly for another 15-20 minutes. The mixture will gradually thicken as you do so. When you think you’ve achieved a thick enough set, drop a small ball of the mixture into a bowl of ice-cold water. If it cools to a firm but still pliable ball, it’s ready. If the ball quickly dissolves, continue to cook and try again with another blob in a few minutes. When it’s ready, pour the mixture into the tin and leave to cool.Once the mix has fully cooled, turn it out of the tin, remove the foil and chop it into cubes. Roll in icing sugar before serving."
Cooking with celtuce: the supermodel of vegetables,"Mild and crisp, celtuce may look like a Dr Seuss illustration, but it tastes darn good",,2019-10-12T20:00:43+0100,"Few chefs I know are surprised by obscure produce. Admittedly, my broad circle of chef friends are highly competent and extremely curious in the study of their craft. Which means, most are always on the hunt for uncommon produce to put on their plates.I love this about my job: dreaming about the seasons ahead, sourcing and planning which seeds to grow, how and where to grow them at the farm.I get to admire them in their process from seed to harvest, then present them, often in the field, to visiting chefs who ooooh and ahhhhh at their beauty as if they were jewels – which to me they are.But one vegetable that confounds chef and layman alike is celtuce. It’s a curious looking vegetable. Is it a radish? Cardoon? Peanut plant? Broccoli stem? Celery? Cucumber? Kohlrabi? Lettuce? Jicama? The guesses come thick and fast. I am always amused by their delight at coming across a vegetable they have never experienced before.Celtuce could’ve been dreamed up by Dr Seuss. To me, it’s the supermodel of vegetables. It has such comically uneven proportions, enviously leggy with lush, carefree, blowsy hair much too large for its body.At full maturity the stems are roughly 20cm long, with a diameter that shouldn’t exceed 5cm. The tops are long and luscious, like you have a cos lettuce on top of a lollipop stem. If it didn’t taste so darn good, I would dismiss it completely.Many Chinese people have grown up eating celtuce. But even then, it is an uncommon menu item in Australian Chinese restaurants. I’m not quite sure why, because it ticks all the boxes. Lactuca sativa var. augustana is an heirloom cultivar of lettuce, and sometimes referred to as asparagus lettuce. Celtuce is thought to have originated in the Mediterranean, before migrating east to China with trade.In Chinese, the stem and leaves are referred by two separate names: wosun and yóumàicài. Used in completely different applications, often the stems are stir-fried quickly and the leaves braised in a broth. I dare say it’s one of the most elegant vegetables going.Over the past few years, I have seen it become more widely available in Asian grocers. If you ever happen to come across celtuce anywhere, I highly recommend you grab a bunch. Be quick, because chef Luke Powell of Bella Brutta and LP’s in Sydney might come along to snatch up the lot! Though he is known for his barbecue and pizza, his vegetable sides are always the stars in my eyes. One of my all-time favourite salads of his is composed of celtuce and apple, cubed and thoughtfully paired with chervil and a soft boiled egg, which sits snugly over sunflower “butter”.Yes, it tastes as deliciously toothsome as it sounds. Even if you aren’t quite sure what it is you are eating.Serves four as side dish, two for a light dinner, or one if you really like salad2 stems of celtuce – Cut off the lettuce’s leafy bit and put aside, peel the outside layer like a carrot, then slice thinly into a bowl of acidulated iced water to stop it from going brown. Using a mandoline for this job is highly recommended. Chop up the leaves into a large mixing bowl.2 large handfuls of celery leaves – which I’m sure you didn’t throw out when you used that bunch of celery. Always pick off the leaves, give them a good wash, then store them wrapped up in some damp paper towels or wax wrapper in the crisper part of your refrigerator, for moments like this when you need salad greens and you don’t have any.1 large or 2 small stone fruits – Or however many you want. I recommend early nectarines or peaches, which will contrast nicely with the crunchiness of the celtuce. Slice them up into sixths and then equatorially again, so you end up with 12 pieces per fruit. You want the fruit to make a presence with every mouthful, otherwise your fellow salad eaters will think you’re stingy with the fruit, and no one wants to be seen as stingy.1 handful of organic walnuts – Toasted in the oven low for seven mins on 140°C, until a lovely brown. Don’t forget about them – there’s nothing worse than bitter nuts in your salad, no matter how amazing the other ingredients are.1/2 Meyer lemon, or any citrus – preferably organic and unwaxed.1 tbsp of white wine vinegar3 tbps of the best-quality olive oil1 tsp sea saltFreshly ground black pepperDrain the celtuce stems and dry as best as you can before you assemble the salad. Into the bowl that is holding the celtuce leaves, add the celtuce stems, roughly torn celery leaves and stone fruit. Zest the citrus, squeeze in the juice, the vinegar, salt, olive oil and, with a gentleness reserved for cuddling babies, toss the salad with your hands.Sprinkle the walnuts and the black pepper liberally. Eat now or later.Curiously, this salad is perhaps even more delicious as a late-night snack, or a refreshing breakfast – do what Luke Powell does and put an egg on it!"
Yotam Ottolenghi’s recipes for butternut squash,"The sweet autumnal favourite roasted with orange and honey, baked in a pie with feta and sage, or fashioned into fritters with a five-spice sugar",Yotam Ottolenghi,2019-10-05T09:30:40+0100,"The sunset colours of autumn are markers of change, and that makes me very happy. There is something dynamic and invigorating about the transitional nature of the season – the idea that you can be in two different places at the same time, looking back fondly at the one and forward in anticipation to the other. I like this change in colour palette to happen on the plate, too, and incorporate all things orange into my meals. Sweet-fleshed butternut is a perennial favourite. This pear-shaped squash is delicate enough to straddle the line between sweet and savoury in the most graceful way, mirroring the change in the air.I love the autumnal combination of squash, orange and hard herbs, and this take on the theme is especially fresh. Blitzing orange zest into olive oil is a quick way to infuse it without having to heat it up or wait very long. The oil is also lovely on salads, roast veg or fruit and yoghurt, so make double if you want and keep in a sealed jar.Prep 15 minInfuse 20-60 minCook 40 minServes 4 as a starter or side1 butternut squash, peeled, cut in half lengthways, deseeded and cut into 1cm-thick half-moons (900g net weight)2 tbsp olive oil¼ tsp ground nutmegSalt and black pepper1½ tbsp runny honey1½ tsp cider vinegar40g pecorino, cut into ¼cm-thick shards1½ tbsp oregano leaves, picked with some stem attached20g pumpkin seeds, toastedFor the orange-infused oil2 oranges45ml olive oilHeat the oven to its highest setting, or 240C fan. For the oil, finely shave strips of zest off the oranges, avoiding any pith, until you have 15g, then roughly chop. Put this in the small bowl of a food processor, add the oil and blitz for a minute, until the peel is finely chopped. Pour into a bowl, leave to infuse for 20 minutes to an hour, then strain through a fine sieve and discard the solids.Peel and segment the oranges over a sieve placed over a bowl, to catch the juice, then set aside the segments and a tablespoon of juice for the dressing.Put the squash, oil, nutmeg, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper in a large bowl, and toss to coat. Divide between two oven trays lined with baking paper – make sure the squash does not overlap – then bake for 20-25 minutes, turning once halfway, until cooked through and nicely browned. Leave to cool to room temperature.Meanwhile, put the honey in a small frying pan on a medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, leave to bubble for two to three minutes, stirring occasionally, until it turns a deep brown caramel, then take off the heat and stir in the orange segments, the reserved tablespoon of juice and the vinegar, and set aside to cool a little.Arrange the squash and pecorino on a platter, overlapping the squash slightly, pour over the burnt honey dressing, and scatter over the oregano and pumpkin seeds. Drizzle over the infused oil, and serve.There’s a bit of waiting involved in this very festive pie, what with the slow caramelisation of the onions and the baking itself. If you want to get ahead, prepare the filling a day ahead, leaving you with a quick assembly job and bake when you want to serve the pie. Serve warm or at room temperature with a side salad. Prep 20 minCook 2 hr 5 minServes 610 sheets filo pastry (ie, a 250g packet)90g unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing30g caster sugar1 tbsp icing sugar, to dustFor the filling60ml olive oil2 onions, peeled, halved and cut into ½cm-thick slices Salt and black pepper5g sage leaves, finely chopped10g parsley, roughly chopped150g feta, roughly crumbled2 tsp lemon zest½ butternut squash, peeled, cut in half, deseeded and then cut into 1½cm-thick half-moons (650g net weight)1 tsp ground cinnamonHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and grease and line the base and sides of a 23cm springform cake tin.Put two tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, turn down the heat to medium, add the onions and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and nicely caramelised – about 40 minutes; don’t be tempted to skimp on the time, because it’s crucial to get the onions to the right point. Off the heat, stir in the herbs, feta, lemon zest, an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper.Meanwhile, line a large oven tray with baking paper, put the butternut squash, cinnamon, remaining two tablespoons of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper on top, then toss with your hands to coat. Bake for 30 minutes, flipping the squash once halfway, or until cooked through and lightly coloured.Turn down the oven to 190C (170C fan)/335F/gas 5. Put the filo sheets under a slightly damp, clean cloth. Take out one sheet, brush it all over with melted butter and sprinkle with half a teaspoon of caster sugar. Transfer to the prepared cake tin, pressing it into the base and letting any excess hang over the sides. Repeat with four more sheets of filo, rotating each one slightly, so the excess pastry hangs out at a different angle each time.Lay the squash in the base of the pie, overlapping them slightly, then top with the onions, pushing them down to compress the filling mixture.Take another sheet of filo, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with half a teaspoon of caster sugar. Roughly scrunch it up like a tissue, then arrange on top of the exposed filling. Repeat with the remaining four sheets of filo, to cover the filling completely, then fold in all the overhang, scrunching it up as you do so.Lift the tin on to an oven tray, then bake for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven, use a tea towel to release the tin, then lift off the outer ring and baking paper (leaving the pie on the base), and return to the oven for 20 minutes more, or until browned and caramelised all over. Remove from the oven, leave to cool for about 15 minutes, then transfer the pie to a plate or board, and dust all over with the icing sugar just before serving.If you’re looking for a pudding that is both gluten-free and vegan, these fritters do the job marvellously. The squash can be swapped for slices of apple or pear, if you prefer, and serve with ice-cream instead of the yoghurt if you want something a little more indulgent.Prep 15 minCook 30 minServes 4, generouslyFor the fritters85g cornflour40g buckwheat flour ⅛ tsp salt140ml sparkling waterAbout 700ml sunflower oil, for deep-frying½ butternut squash (500g), peeled, deseeded and cut into ¼cm-thick half-moonsFor the five-spice sugar50g caster sugar20g desiccated coconut, well-toasted1 tsp Chinese five-spice, plus ¼ tsp extra to serve2 tsp orange zest, plus 1 tsp extra to serveTo serve1 tsp orange zest200g coconut yoghurt ¼ tsp Chinese five-spice2 tbsp maple syrupMix the ingredients for the five-spice sugar in a small bowl and set aside.For the fritters, whisk both the flours and the salt, then gradually whisk in the sparkling water to make a thin batter. Fill a medium saute pan with enough oil for deep-frying (ie, to come 4-5cm up the sides), and put it on a medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot (180C on a probe, if you have one), you’re good to go.Dip a piece of squash in the batter, shake off any excess and fry until lightly coloured and cooked through – around three minutes. Repeat with the remaining squash, frying eight to 10 pieces at a time, so in four or five batches in total. Once cooked, transfer the fritters to a tray lined with kitchen paper and dust liberally with the spiced sugar (you will likely have more sugar than you need, so save any extra for another use such as your morning pancakes or porridge).Stir the orange zest into the yoghurt in a shallow serving bowl, then mix the five-spice into the maple syrup and drizzle this over the yoghurt. Pile up the fritters on to a large plate, sprinkle with the extra five-spice and orange zest, and serve warm with the flavoured yoghurt alongside for dipping."
Anna Jones’s seasonal beetroot recipes,More unusual ways with beetroot to convince the haters: a twist on carrot cake and curried beets,Anna Jones,2019-10-04T12:00:15+0100,"There are foods that polarise: liquorice, dill, blue cheese, brussels sprouts, coriander. Let’s call them Marmite foods. Beetroot is another one. This week, while it is sweet and in season, is the time to cook it (even if it’s on your Marmite list). These recipes use beetroot in a more unusual way. First, a cake pairing it with carrot and pecans for a mellow, textured, just-sweet loaf with a sharp, lemon-and‑orange icing, the other is a beetroot salad loosely based on the flavours of a beetroot thoran, which I serve with yoghurt, and rotis or chapatis for dipping.This is everything I want in a cake: texture and sweetness from the beetroot and carrot, crunch from the pecans and crystallised demerara on top. I often make this without the zesty icing, too.Prep 30 minCook 50 minMakes 1 large loaf cake180ml light olive oil, plus extra for greasing50g demerara sugar80g pecans120g carrots, peeled and grated150g raw beetroot, peeled and grated3 eggs150g golden caster sugar200g spelt flour½ tsp bicarbonate of soda1 ½ tsp baking powder1 pinch salt1 tsp cinnamon1 tsp allspiceZest and juice of 1 lemonZest and juice of 1 orange225g icing sugarHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/350F/gas 6. Grease a 2lb loaf tin, then scatter in a little of the demerara sugar, saving the rest to top the cake. Move the sugar around the tin so its sides are evenly coated. Toast the pecans for five minutes in the oven, then roughly chop.Squeeze out any excess water from the carrots and beetroot, then leave the solids in a colander. With an electric whisk or in a stand mixer, beat the eggs and caster sugar until pale and fluffy. Then, with the whisk still running, pour in the oil until fully combined.Sift all the dry ingredients in another bowl, then, using a spatula or metal spoon, fold this into the egg and sugar mix. Now fold the carrots, beetroot, half the lemon and orange juice and zest, and pecans (leaving a few to top the loaf with) until just combined, being careful not to overmix and knock out the air.Pour into the prepared tin and scatter with a little more demerara sugar and the remaining chopped pecans. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until deep golden brown and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the centre. Leave to cool in the tin.Once the cake is cool, sift the icing sugar into a bowl, then gradually mix in the remaining juice and zest of both the lemon and orange, until smooth and not too thin. Pour the icing on to the middle section of the cake and let it run down the cake.If you are short on time, you could use vacuum-packed cooked beetroot and grate in half a clove of fresh garlic in place of the roasted garlic.Prep 20 minCook 1 hr 5 minServes 4 as a side3 raw beetroot (about 600g)5 garlic cloves, skins on1 tbsp ghee or butter1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp cumin seeds6 curry leaves1 red chilli1 tsp nigella seedsZest and juice of 1 limeSalt and pepperTo serve100g natural yoghurtFlatbreads or chapatiHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/390F/gas 7. Cut the tops off the beetroot, wrap them in tin foil with the whole garlic cloves, put on a roasting tray and bake for 50-60 minutes, depending on size.Unwrap the foil to let them cool slightly, then peel off the garlic skins by rubbing the cloves between sheets of kitchen paper; the skins should easily peel away. If they don’t, they may need a little longer in the oven. Peel and chop the cooled, cooked beetroot into chunks and put in a bowl with the garlic, and mix.In a frying pan on a high heat, melt the ghee or butter. Add the mustard and cumin seeds, curry leaves, red chilli and nigella seeds: they should all crackle with the heat. Fry for one to two minutes, until everything is toasted and crackling nicely, then pour straight on to the beetroot. Squeeze over the lime juice and zest, season well and serve with a dollop of yoghurt and flatbread to soak up the juices."

Hetty McKinnon's whipped hummus with roasted carrots and za’atar oil,"The result of a happy kitchen accident, this fluffy hummus can be served with vegetable crudité, crackers or bread ",Hetty McKinnon,2019-09-27T21:00:48+0100,"Accidents happen, as they say. When these mishaps occur in the kitchen, the results can sometimes be nasty (salty shortbread biscuits anyone?), while at other times those cooking misadventures can be revelatory, and also delicious. This “whipped” hummus is one of my recent kitchen discoveries.It is true that the world has plenty of hummus recipes, but not all are created equal. This one is fluffier than most, with a cloud-like texture, which is both light yet creamy. It is also oil-free.This recipe happened by chance – while making a batch of hummus, I absentmindedly added a whole can of chickpeas – the beans and the liquid – to my blender, along with the regular hummus additions of tahini, garlic and lemon juice. As the mixture blended, I noticed a pillowy, almost-frothy texture forming. I stopped the motor, dipped my finger in and snuck a taste – the hummus was meringue-like and perfect.To be honest, I was a little stunned by the texture and flavour – easily the creamiest, richest hummus I’ve made, no olive oil required. Only then did I realise the secret to this pillowy hummus was actually the chickpea brine that I had distractedly tipped in.Aquafaba is the viscous chickpea cooking water that has long been heralded for its ability to mimic egg whites and creates foam when whipped, giving dishes structure and lift. In this case, aquafaba created fluffy hummus.Serve this whipped hummus in any way you like – with vegetable crudité, crackers, on bread or with roasted carrots and an herbaceous za’atar oil, as I have here.

Autumn recipes from Nigel Slater's new cookbook,"Dishes from the plant-based Greenfeast: Autumn, Winter – gnocchi and peas, orecchiette and cheese, chocolate and cantucci",Nigel Slater,2019-09-16T08:00:48+0100,"Dinner is different in winter. The change starts late on a summer’s evening, when you first notice the soft, familiar scent of distant woodsmoke in the sudden chill of the air. Then, a day or two later, a damp, mushroomy mist hovers over the gardens and parks. Later, you notice the leaves have turned silently from yellow ochre to the walnut hue of tobacco. Autumn is here once again. You may sigh, rejoice or open a bottle. For many, this is the end of their year. For me, this is when it starts, when warmth and bonhomie come to the fore. With the change of weather, supper takes on a more significant role. What I crave now is food that is both cosseting and warming, substantial and deeply satisfying. Food that nourishes but also sets me up for going back out in the cold and wet. And yet, I still find my diet is heavily plant-based with less emphasis on meat. It is simply the way it has progressed over the years and shows little sign of abating.At the start of the longest half of the year, our appetite is pricked by the sudden drop in temperature, and as evenings get longer, we have the opportunity to spend a little more time in the kitchen. To mash beans into buttery clouds. Simmer vegetable stews to serve with bowls of couscous. To bring dishes of sweet potato to melting tenderness in spiced cream. And, of course, the pasta jar comes out again.My cold weather eating is more substantial than the food I eat for the rest of the year. Dinner becomes about one main dish rather than several lighter ones, and the focus shifts towards keeping warm. On returning home I will now happily spend an hour cooking. Maybe a little longer. The oven gets more use at this time of year, the grill and griddle probably less. More food will come to the table in deep casseroles and pie dishes. The temperature of the plates and bowls will change. We want to hold things that warm our hands, a sign of the happiness to come.There will be carbs. They protect and energise us. They bring balm to our jagged nerves. (Winter is nature’s way of making us eat carbohydrates.) Crusts – of pastry, breadcrumbs and crumble – add substance; potatoes fill and satisfy and there is once again a huge sourdough loaf on the table. Rice and noodles are no longer a side dish, and now become the heart and soul of dinner.And, of course, there must be pudding. An early autumn crumble of damsons and almonds. Chocolate puddings (you really must make the ones with dulce de leche). Ginger cake with a cardamom cream and a custard pudding set with cake and apples. There will be nut-encrusted shortbreads with blood orange and baked apples with crisp crumbs and cranberries.I probably eat more puddings during the cold months, but mainly at the weekend. The main course recipes are predominantly for two; the puddings though, are all for four or more. The recipes are made for sharing with friends and family. That said, most of them are rather fine eaten the following day. Especially those little chocolate puddings.Bright flavours for a cold day.Serves 2beetroot 400g, small rawolive oil 1 tbspradishes 8blood oranges 2watercress 100gmint 10 leavesparsley leaves a handfulpumpkin seeds 2 tbspFor the dressingblood-orange juice 2 tbspsherry vinegar 2 tbspSet the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Place a large piece of tin foil in a roasting tin. Wash and trim the beetroot, taking care not to break their skins, and place them in the foil. Add the olive oil, two tablespoons of water and a grinding of salt and pepper, then scrunch the edges of the foil together to seal. Bake the beetroots for 45 minutes to an hour till tender to the point of a knife, then remove and set aside.Slice the radishes in half and put them in a mixing bowl. Slice the peel from the orange flesh, taking care to keep any escaping juice, remove the segments from the membranes, then add the segments to the radishes. Peel the beetroot and cut each one in half, then into quarters, and add them to the mixing bowl.Wash and trim the watercress. (I like to dunk it in a bowl of iced water for 20 minutes to crisp it up.) Put the mint and parsley leaves in with the orange and beetroot together with the trimmed watercress and the pumpkin seeds.Make the dressing: put the blood-orange juice in a small bowl, add the sherry vinegar, season with salt and pepper then pour over the salad and toss gently.The reassurance of pasta. The soothing notes of cheese and cauliflower.Serves 2parmesan 200gcauliflower 1 medium butter 30golive oil 3 tbsporecchiette 200gdouble cream 250mldill fronds 10gPut a deep pan of water on to boil and salt it generously. Finely grate the parmesan. Cut the cauliflower florets from the main stalk.Warm the butter and oil together in a shallow pan, then fry the cauliflower florets for five minutes or so until lightly crisp and golden. Put the orecchiette into the boiling water and cook for about nine minutes or until tender.Pour the cream into the cauliflower, add the grated parmesan and lower the heat. Drain the pasta and add it to the cauliflower and cream. Season with black pepper. Chop the dill fronds, stir into the pasta and serve.• Broccoli, brussels tops, brussels sprouts and kale are all perfectly acceptable in place of the cauliflower. The pasta is interchangeable too, but it’s worth choosing one that will hold a little puddle of sauce, such as casarecce, anelli, cavatelli or ditalini. I suggest you avoid the larger varieties of penne, which is rather like eating pieces of rubber tubing.Hot stock, green peas and the allure of dumplings.Serves 2gnocchi 400gvegetable stock 500mlfrozen peas 350gegg yolks 2parmesan 4 tbsp, gratedBring a deep pan of water to the boil and salt it generously. Add the gnocchi and let them cook for three or four minutes, until they come to the surface, or follow the instructions on the packet. Bring the stock to the boil and add the peas.Remove the gnocchi with a draining spoon and divide between two bowls. Ladle over the stock and peas, then separate the eggs and lower a yolk into each bowl. Sprinkle two tablespoons of grated parmesan over each serving. Stir the yolk into the stock and peas as you eat, making an impromptu sauce.“Toast-rack” potatoes, spicy tomato sauce.Serves 3potatoes 6 largeolive oil 6 tbsptomatoes 800ggarlic 6 clovesfresh horseradish 6 tbsp, gratedSet the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Place the potatoes flat on a chopping board, then slice them at ½cm intervals, cutting almost through to the wood. It becomes immediately obvious why they are sometimes called toast-rack potatoes.Place the potatoes in a roasting tin, trickle with some of the olive oil and roast for about 45 minutes till crisp and golden. Meanwhile, put the tomatoes and unpeeled garlic cloves in a small roasting tin with the remaining olive oil, grind over a little salt and black pepper, then place in the oven. Roast the tomatoes for about 35 to 40 minutes, until they are soft and lightly browned.Remove the tomatoes and garlic from the oven. Pop the garlic from its skin and add the flesh to the tomatoes. Crush the tomatoes and garlic with a fork, stirring in the fresh horseradish as you go. When the potatoes are crisp and golden, remove them from the oven and serve with spoonfuls of the crushed tomato.• Some people find it easier to “hasselback” the potatoes by placing each one in the hollow of a wooden spoon and slicing downwards, thus avoiding cutting through to the chopping board. It’s a good trick.A soup to soothe the soul.Serves 4celeriac 1kgvegetable stock 400mlmilk 600mlchives 25golive oil 125mlhorseradish root 15g, grated pumpernickel or other rye bread 100gPeel and roughly chop the celeriac, then place in a deep pan with the stock and milk and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.While the soup is simmering, chop the chives and put them in a blender with the olive oil. Blitz to a bright green dressing.Puree the celeriac mixture, in two or three batches, using a blender. If you have a stick blender, process it directly in the pan. Stir the horseradish into the soup and check the seasoning. Crumble the pumpernickel and toast briefly in a dry, shallow pan till lightly crisp.Ladle the soup into bowls, pour in the chive oil and scatter over the pumpernickel.• Celeriac is one of the more unsung vegetables, but has plenty going for it. I like it shredded and stirred into a mustardy mayonnaise, but also coarsely grated and fried in olive oil and butter until golden and sizzling and served with a spritz of lemon.The smoky flavours of mushrooms and greens.Serves 2dried mushrooms 25ggreens, such as cavolo nero 200gpecorino 200gfregola 200gbutter 25gBring 1 litre of water to the boil, add the dried mushrooms, remove from the heat and cover with a lid. Set aside for 15 minutes to infuse.Wash and finely shred the cavolo nero. Finely grate the pecorino. Bring the mushroom stock back to the boil, add the fregola and cook for 12 to 15 minutes until tender but not soft. The pasta should still have a slight chewy quality. Drain the fregola and mushrooms.Melt the butter in a frying pan and add the shredded greens, frying them for a minute or two till they start to brighten and wilt. Fold in the drained pasta and mushrooms, then the grated pecorino. Pile into shallow dishes.• Fregola is easy to find in Italian food stores. I like to look out for the Sardinian toasted variety, which has a pleasing nutty flavour.• In place of cavolo nero, you could use crinkly-leaved savoy cabbage or young kale.• The quantity of pecorino sounds alarming, but it is there to bring the whole dish together and offer a luxurious contrast to the otherwise humble ingredients.The humble sweetness of baked rice. The syrupy luxury of fig jam.Serves 4green cardamom pods 6milk 1 litrebay leaves 2vanilla pod 1butter 30gpudding rice (short-grain) 80gcaster sugar 3–4 tbspfig jam/preserve 8 tbspSet the oven at 140C/gas mark 1.Crack the green cardamoms, extract the tiny brown-black seeds, then crush them to a powder. A pestle and mortar will work if you don’t have a spice mill. Pour the milk into a saucepan. Add the ground cardamom seeds, bay leaves, vanilla pod and butter, and bring to the boil.Put the pudding rice and caster sugar in a baking dish, then, as soon as the milk boils (watch carefully), pour the hot milk over the rice and stir till the sugar has dissolved.Slide the dish into the preheated oven and bake for two hours until the rice is soft and creamy and the skin is pale gold. Serve with spoonfuls of soft fig jam.• No effort involved here. Just a little patience.• If fig jam proves tricky to track down, slice six small fresh figs in half and put them in a saucepan with four tablespoons each of granulated or caster sugar and water. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer till the sugar and water have turned to a syrup and the figs are soft and on the point of collapse.Fragile crust. Oozing chocolate.Serves 2dark chocolate 100gdulce de leche 2 tbspeggs 2caster sugar 100gcantucci to serveSet the oven at 160C/gas mark 3. Break the chocolate into small pieces and leave to melt, without stirring, in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of simmering water. As the chocolate melts, gently stir in the dulce de leche and turn off the heat.Break the eggs into a large bowl, add the sugar and beat until thick and fluffy. A food mixer with a whisk attachment will give the best results. Stir the chocolate and dulce de leche into the mixture. You need only two three or three stirs to incorporate it. Any more and you might over-mix it.Transfer to two ramekins, using a rubber spatula. Put the ramekins into a roasting tin or baking dish. Pour enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins, then bake for 20 minutes until the surface is lightly crisp and the inside thick and creamy. Serve with a teaspoon and, if you wish, cantucci biscuits.• A soft crust appears on these puddings as you bake them, while the inside stays rich and fondant-like. It will stay like that for an hour or two, should you wish to make them a little ahead of time.• Heatproof china ramekins are ideal for these, but you can bake them in ovenproof cups too, or even metal thali dishes.• I have baked these chocolate puddings and eaten them the following day, when they are like thick, fudgy chocolate mousses.Greenfeast: Autumn, Winter by Nigel Slater (Fourth Estate, £22).

Nigel Slater’s roast vegetables recipes,A tray of courgettes and one of peppers opens my new oven’s innings,Nigel Slater,2019-09-15T05:10:15+0100,"There was much excitement in the kitchen this week with the arrival of a new oven. Mine had been running a little hot, took forever to heat up and the light inside hadn’t been working for a decade. It was one of two, the second being a much newer and more efficient affair, and being more accurate is the one in which we test recipes. The original had done 20 years’ service and was due to go wherever it is that old ovens go to die. Dismantled for parts apparently. It must have carried a donor card. My oven had quite a life, seeing me through hundreds of weekly columns, half a dozen books and a score of currant-freckled Christmas cakes. Sometimes, especially when I was writing a book, it seemed it was never off. Well, goodnight old thing. Sweet dreams.A new oven, especially one where the cook can once again see through the glass door, is the very best sort of present. There is nothing cheffy or flash about this one, but it is a relief to find the door will actually stay open while I retrieve the baked potatoes, so there will be fewer scars on my left arm, and the meat thermometer is now integrated so an alarm – which, so far, has proved itself to be spot on – tells me when my Sunday roast is ready.Much good comes from being brave with the peppers. Let their skins turn black in spotsMy new piece of kit was christened with two perfectly seasonal dinners of peppers and courgettes. The peppers were roasted until their skins puffed and blackened, their flesh rendered soft and sweet. Half a dozen courgettes, the plump round variety, were toasted until translucent then served with a deeply autumnal sauce of roast tomatoes and fennel. We ate the peppers with green wheat speckled with chopped mint and salted ricotta; the courgettes came with thick triangles of rosemary-spiked focaccia.I imagine a cook remembers their ovens in much the same way a driver remembers the cars they have owned. But shiny modern kitchen kit is hardly in the classic car league and I doubt is capable of holding memories and stories in the way, say, an old Aga does. That said, good things have come from this one already, and, perhaps as a sign of things to come, is already battle scarred from a tray of ribs whose mustard and maple-syrup glaze bubbled over and left its signature indelibly on the bottom – of which more another time.Much good will come from being brave with the peppers, letting their skins turn black in patches. It will add a smoky quality and ensure the flesh is truly soft and the roasting juices sweet and caramel coloured. Freekeh, toasted green wheat, has its own smoky character, too, lending an altogether autumn note.Serves 4red or orange peppers 5light vegetable stock 1 litrefreekeh 150gcoriander leaves 10gmint leaves 20gparsley 10gsalted ricotta 40g or to tasteSet the oven at 220C/gas mark 8. Slice the peppers in half lengthways then pull out and discard their stalks and seeds. Place the peppers cut-side down in a large roasting tin, place in the preheated oven and roast for 20-30 minutes, until the skins have darkened.Bring the vegetable stock to the boil in a medium-sized saucepan. Rinse the freekeh in a sieve under cold running water then tip into the boiling stock, lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.Finely chop the coriander, mint and parsley and put them in a mixing bowl. When the peppers are tender, remove from the oven, transfer to a bowl, cover with a plate and leave for 15 minutes.Peel the skins from the peppers, saving any juice that collects in the bowl, then place them on a serving dish. Drain the freekeh, tip into the chopped herbs and season with black pepper and any reserved pepper juices. Coarsely grate or crumble the salted ricotta into the freekeh and check the seasoning.Spoon the freekeh on top of the peppers, finishing with a little more ricotta if you wish.I used the rondo de Nice variety of late-summer squash, because they were irresistible, but any courgette will do. Slice the long ones lengthways and baste them as they roast.Serves 4plum tomatoes 1.5kg, largefennel 2 bulbsonion 1, largerosemary 6 sprigsgarlic a whole headolive oil 8 tbsp, plus a little extracourgettes or round summer squash 8Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Cut the tomatoes in half lengthways and place them in a large roasting tin. Cut the fennel bulbs in half lengthways then into strips about 2cm thick, then add them to the tomatoes.Peel and slice the onion into thick rings and add to the tomatoes. Pull the needles from the rosemary twigs and add them, too. Tuck the head of garlic, whole and unpeeled, among the tomatoes. Pour 8 tbsp of olive oil over, season with salt and black pepper and tumble everything together so the vegetables and aromatics are coated, then place in the oven.Cut the courgettes in half, toss with salt, pepper and enough olive oil to moisten them then place, cut-side down, in a second roasting tin. Put them in the oven and leave for an hour or so, until they are soft, translucent and nicely toasted. An occasional baste will be beneficial.Remove the tomatoes from the oven. Break the garlic head into cloves, then squeeze each one to extract the toasted flesh. Stir the garlic among the tomatoes and fennel then process to a thick sauce using a blender or food processor.Return the sauce to the tin and heat thoroughly over a moderate heat. Check the seasoning then ladle into a serving dish. Place the roasted courgettes amongst the sauce and serve. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater"
Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for peanut butter blondies,The ultimate fuss-free sweet treat with the added bonus of chocolate and raspberry jam,Meera Sodha,2019-10-12T10:00:21+0100,"Like cranberry woo woos or a game of Twister, blondies know how to get a party started. They’re the ultimate fuss-free, please-all, bung-it-in-the-oven treat. The batter should, in my opinion, be treated as merely a vehicle in which you can add whatever brings you joy. I have gone full American girl scout with mine, adding peanut butter, jam and a little chocolate, because the combination just works, but you could add whatever floats your (blondie) boat.Prep 10 minCook 1 hrMakes 164 ½ tbsp milled chia seeds160g flavourless coconut oil2 tsp vanilla extract 300g caster sugar 200g plain flour1 tsp baking powder2 big pinches flaky sea salt 150g vegan dark chocolate, roughly chopped75g smooth peanut butter75g raspberry jamLine a 20cm square tin with baking paper, and heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.In a small bowl, mix the chia seeds with 275ml water and set aside to soak. Put the coconut oil in a small pan set over a low heat, until melted, leave to cool a little, then stir in the vanilla extract.In a large bowl, mix the sugar, flour, baking powder, salt and chocolate until well combined. Add the bloomed chia seeds and cooled coconut oil, stir well until everything is combined, then blob the batter into the lined tin. Drop teaspoons of peanut butter and jam all over the surface, then swirl them into the batter with a skewer or cocktail stick.Bake for 40 minutes, until the blondies have a crisp top and just the faintest hint of a wobble. Leave to cool completely before slicing and eating, ideally with a cuppa."
Turn stale cake into a seasonal trifle – recipe,"Take some leftover cake, add sherry, apples and blackberries, top with custard, whipped cream and walnuts - et voila!",Tom Hunt,2019-10-12T06:00:14+0100,"Normally, a cake doesn’t last five minutes in my house, but every now again, for some reason or other – post-party, or after many recipe tests – we find ourselves with more cake than we fancy eating. Rather than let it go to waste, I’ve collected a few go-to recipes that will upcycle old cake into a dessert that’s even more special than its former glory.My recipe of choice is a classic trifle with a seasonal twist, which will soften even the stalest of cakes. The old cake is drizzled with sherry (or whatever tipple you fancy or have available), before being topped with fruit, custard and cream, and left in the fridge to set. Sometimes, I make a less sweet version, using yoghurt, for breakfast the next day. Other ways to use up stale cake are to add it in chunks to a chocolatey refrigerator cake or to mash it with rum to make truffles.Cake keeps best out of the fridge and in an airtight container, where it’ll last up to a week. If you need to keep it longer, wrap it in a bag and freeze, ideally before frosting.Trifle is a British dessert that is retro and trashy, but always delicious. If you have leftover cake of any kind, from brownie to a simple sponge, this is a quick and easy way to convert it into a scrumptious dessert. Be inventive with whatever ingredients you have available – swap yoghurt for the custard, say, or just use cream and sweeten with seasonal fruit.1 large unsprayed, organic apple150g blackberries (fresh or frozen, or other seasonal berry)100g leftover or stale cake50ml brandy – or sherry, calvados, or whatever takes your fancy2 tbsp blackberry jam (or other jam)200ml custard150ml double cream, gently whipped25g chopped walnuts (or other nut of choice), to garnishChop the apple into small cubes and put it in a saucepan for which you have a lid. Cover, and heat over a low-medium flame, stirring occasionally, until the apple breaks down into a thick sauce. Stir in the fresh or frozen blackberries and leave to cool. Meanwhile, tear the leftover cake into rough pieces, and toss with a spirit and jam. Spoon into four glasses, top each portion with a quarter of the apple mix, followed by 50ml custard. Top each serving with a spoon of gently whipped cream, finish with a sprinkling of walnuts, and refrigerate until needed."
Liam Charles’ recipe for poached pear and pecan cakes,"With the nights drawing in, we turn to comfort food. Cue poached fruits and mini bakes…",Liam Charles,2019-10-05T11:00:44+0100,"As jacket weather arrives, we look for more hearty, comforting food from breakfast all the way through to dessert. These individual mini pecan cakes served with a poached pear are the perfect example: simple, comforting and tasty. Can’t complain.If you don’t have any small tins, bake the cake in a 28 x 35cm baking tray. When the pears are poached, slice them into thin pieces and scatter over the sponge. Whip the cream to soft peaks and serve alongside the cake.Prep 40 minCook 1 hrServes 4For the cake4 eggs250ml vegetable oil300g pumpkin puree250g self-raising flour2 tsp ground mixed spice1 tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp grated nutmeg1 tsp bicarbonate of soda250g light muscovado sugar100g pecans, chopped100g raisinsFor the pears600g golden caster sugar 1 cinnamon stick 4 strips lemon peel 3 cloves1 vanilla pod, split lengthways 2-3cm fresh ginger, peeled and sliced 4 ripe pears, peeledFor the cream 200ml double cream2 tbsp maple syrup1 tsp vanilla extractHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease and line four deep, 10cm round cake tins with baking paper.Whisk the eggs in a large bowl, add the vegetable oil, whisk, then add the pumpkin puree and whisk again. Sift the flour, spices and bicarbonate of soda into a separate bowl, add the sugar and stir.Add the dry mix to the wet, whisk until incorporated, then fold in the nuts and raisins. Divide the mix between the tins and bake for 30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool. Once cooled, flip them out and set aside.For the poached pears, put all the ingredients apart from the pears in a pan just big enough to hold the pears upright. Half fill the pan with water, bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse. Drop the pears into the pan, cover and gently poach for 20 minutes, or until soft. Turn off the heat and set aside – don’t discard the syrupy water.Mix the cream, maple syrup, vanilla and three tablespoons of the syrupy water in a bowl, then put in the fridge until ready to use.To assemble the cakes, use a cookie cutter to make a 1.5cm-deep circular hole in the centre of each cake, then, with a spoon, remove enough cake for a pear to sit comfortably and proudly. Put each cake on a serving plate, carefully put a pear in the centre hole of each one, then pour the cream over the top and serve."
Thomasina Miers’ recipe for jerusalem artichoke soup,"Simple to make and luxurious to eat, this soup is even more elegant with salsa verde",Thomasina Miers,2019-10-14T12:00:20+0100,"As the nights get fresher, this lightly dressed soup becomes as comforting as pulling on a favourite old jumper. It is inexpensive and simple to make, but so luxurious to eat, as you drink in all that goodness and taste. It also has that chameleon quality I love: a single soup can be rustic, elegant, simple or chi-chi, depending on how you blend it and dress it. No matter how humble your ingredients, the end result can shine.You can use parsnips instead of artichokes – the result is equally delicious.Prep 25 minCook 50 minServes 4-6600g jerusalem artichokes300g potatoes1 large knob butter160ml extra-virgin olive oil2 medium onions, peeled and choppedSalt and black pepper1 large handful fresh thyme, leaves picked1.2 litres vegetable or chicken stockFor the salsa verde50g hazelnuts1 large handful each fresh parsley and mint, roughly chopped1 large garlic clove, peeled2 tbsp capers4 anchovy fillets (optional)2 tbsp red-wine vinegarScrub the jerusalem artichokes clean in cold water with a wire brush and cut into even chunks. Peel the potatoes and cut into similar-sized chunks. Leave to stand in a bowl of cold water.Put a large casserole over a medium-high heat and add the butter and two tablespoons of the olive oil. Once hot, add the onions, season with a heaped teaspoon of flaky salt (or half if using fine salt) and a few grindings of black pepper. Turn the heat down to medium and sweat the onions for 10-15 minutes, turning the heat down if they start colouring. Drain the artichokes and potatoes. Add them and the thyme to the onions, and cook for a further five minutes, stirring once or twice to coat them in the fat. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and leave for 25-30 minutes, covered, until the vegetables are collapsing.While the soup is simmering, make the salsa verde. Using a pestle and mortar, or a stick blender if you’re in a hurry, bash together the nuts, herbs, garlic, capers and anchovies, if using. Once you have a rough paste, add the vinegar, bash again until you have a smoother paste, then work in the remaining olive oil. Taste for seasoning.Blitz the soup with a stick blender until completely smooth. If it’s too thick, add a little water or milk. Taste: it might need more salt, but keep in mind that the salsa verde will season the soup, too. Serve in hot bowls with large dollops of salsa verde on top.Drizzle leftover salsa on to a midweek salad, or use to season lamb chops, a cheesy baked potato or fried skirt steaks."

Blitz the fish to a puree, then, with the motor running, slowly add the warm oil and reserved milk. Once mixed, add the parsley and potatoes, and blitz for 30 seconds. Add most of the lemon juice and a good grind of pepper, then scrape into a bowl. Season to taste, and add more lemon juice if need be.Toast the bread. Lift some shallots out of the liquor, toss with the sliced parsley and arrange on four plates.

Nigel Slater’s hake with pea salsa recipe,Fried fish with a delicious and piquant herb-rich pea purée,Nigel Slater,2019-10-01T12:00:40+0100,"Put a medium-sized pan of water on to boil. Salt it lightly then, as it comes to the boil, add 300g of frozen peas and cook for 3 minutes. Get a bowl of ice and water. Drain the peas and plunge immediately into the iced water.Remove the stems from 20g of parsley and drop the leaves into a blender. Do the same with 20g of coriander then add them, with 20 mint leaves, to the parsley. Pour in 75ml of olive oil and 25ml of white-wine vinegar. Drain the peas and tip into the blender then process to a rough, vivid green paste.Trim and lightly season 2 pieces of hake fillet weighing approximately 250g each. Warm 45g of butter and 2 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan that doesn’t stick, then slide in the fish and cook for 3 or 4 minutes on each side until pearlescent and tinged with gold. Serve the fish immediately with the pea salsa. Enough for 2.Monitor the consistency of the pea purée carefully, adding more olive oil and white-wine vinegar as you wish. The texture should be somewhere between dressing and sauce. You may prefer it thicker, like a mash, in which case you should go carefully with the quantity of olive oil.Use frozen broad beans in place of the peas, cooking them in boiling water for 4 or 5 minutes, then popping them out of their skins before adding them to the processor. Keep the texture of the sauce rough by crushing it with a potato masher instead of turning it into a smooth purée."
How to make chicken soup – recipe,Forget the chilled soups and consommés of high summer; it’s time to appreciate the heartier sort now that soup season proper is with us again,Felicity Cloake,2019-10-09T12:00:15+0100,"I’m glad to say that soup season is upon us once again, and by that I mean proper soup, rather than the deliciously cooling liquid salads of summer – the sort that warms every cockle from the inside out. And you don’t get much more toasty than the classic chicken variety: simple, yet unfeasibly sustaining, and as clean and light as it is satisfying. No freezer should be without it.Prep 10 minCook 2½ hrServes 61kg chicken wings or drumsticks (or a mixture), plus a leftover chicken carcass, if you happen to have one2 sticks celery2 onions3 leeks3 carrots1 small bunch parsley, separated into stalks and leaves750ml chicken stock175g pearl barleySalt and pepperPut the chicken in a large stock pot – I prefer wings and drumsticks, because they yield a lot of bang per buck flavourwise, but you could use a whole bird and add some of the meat to the broth at the end (save the rest of the cooked meat for another meal). This is also a good place to stick a roast chicken carcass, to give your soup a bit of extra oomph.Add enough cold water to the pot to cover the chicken entirely, then bring slowly to a boil. Skim off any froth that rises to the top – this is important, because it will taint the flavour of the finished soup, so don’t be tempted to move on until you’ve removed and discarded as much as possible.While the broth is simmering, wash and roughly chop the celery, onions, and two each of the leeks and carrots – there’s no need to peel the onions or carrots unless they’re dirty, or to be too precise with the chopping, because they’re all going to be strained out once they’ve given up their flavour, but do make sure there isn’t any mud lurking in the folds of the leek.Add the chopped veg to the skimmed pot with the parsley stalks and stock, then simmer for about two hours, stirring occasionally to make sure the aromatics are evenly distributed. Meanwhile, cook the barley in a pan of boiling water for 20-25 minutes, until tender, then drain. Peel the last carrot, and finely chop it and the remaining leek.Strain the soup through a fine sieve and return the broth to the pot. Pick the meat off the chicken bones – bear in mind that if you’re using wings and drumsticks, it will be rather tough, but it should still be pretty tasty – and add that to the pot. Discard the bones and everything in the sieve. Bring the soup back to a simmer, then add the chopped carrot and leek.Cook for about 10 minutes more, until the vegetables are done to your liking, then stir in the cooked barley. While that’s heating through, season the broth to taste. Divide it between bowls, then roughly chop the parsley leaves and scatter these on top before serving.If you prefer dumplings to barley, instead of pre-cooking that in Step 4, mix 100g plain flour with a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of baking powder, 50g suet or grated butter and just enough cold water to make a dough. Roll into six dumplings, then add to the strained soup and cook for 15 minutes before adding the second batch of vegetables.To give the soup Asian notes, replace the parsley with coriander, and add a slit Thai chilli, a few slices of fresh ginger and a star anise when you put in the first batch of veg. Replace the barley with a block of rice noodles – just soften them in the hot strained soup – and top with chopped chilli, coriander and a wedge of lime.For traditional cream of chicken soup, whisk 100ml double cream and an egg yolk in a small bowl. Once the soup is ready, take it off the heat and quickly beat in the cream mix. Check the seasoning again – I like a grating of nutmeg. You can top the soup with a sprinkling of chopped chives or tarragon leaves (in which case, use the stalks in Step 4) rather than parsley."
Yotam Ottolenghi’s German-inspired recipes,"Throw your own Oktoberfest with these autumnal recipes of schupfnudeln with browned butter, flammkuchen with speck and leeks, and a side of spicy sauerkraut",Yotam Ottolenghi,2019-09-28T09:30:05+0100,"There are two reasons today’s recipes are German-inspired: the three-week Oktoberfest that’s taking place right now, which celebrates companionship, cheer and silly amounts of beer (all very good causes, in my book), and a recent trip to Alsace, which reminded me of the region’s conviviality and its hearty food – rooted in German traditions and the perfect antidote to the short days ahead. Although I’ve played around quite a bit with tradition here, all three recipes aim to have the same radiant effect: they’re festive, filling and fun.This is my take on a German flatbread that’s typically topped with sour cream, bacon and onion. If you want to get ahead, make the dough and leave to prove overnight in the fridge.Prep 10 minProve 2 hrs-plusCook 1 hr 15 minServes 4 as a main or 8 as a snackFor the dough500g strong white bread flour1¼ tsp salt2 tsp fast-action dried yeast (ie, 1 sachet, or 7g)320ml lukewarm water1½ tbsp olive oil, plus extra to greaseFor the topping750g leeks, cleaned, trimmed, green parts discarded, then cut into 1½cm-thick rounds90ml olive oilSalt and black pepper280g creme fraiche140g speck (about 16 slices), cut in half widthways 10g chives, cut into 1cm lengthsPut all the dough ingredients in a freestanding mixer with the dough hook in place. Mix on medium-high speed for 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, then transfer to a lightly oiled bowl (the dough will be quite sticky) and cover with a slightly damp tea towel. Leave to sit in a warm place for two to three hours, or until doubled in size.Meanwhile, prepare the topping. Put a well-greased griddle pan on a high heat. Toss the leek rounds with four tablespoons of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Once the pan is smoking hot, grill the leeks in about three batches for four to five minutes, flipping them once halfway, until deeply charred and softened. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining leeks. Don’t worry if the rounds come apart a little – grill the loose strands until they’re just charred and add them to the plate.In a small bowl, mix the creme fraiche with a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper.Heat the oven to its highest setting. Divide the dough into four equal pieces of about 210g each, and roll each one into a ball. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to sit for another 20 minutes.Put two large trays in the oven to heat up. Cut out four 35cm squares of greaseproof paper. Use a well-floured rolling pin to roll out each ball on to a piece of paper into a very thin round (it won’t be perfectly round) about 28cm in diameter. Spread all over with the creme fraiche mixture and top with the leek rounds (and any strands) and speck, scrunching up the speck a little. Drizzle a teaspoon and a half of oil over each flatbread. Carefully transfer two of the flatbreads, with their paper bases, on to the preheated trays and bake for 10-12 minutes, until browned and cooked through, then lift and slide on to a large board, discarding the paper. Repeat with the remaining two flatbreads.To serve, sprinkle the chives over the top and cut each flatbread into four or eight pieces. Divide between four plates, or serve directly off the board or a large platter.This German version of gnocchi is made in much the same way as its Italian counterpart. If you don’t make the spiced turmeric cabbage (see next recipe), sauerkraut, be it homemade or shop-bought, is just as good an accompaniment. Schupfnudeln can also be served as dessert, sprinkled with some cinnamon suga.Prep 5 minCook 1 hr 45 minServes 41.2kg maris piper potatoes, scrubbed clean3 egg yolks, beaten100g plain flour, sifted, plus extra for rolling⅓ tsp ground nutmegSalt and black pepper2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling100g unsalted butter1½ tsp poppy seedsHeat the oven to 250C (230C fan)/ gas 9+. Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, about 10 times each. Put them directlyon the middle rack of the oven and bake for 45 minutes, or until cooked through. While they’re still hot, halve the potatoes and scoop out the flesh; save the skins for another use.Pass the potato flesh through a ricer directly on to a clean work surface, and spread out the mash slightly. Evenly drizzle over the egg yolks, then sprinkle on the flour, nutmeg, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper, and use your hands to bring the dough together; do not knead or overmix.Divide the dough into four equal pieces and then, on a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a long cylinder about 25cm long. Cut into 12 even pieces of 15-20g each, then roll each piece of dough into a roughly finger-length torpedo shape. Transfer to a lightly floured tray lined with greaseproof paper, and repeat with the remaining potato mix.Bring a large saucepan of very well-salted water to a boil. Add the potato dumplings in batches, about four in total, cooking each batch on a for about 90 seconds, or until they float to the surface. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked dumplings to a colander to drain, then transfer to an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and drizzle lightly with a little oil (so they don’t stick).Meanwhile, put the butter in a small saucepan on a medium heat, cook for 10-12 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally, until nutty and browned. Remove from the heat and stir in the poppy seeds and a quarter-teaspoon of salt.Put a teaspoon and a half of oil in a large, nonstick saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add a quarter of the dumplings and fry, flipping as required, for four to five minutes, until well browned all over. Transfer to a large plate while you repeat with the rest of the dumplings, adding a fresh teaspoon and a half of oil each time.Wipe out the saute pan and put it on a medium heat. Return the dumplings to the pan, pour over the browned butter and warm through for a couple of minutes. Divide the schupfnudeln between four plates and serve.This quick version of sauerkraut skips the standard two-week fermentation process by lightly cooking the cabbage in vinegar first. Keep it in the fridge for up to 10 days, and serve with schupfnudeln (see previous recipe, for example), or on any occasion that calls for a pickle or a sharp salad. Prep 15 minCook 25 minServes 4 as a side2 tbsp olive oil1 head white cabbage (1kg), core removed and thinly shredded about ¼cm-thick pieces 30g fresh turmeric, peeled and thinly sliced into rounds (or ½ tsp ground turmeric powder)1¾ tsp salt100ml apple cider vinegar1½ tsp caster sugar2 tsp coriander seeds, toasted2 tsp cumin seeds, toasted10g dill leavesOn a medium-high heat, warm the oil in a large saute pan for which you have a lid. Once hot, add the cabbage, turmeric and a teaspoon and salt, stir to combine, then cover the pot with a lid and cook for 10 minutes, stirring only twice, until the cabbage wilts but doesn’t take on any colour. Remove the lid, add the vinegar, sugar, seeds and two tablespoons of water, and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for another eight minutes, or until the liquid evaporates and the cabbage is tender but still has some bite. Set aside to cool completely, then refrigerate until ready to serve. Stir through the dill leaves just before serving."
Four Venetian recipes from Polpo,"Recreate a classic Venetian ristorante at home with recipes for spaghetti with onions, fennel and orange salad, tomato and oregano bruschetta, and steak with mushrooms",Russell Norman,2019-09-14T07:01:42+0100,"Prep 10 minCook 30 minServes 46 large white onions2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil200ml chicken stockFlaky sea salt and black pepper350g dried spaghetti1 large knob butter1 handful flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped100g grated parmesanPeel the onions and, using a very sharp knife, slice into 5mm-thick rings. Heat the oil in a large frying pan on a medium-low heat, add the onions and slowly saute for 12-15 minutes, stirring frequently so they don’t burn: they should take on a glossy, translucent appearance with a hint of golden-brown here and there.Add the stock and cook for 10 minutes more: if the stock bubbles too fiercely, reduce the heat.Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions. When al dente, drain the pasta and add it to the frying pan. Mix well over a gentle heat, adding the butter, a generous pinch of salt and pepper, the parsley and most of the parmesan.Take off the heat, mix again, and serve on warm plates with the remaining parmesan scattered on top.Prep 20 minServes 41 large fennel bulb2 navel oranges, or blood oranges when in season1 small red onion, peeled1 large handful kalamata olivesExtra-virgin olive oilFlaky sea salt1 small handful mint leavesCut the fennel in half lengthways, and remove and discard the core. Cut off a few of the feathery fronds and set them aside. Using a mandoline or an extremely sharp knife, slice the fennel very thinly.Peel the oranges and separate the segments, setting two segments aside. Using a sharp, serrated knife, remove the pith and the membrane from the others.Slice the onion as thinly as possible, and remove the stones from the olives by squeezing them between thumb and index finger – it doesn’t matter if they get squashed in the process.Put the orange, fennel, olives and onion into a large bowl, and add a generous glug of olive oil and a good crunch of salt. Sacrifice the two reserved orange segments by squeezing their juice into the bowl and discarding them. Turn once or twice, add the mint leaves, turn once more and divide equally between four pretty plates, garnishing each plate with the reserved fronds.Prep 10 minRest 15 minCook 5 minServes 4600g ripe tomatoesFlaky sea salt and black pepper1 handful plump, fresh oregano leaves, stalks removedExtra-virgin olive oil4 slices sourdough, 3cm thick1 garlic clove, peeled and halvedGive yourself plenty of space, with a large chopping board and a very sharp or serrated knife. Make sure the tomatoes are at room temperature – this is of critical importance. Carefully cut them into pieces about the size of small dice: shape isn’t important but creating as much surface area as possible is key. Discard the stalky bits from the crown, but keep the seeds and juice, of which there should be plenty. Transfer the chopped tomatoes to a large bowl and scatter over a generous amount of salt. Leave to stand for 15 minutes, preferably in the sun.Tear any large oregano leaves in half and add to the tomatoes with a good glug of olive oil; stir once or twice. Keep the small oregano leaves intact and set aside.Grill the slices of bread until they are lightly charred but still have a little spring when pressed with a finger. (If you have a barbecue on the go, even better; a few minutes over hot coals does wonders for the flavour.) Lightly rub the garlic clove very briefly on to one side of each slice.Taste the tomatoes and add more salt, if necessary, then spoon generously over the grilled bread. Scatter the remaining small oregano leaves evenly over the top, add a twist of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil, then cut the slices in half and serve.Prep 15 minRest 15 minCook 20 minServes 4Flaky sea salt and black pepper800g flank steak, trimmed of any fatExtra-virgin olive oil4 handfuls watercress leaves, washed and dried8 large field mushrooms, sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and very finely chopped1 large handful chopped flat-leaf parsleyGenerously season the outside of the meat and, using a hot, oiled griddle pan, grill the steak until it is nicely charred on the outside and pink on the inside – six to eight minutes, depending on the thickness of the steak. Leave to rest somewhere warm for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, dress the watercress leaves in a few splashes of olive oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper, and divide between plates.Put a frying pan over a medium flame and heat a very good glug of olive oil. Fry the mushrooms, garlic and half the chopped parsley; when soft and shiny, remove from the heat and set aside.Put the rested meat on to a firm chopping board and thinly slice with a very sharp knife into 5mm-thick strips. Lay the juicy, pink slices on top of the watercress, scatter the mushrooms evenly on top and serve with a scant drizzle of oil and the remaining parsley.• Russell Norman is the co-founder of Polpo restaurants, which this month celebrates its 10th anniversary."
Rachel Roddy’s recipe for tonnato sauce,"This creamy tuna and anchovy mayonnaise from northern Italy suits meats, hard-boiled eggs and buttery lettuce, but is superb over tomatoes",Rachel Roddy,2019-08-19T12:00:41+0100,"Anna, Jane, Elizabeth, Madhur, Alastair, Colin, Delia, Nigel, Mary, Simon, Nigella, Sophie, Josceline, the Ladies of the Yorkshire WI: when I return to my parents’ house, coming back to Mum’s cookbooks is like walking into a room of incredibly familiar people, all of whom look a bit odd, older and, in a few cases, fallen apart.This wasn’t always the way; these were the books I grew up with, as familiar as the plates we still eat off. I was raised with Jane and Josceline wide open on the counter and providing good advice and good meals in the best and worst of times. These were the books I stared at wondering why there were not more photos, that showed me how to write about food long before I ever thought of doing it. When I left home, swearing that I would do everything differently, I bought myself copies of pretty much every book on Mum’s shelves. But they were later editions, often with different covers and indexes, which have received different folds and strains. So when I go back, Mum’s copies, with their broken spines and different traces of sauce, seem both familiar and odd, a bit like home itself when the adult child returns.These days, I like walking into familiar rooms; after all, I am getting older too. Recipe-checking is my work now, but it is still a pleasure, pulling not just books but people from the shelf, and asking them a question I possibly know the answer to: “Anna, Alastair and Elizabeth, remind me how you make tonnato?”The Italian food writer Anna Del Conte describes her mother’s Milanese tonnato (tonnè), which is served with veal, as being an elegant beige sauce made with tuna, anchovies, cream, lemon and then some of the veal cooking stock. It is a superb recipe for a richly flavoured sauce. I have made it many times, each time enjoying the story above the recipe: Anna’s mother’s joy at finding veal in post-war Milan, then the stumble, and the dish being dropped on the floor, the beige mess on the carpet, and her aunt’s cry that it was too good to waste, and that she would eat it anyway.In the neighbouring region of Piedmont, they make tonnato with olive-oil mayonnaise, clearly inspiration for Elizabeth David’s version in her book, Italian Food: “Make a stiff mayonnaise with two egg yolks, a little salt, 100ml of olive oil and a very little lemon” – she notes it should be a jelly-like substance that sticks to the spoon and falls with a delicious plop on to the plate – “then mix it with 50g of tinned tunny fish”. When and why did we stop saying “tunny”?Alastair Little and Ed Smith’s versions are somewhere between Milan and Piedmont, but more straightforward than both in that you are not required to make a stock or mayonnaise: simply blend everything in a food processor or an immersion blender.Tonnato is synonymous with veal, for the dish vitello tonnato. The idea of combining meat and tuna sauce might sound odd, but it works well – very well. Tonnato is also a match for chicken, turkey and, best of all, soft, hard-boiled eggs and floppy butterhead lettuce.Elizabeth David suggests using her mayonnaise tonnato to fill tomato halves, but it is Ed Smith who suggests serving slices of tomato on tonnato and topping it with capers. Rounds of red on a butter-coloured sauce look wonderful. It is also one of those beaming combinations – after all, tomatoes love tuna, anchovies and eggs, so are absolutely at home with the sleek sauce, the capers adding little bullets of salt. Thank you Anna, Alastair, Ed and Elizabeth, you are all looking well.Tuna and anchovy are never shy – this is a rich, fishy sauce – but the egg and olive-oil emulsion provide the real body of this tonnato, while lemon and dijon sharpen the edges.Prep 10 minServes 6-82 anchovy fillets160g tinned tuna (120g drained weight)1 garlic clove, peeledJuice of half a lemon1 egg plus an extra yolk1 small handful parsley leaves1 tsp dijon mustard150ml olive oilSalt and pepper, to seasonPut all the ingredients, except the oil and seasoning, into a food processor or a bowl suitable for an immersion blender, and pulse until smooth.While pulsing, add the oil, bit by bit, then blend until smooth. The consistency should be loose, but not runny – somewhere between single and double cream. Taste and add more lemon juice, salt and pepper, as needed.⁃ The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish. For ratings in your region, check: UK; Australia; US.

"Thomasina Miers' recipe for mussels with fregola, 'nduja and baby tomatoes",A pasta-like grain adds bite to this quick dish of mussels tossed in a sauce made with with the last of the season’s baby tomatoes and spicy pork salumi,Thomasina Miers,2019-09-30T12:00:14+0100,"Fregola, from Sardinia, is a pasta-like grain similar to couscous, except that the kernels are much fatter and therefore more satisfying to bite into. It is easy to cook and a great vehicle for robust flavours. Here, I toss fregola with mussels spiced with the pork salumi paste ’nduja for a simple, fast supper packed with flavour.If you are struggling to find fregola, the Middle-Eastern brand Zaytoun sell an almost identical sized couscous called maftoul, which is equally delicious.Prep 15 minCook 30 minServes 4-63 tbsp olive oil1 large red onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely choppedSalt250g fregola or maftoul 300g baby tomatoes, halved200ml white wine40g ’nduja paste1.5kg mussels, thoroughly cleaned and de-bearded1 big handful parsley, choppedCrusty bread, to serveWarm the oil over a medium heat in a large, wide casserole or pan for which you have a lid (or that an upturned frying pan can snugly cover). Add the onion and garlic, season with a few pinches of salt, and sweat for 10 minutes, until softened.Meanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to a boil and cook the fregola, shaving two minutes off the cooking time stated on the packet (usually around 10-12 minutes): you are going to cook it again with the mussels and want to maintain some bite to the grains. Drain and set aside.Add the tomatoes to the onions, simmer for two minutes, then stir in the wine, fregola and ’nduja. Turn up the heat and simmer for another two minutes, to allow the grains to absorb the flavours.Now add the mussels, put the lid on and cook for a further four to five minutes, shaking regularly, until the mussels have all opened (dead ones won’t open and you must throw these away). Divide between bowls, sprinkle with the parsley and serve at once with crusty bread to mop up any stray juices.Any leftover ’nduja will transform many suppers: add to tomato sauces, heat and drizzle over pizzas or breakfast eggs, or even use to sauce a sauteed fillet of fish. Leftover fregola or maftoul can be turned into delicious autumnal salads, to accompany grilled vegetables or slow-cooked lamb."
"Anna Jones' recipes for nigella seed and lime dal, and plum chutney","Mix things up and make nigella seeds a new store-cupboard go-to. They pack an earthy, oniony punch in these dal and chutney recipes",Anna Jones,2019-09-27T12:00:36+0100,"There are a handful of ingredients that I use on repeat to boost flavour. They have become like reliable old friends: from lemons to smoked paprika, my kitchen is never without them. One less run-of-the-mill kitchen friend is nigella seeds, or kalonji. Their flavour is quite difficult to describe – perhaps closest to the faintest taste of onion, but with a back note of earthy spice.This dal and chutney put the flavour of nigella seeds centre stage, but be bold and use the seeds to perk up simple everyday dishes, too, like fried eggs on toast, rice or baked feta.I suggest soaking the lentils overnight, to help reduce the cooking time and to make them easier to digest. If you can’t manage this, a couple of hours will do.Prep 15 minSoak OvernightCook 1 hrServes 4100g red (split) lentils100g chana dal (split yellow lentils)2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped1 thumb-size piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped1 green chilli, finely chopped (deseeded if you like)1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp coriander seeds1 × 400ml tin coconut milk500ml hot vegetable stock1 bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped, stalks and all1 lime, juicedFor the nigella seed temper 1 tsp mustard seeds 2 tbsp nigella seeds 2 tbsp gheeTo servePlain yoghurtPlum chutney (see above recipe)Chapatis/roti (optional)Brown basmati rice (optional)Rinse the red lentils, then soak with the dal in cold water, ideally overnight, or for as long as you have – at least two hours.In a large saucepan, fry the garlic, ginger, chilli and red onion in a little oil for about 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Add the seeds, and cook for a couple of minutes to toast and release their flavours.Drain the lentils and rinse again, then add them to the pan with the coconut milk and stock. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down and let them bubble away for 40 minutes.Next, make the temper. Put a small frying pan on a high heat, fry the mustard and nigella seeds in a little ghee for two minutes, then pour into the dal and stir.To finish, remove from the heat and stir in half the chopped coriander and lime juice.

Rachel Roddy’s recipe for Italian confit chicken,"Confit chicken, or pollo sott’olio, slow-cooked in a bath of fragrant extra-virgin olive oil on a bed of herbs and zest",Rachel Roddy,2019-09-23T12:00:27+0100,"It is estimated that fragments of 53m terracotta amphorae once containing olive oil make up Monte Testaccio in Rome. The hill was constructed between the first century BC and the third century AD, when billions of litres of oil from Baetica (modern-day Spain), Tripolitania (Libya) and Byzacena (Tunisia) were imported into imperial Rome. This was not simply oil for drizzling on leaves, but fuel for an empire – for lamps, cleaning, balm, perfume and medicine. Once the oil was decanted, the impregnated amphorae couldn’t be reused – which is why they were smashed and, in highly organised feats of stacking, made into a hill that rose nonchalantly, the Leonard Cohen of landmarks, in the middle of Rome.Over the centuries, the hill – which stands at 35m and has a circumference of half a mile – has taken on a life of its own: grass, shrubs and trees have taken root on its slopes; restaurants, nightclubs and mechanics at its base. Depending from where you approach it, Monte Testaccio can look like a woodland wilderness, a hub of charming trattorie, a scruffy and seedy clubland, an urban farm or a neatly stacked exhibit. It is from inside Testaccio’s other unlikely landmark, a former slaughterhouse, that you can best understand the monte, the pieces of broken pot visible on the slopes.The slaughterhouse and olive oil pot hill are just two of the many reasons Testaccio feels so edible. It was appropriate, I thought, that I passed both on my way to see a man about a recipe for chicken in olive oil.Domenico Cortese comes from Tropea, a town almost at the tip of the toe of Italy’s boot, famous for its sweet red onions. The eldest of five children, his grandfather and father were both butchers, and he grew up around the family shop. He learned his father’s vocation, and found it was not his own. His career as a chef is a sort of careful stacking of experience: near his mum as a kid; in hotels as a teenager; as a dishwasher and the chef at an Italian restaurant called Messina, in Rotterdam; as a private chef to the Argentinian ambassador in Rome; head of a police canteen; sous chef in the American Academy in Rome; running a supper club with his Danish partner and baker, Sophie.Now they have their own place, Marigold, which seems like a culmination of all the layers of experience and hard work: an oasis of exceptional food, just beyond the hill of olive oil pots. While Domenico’s great skill is undoubtedly pasta and vegetables, I particularly appreciate his use of herbs and citrus, and the way he brings out flavour, which is apparent in this, his recipe for chicken with many herbs, lemon, orange and ginger, cooked sott’olio – under oil, or confit.Domenico is unequivocal about using extra-virgin olive oil, for its unrivalled flavour and conduction: oil diffuses heat better than air, which is why meat confined and cooked under oil is so tender and almost velvet-like, rich but, surprisingly, not fatty. With cost in mind, he concedes that you could use half olive/half vegetable oil. Either way, it should almost cover the legs (about 800ml) – only the very top of the skin should be above the oil.Another pleasure of this dish is the scent, in preparation and at the end of cooking when the blackened herbs, garlic, wrinkled strips of citrus and ginger make the hardworking olive oil seem like a balm or kitchen medicine, just as it has always been. Domenico sends me away with the last two portions of chicken, which will store under oil for days, or weeks if I put them in a jar. As we drive home, I can feel them slosh and sway in the olive oil as we pass the hill of olive oil pots.After cooking, you can reuse the now deliciously flavoured oil to cook more chicken or make roast potatoes – simply filter through a sieve then keep it in a jar in the fridge as use as needed. Refrigerated, it will last for months.Prep 20 minRest OvernightCook 3hr 20 minServes 44 chicken legs, approx 220g eachSalt and pepperSmall bunches thyme and sage2 lemons1 orange8 garlic cloves, peeled2 inches root ginger, unpeeled, cut into thick slices.800ml extra-virgin olive oil or an olive oil/vegetable oil mixThe day before, carefully and generously season the chicken, rubbing salt and pepper all over the legs, paying particular attention to the flesh near the bone. Put in a container, cover and leave in the fridge overnight.Pull the chicken from the fridge an hour before cooking. Choose an ovenproof dish or casserole large enough to accommodate the legs in a single layer. In the bottom of the dish, make a bed of the herbs, the pared zest of the lemon and orange (a peeler is best) the garlic and ginger. Lay the chicken on top, skin-side up and pour over the oil, which should submerge all but the very top skin of the chicken.Put in the middle shelf of the oven at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 20 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 140C (120C)/275F/gas 1 for three hours.After cooking, let the chicken sit for at least an hour. To serve, lift the legs from the oil with a slotted spoon, letting the excess oil drip back into the dish."
Meera Sodha’s vegan wild mushroom miso broth recipe,"Miso provides an instant savoury base for simple broths, such as this light mushroom soup bulked up with jasmine rice",Meera Sodha,2019-09-21T10:00:26+0100,"Miso is a tired cook’s best friend and the time-poor cook’s shortcut to an excellent meal. There’s more than one type, too. Sweet white miso is chirpy and savoury in equal parts; it makes a great salad dressing and adds sparkle to chocolate brownies. Then there are the dark, brooding types, such as the brown rice miso I’ve used in today’s recipe. It’s deeply flavoured enough to stand up to the earthiest mushrooms and creates a broth – and a real welcome to autumn – in a matter of minutes.Kombu is a dried, flat natural seaweed that can be found in Asian supermarkets, the world food aisle of big supermarkets and in healthfood stores. It’s great for making a stock.Prep 10 minCook 25 minServes 4 for lunch300g jasmine rice6 spring onions – 4 roughly chopped for the broth, 2 finely sliced, to finish5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly sliced25g dried shiitake mushrooms1 sheet (or 12g) kombu1 red bird’s eye chilli, slit lengthways250g wild mushrooms (such as ceps, chanterelles, girolles), cleaned and finely sliced4 tbsp brown rice misoFirst, make the rice. Put the rice in a sieve and wash under cold running water until it runs clear. Tip the rice into a saucepan for which you have a lid, cover with 450ml cold water and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat, cover the pan and leave the rice to simmer for six minutes. Turn off the heat, but don’t be tempted to lift the lid; leave the rice to continue steaming until the soup is ready.Now make the broth. Fill a large saucepan with a litre and a half of water and set it over a medium heat. Add the roughly chopped spring onions, ginger, shiitake, kombu and chilli, bring up to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. Strain the stock into a bowl through a fine sieve, pouring it very carefully so you leave behind the last couple of tablespoons (these might be a little gritty from the dried mushrooms).Return the broth to the clean pan and discard the stock veg in the sieve. Bring the broth back to a boil and, once it’s bubbling gently, add the sliced mushrooms. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the mushrooms in the broth for four minutes.Turn off the heat and gently whisk the miso paste into the stock. Divide the broth and mushrooms between four bowls, and serve with the steamed rice."
Anna Jones’ Turkish lahmacun and esme salad recipes,"A deliciously chewy, moreish flatbread that many call the Turkish ‘pizza’, with a spicy salad of tomatoes and onion with beans",Anna Jones,2019-09-20T12:45:06+0100,"Where I live in Hackney, London, there is a Turkish kebab shop on every corner. The mum or granny of the family often sits in the window, rolling gozleme and bases for their pizza-like lahmacun: I challenge you to find a better, cheaper lunch. I rarely make them at home though as I’m not as adept at rolling, but I found myself out of town the other day and craving them.So this was dinner, with an ezme salad featuring mandarin, inspired by a recent trip to the restaurant Bubala in London, where they put grapefruit in theirs. I am sure neither of these dishes are traditional: I’ve simplified the lahmacun dough and added a few things like harissa to the ezme salad, but that’s exactly what recipes should be, and what I love about where I live in London: a tapestry of food, people and culture.Lahmacun are often nicknamed “Turkish pizzas.” There are as many variations of these flatbreads in Turkey as there are pizzas in Italy, from bazlama to manaqish, depending on where you are. The breads vary in how the dough comes together and how they are cooked, as well as what they are topped with. I obviously go for the vegetarian version: here, earthy spices lift finely chopped sweet peppers and late-summer tomatoes.Prep 45 minRest 1 hrCook 5 minMakes 4 pizzasFor the pizza dough350ml luke-warm water1 tbsp dried yeast1 pinch sugar2 tbsp olive oil500g strong white bread flour (or 00 pasta flour)1 pinch saltFor the topping2 red peppers, deseeded and chopped3 tomatoes, finely chopped1 fresh green chilli2 garlic cloves2 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp ground coriander1 tbsp tomato pureeZest of ½ lemonTo serve1 handful fresh mint, roughly chopped 1 handful fresh parsley, roughly chopped1 tsp sumacExtra-virgin olive oilMix the warm water, yeast, sugar and oil in a bowl, and leave for about 10 minutes.In a stand mixer with a dough hook, mix the flour and salt for a few seconds. Then, with the motor still running, slowly add the liquid, and keep mixing until the dough no longer sticks to the sides and is soft, glossy and stretchy – about five minutes. Alternatively, you can mix the dough and then knead by hand for 10 minutes. Stretch the dough between two hands, if you can see through the thin layer of dough that forms then it’s ready.Cover the dough so it’s airtight,  and leave somewhere warm for about an hour. Once it has doubled in size, turn out and knead for a few more minutes, until soft.Heat the oven to its hottest setting and put a pizza stone or heavy-based frying pan in to get really hotside.Finely chop or blitz the topping ingredients in a food processor to a rough, salsa-like texture. Season well with salt, then pour the topping into a sieve and stir until most of the liquid has drained off, and you’re left with a thick, tomatoey salsa-sauce.On a well floured surface, split the dough into four and roll each piece out into a 5mm-thick round. Remove the hot pan from the oven and carefully put a circle of dough into the pan. Put two tablespoons of the sauce on top and spread evenly in a nice, thin layer.Bake for about five minutes, until bubbly, golden and charred at the edges. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the fresh herbs and sumac, then finish with a drizzle of olive oil. Repeat with the rest of the dough and topping and serve immediately.An absolute staple of Turkish cuisine. You will find a bowl of this spicy salad as part of many meze spreads. I first tried it in an east London takeaway, alongside falafel, Turkish feta and stewed green beans, and now I can’t get enough. Leave the flavours to mingle for a couple of hours if you can.Prep 20 minServes 4 as a side2 ripe vine tomatoes, finely chopped 1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped1 mandarin or clementine, peeled and segmented 2 red peppers, finely chopped½ cucumber, finely chopped2 tbsp capers½ bunch parsley, leaves pickedZest and juice of ½ a lemon2 tbsp pomegranate molasses2 tbsp olive oil1 pinch each salt and pepper1 tbsp harissa½ tsp sumac1 pinch chilli flakesPut the tomatoes, onion, garlic, mandarin, peppers, cucumber, capers and parsley in a serving bowl.In a jar or small bowl, mix or shake the lemon juice and zest, pomegranate molasses, olive oil, salt, pepper and harissa together. Pour this over the salad ingredients, toss together, then sprinkle over the sumac and chilli flakes.Serve straight away or put in the fridge, covered, for later."
Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for pistachio and cherry croissants,"The smell of baking pastry is one of the world’s favourite aromas, and readymade puff means you can enjoy croissants with far less fuss than usual",Meera Sodha,2019-09-14T10:00:52+0100,"The smell of fresh baking is one that deserves to be enjoyed by everyone. It soothes the soul, travels out of windows and into the street, spreading delight in a way no other scent can. Today’s recipe is particularly aromatic: a cheat’s croissant made with pre-rolled puff-pastry filled with a push-of-a-button pistachio marzipan and sweet cherries. So few ingredients and little work for such lovely smells and so much joy … you may as well fling open the windows (and pass a plate around).You can use frozen cherries, if you like – just defrost them fully first. The cherries will produce some juice that you won’t need here, but it keeps for three days in the fridge – use it in cocktails. You’ll need a food processor for the pistachio paste.Prep 20 minCook 1 hrMakes 16200g fresh cherries, pitted (or frozen cherries, defrosted)1 tbsp icing sugar, plus a little extra to dust100g unsalted pistachio kernels 4 tbsp brown rice syrup 1 tsp vanilla extract ½ tbsp flavourless oil, such as rapeseed, plus extra for brushingSalt2 x 320g packets pre-rolled puff pastry sheets – I like Jus-Rol’sHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line two oven trays with nonstick baking paper. Finely chop the cherries, put them in a bowl with the icing sugar and leave to steep.Finely chop a tablespoon of the pistachios and set aside. Put the rest of the nuts, syrup, vanilla, oil and a good pinch of salt in the bowl of a food processor, and blitz until it comes together like wet dough.Unfurl one pack of pastry. With the longest side parallel to the edge of the worktop, mark it out into quarters, then cut across the whole sheet from top left to bottom right and top right to bottom left – you will end up with eight pastry triangles. Repeat with the second pastry sheet.Put a sieve over a small bowl and drain the cherries (reserve the juice). Take one triangle and put the shortest side parallel to the worktop – this should be a long, skinny triangle with a sharp, slightly off-centre point at the top, so stretch the base a bit to even it out.Put a scant teaspoon each of the pistachio paste and drained cherries on the bottom of the triangle, 2cm from the edge – don’t be tempted to use more, or it’ll be too fat to roll. Roll the bottom edge over the filling and keep rolling, with the filling central – you’ll end up with a chubby bit in the middle and two horns. Fold the horns in towards each other to form a crescent, and pinch the ends closed as necessary.Put on the lined tray, then repeat with the remaining pastry and filling to make 15 more croissants. Brush each with oil, and bake for 15-20 minutes, until crisp and golden.Dust liberally with icing sugar and chopped pistachios, and leave to cool."
Rachel Roddy’s recipe for Sicilian doughnuts,Among the many delights of Italian cafe-bars are ciambelli – deep-fried doughnuts,Rachel Roddy,2019-09-09T12:00:12+0100,"“You have to order iris,” the girl behind the counter at Pasticceria Catania tells me, before glancing up at the clock, then at the door, then back to me. “Great, good, excellent: I would like to order two,” I reply, apologising if she’s about to close. “And the filling?” she asks, while flipping to the right page of the order book, then smoothing it back like a wrinkle with her thumb. “Ricotta,” I say, pleased with myself that I know these fried brioche are filled with ricotta. Her eyes narrow: “Here [in Gela], the filling is either chocolate or pistachio; you need to order a minimum of four; leave a deposit – we are closed on Monday, so they will be ready at 9am on Tuesday.” Our conversion is in my adequate Italian and her Sicilian, except my compulsive enthusiasm and her last three words: “Is that excellent?”As we walk back two days later, we pass the countless other bars that have filled our veins with short, dark coffee and cold lemon tea this summer; that have cooled us with iced granita, but disappointed with their breakfast buns. Many bars in Sicily, at least the ones we’ve found ourselves in, seem to buy in the cheapest, most anaemic breakfast things these days, and I write this as someone who is easily pleased – I am far from a yeasted bun snob. If only we had walked 300m farther along the corso (main street) sooner. If only we had found Bar e Pasticceria Catania in early July, we could have enjoyed six weeks of yeasted and fried bun delight with our morning caffeine.Bars dispensing coffee, soft drinks, hard spirits, beer and snacks from early until late are a way of life in Sicily, as they are in most of Italy. Bars are everywhere, for everyone. Order at the cash desk, which may require an amount of single mindedness, and consume either at the bar or a table, and join in the everyday rhythm. Combine a bar with a Sicilian pasticceria, with its long, glass counter lined with soft almond biscuits, brioche, green, marzipan-draped confections and layered bricks of cream, sponge and custard, and you have a sugared, caffeinated nirvana.Sicilian bar breakfasts are sweet. Most things seem to be called brioche, notably the brioscia col tuppo (round bun with a top knot), but also cornetti (croissant), ciambelle (ring doughnuts), fried ravioli and other cones and folds. Then there is the mythical iris, a UFO sphere of brioche dough filled with ricotta in Palermo, and chocolate or pistacchio in Gela, then deep-fried until darkest golden brown.It is just after 9am when I arrive on Tuesday, and my iris are sitting ready on a golden tray like kings. The girl wraps them in a cocoon of paper, then I walk them back along the corso. At home, we marvel at the crack of the outside shell and improbable ratio of filling, which is a sort of thick chocolate pudding. I find the idea of a guilty pleasure a ridiculous and annoying one. When faced with something like iris, there is only pleasure, and possibly a blob of chocolate on your lap.After all that, I am not ready to write about iris: next year. I am, though, ready to write about the ciambelle: another pleasure both to eat and make. I use a cutter for the doughnut rounds and then a liqueur glass to make a hole in the centre, creating a ring and, as Emiko Davies (whose recipe this is based on) notes, the leftover bocconcini (mouthfuls).As well as sweet, this has been a truly fried column, for which I don’t apologise – but I do understand if it seems a pain. Be careful as you lift them outThe absence of egg in this recipe makes for soft, plump ciambelle that aren’t too sweet. You could, therefore, pipe some jam into the heart of the little bocconcini; alternatively, whipped ricotta, chocolate or custard are great, good and excellent.Prep (including proving time 2 hr 30 minCook 30 minMakes 8 x 5 inch rings15g fresh yeast or 7g active dried yeast80ml tepid water200g strong plain flour160g sugar30g butter, meltedZest of 1 lemonSalt Vegetable, sunflower or peanut oil, for frying and oiling the bowlIf you are using fresh yeast, crumble it into the water, stir and leave to sit for 10 minutes.Put the flour, dried yeast (if using), 60g of the sugar, butter, lemon zest and a pinch of salt in a bowl and add the water/yeast – or simply water if using dried yeast.

Fry the doughnuts in small batches for two minutes per side, or until golden. Lift out with a slotted spoon, blot, then, as soon as possible, roll each one in the remaining sugar."

In a separate jug, beat the egg with the milk, vanilla and melted butter. Gradually whisk the egg mixture into the flour mixture until well combined.Add a little oil to a large frying pan, then give the pan a wipe with kitchen paper. Put the pan on a medium heat and cook your pancakes in the greased frying pan one at a time, using about 60ml batter (quarter cup portions) for each pancake. Flip the pancake when the edges seem dry and bubbles form and burst on top. Now flip the pancake over and cook on the other side for a further two minutes, and set aside – grease the pan for each pancake. Keep the cooked pancakes warm while you cook the rest.Add the bacon rashers to the frying pan you cooked the pancakes in and cook on a medium heat for about eight minutes, then flip them over and cook until crisp on both sides. Remove from the heat and put the rashers on kitchen paper to drain the excess fat.Turn the heat to low. Beat the eggs, add the butter and milk, put in the pan and begin to cook with a spatula or a wooden spoon, melting the butter, continuing just until the eggs are still slightly runny and undercooked. Remove the pan from the heat, continuing to stir (the pan’s residual heat will continue to cook the eggs).To assemble the tacos, fold each pancake into a taco shape and prop it up between two cups or glasses (or using a taco holder if you have one). Put some of the scrambled egg into the taco, slot in two bacon rashers between the egg and the pancake, top with a few avocado slices and some salsa, and drizzle with a little maple syrup.For the fish taco, repeat, but swap the bacon for smoked salmon, and maple syrup for pesto. Repeat with the remaining pancakes. You can make these on the fly and experiment with different fillings, such as sausage in place of bacon.Prep 30 minFreeze overnightCook 20 minServes 4200g mixed berries200g natural yoghurt honey, to serveFor the clustery granola pieces90g unsalted mixed nuts225g rolled oats25g sesame seeds25g sunflower seeds60ml sunflower oil50ml runny honey80g mixed dried berriesFor the porridge200g rolled oats1 tsp ground cinnamon400ml unsweetened almond milk, plus extra to serve100g raisins1 tsp fine sea saltFor the banana ice-cream4 large bananas, cut into chunks1-2 tbsp almond milkStart preparing the day before.

Mix the nuts, oats and seeds in a large bowl, then add the oil and honey.Stir with a fork, tip the granola on to the lined baking tray and spread out in a thin layer. Bake for 20 minutes, stirring twice so it bakes evenly, until golden brown. Tip into a bowl and leave to cool, then add the dried berries and pop it into an airtight container ready to use the next day.To make the porridge, put oats in a bowl, stir in the cinnamon, almond milk, raisins and salt, cover and put in the fridge until the next day.To make the ice-cream, put the banana chunks on a baking tray and put in the freezer overnight. The next day, throw the frozen banana into the bowl of a food processor and blitz smooth, adding enough almond milk to give it a creamy consistency.Loosen the porridge slightly with a little almond milk, then divide it between four large jars or bowls. Top with mixed berries, a spoonful of yoghurt, a scoop or two of banana ice-cream and clustery granola pieces. Add a drizzle of honey and serve.Prep 25 minCook 50 minServes 4 (makes 4 muffins)4 slices American-style cheese4 large eggs4 English muffins, halvedFor the breakfast patties500g pork/beef mince2 tbsp dried mixed herbs1 tsp freshly ground black pepper1 tsp fine sea salt1 tsp garlic granules1 tbsp soft light brown sugar1 pinch ground cloves4 tbsp vegetable oilFor the beany hash400g potatoes (skin on)1 x 415g tin baked beansDried mixed herbs60g salted butter, melted5 tbsp sunflower oilTo make the breakfast patties, mix all the patty ingredients except the oil in a large bowl, using your hands to make sure everything is fully incorporated. Divide the mixture evenly into four, and shape into flattened patties, making them a little larger than your muffins because they will shrink while cooking.Heat the oil in a large skillet or frying pan on a medium-high heat. Cook the patties in batches, frying them for three minutes a side, until browned on both sides and cooked through. Once you’ve flipped the patties, top each one with a slice of cheese (while it’s still in the pan) – the residual heat should melt the cheese – then transfer to a plate and keep warm.For the beany hash, cook the whole potatoes in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for about 10 minutes, then drain and set aside to cool.Drain the baked beans in a sieve, saving the sauce from the tin in a bowl underneath. Set aside the drained baked-bean sauce.Coarsely grate the potatoes into a separate bowl, discarding any potato skin left in your hand once you’ve grated the potato, season well with salt, freshly ground pepper and mixed herbs, and add the drained baked beans and just over half the melted butter. Mix well and divide the mixture into eight patties roughly the same width as the cooked breakfast patties. You only need four patties for this recipe: keep the rest in the fridge or freezer – it’s a great thing to pull out when you have people round.Heat the oil and the rest of the melted butter in a frying pan, for which you have a lid, over a medium heat. Once the butter and oil are sizzling, add the bean hash patties and fry gently for two and a half minutes a side, until crisp and golden. Transfer to a plate but leave the pan on the heat.Ideally, use egg rings to get that authentic breakfast-egg shape. In the same pan over a medium heat, add one tablespoon of vegetable oil to the pan, grease or spray the egg rings (if using) with more oil and put them in the pan (if you only have one egg ring, fry the eggs one at a time). Crack the eggs into the rings, add two tablespoons of water to the pan and cover with a lid. Cook for two minutes, or until your egg is cooked to your liking: cook for one minute for a runny egg, a little longer for a slightly runny egg, then longer than that for an egg yolk that is not runny. I like my eggs to be walking – in other words, well cooked with a runny yolk, and not overdone. Transfer to a plate and set aside.To assemble, put the muffins on a baking tray, cut-side up, and grill; alternatively, stick them in the toaster. Top the four muffin halves with the meat patties, then an egg, and a beany patty drizzled with some warmed-through baked-bean sauce. Top with a muffin lid, wrap each muffin in a bit of baking paper, and serve.Prep 15 minCook 8 minServes 22 large eggs3 tbsp whole milk½ tsp smoked paprikaSalt and black pepper4 slices brioche4 tbsp chilli jam4 slices gouda1 tbsp unsalted butter1 tbsp vegetable oil1 tin tomato soup, to serve (optional)Put the eggs, milk and paprika in a bowl and whisk together, season with salt and freshly ground pepper and pour into a baking dish.Spread two slices of brioche with two tablespoons of chilli jam each, then top with the gouda slices.Top with the remaining two slices of brioche. Dip the sandwiches in the egg mixture, making sure both sides of the sandwiches are well coated.Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add both sandwiches to the pan and cook for four minutes a side, until golden brown.

Four summer jam recipes,"Store up the sunshine for the leaner months in homemade jams of peach and lemon thyme, gooseberry and camomile, raspberry and cacao, or a strawberry and lemon marmalade",,2019-08-17T07:00:38+0100,"Before you start on any of these jams, sterilise jars and lids. Wash them in hot, soapy water and rinse well. Drip-dry upside down, then put in an oven heated to 100C (90C fan)/gas ¼ for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, put a few small plates in the freezer in preparation for the “wrinkle test.”Sealed, the jam will keep for up to 12 months. Once opened, keep refrigerated and eat within three months.Prep 15 minCook 25 minMakes 8 x 228ml jars2 tbsp loose camomile tea or flowers1.5kg gooseberries60ml lemon juice700g sugarSterilise the jars and lids, and put a few small plates in the freezer, as described above. Brew the camomile tea or flowers in 250ml just-boiled water for five minutes.Wash the gooseberries and cut off the little brown tops. In a large, wide-rimmed, stainless-steel saucepan or jam pan, soften the gooseberries on a medium-high heat with the lemon juice and brewed tea (flowers and all, if using). Simmer for five to 10 minutes, stirring frequently so that the mixture doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan and burn.Slowly pour in the sugar, stirring until it dissolves completely. Increase the heat and boil over a high heat for about 10-15 minutes, until it reaches 104C on a thermometer, or the rolling boil turns into heavier, ploppy bubbles.When you think it’s ready, take off the heat and do the wrinkle test: put a quarter-teaspoon of jam on to a pre-frozen plate and put in the fridge for a minute. Remove from the fridge and push the jam with your finger; it should have a slight wrinkle on the surface, similar to when boiled milk forms a skin. If there’s no wrinkle, put the pan back on a high heat, keep cooking and test again every few minutes until the wrinkle has been achieved.When the jam is ready, skim off and discard any froth that has formed on the surface, then ladle into hot, sterilised jars. Clean the rim of the jar and seal immediately.

Gently wash the raspberries, if needed, and pick out any leaves or twigs.Put the raspberries in a large, wide-rimmed, stainless-steel saucepan or jam pan, add 50ml water and the lemon juice, and soften the fruit over a medium-high heat for about five to seven minutes, stirring frequently so it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan and burn.Slowly pour in the sugar, stirring until it dissolves completely, then add the vanilla and cacao nibs. Increase the heat and boil over a high heat for about 10-15 minutes, until it reaches 104C on a thermometer, or the rolling boil turns into heavier, ploppy bubbles.When you think it’s ready, take off the heat and do the wrinkle test: put a quarter-teaspoon of jam on to a pre-frozen plate and put in the fridge for a minute. Remove from the fridge and push the jam with your finger; it should have a slight wrinkle on the surface, similar to when boiled milk forms a skin. If there’s no wrinkle, put the pan back on a high heat, keep cooking and test again every few minutes until the wrinkle has been achieved.When the jam is ready, skim off and discard any froth on the surface, ladle the jam into hot, sterilised jars.

If you don’t have the type of zester that can do this, use a vegetable peeler to pare the lemon skin into strips, scrape off any pith with a small, sharp knife, then finely slice into even thinner strips.Set aside 10-12 of the smaller strawberries, then chop the rest into quarters. Put in a large, wide-rimmed, stainless-steel saucepan or jam pan, add 70ml water, the lemon zest and juice, then soften the quartered fruit over a medium-high heat for about 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently so the mixture doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan and burn.Slowly pour in the sugar, stirring until it dissolves completely, then add the remaining whole strawberries. Increase the heat and boil over a high heat for about 10-15 minutes, until it reaches 104C on a thermometer, or the rolling boil turns into heavier, ploppy bubbles.When you think it’s ready, take off the heat and do the wrinkle test: put a quarter-teaspoon of jam on to a pre-frozen plate and put in the fridge for a minute.

Drain, peel off the skins, cut the flesh off around the stone, then chop into 1cm pieces.Put the fruit in a large, wide-rimmed, stainless-steel saucepan or jam pan, add the lemon juice and lemon thyme sprigs, and soften the peaches over a medium-high heat for about 10-15 minutes. Stir frequently so they don’t stick to the bottom of the pan and burn.Slowly pour in the sugar, stirring until it dissolves completely. Increase the heat and boil over a high heat for about 10-15 minutes, until it reaches 104C on a thermometer, or the rolling boil turns into heavier, ploppy bubbles.When you think it’s ready, take off the heat and do a wrinkle test for a soft-set jam: put a quarter-teaspoon of jam on to a pre-frozen plate and put in the fridge for one minute. Remove from the fridge and push the jam with your finger; the jam should be heavy and congealed, and when picked up with your finger, it should very slowly drip. If there’s no wrinkle, put the jam back on a high heat, keep cooking and test again every few minutes, until you get that telltale wrinkle.When the jam is ready, skim off and discard any froth from the surface, pick out the lemon thyme stalks, then ladle the jam into the hot, sterilised jars.

Pan-global: Yotam Ottolenghi’s pancake recipes,"Global variations on the humble pancake: omelette-like bánh xèo, the fritter-style okonomiyaki of Japan and a German-style crepe-noodle soup",Yotam Ottolenghi,2019-08-10T09:30:11+0100,"The minimal effort it takes to get pancakes into the pan and the ease with which they slip out of it, combined with the pure joy they give everyone, put them at the top of the breakfast chart in my home. Yet there’s so much more to pancakes than a drizzle of lemon and a dusting of sugar. In fact, some multi-layered savoury delicacies from around the world are based on an egg batter that holds together ingredients and soaks up flavours in a way that is hard to resist.These are much thinner than your average omelette – more like crepes, in fact, but without the flour. They are meant to be eaten like bánh xèo (Vietnamese pancakes), stuffing the herb salad into the omelettes and dipping the whole thing into the sauce, but you can also simply make the omelettes without the sauce and salad and serve with a squeeze of lime.Prep 30 minCook 35 minMakes 8For the omelettes90ml sunflower oil3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 green chillies, finely chopped (deseeded if you don’t like heat)3 banana shallots, peeled and finely chopped (180g)5g ginger, peeled and finely choppedSalt¾ tsp ground turmeric1 lime, grated to get 1 tsp zest, then cut into wedges to serve6 eggs1 x 400ml tin coconut milk (70% solids)For the dipping sauce1-2 pink grapefruits, juiced to get 80ml, plus 40g pulp 2 tbsp rice vinegar 1½ tbsp mirin 1 tbsp lime juice2 red chillies, finely chopped (deseeded if you don’t like heat)For the salad 3 spring onions, finely sliced into 5cm strips10g mint leaves10g coriander, picked leaves with some stem attached70g beansprouts60g breakfast radishes, finely sliced Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large, nonstick frying pan for which you have a lid, on a medium-high heat. Add the garlic, chillies, shallots, ginger and half a teaspoon of salt, and fry for eight to 10 minutes, stirring often, until soft and golden. Leave to cool for a few minutes.In a large bowl, whisk the turmeric, lime zest, eggs, coconut milk and half a teaspoon of salt until smooth and combined. Stir this through the cooled shallot mixture, then transfer to a measuring jug.Mix together all the ingredients for the sauce, including the pulp, with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, then toss all the salad ingredients together.Wipe the pan clean and return it to a high heat. Once very hot, add one and a half teaspoons of oil. Pour in about 100g of batter and swirl to coat most of the pan. Fry for a minute and a half, until the bottom is golden brown, then cover with the lid and continue to cook for another 20-30 seconds, or until the top is set. Transfer to a tray lined with baking paper and keep warm. Continue with the remaining oil and batter in the same way until you have eight omelettes.Carefully arrange the omelettes on a large platter, browned side up – they may fold naturally. Serve hot with the salad, dipping sauce and lime wedges alongside.Okonomiyaki are a savoury Japanese pancake made with cabbage and various other add-ins, and topped with sweet and savoury sauce. You can find ready-made okonomiyaki sauce in most Asian supermarkets, or you can make your own as suggested below. The sauce is quite sweet, so feel free to reduce the amount of honey the recipe calls for.Prep 25 minCook 45 minServes 2 as a main, 4 as a starterFor the pancakes110g plain flour25g tapioca flour¼ tsp baking powderSalt3 large eggs90ml dashi, fridge-cold¼ head white cabbage, core discarded, thinly shredded and cut into 1½cm pieces (180g)10g ginger, peeled and finely grated15g coriander, roughly chopped½ small sweet potato, skin-on and roughly grated (100g)180g extra-large, sustainably-sourced raw king prawns, peeled, deveined and roughly chopped100g good-quality kimchi (store-bought), roughly chopped, plus extra to serve 6 spring onions, thinly sliced (90g)60ml sunflower oilFor the sauce90g ketchup1½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce1½ tbsp soy sauce2 tsp runny honeyTo serve1½ tbsp mayonnaise (or Japanese mayonnaise)2 tsp nori sprinkle, or 1 sheet of nori finely blitzed in a food processor to get 2 tspPut all the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and simmer for a minute, stirring continuously, then set aside.In a large bowl, whisk together both flours, the baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Add the eggs and dashi, and whisk until you have a smooth batter. Add the cabbage, ginger, coriander, sweet potato, prawns, kimchi and three quarters of the spring onions, and mix to combine.Put two medium frying pans on a medium heat, adding a tablespoon of oil to each. Once hot, add a quarter of the pancake mixture (about 250g) to each pan and spread into a circle with a spatula to cover the base of the pan (about 18cm), pushing down to flatten. Cook for 10 minutes, or until golden on one side. Carefully flip over and cook for another six minutes, or until golden on the other side and cooked through the centre. Repeat with the remaining oil and batter, making four pancakes in total, and divide between four plates.Brush the tops with the sauce, then drizzle with the mayonnaise in a zig-zag motion (a squeezy bottle is best for this). Sprinkle with the remaining spring onion and the nori, and serve with some extra kimchi alongside.The southern German flaedlesuppe (or frittatensuppe in Austria) is the inspiration for this dish, where strips of crepes are served inside a clear broth, softening and expanding as they soak up the liquid. Thanks to Christiane MacKenzie for handing over the real-deal pancake recipe (minus the coriander). Any good-quality broth, meat- or vegetable-based, can be used here, but I urge you try this deliciously lemony broth, which can be made ahead of time and kept in the fridge for up to three days.Prep 25 minCook 3 hrServes 6For the soup1.5 kg bone-in lamb neck piecesSalt and black pepper 2 tbsp sunflower oil1 onion, peeled and thinly sliced (150g)3 cinnamon sticks2 whole star anise 8 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1-2 dried red chillies (the finger-length variety)500g carrots, peeled and cut at an angle into 3cm chunks 75ml lemon juice20g coriander, roughly chopped, plus extra to serveFor the pancakes250g plain flour4 eggs250ml whole milk50ml sparkling water10g coriander, roughly chopped, plus extra chopped to serve40g unsalted butter, cut into 8 x 5g pieces, for fryingPat the lamb dry, then season all over with three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper.Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large, cast-iron saucepan for which you have a lid, on a medium-high heat. When hot, fry half the lamb for about six to seven minutes, until browned all over. Transfer to a tray and repeat with the remaining lamb.Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, add the onion, cinnamon and star anise, and cook for three minutes more, stirring often, until lightly browned. Add the garlic and dried chillies and cook until fragrant – about a minute. Put the lamb back in, add 1.7 litres of water, two teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to medium-low, cover with a lid and leave to cook gently for about two hours, or until the lamb is quite tender.Add the carrots, replace the lid and cook for 30 minutes more, until the carrots are soft and the lamb is almost falling off the bone. Use a slotted spoon to remove the lamb and, when cool enough to handle, pull the meat apart into bite-sized chunks, discarding the bones. Return the meat to the saucepan, add the lemon juice and coriander, and keep warm, discarding the whole spices.Towards the last half hour of cooking, start making the pancakes. Add the flour and half a teaspoon of salt to a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Add the eggs, milk, sparkling water and coriander and whisk until smooth with no lumps.Add 5g butter to a large nonstick saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add about 90g of the batter, swirling to cover the base of the pan, and cook for about two minutes on each side, or until cooked through and browned. Repeat with the remaining butter and pancake batter to make eight pancakes in total.Roll up each pancake and cut into ¼cm-wide strips. Unravel the strips and divide them between six bowls. Ladle over the lamb soup and serve right away, with an extra sprinkle of coriander.

Four retro-classic recipes with a native ingredient update by Mark Olive,"From savoury muffins with warrigal greens to lemon myrtle baked whiting, these recipes share an Indigenous Australian twist",,2019-10-22T18:00:15+0100,"Although they’re growing in popularity, native ingredients aren’t readily available at most supermarkets – yet.

"Nigel Slater’s roast tomatoes, whipped cheese and samphire recipe",An unusual hot-and-cold take on a piquant herby classic,Nigel Slater,2019-10-22T12:00:59+0100,"Put 1kg of assorted tomatoes into a roasting tin, tuck in 6 sprigs of thyme, season with black pepper and trickle over 5 tbsp of olive oil. Roast at 200C/gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft and their skins lightly browned in places.Finely chop 2 tbsp of tarragon leaves and the same of basil. Mash 150g of goat’s cheese with a fork and then stir in 100g of crème fraîche. Add the chopped herbs and a little pepper then chill until needed.When the tomatoes are ready, remove them from the oven and transfer to a serving plate. Toss 100g of samphire into the tomato roasting juices in the tin then add next to the tomatoes on the serving plate. Spoon the herbed cheese into a small bowl then serve with pieces of crusty white baguette to soak up the juices. Enough for 2.To get the full sweet, sharp and smoky flavour of the tomatoes, roast them until their skins start to blacken here and there. Serve them hot, straight from the oven to contrast with the chilled whipped cheese.The tomatoes can be replaced by aubergines. Cut them into large cubes, then add to the roasting tin with the thyme and olive oil and bake for a good half hour or so, turning them as they burnish and soften. Season with a sprinkling of za’atar, fresh mint and serve with the whipped cheese and samphire.Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater"
Bitter-sweet memories: Rachel Roddy's recipe for marmalade cake,Hand-me-down recipes come inseparably steeped in memories – such as this recipe for marmalade cake from an old friend that became etched into the family biography,Rachel Roddy,2019-10-21T12:00:28+0100,"The other day I opened a book to find a sentence, and a bit of paper fell out. As the square piece of block pad glided to the floor like a dead moth, I recognised it as a recipe for a ring cake written out for me not long after coming to Italy, about 14 years ago. I remember making the recipe several times, before using it as a bookmark that was left at page 76. What I don’t remember or recognise is whose neat writing it is.My memory lapse is frustrating. Sharing a recipe is an open-handed act, one made even more tangible if the person sharing has taken the time physically to write it out, maybe with notes, which is a small labour in these copy-and-photograph times.Even if the recipe given is never made, I want to remember where the Post-It lemon pudding or back-of-envelope braised chicken came from. And if the recipe becomes part of my cooking life, it is no different from a recipe from a book or famous chef: it absolutely must have that person attached to it, like a name tag sewn into a collar. Then, every time the recipe is made, the person and your relationship to them, whatever it was, is remembered. Even if it means you have to relive a tired exchange about authenticity, or be reminded that Mario subsequently left his wife for his secretary, recipes have names: Mario’s red-wine risotto; my elegant neighbour Vera’s creme caramel; Lise from Bavaria’s liver and apple.Shared name-tagged recipes are also a way of marking time. Years ago, I organised my mum’s loose recipes, gluing the loose-leaf pages and lips of envelopes into a book and noting where and who they came from. The book is now a sort of collective biography of our family – a strained one.Freda Coleman was a neighbour in the late 1970s, and her marmalade cake marks the margarine years. It was, and is, an ideal cake for a family with congenital marmalade dependency: a rich pound batter into which you stir orange marmalade, which bakes into a bitter-sweet cake. The icing is as good as the cake, which you zig- zag over the top where it then sets into a hard lattice that can be pulled off, although hopefully not from the entire cake as once happened.Part of the pleasure of a cake is the smell as it bakes: marmalade bakes into an almost toffee-like sweetness, and hopefully a bit of peel at the bottom of the cake catches and the smell of that, like dark treacle, assaults your senses.Recipes are only recipes, but they can become fixed points in our lives around which other things move: with them, we can measure time, places, people. Freda’s cake – now our family cake – is one such recipe. If I could only remember the name of the person who gave me the recipe that fell out of the book, that would have a name tag too. Until then, it is just a ring cake. Both cakes are good, but the marmalade triumphs for its amber chunks of peel and icing which, because cake is 50% pleasure, 50% habit, I still want to pull off before eating a slice.This is a cake of four equal parts, plus marmalade (thick-cut or thin, you decide).

A South African shepherd's pie: Thomasina Miers' family recipe for bobotie,"An intriguing recipe handed down by Tommi’s mischievous nanna Mimi – a sort of South African, spicy version of shepherd’s pie called bobotie ",Thomasina Miers,2019-10-21T12:00:25+0100,"My maternal grandmother was known for being a tiddlywinks demon, having the naughtiest twinkle in her eye and, whenever she went home to South Africa, for disappearing into the bush to hang out with Zulu tribespeople – the people with whom she seemed to feel most at home. Her stories of her time there were always captivating, and of the recipes she made that were both homely and exotic, this was one of the best.Don’t be put off by the long list of ingredients – this is essentially a South African shepherd’s pie, only easier, with some lovely spicing thrown in.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 6-8Butter, for greasing4 tbsp olive oil3 onions, peeled and choppedSalt and black pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped2 bay leaves1½ tsp mustard seeds2 tsp curry powder½ tsp chilli flakes1 tsp turmeric1 ½ tsp garam masala1kg beef or lamb mince100ml red-wine or cider vinegar100g flaked almonds120g raisins50g fresh breadcrumbs75g fruit chutney (I like Tracklements’ Country Garden Chutney)For the topping3 eggs500ml whole milk3 bay leavesGrease a large baking dish and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. Warm a large, wide casserole pot over a medium heat and, when hot, add three tablespoons of oil.Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and sweat for 10 minutes, until soft. Stir in the garlic, bay leaves and spices and cook for another three to four minutes, until fragrant. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. When hot, season the meat with salt and pepper, and brown in the pan in two or three batches, breaking up the meat with a spoon and cooking until caramelised and dark. Once all the meat is browned, return the onion mixture to the pan and add the vinegar, almonds and raisins.Turn the heat down to low and simmer for five minutes, to allow the flavours to mingle. Take off the heat, stir in the breadcrumbs and chutney and check the seasoning. Transfer to the baking dish, smooth over with the back of a spoon and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes.To make the topping, beat together the eggs and milk and pour over the meat. Scatter over the bay leaves, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden and the custard just set. This is delicious served with brown rice and some greens.Leftover flaked almonds make the best biscuits. I love florentines, or you could mix them with honey and a little butter for a crunchy topping for shortbread. Leftover bobotie makes a killer filling for a jacket potato, so don’t eat it all at once."
Nigel Slater’s autumn recipes to take time over,"Spiced rice and pumpkin, comforting beef rib and potato, raspberry mille-feuille: layered recipes, contrasting autumn flavours",,2019-10-21T08:00:41+0100,"I am on the brink of lighting the first fire of the year. In fact, by the time you read this, I shall probably have done so. And with the cooler weather comes a different type of eating. Slower and (slightly) more complex, the sort of cooking that keep us a little longer in the kitchen but also at the table. Food to linger over.Lasagne aside, the most famous of layered recipes is probably biryani, where meat and rice is pressed down in a pot with onions and spices and often enclosed in a pastry crust. To say it’s a lot of work is an understatement. It is one those dishes I tend to leave to restaurant cooks.A somewhat simpler version can be made without meat, and without the pastry crust. I did a version this week, layering saffron rice with mashed pumpkin and spiced onions that took a good hour, but without the inevitable fuss of the classic.Serves 4onions 2 mediumgroundnut oil 4 tbspginger 60gchilli flakes 1 tsppumpkin 1.5kgwhite basmati rice 300gsaffron 2 pinchesgreen cardamom pods 12peppercorns 8bay leaves 4cinnamon 1 stickbeetroot 200gPeel and roughly chop the onions. Warm 3 tablespoons of the oil in a deep pan then add the onions and cook over a low to moderate heat. Grate the ginger and stir into the onions with the chilli flakes, and let them continue cooking until the onions are soft and golden brown – a good 25 minutes.Peel the pumpkin, cut into large pieces, then steam for 15 minutes till soft. Drain and mash with a vegetable masher or fork. Stir in black pepper and a little salt.Wash the rice in warm water: put the rice in a large bowl with plenty of warm water, stir the rice around in the water with your hand, pour off the cloudy water, then repeat twice until the water is almost clear. Drain the rice, put in a medium-sized saucepan with enough water to cover by 3cm. Add the saffron and whole cardamom pods, peppercorns, bay leaves and cinnamon stick, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the water simmers, then cover tightly with a lid. Leave to cook for 10 minutes.Remove the rice from the heat and leave to rest without removing the lid. Coarsely grate the beetroot and set aside. Lift the lid from the rice and stir briefly with a fork to separate the grains.Now assemble the dish. Pour the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the dish then add one third of the rice followed by a third of the pumpkin. Scatter a third of the onions over the pumpkin then half of the beetroot. Now continue layering until all the rice, pumpkin, onion and beetroot is finished.Bake for an hour at 200C/gas mark 6.Crab and avocado is a comfortable marriage, needing only something crisp to press all my bells at once. (I often serve carta di musica with mashed avocado and white crab meat.) I sometimes dice cucumber finely and fold it into the avocado cream too. A layer of crunch amid the smooth green cream and flakes of seafood.You can make a modern version of the seafood cocktail by layering mashed avocado, cucumber and crab meat – I use both the brick-red brown meat and the snowy needles of sweet white flesh. It can look beautiful in a wine glass, especially when the layers are put together loosely rather than tightly packed. A squeeze of lime wouldn’t go amiss and I like to put in some coriander too, a herb very much at home with both crab and avocado.Serves 4avocados 3 ripelime juice 4 tbsp red chilli 1 large cucumber ½white crab meat 250gbrown crab meat 250gcoriander leaves 3 tbsp, choppedPeel and stone the avocados, then put the flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Squeeze in the lime juice. Halve, seed and finely chop the chilli then add to the avocado and process it all to a smooth, pale green paste.Peel the cucumber, core with a teaspoon and discard the seeds, then cut first into thick strips then into small cubes and fold into the avocado cream.Check the white and brown crab meat for any remaining shell, then fork the chopped coriander through the white meat.Loosely layer the avocado and white and brown crab meats in four glasses or small dishes, chill for half an hour and serve.The first time I met the mixture of filo, spinach and feta was aboard a ferry bound for the Greek islands circa 1980 and I have loved it ever since. For all its cellophane wrapper and dubious age, I wolfed my flaky pastry parcel gratefully and have used the combination in tarts, salads and little pies ever since. (Try brushing a sheet of filo with melted butter then sprinkling it with sea salt and dried thyme. Bake till crisp, then shatter the cooked pastry and scatter over a salad of spinach leaves and feta.)This time, a roll-up of chilli-flecked spinach and melted cheese baked inside the filo. The rolled layers of vegetables, cheese and pastry formed a simple lunch with a salad of tomato, black olive and basil.Serves 6spinach 600gdill 30gfeta 400gmozzarella 375gdried chilli flakes 2-3 tspbutter 105gfilo pastry 6 sheets (about 250g)nigella seeds 2 tsppoppy seeds 2 tspsesame seeds 2 tspSet the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Wash the spinach, then, with the leaves still wet, place it in a large saucepan over a moderate heat. Cover tightly with a lid and let the leaves cook in their own steam for a minute or two till wilted. Tip them into a colander and squeeze out any moisture.Roughly chop the spinach and the dill and mix them together. Coarsely grate the feta and mozzarella into the spinach and dill, then season with black pepper and the chilli flakes. Melt the butter in a small pan.Place a sheet of filo on a work surface or chopping board. Brush generously with some of the melted butter. Place a second sheet on top, butter it, then repeat with a third sheet. With the longest edge towards you, shape half of the filling in a long sausage, along the nearest edge.Roll the pastry away from you, covering the filling and forming a long cylinder. Transfer to a baking tin.Now repeat with the remaining three sheets of pastry and the remaining filling. Place the second roll close to the first. Brush with the last of the butter then sprinkle with the nigella, poppy and sesame seeds.Bake for about 20 minutes till the pastry is pale gold, then serve immediately.It was the first properly cold morning of autumn when we set about making this deeply comforting dish. Layers of potato and cheap, bone-in meat for a night when the chestnut leaves are piling up in the lane outside the house. The hands-on cooking time here is minimal, involving little more than the slicing of onions and Maris Pipers, but the unattended cooking time, when the recipe gets on with things itself, is a good two hours. The dish is all the better for that, the flavours deepen and the separate elements – the meat, stock and potatoes – become, deliciously, as one.During the layering of meat and potatoes I like to tuck in the stripped rib bones, and in so doing extracting every last bit of goodness and savour from them. On the side, a crisp white cabbage salad, perhaps (olive oil, white wine vinegar, dill), and some bread with which to sponge up the herb-stippled juices.Serves 6 beef short ribs 1.4kgolive oil 4 tbsponions 3 mediumthyme 8 sprigsrosemary 4 bushy sprigsbay leaves 4black peppercorns 8beef stock 2 litreslarge potatoes 1kgCut the beef into ribs. Warm the oil in a large, deep-sided pan, then brown the ribs all over, taking care as they may spit and pop. Turn the ribs over with kitchen tongs as they colour, removing them to a plate when their fat is golden.Peel and thinly slice the onions then put them into the pan in which you have just browned the beef, adding the thyme, rosemary, bay and peppercorns, and lower the heat to moderate. Let the onions cook, giving them the occasional stir, for about 20 minutes, until they are soft and light gold.Return the beef ribs to the pan, together with any juices from the plate, then pour over the beef stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the liquid quietly putters, partially cover with a lid, and leave for 1 hour or until the meat can easily be cut from the bones.Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Remove the ribs from the pan and pull the meat from the bones. Slice the potatoes thinly, using a mandoline if you have one, a large cook’s knife if not. In a large, shallow baking dish or roasting tin, layer the potatoes and the meat and onions, seasoning each layer as you go with salt and black pepper, then pour over the stock from the pan.Bake for an hour to 90 minutes, until the potatoes are soft and giving.As much as I like the idea of the classic layered mille-feuille I feel it only works when the pastry is very dark, thin and crisp and the filling involves a few sharp fruits to contrast the soft, billowing blandness of the cream. Raspberries, blackberries and blackcurrants then, rather than peaches and strawberries. You can go further with the contrasting textures by adding crushed brittle or almond or pistachio praline to the whipped cream. The cream is best when beaten until only just thick enough to spread.Serves 8caster sugar 125gshelled pistachios 125gpuff pastry 320gdouble cream 500mlraspberries 250gTo decorateicing sugar 3 tbspraspberries 125gYou will need a small, lightly oiled baking sheet and two large baking sheets, one of which is lined with baking parchment.Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 8. Put the sugar in a non-stick shallow pan over a low to moderate heat. Watch very carefully as it melts, then, when it is golden, add the shelled pistachios. As the sugar darkens to a deep bronze, tip the mixture out onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and leave to cool.Roll out the pastry to a rectangle measuring 28cm x 33cm. Transfer to the baking sheet lined with baking parchment. Place a second sheet of parchment on top, then cover with the second large baking sheet. Place a heavy roasting tin on top then bake for 15-20 minutes.Remove the roasting tin, baking sheet and top layer of parchment, then continue to bake for a further five minutes or until the pastry is deep golden brown and very crisp.Break the pistachio brittle into large pieces and reduce to coarse crystals using a food processor. If you prefer, pound the brittle to crumbs with a pestle and mortar.Whip the cream until thick. Crush the raspberries with a fork and fold them into the cream together with three quarters of the crushed nut brittle. Cut the pastry in half lengthways and trim the edges, crushing the trimmings to crumbs with a knife.Place one of the two sheets of pastry on a serving dish or board. Spoon the cream, fruit and nut filling on top, smooth the surface flat pushing the cream right to the edge of the pastry, then cover with the second piece of pastry. Press down lightly on the cake with your hands or a baking sheet to settle the layers of cream and pastry.Smooth the edges flat with a palette knife, then cover the sides with the reserved pastry crumbs, pushing them in with the knife.To decorate, mix the reserved brittle with the icing sugar, then scatter over the top of the cake. Place the remaining raspberries along the top and serve.@NigelSlater"
Nigel Slater’s crab and harissa croquettes and white chocolate and lemon buns recipes,"Delicious bite-sized morsels, savoury and sweet",Nigel Slater,2019-10-20T10:30:53+0100,"I go on about the pleasures of sharing, but there is something appealing about having a little something to yourself. A golden croquette, hot from the pan, to wolf in one go. Or perhaps a dainty bun of choux pastry filled with cream, its surface tacky with chocolate fondant…I splashed out on some dressed crab this week, padded out the snow-white needles of flesh with a few breadcrumbs, rolled them into balls and deep fried the lot. Toothsome, an old fashioned and totally appropriate word for a crisp morsel of crab with the faintest hint of brick-red harissa, but you couldn’t really think of them as a meal. We passed a batch of them round in a basket while drinking beers and eating thin slices of deep maroon, fat-marbled ham. No forks were necessary, although a napkin or two wouldn’t have gone amiss. Should you feel they would make supper, roll each one into the size of a plump scallop and serve with a tangle of green beans, lightly steamed then tossed in a shallow pan of finely chopped bacon and its glorious fat.In my house, puddings and pastries are on the menu. Crumbs of comfort in a world gone madI should mention that I put mayonnaise in my crab croquettes and I do know it sounds a little odd, but I have been doing so for more than 20 years. The addition does more than bind the crab and crumbs – it is partly responsible for the soft, silk-like texture of the filling.Perhaps to take our minds away from other events, I made a tray of sweet choux pastries, too, filled not only with cream but with nuggets of chopped chocolate. In my house, puddings and pastries are back on the menu with a vengeance. Crumbs of comfort in a world gone mad.If I have time, I will often prepare a crab myself, cracking the shell and tugging out the flesh with a skewer. It’s a deliciously messy job for a Saturday morning. That said, for fritters and these golden-shelled croquettes, it is worth considering the ready-picked fresh crab sold in tubs. I suggest the crisp panko crumbs, available in supermarkets and Japanese shops, for their ease and lightness. You can use fresh breadcrumbs, dried in the oven until crisp, if you prefer.Serves 4white crab meat 450gpanko crumbs 125gspring onions 3parsley leaves 7g (a handful)coriander leaves 7g (a handful)eggs 2grain mustard 1 tbspharissa 2 tspmayonnaise 120gYou will also need oil for deep fryingPut the crab and breadcrumbs into a large mixing bowl. Finely slice the spring onions, then chop the parsley and coriander leaves. Add all three to the crab and mix gently.In a second bowl, break the eggs and beat lightly to mix yolks and whites, then blend in the mustard, harissa and mayonnaise. Stir into the crab gently combining crab, crumbs and seasoning.Shape the crab mixture into 20 balls, each weighing approximately 45g, rolling them lightly in your hands, floured if necessary. Let the balls settle for 20 minutes in the fridge.Pour enough oil into a pan in which to deep fry the croquettes and heat to 180C on a kitchen thermometer. Place one of the croquettes on a draining spoon and lower into the oil – it should crackle immediately – followed by 5 or more of the others, taking care not to crowd the pan. Keep an eye on the heat – you need it to remain fairly static. Fry the croquettes for 2-3 minutes until golden, lift out and drain on kitchen paper then repeat with further batches until the mixture is finished. Serve hot, with halves of lemon or lime.A bun filled with cream and nibs of chocolate, finished with a gossamer-thin coating of lemon icing. A frivolous thing, a treat for a Sunday afternoon. Lemon has a welcome effect on white chocolate, diluting the latter’s tendency to cloy by adding a clean, fresh note. Use dark chocolate if you prefer.Makes 8For the buns:water 125mlbutter 50gstrong white flour 75gsalt a good pincheggs 2, beatenFor the filling and icing:white chocolate 100gdouble cream 250glemon curd 125gicing sugar 175glemon juice 2 tbspSet the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment.Pour the water into a small saucepan, add the butter and let it melt, then add the flour and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon until you have a thick paste, then remove from the heat. Transfer the paste to the bowl of a food mixer and add the beaten eggs, a little at a time, beating at a fast pace with a flat paddle attachment. When you have a thick, creamy, sticky dough, place 8 generously heaped tbsp of the mixture on the prepared baking sheet.Bake the buns for approximately 25 minutes, until well risen and crisp, then remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Finely chop the chocolate and set aside. Using a chilled bowl, whip the cream, until thick enough to spoon into the buns. Very gently fold in the chocolate and the lemon curd. Pierce a hole in each bun using a chop stick or small knife then push in the cream with a teaspoon. If you have a piping bag, use that. Set the buns back on the wire rack. Sift the icing sugar into a bowl, stir in the lemon juice then spoon over the buns and leave to set.The Observer publishes recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide"
Yin and yang: what's the difference between a shallot and an onion?,"Though recipes frequently use them interchangeably, shallots are a different beast from onions – and you can even use them in desserts",,2019-10-19T20:00:40+0100,"Let’s be clear: a shallot is not an onion. You could be forgiven for thinking they are the same, and substituting them for onions in a recipe. Very few recipe writers will specify shallots for this reason, myself included sometimes. It’s so much more convenient just to say “onion”.Editors will say to me: “No one will know the difference, so why fuss?” But you should fuss, because shallots have a completely different flavour profile. Shallots are yin to the onion’s yang.I grew up thinking shallots and onions were the same, too. In Thai, shallots were referred to as hohm. I should have realised something was up, as the literal translation is “fragrant”.No one in their right mind would sniff a raw onion and call it fragrant. If you sniff a shallot, however, I could understand that. It’s still going to make your eyes water, but it is not as pungent. Shallots are more delicate and aromatically perfumed, much sweeter to eat raw.Randy Moon, one of the “Four Horsemen” behind my favourite wine bar in NYC (with a killer menu, too) says onions are a crucial base note to dishes that require a long cooking time. Some of the world’s greatest dishes have onions as a starting point. Meanwhile, shallots are the top note.“Everything in its place and a place for everything,” is what mise en place means, and that’s the motto for all self-respecting cooks and chefs. There’s a place for shallots, and a place for onions.Use shallots raw in a salad and they will sing harmoniously with your other veg; use onions when making a stew. Shallots when you require finesse, onions when you need weight.Shallots are in the allium family (Allium cepa, if we’re being pedantic) and look very much like onions. But, surprisingly, they’re more closely related to garlic than onions. Shallots grow like garlic, with clusters of offsets genetically identical to their mother bulb, whereas onions are a loner bulb, and easier to grow from seed.Shallots come in a few different forms. Most common in Australia are the French red eschallot. Long and tapered, they’re daintily pretty. Cuter still are the petite Asian shallots. They are clumpier and fiddlier to peel, but the extra sweat is worth it. Their colour varies from yellow to pinky grey to an eye-catching deep crimson.In the last decade, they’ve become easier to find in Australia. The first time I came across them, my eyes bulged. It was at a Vietnamese-owned farm in Darwin, where massive piles were being cured. I bought as many as I could fit in my suitcase to take back to my kitchen in Sydney, where I gleefully used them in place of everything calling for an onion in Asian recipes.Onions aren’t common in south and south-east Asian culinary traditions. When chefs and cooks come to Australia, where onions are plentiful, they sigh in relief. Peeling a box of onions is a walk in the park compared with peeling a box of itty bitty shallots. That’s why in restaurants, Asian ones included, you will nary see a shallot, even if it is traditionally called for. But don’t be put off from using them at home. The rewards are many.Upon cooking, shallots excrete a lot less moisture than onions, which makes them a better choice to fry until crisp. You can buy them ready-fried in Asian grocers, but why not make it a Sunday afternoon meditative experience? The benefits of that session will be a hundredfold.Store-bought fried shallots are often rancid, and fried using dubious sources of palm oil. Making it yourself, you can use a much better quality oil. My current obsession is macadamia oil, which has a fantastically high heating point and great health benefits too. Macadamia oil is rich in oleic acid and monounsaturated fatty acids, and it’s high in omegas three and six. When combined with the high levels of polyphenols and flavonoids (anti-oxidants) from the shallot, it’s practically a superfood flavour bomb.Fried shallots are incredibly versatile. You can use them as a garnishing flourish on anything you like to finish a dish. Pasta, noodles, rice, soups, vegetables, meat … even dessert. Seriously.That’s what Thais do. It’s not weird … not at all.I used fried shallot recently in the dessert course of a dinner I cooked in New York, a royal cuisine dish called som chun: iced fresh fruit, perfumed with a floral aromatic syrup, bergamot, fresh ginger, sliced macadamias and finished with crisp fried shallots.Try it this summer. It teeters on the balance between fresh sweetness from seasonal fruit and savoury flavour from the shallots.Just don’t try it with onions. It wouldn’t be the same.Fried Shallots6 shallots500ml macadamia oilGrey salt to seasonGet into the zone, with nowhere to be but peeling and finely slicing the shallots. You don’t need to halve them before you slice, as once they fry up they will shrink.On the highest element, heat the oil in wok or frying pan for about five minutes. Gently nudge the shallots into the oil and watch it bubble away. Turn down the heat to low-medium. Resist the urge to push it around for approximately five minutes.Then get at it using a wooden paddle or spatula and stir the shallots around the pan constantly. Stand by the stove, focus on your breathing and inhale the smell of allium delight. If you don’t want your entire house to smell like shallots, I highly advise you to turn on the hood to the highest extraction and open your windows.Once the shallots start to turn a golden brown, take them off the heat and drain into a steel mesh colander, lined with a few paper towels. Have a stainless steel bowl underneath the colander to catch all the oil. Cool the shallots down, then toss a teaspoon of salt into them. Stored in an airtight container, you can keep them refrigerated for up to six months.Keep the oil separately in another jar and use it for salad dressings or as a finishing oil for absolutely anything and everything. These will become your favourite pantry staples. They are for me."
Liam Charles' recipe for coconut bread pudding – direct from his nan's kitchen,"Nan’s always right, and as ever she gets it spot-on with this coconut-infused bread pudding",Liam Charles,2019-10-19T11:00:25+0100,"I bake and my nan cooks. Well, I cook as well, but you know what I mean. I have to admit, there have been a few times when Nan has stepped on my territory, the baking world.Did she succeed?

Meera Sodha’s family recipe for vegan Gujarati tomato curry,From western India via Uganda comes this vegan curry made irresistable when topped with crunchy fried noodles known as sev,Meera Sodha,2019-10-19T10:00:26+0100,"This is an ancient Gujarati dish from the Kathiyawad peninsula, where my ancestors are from. This recipe was carried by my great grandfather in the 1940s when he set sail for Uganda with his big ambitions and his sev sancha (a little machine that’s used to make chickpea flour noodles).The recipe travelled again decades later, in 1972, with my grandparents when they left Uganda for Britain. It was passed on to me by my mother last year, and now it’s yours for safekeeping.The recipe has stayed the same; it’s only the cook and the times that have changed.You might think that tomatoes are out of season, but the Isle of Wight’s Tomato Stall still supplies much of the UK for another few weeks yet.The sev – super-thin, fried chickpea noodles often called “nylon” sev – can easily be bought here in the UK: try the world food or ethnic aisles at bigger supermarkets, your local Indian grocer or online. Eat this with another vegetable curry (such as my potato and spinach curry), rice and/or chapatis.Prep 10 minCook 15 minServes 4 as part of a main meal3 tbsp rapeseed oil ¾ tsp mustard seeds 1 big pinch fenugreek seeds 5 fat garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1kg mixed tomatoes, quarteredSalt1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder1 tsp ground coriander ¾ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp tomato puree30-50g nylon sevFresh coriander, shredded, to serveIn a large frying pan for which you have a lid, heat the oil over a medium heat until it’s shimmering hot. Add the mustard and fenugreek seeds, leave them to pop for a minute, then add the minced garlic. Stir until the garlic is golden and getting sticky in the pan – this will take a minute, possibly two – then add the tomatoes and a big pinch of salt. Stir to combine, then cover the pan and leave everything to cook on a high heat for five minutes – it should be bubbling fiercely. Add the chilli, ground coriander, cumin, turmeric, tomato puree and a couple of tablespoons of water, if need be to loosen the mixture, cover again and cook for a further two minutes.Taste and adjust the salt or chilli, if you wish, then distribute the curry across four bowls and add a small handful of sev and a sprinkle of coriander to each.

From coconut curry to hoppel poppel: Yotam Ottolenghi’s family recipes,"A diverse heritage has led to Yotam’s eclectic toolkit of international hand-me-down recipes, from Germany via the American Midwest to Malaysia",Yotam Ottolenghi,2019-10-19T09:30:22+0100,"The food legacy handed down to me by my parents is probably best embodied by hoppel poppel, a leftovers dish featuring potato, onion, sausage and egg, all mixed together into a glorious hodgepodge. It’s a kind-of bubble and squeak, and comes from my mother’s German heritage but, with pork sausage at its core, it couldn’t be more distasteful to the two other cultures that dominated my early years in Israel: Jewish and Arabic.It also didn’t work at all for my father, a proud Italian and a master of refined understatement in the kitchen. The beauty of today, though, is that I get to choose my childhood favourites from a whole range of formidable and delicious traditions.This soup is a speciality of my father’s. It uses the tiniest amount of potato to thicken the base while still keeping the soup light and fresh. My dad would buy in pickles to garnish his, but I’ve made my own quick one here.

Add the vinegar and sugar, toss to mix, then leave to pickle for 30 minutes while you get on with the soup.Put the potato and 700ml water in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once it’s simmering, add the leeks and cook for eight minutes, or until the vegetables have softened. Drain and leave to cool for 15 minutes.Transfer the leeks and potatoes to a blender, add the yoghurt, ice, parsley, garlic, two tablespoons of olive oil, 100ml water, all the chopped cucumber, 150g of the pickled cucumber and a tablespoon and a half of its pickling liquid, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, then blend until very smooth. Transfer to the fridge to chill for about an hour, or longer if you want to get ahead.To serve, divide between four bowls, top with the remaining pickled cucumber (discarding its liquid) and drizzle with the last tablespoon of oil.My mother made this, a Berliner dish that became very popular in the American midwest, with leftover cooked potatoes. The meat element can be sausage (any sausage, really) or bacon, and she’d serve it with a tomato and cucumber salad dressed with lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic.

Once hot, fry the onion, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned – about six minutes. Add the potato and frankfurters, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and fry, again stirring occasionally, until everything is starting to brown and crisp up – another five or so minutes. Stir in the green pepper and cook, shaking the pan often, until it softens and everything is nicely coloured – about seven minutes.Turn down the heat to medium, add the last 10g butter and swirl the pan to melt. Pour in the egg mix, sprinkle on the cheese and cook for about three minutes, gently folding over the mixture here and there with a spatula, though without mixing everything completely together. Sprinkle over the extra chives and serve directly from the pan.My mum’s favourite cookbook was Myra Waldo’s The Complete Round-The-World Cookbook from 1954. It would take her to all corners of the globe, and we were her guinea pigs. This sweet, coconutty dish became her favourite, and ours, too. It’s not one bit authentic, but it is addictive.

Tip into a bowl, and set aside one tablespoon to garnish.Meanwhile, put the ginger, garlic, turmeric, chilli, star anise, coriander seeds and three tablespoons of water in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz to a coarse paste, scraping down the sides a few times as you go.Heat the oil in the same saute pan on a medium-high flame and, once hot, fry the onion, stirring now and then, until softened and lightly browned – about seven minutes. Add the spice paste and cook for another two minutes, until fragrant. Add the chicken, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is no longer pink on the outside – another seven minutes or so – then stir in the lime zest, jam, coconut milk, 120ml water and the toasted coconut. Bring the mix up to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover the pan and leave to cook for 40 minutes. Remove the lid, turn up the heat to medium and cook, stirring now and then, for seven minutes more, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick and rich. Stir in the lime juice.Transfer to a shallow serving platter and drizzle with the extra coconut milk. Sprinkle with the reserved toasted coconut and the coriander leaves, and serve warm.

'Mozart would have made video game music': composer Eímear Noone on a winning art form,The Irish composer and conductor – who’s worked with film director Gus Van Sant and on World of Warcraft – talks passionately about making game music,Keith Stuart,2019-10-22T07:01:11+0100,"Eímear Noone got into composing and conducting video game music by accident. One day, while studying music at Trinity College Dublin, a fourth-year student came to the bar she was drinking in with members of the college chapel choir and offered them a few quid to help with the orchestration on a project of his.“I have a vivid memory of sitting on a studio floor somewhere in Dublin writing choral parts with my pals and then singing them,” she says. “Six months later, my brother calls me in a complete tizzy and says, ‘Did you work on Metal Gear Solid?’ I was like, ‘No!’ He says, ‘Well, I’m looking at your name on the screen credits right now.’ And sure enough, the session she had contributed to for beer money was the soundtrack to Hideo Kojima’s blockbuster adventure game. “Years later, I was at the Bird’s Nest in Beijing conducting this very piece of music,” she says. “It’s just a bizarre life.”Noone is now a successful composer for films and video games, having contributed scores for directors such as Gus Van Sant and Joe Dante, and for games such as World of Warcraft, Diablo III and Hearthstone. In November, she will present her second series of High Score, Classic FM’s programme dedicated to game music. Underappreciated outside of game fandom for years, the genre now has dedicated orchestras playing sold-out concert tours around the world. And Noone is a passionate advocate to explore and explain the unique elements of the form.There is, naturally, a foundational similarity between game and film scores: they are both composed to accompany and accentuate screened action. But while a film score needs to accompany a two-hour linear experience with specific cues and events, video game music must be present for many hours of play. Most open-word action adventures, such as Assassin’s Creed Origins, Witcher 3 and Final Fantasy XV, offer more than 100 hours of narrative, but many players will spend much longer exploring their worlds.Music has two roles in games: it accompanies the noninteractive cinematic sequences that set up the story and occur throughout a game (sort of like short animated movie sequences) and they provide background music while you play. “Cinematic are scored very similarly to a movie or an animated film,” says Noone. “The composer will be given an animatic, which could be anything from a fully rendered sequence to just stick figures on screen. But the edit is pretty close to what it’ll be in the end.“But when music needs to respond to changes the player makes in the world, we employ a kind of loop system. We use a recording method known as striping – we might record the strings separately, for example, but we’ll compose in a way that the strings on their own provide a functioning piece of music. Then, if our character triggers something in the world, perhaps a battle, we can land the wood winds or brass on top of that to increase the intensity. Each part must be self-contained yet work with others – you need to be able to kick in the brass, kick in the percussion, whenever its triggered by gameplay. It’s like a Rubik’s cube puzzle! This is the kind of thing Mozart would have enjoyed – he loved puzzles. Mozart would have loved making game music.”Noone also points out that video game scores help establish the reality of the world the player is about to explore: the instruments used, the style of music, the pace and tempo all work with the art and design to give the players clues about how the universe functions. “The composer has to put you in the headspace of the world, emotionally and intellectually,” she says. “Often these are fantasy worlds, but to ensure they make sense they must have their own rules – and the composer must abide by them. I had a fan contact me once who said ‘I was just listening to the score of World of Warcraft and there are electric guitars! There are no electric guitars in Azeroth!’ But these rules are important – they help make an authentic fantasy world.”For Noone, the most satisfying part is composing the themes that accompany the player throughout the interactive experience. “In-game music is where the composer gets the most freedom – it’s where we creates the big themes,. This is where a lot of the music we perform live with orchestras comes from; it’s the big identifiable themes that players associated with the game and with the characters.“Take the music of Koji Kondo – as soon as you hear the theme from Legend of Zelda, you’re right back in the game, you’re back in the time period in your life that you played it and you’re back with the people you played it with. It’s like hearing a great pop song playing over and over again on the radio – it encapsulates that time for you, it’s in bars, it’s in shops … and with video game music, you live with that soundtrack for the entire time you’re playing the game. It’s not two hours, it’s however long you spend in that game, which can be years.“Game soundtracks become the soundtracks to people’s childhoods, the soundtracks to their second childhoods and their children’s childhoods! More people are listening to orchestral music through video games than ever before in the history of recorded music.”Noone moves on to another difference between film and video game music: they follow different trends. “In film, there’s a stylistic trend at the moment away from the big theme,” she says. “Directors talk a lot about texture. But it seems that video game directors still embrace the big theme, and that’s good for composers because we want to write something more involving.”She is passionate and defensive about game music and its merits. I ask her if the medium, with its lush symphonic orchestration, is kind of old-fashioned – if you compare it to where modern instrumental music is going? I bring up Elgar and his use of big sweeping themes as an example of where game music seems to be and she smiles broadly. “Actually, this is a really good example because when Elgar was writing that music it would have been really uncool – it’s very emotional, it’s visual but at the time there was a lot of atonal music, things were changing, going into serialism even – and Elgar was writing these big lush emotional tunes – how dare he?!”So it’s quite radical for video game music to be overtly lush and emotional? “This is the music of the 21st century,” she says. “Look, we do have atonal music in video games – listen to Garry Schyman’s BioShock score, for instance. I just sat on a panel with Krzysztof Penderecki and his influence is all over horror games. It’s all about the context. There’s a gorgeous mobile game Contre Jour – it’s very visually different, and the piano score is reminiscent of the score to Amélie. I hear the influence of Glass or Reich in lots of what you might consider more traditional classically influenced scores – especially Steve Reich’s Proverb, the vocals on that. Ethereal vocals are definitely part of the video game music style.”For the next season of High Score, Noone has lined up some themed features dealing with specific elements of game music. One show is all about Japanese soundtracks, from the seminal work of Nobuo Uematsu and Yoko Shimomura, who operate in the western orchestral tradition, to J-pop-inspired Masato Nakamura, composer for Sonic the Hedgehog, who is part of the band, Dreams Come True. She also has a programme dedicated to nostalgia, looking back at the earliest works of composers such as Nintendo’s Koji Kondo, who started out on arcade games in the mid-1980s. Before the arrival of CD-Rom technology in the early 1990s, game soundtracks had to be programmed directly to sound chips, with only a very limited amount of memory available.Noone thinks this process was vital in forming the unique sound of game scores. “The reason some of these themes endure, especially Koji Kondo’s, is he had to sit down and painstakingly programme the themes in note by note – so every note mattered – he had to really seriously plan it. If you look at Beethoven’s manuscripts you’ll see him start with a complex theme and then cut that back and he ends up with the opening of the fifth symphony. Similarly, Koji had to refine and chisel down – and that’s why the themes from Mario and Zelda endure: they had to be simple but effective and meaningful.”Noone’s programmes then are going to be an interesting listen for game and music fans who want to understand why scores sound the way they do – and she can be amusingly honest about how game scores (just like film scores) have tropes and techniques that composers will rely on again and again. “If I’m going to be really simplistic, we all know instantly that when the chord of C major goes to F sharp major then back to C major, there’s a spaceship about to fly over head,” she laughs.“Flat five one or sharp four one is a spaceship flying over. That’s it. Every time.”• Eímear Noone presents the new series of High Score from 9 November at 9-10pm on Classic FM."
"Fortnite Chapter 2 is live with new map, weapons and more","It’s back on! Out of the black hole, a whole new world begins, bringing fresh characters, weapons and maybe a redesigned progress system",Keith Stuart,2019-10-15T12:03:11+0100,"It begins. In familiar Fortnite fashion, the first news of the game’s future arrived throughout Monday night, not via official channels, but via the army of celebrity YouTubers and specialist leak accounts spread across social media. Rumours suggested the game may launch at any point in the next few hours.Then we got the cinematic trailer for what will be known as Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1, showing four new characters arriving at dawn on a brand new island, featuring a beach area and gloop-spewing power plant. At the close of the trailer, the battle bus arrives, filled with familiar superstars from the game’s previous seasons, including our own personal favourite, Cuddle Team Leader.Also leaked online was a new Battle Pass trailer showing a fresh range of weapons and a new in-game levelling up system in which players are awarded medals for carrying out tasks such as surviving into the Top 50 players and making head shots – these medals are collected on a punchcard which no doubt unlocks items. This trailer also shows players hopping across the landscape on pogo sticks. Yes, there are going to be pogo sticks.As from right now, the new update is downloadable and a text intro tells us that the Visitor managed to stop the destruction of the universe at the last moment. Players are then dropped straight into a live game, allowing them to explore the map, opening up and revealing new sections as they go.We’ve only had a few minutes play but it’s clear the landscape features remixed versions of classic areas such as Risky Reels and Pleasant Park, as well as totally new discoveries such as Craggy Cliffs, a small town with a range of olde worlde buildings and takeaways, and Sweaty Sands, a hotel and apartment complex complete with rooftop tanning areas. We’ve already had a swim in a spa pool, sped around in a motorboat, found a fishing rod and seen a lighthouse on a distant shoreline. We noticed that the Playground and Creative modes have also been updated.So we’re back in Fortnite again, sooner than expected, and with an impressively stable server experience. There’s a lot to discover in this new if familiar environment, and fans will perhaps be relieved that this isn’t a total reimagining of the beloved Fortnite world with its fluffy trees, rolling hills and eccentric architecture. It will be interesting to see how the new systems work, and how Fortnite Chapter 2 deals with the problem of rivals such as Apex Legends, which brought in the ability to revive downed teammates, putting Epic Games on the back foot. For Chapter 2, Fortnite is adding bandage bazookas, which you can fire at team mates to heal them, and the ability to carry knocked teammates to safety, adding new strategic elements to those frantic gun fights.Other features we’re yet to see include hiding locations such as haystacks and dumpsters, allowing you to leap out on unsuspecting foes, and explosive gas tanks and barrels, to take out enemies when you don’t have grenades. Most interesting is the addition of a weapon upgrade bench so you can tweak your guns with resources discovered during play.Right now, as we charge across a hillside trading gunfire with a man dressed as a golden medieval knight carrying a submachine gun, what’s most striking is that this is very much Fortnite, just in a nice new playground, with fresh rides and the odd surprise. In other words, everything we wanted."
Fortnite has reached The End – changing video game storytelling for good,"Season 10 of Fortnite climaxed in apocalyptic fashion – sucking gamers into a black hole. Whatever the future brings, it has transformed video-game storytelling",Keith Stuart,2019-10-14T11:24:35+0100,"On Sunday evening, more than 6 million people gathered online via streaming services such as Twitch and YouTube to watch the end of the world. Not our world, thankfully, but the world of Fortnite, which was sucked into a black hole, taking the whole game and all player characters with it. If you try to load Fortnite today, you’ll be presented with a blank screen. When developer Epic Games called the finale of Fortnite Season 10 “The End”, it wasn’t kidding.OK, before confused parents start celebrating, let’s be clear: Fortnite will be back, it’s just that Epic has closed out the first chapter of the game, which has amassed 250 million players since the launch of its Battle Royale mode in September 2017. And amid all the hype, hysteria and controversy that has surrounded the gigantically successful title over the past two years, one aspect has been overlooked outside its fanbase: this has been one of the most innovative story experiments of the decade.There is no conventional “narrative” to Fortnite Battle Royale – Epic doesn’t provide an origin story for its endless 100-player wars, it doesn’t give us long cinematic scenes with characters explaining the world, the factions and the plot. Instead, Fortnite is split into a series of three-month-long seasons, each with a climactic event that suggests some kind of interdimensional struggle taking place over the future of the game’s isolated island locale.The plot began in Season Three when players noticed space rocks hitting the surface of the island as they played. Season Four opened with a huge meteor crash, which destroyed the Dusty Depot area of the map, and then at the close of the season, a rocket flew out of the impact site in a live, in-game event visible to all players online at the time – an incredible technical achievement, and a fascinating new way to tell stories within a non-persistent multiplayer universe.From here, each season brought some new anomaly to the world, including giant alien cubes and vast volcanoes, all seemingly part of a fissure in space-time. But players were never told exactly what was going on – everything played out through dramatic season events, and clever little environmental storytelling features, such as in-game television screens suddenly showing countdowns, and new scenic features such as impenetrable bunkers appearing in the woods, with no explanation.Through this system of events and signs, a kind of narrative economy emerged between players. Fans took to Reddit forums in their millions to discuss findings and theorise over what the latest signals could mean. These theories were focused and amplified by the game’s biggest YouTube players – especially Fortnite superstar Ninja – who made videos, picking through clues they and other players had found in the landscape.Environmental storytelling has always been a key element of video game design. When you have a world that players are free to explore, it makes sense to fill that world with story-enhancing elements, rewarding players for having a good look round. Hidden audiotapes, emails and scrolls are a familiar element of action adventure titles such as Assassin’s Creed, Mass Effect and Grand Theft Auto. But these are grand, single-player experiences, where narrative discovery is a key element.In short, it's a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a flying bus on to a small island and then fight until only one is left. Hidden around are weapons and traps, and players must arm themselves while exploring.Fortnite started in July 2017 as a four-player cooperative survival game, but the game's developer, Epic, noticed the huge success of PC title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which pits 100 players against each other, and decided to release a new version.The game is free and players are able to unlock new items as they progress without paying anything. A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items.It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. Players can pull a variety of dance moves, and team up with a friend to compete as a duo or a squad. Participants can chat as they play using headsets and microphones.Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements – nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers – into one package that is free to download.Fortnite Battle Royale, on the other hand, is a multiplayer online game where players interact with the world in discrete 20-minute sessions. Ostensibly, there’s no need for a narrative – Epic could, in theory, retain player interest simply by making sure there is a steady supply of new dance moves, costumes and scenic features to enjoy. Instead, the studio has built a vast functional universe in which an alien known as The Visitor is attempting to mend the space-time fissure around the island, and communicated this through systems of signs, signals and miracles – sort of like the Medieval Christian church. Indeed, it’s interesting how Fortnite has co-opted a lot of religious symbolism into the game’s suggestive narrative, from comets trailing across the sky, to the decidedly apocalyptic imagery of fire, brimstone and global destruction.For Season 10, Epic was always building toward something vast and catastrophic and upped the narrative signalling accordingly. Throughout the last months players have been able to find audiotapes hidden around the map in which The Visitor has made recordings about his attempts to fix a loop in time and prevent a singularity. It sounds like the ravings of a conspiracy theorist, echoing back the most extreme theories from the fanbase itself.And then in the game’s final moments on Sunday evening, a giant explosion took place, sucking the world into a black vortex, leaving players stunned and confused. Brilliantly, Epic took the explosion out of the “fiction” of the game, so that the menu pages and user interface were also pulled into the black hole. To complete the meta-narrative, players who looked up the game’s server status found the narrative had even extended here:Mad props to everyone on the @FortniteGame team for the brilliant execution of this season’s end. I really appreciate the little details like the server status (see picture below). This STW player is excited to see what’s next! 😊 #Fortnite #FortniteChapter2 pic.twitter.com/jGHnJLlMfbFortnite has been criticised as a shallow, cynical machine of compulsion, its trendy dances and outlandish outfits a means of ensnaring younger players. But as a purveyor of new forms of storytelling, in which the community is left to construct its own narrative based around subtle semiotic systems and climactic events, it is a fascinating innovator.In many ways, video-game storytelling is still young. The artform is barely 40 years old as a mass medium – compare that to the movie business (taking the Lumière brothers’ Cinématographe as our start point), which was only just getting into era of colour after four decades. We have seen the rise of massively multiplayer adventures such as World of Warcraft, where global arching narratives are woven into the largely player-directed quests, and we have seen plenty of interesting live story experiments, such as the mostly single-player adventure Dark Souls allowing players to leave messages to each other within the game.But Fortnite is playing with storytelling concepts, tropes and systems while also providing a piece of blockbuster entertainment for millions of mostly teenage players. It’s like a new Marvel superhero movie being performed entirely in interpretive dance.When Chapter 2 inevitably begins, bringing a new landscape with new gameplay features, it will be interesting to see where Epic goes next on its somewhat transgressive storytelling odyssey. It is, after all, quite hard to top the end of the world as a narrative device."
PlayStation 5 v Xbox Scarlett: the next console war begins in 2020,"Sony’s PS5 will have haptic feedback, while Microsoft’s competing console will have four times the power of Xbox One. Here’s how the two high-end machines compare",Keith Stuart,2019-10-09T10:07:34+0100,"The next console war has a start date – or at least a start period. Sony has announced that its next console, PlayStation 5 (PS5), will be launched next autumn/winter, putting it in direct competition with Microsoft’s forthcoming Xbox Scarlett, also due in time for the 2020 Christmas holiday period.In a post on the PlayStation site, Sony revealed that PS5 will have a new controller that replaces the current joypad’s rumble feature with more sensitive and contextual haptic feedback.“With haptics, you truly feel a broader range of feedback,” Sony said. “Crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field. You can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.”The console will also have “adaptive triggers” incorporated into the L2 and R2 trigger buttons. Developers will be able to program the resistance of the triggers so that players, “feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain”. Microsoft is experimenting with a similar technology for its Scarlett controller.This is not the only apparent similarity between the competing consoles. In April, Sony revealed that PS5 would feature an eight-core CPU based on the third generation of AMD’s Ryzen processors, as well as a custom graphics processor based on the AMD Navi family (a technology capable of real-time ray-tracing effects), and a solid state drive (SSD), which will mean the faster loading of games and in-game content, and may also allow more granular loading processes, so players can choose to install only a game’s multiplayer component, or its campaign. The machine will support 8K resolution displays and 120Hz screen refresh rates.Meanwhile, Xbox Scarlett will also utilise the latest AMD Ryzen processor and Navi graphics chipset; it will support screen resolutions of up to 8K and 120Hz refresh rates, and it will use an SSD rather than a traditional hard-disc drive. In addition, Scarlett is set to offer backwards compatibility for all Xbox One games as well as the Xbox and Xbox 360 titles that are available via Xbox One’s backward compatibility feature.Little else is known about the machines. Sony has spoken about PS5’s 3D audio capabilities, using a custom AMD sound chip to create incredibly immersive effects. In an interview with Wired, system architect Mark Cerny claimed the PlayStation user interface is getting a complete overhaul, and will show games information such as multiplayer activities and forthcoming mission objectives while players browse the menu.Virtual reality will also be supported on PS5, at first via the current PlayStation VR headset, but later through a new headset, which is rumoured to support eye-tracking technology and may be wireless. Microsoft has not announced VR or augmented reality tech for Scarlett, but in the summer, rumours surfaced that the machine might be compatible with the Oculus Rift S gaming headset, currently available for PC.It is unclear how the machines’ online multiplayer services will evolve for the next generation. Sony is likely to overhaul its PlayStation Now streaming game service, while Microsoft has its Xbox Game Pass equivalent. Rumours of an Xbox console that uses Microsoft’s cloud-based gaming service have been denied by the company.As for Nintendo, the Switch console is only two years into its lifecycle, so a successor is unlikely to be released next year. However, rumours persist that the company is planning to release an updated and more powerful version of the Switch – known as Switch 2 or Switch Pro on tech sites – featuring an updated processor.In an entertainment market dominated by streaming platforms and services, where everyone is looking for the next equivalent to Netflix or Spotify, it will be interesting to see how two specialist high-end machines fare, especially with Google Stadia (out in November) and Apple Arcade (launched in September), looking to entice more casual players."
'It's a new golden age': Radio 3 launches video game music show,"Presenter Jessica Curry says she wants to prove it’s not all about soundtracking battle scenes – there are plenty of beautiful, relaxing sounds, too",Keith Stuart,2019-10-09T07:00:53+0100,"Radio 3 is launching a new weekly programme dedicated to video game soundtracks. Running from Saturday 26 October, the hour-long show will be presented by composer Jessica Curry, who won a Bafta for her work with UK studio The Chinese Room and created and presented Classic FM’s video game music programme, High Score.“[BBC presenter and journalist] Tom Service and his producer Brian Jackson came to interview me for Radio 3 at Chinese Room a couple of years ago, and we all really hit it off,” said Curry. “Tom’s an avid gamer and there was a definite feeling of excitement about the gaming scene and the music that’s being composed for games.“Lots of people think that it’s all battle music and aggression. The show will prove that that couldn’t be further from the truth.”Video game music has undergone a boom in interest and appreciation in the past five years, as the art form has grown and matured. The Distant Worlds concert, which features compositions from Japanese role-playing game Final Fantasy, has been touring the world for more than a decade, while video-game-themed symphony concerts devoted to games such as Legend of Zelda, Mass Effect and Halo have taken place at the world’s major classical venues, including the Royal Albert Hall in London and Sydney Opera House. Meanwhile, a new market for vinyl video game soundtrack albums has grown up with specialist labels iam8bit and Data Discs producing lavishly packaged records for new and retro games.For fans, the appeal of the music is often nostalgic and related to their love of the games, but Curry says video game soundtracks are attracting a wider interest for their own qualities. “I believe we’re entering a golden age of games music,” said Curry. “The sheer breadth of soundtracks this year has been mind-blowing, and the quality and diversity of games music is on the rise. At the moment, I am in love with Lena Raine’s music for Celeste – it has such a beautiful nod to nostalgia but is also completely now. All of Grant Kirkhope’s music is stunning, and I have Olivier Deriviere’s incredible score for 11-11 Memories Retold on repeat.”Unlike film and TV scores, which are linear and require specific sequences for specific moments, game soundtracks are more open and afford greater compositional space. Speaking to the Guardian last year, composer Winifred Phillips said: “Games are structured so that there are long expanses where there is no dialogue. And music that you create for those sequences, you have the opportunity to really develop musical ideas.”Curry also points out that, as game music needs to be able to fill long periods of time while the player explores at their own pace, it can be more ambient and unintrusive – making it perfect to listen to while doing other things or relaxing. “Todd Baker’s music for Monument Valley always goes on when I’m stressed and need to chill out,” she says.While symphonic scores are flourishing, experimental electronic soundtracks are also gaining wider recognition. “If you look at Sayonara Wild Hearts, that game is packed full of lush electronica. Berlinist’s score for GRIS was a gorgeous mix of more traditional game music and epic electronic dreaminess. Chipzel is tearing the house down with her chip-tune bangers.”While many video game soundtracks are intended as a discrete compositions, there has been a rise in “procedural” scores, which adapt to the actions of the player, rising in tempo and urgency in action set pieces and becoming more ambient during exploration. Experimental group 65daysofstatic produced over two hours of modular electronic music for the space adventure No Man’s Sky, while Matt Boch, associate arts professor at NYU Game Center, created a percussive interactive jazz soundscape for beat-’em-up game, Ape Out.“Nostalgia isn’t going anywhere; the AAAs will stick with the traditional filmic orchestral model,” said Curry. “But the success of Ape Out means that the use of procedural music is going to keep growing.”She believes an influx of new talent, training specifically as video game composers, will also challenge the status quo.“Lots of us older composers were trained in film and television and adapted our compositional approach, but the young guns are digital natives and grew up wanting to compose specifically for games. They have a very intuitive understanding of interactive media and that’s one of the reasons that music for games is getting better and better. It’s been exciting to see more women breaking through, as traditionally it’s been very male, and those different voices have inevitably led to new and exciting approaches.”Curry says her programme will seek to showcase the variety in the medium, as well as explore how game scores are written.“Each week we play a classic track – one that I feel has stood the test of time – as well as a new release and an interview with a games composer, lifting the lid on what it takes to write music for games. For the rest of the show I will be unashamedly partisan and just play tracks that I absolutely love.”Curry sees the medium evolving further as its profile increases. “More bands will write music for games,” she says. “And with an increase in tours and performances of their work, game composers are going to become stars in their own right.”• Sound of Gaming is a recurring four-part series, running from Saturday 26 October, 3 - 4pm, on BBC Radio 3. The programme will also be available on BBC Sounds."
"Electra, Oresteia and an execution: the daring designs of Hildegard Bechtler – in pictures","The theatre designer on creating a family dinner at Agamemnon’s, an election night Oedipus and the night Fiona Shaw got stuck",David Jays,2019-10-23T06:00:30+0100,"‘You never know anything, you can only do your best.” Hildegard Bechtler is modest, but this soft-spoken, keen-eyed designer has created a host of memorable productions. Raised in Stuttgart, Bechtler moved to London in 1970, initially to train in fine art. She then worked in film, and likes the idea that she brings an outsider’s eye to British theatre. “Being a designer is constantly changing, depending on the people you work with,” she says. “Ideally, you forget everything. Collaborators are crucial, and the skill of the director is in creating the team. I’ve only had one bad experience with a director in my 30-odd years.”Linda Nylind for the GuardianBechtler’s 1988 production with Deborah Warner and Fiona Shaw of Sophocles’s tragedy for the RSC began a collaboration that continued for a decade.“I wasn’t really familiar with Deborah’s work, but I liked the way she talked. When she asked me about Electra, I had just turned down a film I had been offered. It was a pivotal decision, and very good timing! It led to a very intense 10-year working relationship with her and Fiona.”Natasha Parry as Clytemnestra and Fiona Shaw as Electra at the Pit, Barbican, London, in 1988. Photograph: Neil Libbert“One of the first things Fiona said was that she might smoke cigarettes, and Deborah said she saw rusty containers. So that immediately means you will not have to go to classical Greece! That was maybe the only conversation we had before I came up with some suggestions. It wasn’t based on big discussions or dissecting the text. It was more an instinctive arrival at something unfathomable.”“Like many people, I had been using the escalators at King’s Cross station after the tube fire, and was very affected by how it still appeared burned. For Electra, I had the idea of the water, ash and an altar. It was to do with essential elements – I made the walls of this enclosed prison courtyard the colour of ash. The door at the back was real metal, which gave great sound possibilities. And there was a channel of water running to the front of the stage, which eventually ran red with blood.”“I wanted Electra to be dressed in black and showing quite a lot of skin. Fiona cut her hair very short. She looked amazing. She was doing so much physical work, crouching and standing. We cut her dress on one side so that one thigh was exposed. It was like self-harming.”Shaw starred in Howard Barker’s play about a fictional Renaissance painter, directed by Tom Cairns, at the National Theatre, London, in 2012.“Fiona is the only actor I’ve come across who would be happy to wait till the midnight hour to confirm her costume. Even in previews, we didn’t know if she would wear shoes in the last scene. It’s brave.”“I never even thought of showing the painting that the artist is working on. I had an early sense that the Lyttelton proscenium was her frame. The audience looked through the frame and she looked back at us. It took for ever. I kept all of the models, to remind myself how many structures you can build.”“It wasn’t a very technical show. It was spare, with modern materials and smooth, simple walls: wood, plastic and metal. We had a small revolve to move a wall into different perspectives, and structures to bring Fiona up to another level for a scene and then very simply move her down again. I’m still thrilled to think of it.”Phoebe Nicholls as Rivera and Fiona Shaw as Galactia at the National theatre, London, in 2012. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian“On the first night there was a technical mistake – Fiona was supposed to move down but the whole thing came to a standstill. She was suspended in space. Your heart goes insane, but I couldn’t leave the audience because I wasn’t sitting at the end of a row. You have to see the funny side. It’s not life and death – it’s show business.”Photograph: Manuel HarlanBechtler’s ongoing collaboration with Robert Icke began with his version of the trilogy by Aeschylus at London’s Almeida in 2015.“I hadn’t seen much of Rob’s work, but I sensed something during one of our first conversations. One of the main things we talked about was family. When I think of a German or Italian family especially, I think about sitting around a table and eating together. That was the starting point. I knew the table had to be meaningful, as it was almost the only furniture. There was a nod to Greece in the slightly marble-like material, architectural but built into the Almeida’s own brick.”Photograph: Manuel Harlan“Our innovation was the ‘electric’ glass, which we could make opaque or transparent at the flick of a switch. I don’t know of a show that had used it before. We felt strongly about looking through to see corridors, other spaces, opening to the bath or the altar. We needed this glass to stage Iphigenia’s death as brutally and shockingly as possible. We took a huge risk – the glassalmost ate the whole budget, so we had to commit to it. But lots of people use it now.”“My drafts of the Oresteia included a large video screen. We never used it in this production, but it became completely right for Hamlet at the Almeida. There’s talk of us combining the Oresteia and Hamlet in one world, and making it site-specific to the Armory in New York, which would be an amazing challenge.”Photograph: Jan VersweyveldBechtler and Icke’s version of Sophocles’s tragedy premiered at the Internationaal Theater Amsterdam in 2018 and was staged at the Edinburgh festival in 2019.“Our Oedipus is a politician on election night. We approached the play as being about the feeling that something was coming to an end, that it felt worn out and tired. I came up with an idea where we would have the stage completely filled with the remnants of the old world. It would be packed up during the play, and we’d end up with nothing. When we took the design sketch to the theatre in Amsterdam, we were told that we had massively overestimated our budget! So, literally back to the drawing board. We ended up doing the opposite.”An early model above and a later version below“Fortunately, we were with the Toneelgroep company, which has been together for so many years, doing amazing work. It was a revelation. Hans Kesting as Oedipus – what a phenomenon, what a collaborator.”Photograph: Monika Rittershaus/Salzburg FestivalThis opera by Thomas Adès, based on Luis Buñuel’s film, was directed by Tom Cairns at Salzburg in 2016, before travelling to New York and London.“I’d never designed a contemporary opera on such a big scale. It had to work for the Met in New York, Covent Garden and Salzburg, which have very different prosceniums. The design ended up so simple purely because it went through countless work. I considered far more architectural, enclosed spaces.”“It was the first time I worked with a company of international singers who not only rehearsed together for weeks, but did so on the built set. They were like an ensemble rehearsing a play.”“Because the principals could never be off stage, the revolve was used to make sure we always got the action closest to where we needed it. The relevant action always had to be in focus. We used it like a camera to create a closeup. It felt disorienting and queasy, because our big arch on the stage moved independently. It was very creepy.”Photograph: Monika Rittershaus/Salzburg Festival“We had to make identical versions of each of the characters’ couture-type costumes because they are totally destroyed during the story. We had them made in advance so the singers could wear them in rehearsal and then break them down in the way each felt they should.”Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBechtler and Terry Gilliam staged Berlioz’s unwieldy opera for ENO at London’s Coliseum in 2011.“I knew Terry a little bit socially, because my husband, Bill Paterson, was in some of his films, but he didn’t know I was a stage designer. When ENO brought us together, I thought it was a risky idea, because he’s a very distinctive and visual film director. But it became a significant collaboration for me.”Model storyboard for The Damnation of Faust“The opera is famously difficult to stage. Terry’s version was set in Germany during the first half of the 20th century. I grew up in Stuttgart in the 50s and left in 1970 because I felt burdened by that history. So this was a very important project for me.”“Working with Terry, I was forced in a direction I would never have gone in. Although you can have any concept you like, opera has rigid musical demands and timings. Unlike film, you can’t simply edit out the bits you don’t like! Terry grasped this, and I would never have produced anything like it with someone else. He was very knowledgeable and incredibly respectful, letting me bring all the visuals to him. The joy of the opera was to work with a great collaborator.”The Almeida’s production of The Doctor, designed by Hildegard Bechtler, is at the Duke of York’s theatre, London, 20 April-11 July 2020."
"A Museum in Baghdad review – two views of Iraq, 80 years apart","Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-AvonHannah Khalil’s play frames Iraq’s history through the eyes of real characters, but feels like a missed opportunity",Miriam Gillinson,2019-10-22T23:59:16+0100,"A black-and-white photograph on display in London’s National Portrait Gallery inspired Hannah Khalil to write A Museum in Baghdad. The picture was of the British explorer Gertrude Bell, who helped to found both Iraq and its national museum, and eventually overdosed on sleeping pills. A fascinating life with a bit of mystery. However, that exhibition was more than 10 years ago and perhaps the subsequent play has been gestating for far too long. The piece feels over-wrangled and overwritten – to be appreciated but only from a distance.Khalil’s earlier play 68* Years was a haunting work about occupied Palestine, which has stayed with me ever since its London premiere in 2016. It felt as if the writing flowed naturally from Khalil, who is of Irish-Palestinian heritage. But this latest piece doesn’t work nearly as well, and feels trapped between two worlds in different and difficult ways.Erica Whyman’s hard-working production awkwardly straddles two eras. We watch as two women – Bell and Iraqi archaeologist Ghalia Hussein – struggle to open a museum in Baghdad. Bell’s scenes unfold in 1926, shortly after the birth of Iraq, and Hussein’s scenes are set in 2006, after the invasion and subsequent looting. The women sit at adjacent desks and their action and dialogue frequently overlaps. Both worry about the museum, the role it might play in galvanising national identity and the influence they might wield. All interesting ideas but voiced in perfect unison, using the exact same words? It’s galling, and oddly reductive.Emma Fielding and Rendah Heywood are underused. Fielding plays Bell as a sort of gung-ho but increasingly gloomy headmistress. Heywood’s Hussein, based on a real-life Iraqi archaeologist, spends an awful lot of time shouting at the locals. Both parts feel like missed opportunities, conceived with compassion but lost in translation.It’s only in the mystifying yet compelling scene changes that this play really engages. Whyman’s slightly dry production becomes a little odd – slippery and intriguing. Haunting projections light up the empty museum display cases, ghosts and goddesses stalk the stage, beauty and danger rise up together and Iraq’s history suddenly comes to life.At the Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 25 January. Then at the Kiln theatre, London, 22 April-23 May."
London theatre to ban visitors from bringing single-use bottles,Royal Court crackdown forms part of mission to become net-zero-carbon venue in 2020,Mark Brown,2019-10-23T06:00:38+0100,"Audience members at the Royal Court theatre will be banned from taking in single-use plastic bottles as part of a mission to become a net-zero carbon arts venue in 2020.The London theatre announced it was scrapping its plan to have a month of performance on the climate emergency. Instead, it said, it would spend the time taking stock to find ways to make the organisation net zero by the end of next year.That will include examining all aspects of its operations, from lighting and set design to its bar and restaurant and whether someone can take in a single-use plastic bottle of drink.“It would be banned and I think it’s really important that it is banned,” said the theatre’s artistic director, Vicky Featherstone. “We are not nannying people: when they leave our building they can behave how they want but, actually, I think it is really important that people have to think about how they come in to the space and what it means.“My feeling about it is we are all in such a dystopian, existential crisis about this real thing that is in front of us, that to be able to go somewhere and to be told … about how to model your behaviours within that building will be a really calming thing for people.”The theatre announced this year that it would give March 2020 over to work on the climate emergency. But things have changed quickly and the issue is already embedded in the work and thoughts of Royal Court writers, Featherstone said.“It felt a bit simplistic to be saying we were going to be programming work specifically just for a month around the climate emergency when all the writers are writing about it all the time.“Instead of filling March with possibly very brilliant monologues about the climate emergency, we are going to stop and take stock and learn how we can, from March onwards, commit to the building becoming net-zero.”The plan is to make changes in its rehearsal and experimental performance space, Site, which will then be applied to the main building as it transitions to a net-zero arts venue.A lot of work has been done by arts organisations around the UK to reduce, offset and neutralise climate impact.The Royal Court initiative arguably takes this to the next level and its executive producer, Lucy Davies, said the theatre would share all of its experiences, “including all the experiments that fail”.Featherstone said anyone entering the building from March would be contributing to the commitment. “The Royal Court has always been radical and must always be radical and fearless in its approach to the way that the work is made, who makes it and who it is for,” she said. “It feels like we don’t have a decision here; we just have to do it. It has to be now.”The theatre said more information about public events during Open Court: Climate Emergency (2-20 March) would follow in early 2020."
Julie Taymor: how we made The Lion King musical,"‘The sheer idea of having a stampede on stage was exciting – the bigger the risk, the bigger the payoff’",Chris Wiegand,2019-10-22T06:01:14+0100,"It was a surprise to get the call from Disney. Their world wasn’t my aesthetic, but The Lion King’s story aligned with the myths, folktales and Shakespearean stories I had done. I’d never seen the film before and was totally taken with it. The sheer idea of staging a stampede was exciting. They gave me a lot of freedom. I was told: “The bigger the risk, the bigger the payoff.”Everybody acknowledged that the film’s story should be fleshed out. There were no good female roles. The Circle of Life – the first song – is sung by an anonymous woman in the movie. In a musical you see the singers, so we needed to ask which character is singing that song. I had just been working with the fantastic South African actor Thuli Dumakude and asked her if she could gather together South African singers for a reading. “Sadly, there are no good characters in it for people like you,” I said. “It’s always the case!” she replied. I asked her about shamans in South Africa and she told me they’re mostly women. Then I knew that Rafiki, the storyteller, should be female. She would be first on stage, bringing the animals together.The soul of this musical is South African choral singing and we mostly have South Africans playing Rafiki. For the wicked uncle Scar you need a Shakespearean actor because the singing is secondary to the acting. With the other characters you’re looking for people who can move really well and inhabit the puppets – that takes time and practice.The actors wear masks above their faces because I wanted to present the animal and the human simultaneously. When an animal attacks, the mask can be taken off and pushed forward in an aggressive manner. One of the first animals I designed was the giraffe. I wanted to use stilts but also show how they were attached to the arms of the dancers. We didn’t want to hide the strings or the rods [on any of the puppets] but rather expose the mechanics and let the art of making theatre become part of the experience. We put the whole thing together in five or six weeks of rehearsals and a three-week tech. The first performance was in Minneapolis and, two seconds in, the audience was on their feet screaming. We all burst into tears. You couldn’t hear the song! More than 100 million people have seen The Lion King now. It’s been on every continent apart from Antarctica. It changed my life. It was amazing to have a company like Disney take a chance on me – and on a kind of theatre that no one had seen before.I’d already been to Africa several times with my dance company, so we were comfortable with what these animals look like in the wild. When I saw the movie all my visions of Africa came back. Going over to Julie’s home and looking at her costume sketches was exciting. The biggest challenge was to get the dancers to try to be animal-like. As dancers, we love our bodies. Then here comes Julie with these fabulous designs that cover a lot of our bodies. I told them: “Trust me, it’s going to be magical.”There is a lot of dancing in The Lion King. Everybody dances … sooner or later! In lots of Broadway shows, the dancing is just the women coming out and shaking their you-know-what and smiling, and the men are just macho idiots. We wanted to get away from that stereotype and be broad, enriching, enticing human animals.I'm in my late 70s and I still bawl like a baby at the opening numberI had to be sure the movement was exciting and fresh and would grab the audience. People have paid for babysitters, tickets and transportation – I want them to come out of the theatre uplifted. There is so much to see in the show that you can miss something. Here I am in my late 70s and I still bawl like a baby at the opening number. I know every step, every turn and every feather that’s going to fly.The antelopes are my favourites. The dancers have an antelope puppet on each arm and one on their back and they can still leap. The hyenas might be the bad guys, but I wanted to be sure that they didn’t become stereotypical gangster types – they are also very witty creatures who get in and out of every situation imaginable. The show opens with a procession of all the animals and when I saw the antelopes leaping across the stage I said: “Oh lord, yes!” • The Lion King is at the Bristol Hippodrome until 23 November and continues at the Lyceum theatre in London."
"David Baddiel on God, gags and being trolled – 'It hurts and then I think: material!'","The comedian has written his first play – on whether science can prove that the Almighty exists. But first, there are some hecklers to deal with ... ",Brian Logan,2019-10-22T12:11:28+0100,"Schrödinger’s cat can be both alive and dead – so surely David Baddiel can be both a comedian and a playwright? When, in 2014, he launched his first solo comedy venture in 15 years, Fame: Not the Musical, he reports: “I had a constant struggle. People were saying ‘I’m coming to your play’, ‘I’ve heard great things about your play.’” Maybe it was because he’d chosen a theatre venue (the Menier Chocolate Factory in London) to premiere the show, but “ I would constantly have to say, ‘It’s not a play – it’s a one-man show.’” Baddiel is a comedian, to his fingertips. “I found it threatening to my identity,” he says now.He pauses, draws breath, and then: “But now I have written a play.” That’s why we’re back at the Menier, where God’s Dice is being prepped for its stage debut. The show is the 55-year-old’s first proper play: it’s not a one-man show, and he’s not performing in it. The droll fiftysomething role has been offered to fellow standup Alan Davies, of Jonathan Creek fame – now cast as a physics lecturer who co-authors a book with his Christian student, proving the Bible’s miracles to be scientifically possible. For a religious readership, it’s manna from heaven. Henry is hailed as the new messiah – to the chagrin of his Dawkins-alike celebrity atheist wife.Baddiel is in the rehearsal room today, at the shoulder of director James Grieve, who is staging Henry’s book launch, at which wife and student come to ideological blows. Afterwards, I ask Baddiel if he enjoys hearing his words brought to life. “I find it difficult,” he says, “particularly with the comedy. Give a director a dramatic scene and they can direct it in 20 different ways that might all be equally valid. If you give them a reveal gag and they direct it wrongly, it’s like playing the wrong notes, and it won’t get a laugh.”Baddiel’s prior experience of writing for others was on the musical – then the movie – The Infidel, to whose director, Josh Appignanesi, he made himself “a fucking pain in the arse on set”, demanding retakes when his gags weren’t delivered just right. The thing is, Baddiel explains – and he has discussed this with his wife, and fellow comedy writer, Morwenna Banks – “it feels like you’re getting cancer, like some terrible tumour is growing inside of you, when you see your lines being done wrong.” Pause. “I apologise to everyone who might be offended by that metaphor.”So he’s on his best behaviour in rehearsals for God’s Dice, straining to trust Grieve (who is “fucking brilliant”) and keep his mouth shut. Not easy, of course, when jokes are your currency – and when even the play’s more substantial material is personal. “I’ve been reading a lot about physics,” says Baddiel. “I think it’s to do with my dad” – who worked as a research chemist for Unilever and brought up his family “heavily under the influence of science”. Baddiel pere, who now has dementia, formed 50% of the subject of My Family: Not the Sitcom, Baddiel’s tender and flabbergasting 2016 show about his parents and their eccentric relationships. Following on from Fame, it situated mid-career Baddiel in a creative purple patch, far removed from the laddish comedy for which, in the 90s, he made his name.They say don't feed the trolls. But as a comedian, you don’t ignore hecklers, you work with them“I think there’s been a return of the repressed, or something,” he says, because, “in my 50s, I’ve become obsessed with physics.” Deeply submerged in that obsession, he noticed something. “Essentially, quantum physics is a leap of faith. Its truths are not exactly unprovable but they’re certainly unseeable. You have to believe in them. So there’s a parallel between believing in quantum physics and believing in God.”Baddiel began to wonder: what if a physicist experienced a crisis of the faith required to pursue his subject? Might one arrive at religious belief, not out of ignorance, but out of high intelligence? Behind that inquiry is Baddiel’s memories of his old mucker – and Fantasy Football League sidekick – Frank Skinner. “Before I met Frank,” he recalls, “I’d never met a very, very intelligent person who deeply believed in God, and that was really challenging to me as an atheist.”The play’s other source was a Brian Cox lecture that Baddiel had attended, at which the physicist proposed the possibility of a diamond leaping by itself out of a velvet bag and reappearing elsewhere in the theatre. Admittedly, says Baddiel, it was “a very unlikely possibility. But in a multi-world universe, it doesn’t matter how unlikely something is. If it’s possible, it must be happening somewhere. And that’s a miracle isn’t it – a diamond leaping suddenly out of a velvet bag? A scientifically possible miracle.”All of these revelations might challenge what Baddiel, who is culturally Jewish, describes as his “fundamental atheism”. It’s a point of pride with him, certainly, that God’s Dice is not an atheist play. “Believers have read it, scientists have read it” (including the physicist Jim Al-Khalili), and everyone credits its open-mindedness on the overlaps between faith and science. Baddiel himself remains a sceptic, albeit one who admits the play is borne of a spiritual crisis of sorts. “As I get older and nearer death, I really want to understand the world before I die. And I don’t believe in God, so maybe this – physics – is the way to understand it.“But [theoretical physicist] Richard Feynman said, ‘If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics.’ And I don’t understand it. Sometimes when I read these books, I feel like I understand it for a minute – and then, ‘Oh no, I don’t understand it again.’ Intellectually, it’s very frustrating.” There is consolation, though, in fashioning that near-miss incomprehension into stories – which Baddiel now sees as his stock in trade. “I genuinely do not recognise borders between different kinds of storytelling,” says the novelist, screenwriter, and writer of hit children’s books. “If you’re good at storytelling, you should be able to apply the idea to whatever genre fits it best.”As if to prove the point, he’s drafting a new standup show – or at least as close as he gets to standup, now that “theatrical one-man show” is more his bag. Trolls: Not the Dolls will tour in 2020, and addresses Baddiel’s self-confessed dependence on social media. (“I would say it’s got a bit out of hand for me…”) It was born of the moment when, faced with a “don’t feed the trolls” campaign by fellow celebs, he thought: “That’s not right for me. To me they’re hecklers. They’re people calling me a cunt, or telling me I’m shit. And as a comedian, you don’t ignore hecklers, you work with them.”As his 624,000 Twitter followers will know, Baddiel devotes time to outsmarting his online tormentors. The new show will trace these relationships through his 10 years on the platform, and will ask: “Why is everybody so angry? What is anger doing for people? Why is everything so polarised? Social media involves people not imagining how the other person feels while raging at them. So the battle is to restore empathy to this empathy-less world.” But isn’t it painful to walk towards all of this hostility? “If someone slags me off on social media,” says Baddiel, “I definitely still feel a stab of hurt and vulnerability. And then I think: material!”Trolls will be, he says, his most political show, and one that stakes out the kinds of dark territory into which a prominent Jewish person online can easily be lured. Baddiel is also making a BBC documentary about Holocaust denial – and conjuring with a second play, about #MeToo. He eye-rolls with trepidation at that possibility, mindful that not everyone wants to hear the well-off, middle-aged straight man’s take on gender politics. But he resists the suggestion that comedy is under threat from a new censoriousness.Unpleasant and awful things sometimes need to be said in comedy – and how you get there is the art“I’ve a problem with the polarisation of that conversation,” says the man whose Radio 4 show Don’t Make Me Laugh was cancelled after broadcasting a supposedly off-colour remark about the Queen. “The idea that, ‘Oh, we’re over here with the free speech and offensiveness, and you’re over there with the woke comedy.’ I don’t think it should be seen like that.”Baddiel chooses to stake out a space for independent thinking. “More and more, I don’t map any received political viewpoint on to what I say in my work. I’d rather ask myself, ‘What do I actually think about this thing?’” And he craves nuance. “Unpleasant and awful things sometimes need to be said in comedy – and how you get there is the art. Fewer people seem to be able to understand this, but someone can be a brilliant comedian and say stuff that is unacceptable. Those things are entirely compatible.”It’s a quantum physics way of thinking from a comic committed to keeping contradictory possibilities alive. Comedy/theatre, science/religion, brilliant/unacceptable – and emotional/meaningless. “Something about religion will always be immensely powerful, aesthetically and emotionally,” he says, while his new play comes to life in the room next door. “But I do believe that life is meaningless finally. It’s fucking brilliant. But then it’s gone and that’s it.”That’s not a cheerless conclusion. “I say, accept the meaninglessness – and enjoy yourself in whatever way you can.”God’s Dice is at Soho theatre, London, from 24 October to 30 November. Trolls: Not the Dolls tours from 24 January."
Vassa review – revolutionary attack on moribund politics,"Almeida, LondonSiobhan Redmond is impressive as a tyrannical mother trying to rescue her debt-ridden family in Tinuke Craig’s strangely rootless production",Michael Billington,2019-10-22T00:01:45+0100,"This production of Maxim Gorky’s play suffered a setback when Samantha Bond had to withdraw from the title role but Siobhan Redmond has stepped into the breach with great elan. She gives a highly impressive performance as Gorky’s domineering matriarch but, although Mike Bartlett’s version begins with a caption telling us “the play is set before a revolution – capitalism is showing its age,” it seems, like Tinuke Craig’s production, strangely rootless.The first issue is which text to use. They opt for Gorky’s 1911 version rather than his 1935 revision, which is a more explicit attack on a moribund political system. What we get is a robust drama about a merchant-class family struggling to survive. Vassa, the tyrannical mother trying to rescue a debt-ridden business, despises her weakling sons, regards her daughter with wary suspicion, seeks to poison her voracious brother-in-law and forges a will to ensure future control. Even when she describes her dying husband as “promiscuous, violent, overbearing” you feel it is less in tones of moral condemnation than grudging admiration.Gorky’s play is clearly a portrait of insidious corruption in pre-revolutionary Russia. Bartlett and Craig, however, strip it of any historical context to give us a blackly comic account of the destructive nature of the profit-driven family. Even Fly Davis’s set, with its multiple upstage doors, suggests we are close to farce. The result is that we lose the play’s sense of particularity and, in her 21st-century diverse casting, Craig reinforces the sense that we are in a time-free zone.Individual performances are good. Redmond fearlessly shows the cost to Vassa of her merciless manipulation: left alone, she crumbles into despair or hides under a desk. Amber James as her equally strong-willed daughter, Danny Kirrane and Arthur Hughes as her neurotically insecure sons and Michael Gould as her lecherous brother-in-law – typically described as “a randy old shit” – all make a positive impression. But, if the intention is to suggest the play’s relevance to our own wayward times, I would rather be allowed to draw my own conclusions from Gorky’s damning historical evidence.At the Almeida, London, until 23 November."

Greek video designer Panagiotis Tomaras offers rippling projections cast across five dancers’ bodies, emulating close-ups of cells and muscle fibres connecting to the choreographer’s theme, the inner workings of the body – something that Maliphant, trained in anatomy and body work techniques as well as classical ballet, is deeply involved with.What emerges is a slow and concentrated Zen-like energy, as if the brain’s alpha waves were made flesh, across a succession of lighting states. Some of them are transfixing: a molten solo for Grace Jabbari is lit by flickers like neural networks, synapses firing or pulses through veins. The deft young dancers move with ninja stealth. Even an athletic barrel turn or flying kick is silently blended into the thread. It’s as if the dancers are absorbed by the movement rather than it being something they project. And anonymity reigns; this is dance about bodies, not people.There’s shifting complexity within the repetitive currents of the choreography, but it can very easily all look the same, underlined by the unimaginative looping of some of the score (there’s a distinct 90s trip-hop vibe going on). Silent Lines is less a journey somewhere, more a study of stasis, moving yet staying in place, like the vibrating matter of the universe – you can get a bit cosmic with this stuff, there’s even a swirling Milky Way at one point. If you can catch a ride on Maliphant’s flow, you’ll find this a sublime and trancelike hour, otherwise things could get painfully samey."
Fierce festival review – a daring whirl of theatrical thrills,"Various venues, BirminghamAided by hula hoops, raw chicken and animatronic dogs, the performers in this six-day series of shows embarked on a quest for emotional connections",Gareth Llŷr Evans,2019-10-21T11:28:43+0100,"Communion, empathy, resistance and joy … Writing in the programme of this year’s beautifully curated Fierce festival, artistic director Aaron Wright said that these were the elements that characterised this six-day festival – and these four qualities were abundant in the performances I saw. As was, appropriately enough, a fierce sincerity.Communion featured in Belgian artist Miet Warlop’s astounding and exhilarating Ghost Writer and the Broken Hand Break. Warlop and two other performers whirled away while remaining in lit circles for 45 minutes. Its simple act of balance and velocity rendered extraordinary through repetition and duration, made all the more impressive with music and percussion that made me feel as if my blood was vibrating.Gillie Kleiman and Greg Wohead’s Familiar, with its focus on empathy, consisted of two works – Study in Significant Otherness created by Kleiman and performed by Wohead, and Dog Years, created by Wohead and performed by Kleiman. Aided by two animatronic dogs, it’s a neat conceptual conceit, with both works to-ing and fro-ing around the impossibility of knowing everything about another person.In the first part, Wohead performed a sequence of static canine gestures that evolved into a long sequence of movement under a dim red light. The second work was looser in tone and structure, with Kleiman parroting Wohead’s words as they were spoken into her ear. As she repeatedly asserted that she was here to make a meaningful connection with us, there was a playful, tentative ambivalence about whether it’s possible to fulfil such a promise.Meanwhile, resistance was Lucy McCormick’s theme. Offering a preview of her soon to be released narrative concept album, Life: Live! was a balls-to-the-wall skewering of the misogyny and exploitation that underpin popular culture. While McCormick moves and sings like the most glamorous of arena-filling pop princesses, her shonky-spectacular aesthetic is anything but: it is cold, wet and even humiliating. But it’s all on her terms. This is no easy, ironic parody: it is extreme and often looks dangerous. Her fearless commitment to this contradiction is what makes McCormick’s performances so thrilling.Whether doused in paint and water, frozen meals and raw chicken, or hanging from the rafters, whipping the crowd into a frenzy, McCormick and her backup dancers could lead the revolution.Finally, various moments of joy: Oozing Gloop in The Gloop Show, insisting on a better future as she hula-hooped; the care and precision with which names were spoken and choreographed in Mariana Valencia’s moving, autobiographical Album; the moment when one child stretched out her arms and led her own dance for the first time in Nicola Gunn’s Working With Children."
"Staging Schiele review – art, obsession and orgasmic yelps","DanceEast, IpswichThe expressionist aesthetics of Egon Schiele’s nudes should make for riveting dance, but Shobana Jeyasingh’s production is a bit too beige",Anna Winter,2019-10-20T19:30:06+0100,"It’s easy to see why the work of Austrian painter Egon Schiele (1890-1918) is tempting choreographic catnip. The expressionist aesthetics of Schiele’s nudes – emotionally charged and attenuated lines, tense dynamics and oddly contorted poses – seem like a natural fit for contemporary dance. Despite this felicitous figural match, Shobana Jeyasingh’s Staging Schiele doesn’t always make for riveting dance.Part of the lasting power of Schiele’s work lies in the unflinching depiction of his models’ (or his own) genitals – thrust forward, distorted, sometimes hermaphroditic – accompanied by a direct gaze at the viewer. Here, the four dancers strip off gauzy outer garments to reveal flesh-coloured underwear. Though their surly spread-eagling pays homage to Schiele’s bodies, a lot of beige gusset ends up on display. It’s an inadvertent reminder that Schiele’s nether regions are anything but beige.Nevertheless, it’s a slick and skilful production. An upstage structure of slanted metal bars and spare strip lights alludes to Schiele’s brief stint in prison (for obscenity) while evoking a more general sense of spatial dislocation, with washes of pale green and red light suggesting the bruised hues of Schiele’s watercolours.Fragmented video projections of the artist’s face are matched by a collage of sounds and music: excerpts from poems by Rilke and Schiele and the intense scribbling of a pencil are punctuated by orgasmic yelps and unsettling piano.Dancing with a small mirror, Dane Hurst is a nimble and compelling presence in the opening section. As he tries out new perspectives and weird angles, grimaces and gurns, he’s nervously fervent, but buoyed by bourgeois confidence. We see the artist’s obsessive scrutiny of his own body not simply as narcissism, but as an earnest pursuit of some higher truth.Elsewhere, the push and pull of Hurst’s interactions with Catarina Carvalho, Sunbee Han and Estela Merlos – a combination of coercion, collaboration and combat – evokes the ambivalent interplay between artist and model, as well as Schiele’s fraught personal relationships. There are striking moments, but it lacks some crucial light and shade.At the Roses theatre, Tewkesbury, on 23 October. Then touring."
Cross Currents/ Monotones II/ Everyone Keeps Me; Danse Élargie – review,"Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House; Sadler’s Wells, LondonPam Tanowitz’s dazzling new piece for the Royal Ballet worked perfectly alongside Ashton and Cunningham. Elsewhere, the best of young talent bared all in vain",Sarah Crompton,2019-10-20T12:00:55+0100,"The American choreographer Pam Tanowitz says she dances along the edge of history. Her delicate, thoughtful choreography fits into the places that other choreographers have left empty. She is a student of dance as well as a practitioner, someone who is always conscious of the people who forged a path before her. So there could be no better programme for her first piece of work commissioned by a British company – in this case, the Royal Ballet – than one that shows her in the light of both Merce Cunningham and Frederick Ashton.The pressure must have been enormous, taking her place in so distinguished a line, but her 20-minute Everyone Keeps Me rose with astonishing calm beauty to the challenge. Set to Ted Hearne’s emotional string quartet Exposure, it brings its nine dancers on to the stage in silence, their arms linked, their legs making a delicate crisscross of movement, like figures running around a Greek vase.As the music starts, the dancers break away and James Hay and Anna Rose O’Sullivan begin a duet that is both intimate and involving and also strangely distant; they face each other, mirroring one another’s movements, both elegant and clear but also disturbed by the unexpected – a push under an arm, little hops, skips and twists of the feet.This is characteristic of all the movement that follows – solos, duets, deliberately misaligned groups. Its inventiveness constantly surprises. Luca Acri crosses the stage, rolling his shoulders; Hannah Grennell pushes her head into Aiden O’Brien’s shoulder as they both unfold their legs into arabesques, like a see-saw as he walks backwards; Beatriz Stix-Brunell is carried aloft, her bent arms frozen like a doll’s.The dancers – all superb – look at one another as they dance and seem to reveal their personalities; sometimes the women lie on the floor, propping their heads on one elbow, watching all that unfolds with bold but uncommitted curiosity. The ending is sublime: a long, complex, twisting solo for Calvin Richardson, full of jumps and sudden stops, matched by music that uses the bows as a percussive scrape (played from the side of the stage). Then four of the women enter and Fumi Kaneko flings herself into a rapid spin before they all take one another’s hands, linked in lovely contemplation. The first group forms again and they slowly walk around, before lying on the stage.Bathed in Clifton Taylor’s luscious lights, which paint the stage with rectangles of pure colour and costumed by Fay Fullerton in soft-shaded chiffon (blush, turquoise, mauve, yellow, pink), Everyone Keeps Me builds its own self-enclosed world, suggestive of things that you can’t quite grasp. Like a lot of Tanowitz’s choreography, it sets off ripples of memory – it recalls at various moments Cunningham, Martha Graham and Jerome Robbins’s Dances at a Gathering – but is uniquely and utterly itself. She has a great gift.Earlier in this triple bill, programmed in honour of Merce Cunningham’s centenary, we saw her lineage. Matthew Ball, Francesca Hayward and Mayara Magri became the first Royal Ballet dancers ever to perform Cunningham’s pioneering work at the ROH, and brought to his lively Cross Currents (premiered in London in 1964) a brisk vivacity, expressionless but thrilling in the twists and tilts of the choreography, its fierce jumps, its sense of being totally self-contained, exploring the reaches of movement as Conlon Nancarrow’s discordant difficult score did its own thing alongside.When Frederick Ashton saw Cunningham’s work he responded to its poetry; and his Monotones II has the same interest in seeing a body in space, making sophisticated shapes and patterns out of its three white-clad dancers (Melissa Hamilton, Reece Clarke, Nicol Edmonds). But Ashton is supremely responsive to Satie’s mournful Gymnopédies; Cunningham’s separation of music from dance has had very few followers.Of Danse Élargie, the less said the better. This biennial competition showcase, devised by choreographer Boris Charmatz and director Emmanuel Demarcy-Mota, is designed to let young talent have its head and should be thrilling. In fact, it’s depressing.Each gets 10 minutes to show what they can do and there is some promise on display, but an awful lot of sloppy thinking and generic movement too. The second half featured nudity, which is always a bad sign, and the nadir was a piece by Pietro Marullo that contained nudity and a giant black pillow that floated around the stage. The highlight was the competition winner Kwame Asafo-Adjei, who used the language of hip-hop in new conversational ways in a dramatic dialogue about family honour. Also appealing were the all-female Queen Blood, choreographed by Ousmane Sy, and the energetic To Da Bone featuring (La) Horde, whose fierce, stamina-sapping, jumpstyle provided a rousing conclusion to a dark night.

Lungs review – Claire Foy and Matt Smith shine in climate crisis drama,"Old Vic, LondonDuncan Macmillan’s two-hander is a frenetic portrait of flawed love in a flawed world, exposing the neuroses of a modern couple who struggle to put their principles aside",Arifa Akbar,2019-10-20T11:34:31+0100,"‘The world is fucked,” says one half of the earnest couple in Lungs, fretting about starting a family on an over-populated planet. Since Duncan Macmillan’s play about modern love and the climate crisis was first staged in 2011, it feels like the world has become even more so. The script’s debates on individual responsibility for saving the planet take on renewed significance amid the rise of public protest and Extinction Rebellion.The unnamed couple, played magnetically by Claire Foy and Matt Smith, worry about the polar bears and eating imported avocados. Their hand-wringing carries its own middle-class hypocrisies. They angst over the carbon footprint of a prospective baby (“10,000 tonnes of CO2”) and consider planting trees to offset the damage. But they sound like helicopter parents from the minute she gets pregnant. Their neuroses and double standards are gently derided, but the idealism to be “good people” is not undermined altogether.Foy and Smith perform this two-hander after having honed their chemistry in Netflix series The Crown, and it is an achievement that they are not defined by those roles. These characters are instantly convincing as a trendy young couple arguing in an Ikea queue: she is a PhD student in dungarees and rolled up shirt sleeves, he is a new man in Nike trainers, nodding along to her stridency. Their rat-a-tat repartee of the early scenes is sharp and funny, but frenetic, too, and the drama gathers powers as it slows and introduces silences.Rob Howell’s set design, like the original, is minimalist to the extreme, empty but for a solar-panelled floor and two tiles on opposite sides propped up by rock crystals – a sly satirical reminder of the couple’s fashionable, new age environmentalism. The bareness on stage forces the actors to do all the work; for Foy and Smith, it allows them to showcase their natural synergy, sometimes with a hint of swagger. But it also works on a metaphorical level in stripping their relationship down to its bones.Their existential crisis is as much about sexual politics as it is about the environment. As an enlightened modern couple, they reverse traditional gender relations to some degree: Foy is more dominant, forcing her counterpart into the ancillary role as she monologues about the planet, motherhood and his predatory gaze when they have sex (“Sometimes it looks like you are going to hack off my limbs and bury me in the woods”). Yet she also demands old-style strength and initiative from him.Smith, for his part, likes her honesty, but is paralysed by it: “I don’t know what you want. I need you to give me some clues.” In this bristling dynamic, they encapsulate the paradoxes of modern masculinity and empowered femininity, enacting its conflicts and contradictions brilliantly in scenes that range from comically bathetic to tender and enraged.Matthew Warchus’s direction pits them against each other visually to mirror the verbal combat; they stand at opposite ends of the stage or circle each other in gladiatorial fashion when they are scripted to be lying in bed together.Scenes cut away and change seamlessly so that day turns to night within seconds, a row turns into a sex scene, a breakup into a reunion. Foy and Smith manage the switches of mood and tone with a virtuosity that verges on ostentatious, and there are very few off-moments in pace. It is only the last sequence, in which times speeds up and characters, present and imagined, grow up, age or die within seconds, which feels rushed, gimmicky and riddled with cliche.The couple’s principles are put to one side when life takes over. Yet the message of this play is not a cynical one. It is simple a picture of flawed love, set in a flawed planet.At the Old Vic, London, until 9 November."
I Have Met the Enemy (And the Enemy Is Us) review – not quite on target,"Byker Community Centre, Newcastle upon TyneThe audience is invited to attend a mock UK arms fair in this laudable but underdeveloped production",Clare Brennan,2019-10-19T12:00:25+0100,"Travelling to Common Wealth and Northern Stage’s new co-production about the arms trade, its consequences and techno music, I read in the paper that the UK is suspending arms exports to Turkey. It’s a (happy) surprise. As the mock arms-trade fair to which the audience is invited at the show’s blackly humorous opening makes clear, Britain’s weapon sales are not usually so easily interrupted.Here, three main actors have, in different ways, paid the price of armament profits. In collaboration with Common Wealth and writer Hassan Mahamdallie, each has incorporated their personal experience of conflict into a wider, docu-fiction (that incorporates the seven-strong Byker community cast). While the material is promising, the production feels unrealised, stuck at workshop stage. It satisfies most when engaging individual stories. As when Shatha Altawai, a Yemeni artist (who joins the company via video link), swaps wedding songs with Mo’min Swaitat, an actor from Palestine, then tells of the Saudi bombs bringing death to a marriage feast. Or when Swaitat and Alexander Eley, a former soldier who served in Afghanistan, discover a shared love of techno music: a cross-cultural bond, a refuge from trauma and a form of resistance.Under the joint direction of Evie Manning and Rhiannon White, the action weaves through Robbie Thomson’s sculptural design of movable steel towers, stacked with 72 mirrored metronomes - one for every Eurofighter jet sold by the UK to Saudi Arabia.The company’s laudable aim is to encourage people to challenge the arms trade, but, as the promenading audience is manoeuvred around the community hall, I ponder the irony of trying to motivate individuals by treating them like sheep.• I Have Met the Enemy (And the Enemy Is Us) is at Byker Community Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne, until 19 October"
The week in theatre: There Are No Beginnings; Solaris; A History of Water in the Middle East – review,"Leeds Playhouse; Lyric Hammersmith; Royal Court, LondonA powerful verbatim portrayal of women’s lives during the Yorkshire Ripper years; a sci-fi classic reborn; and a musical imperialism primer",Susannah Clapp,2019-10-19T08:00:28+0100,"The theatre formerly known as the West Yorkshire Playhouse has reopened after 15 months of renovation. It has reverted to its original name of Leeds Playhouse, which is clearer. The main entrance now overlooks the city, which is bolder. Auditoria and front-of-house areas have been spruced up, lightened, made easier for wheelchair users. And, in an unused hollow at the bottom of the building, a new studio theatre has been created. The uncompromisingly named Bramall Rock Void (which has a totemic pile of masonry at the side of the entrance) seats 120. It is cosy but airy, and it carries a promise: that here is a place where new work can be tested. Its opening production comes through with flying colours.There Are No Beginnings is not the first play to show a region shaken to its core by a serial killer of women. It’s a subject that provoked Liverpool Everyman’s lacerating Unprotected in 2006 and, five years later, the National Theatre’s unsettling London Road. Still, Charley Miles’s play belongs to Leeds. Set in the city between 1975 and 1980, when Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, was at large, it features neither Sutcliffe nor the women he murdered. Miles’s concern is with the effect the killings had on all women’s behaviour. How, living with a running commentary of terror (“Grrrrruuuuesome”, rasps the radio) they began always to lock their doors. How they were roused to anger by the advice that they, rather than men, should observe a curfew. How they came together to protest; how distinctions made on grounds of “decency” – on whether a woman was a prostitute – began to be questioned. Meanwhile, the floor in the police department holding the reports on the killings began to sag under the weight of the paperwork.After some artful opening flutters, Amy Leach’s production is direct, personal and crisp. And often funny. The speeches of the four-strong cast are based on dozens of interviews Miles conducted with women who were in Leeds in the 70s; the performances are exceptionally distilled. Julie Hesmondhalgh, sombre, merry, stolid in her pinny while she runs a women’s refuge. As her daughter, Tessa Parr moves dextrously from being a Donny Osmond adorer to a woolly-hatted protester, always slipping between pert and precarious. Jesse Jones is cleverly inscrutable as the ambitious, wary young policewoman. Natalie Gavin – the working girl – is remarkable: she never cries, but her face seems to be bruised with tears. The women put on their costumes in full view of the audience in the opening moments, as if to say we could any of us put on each other’s skin.Stanisław Lem’s 1961 novel Solaris is a tremendous lure and snare for any adapter. The real yeast of the fiction is not plot but a stirring central concept: the idea that on a distant planet there is an ocean that has consciousness: a cerebral sea which, when approached by humans, seems to give physical substance to their thoughts and fantasies. This is not as easy to embody as a gloomy love entanglement, and it was that gooier aspect to which both Steven Soderbergh and Andrei Tarkovsky were drawn – to Lem’s dismay. He thought Tarkovsky’s jowly 1971 film “amputated the scientific landscape”. Reimagining Solaris for the stage (in a co-production with the Lyric, Melbourne’s Malthouse Theatre and the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh), David Greig has some fun with the romance: the fantasy love object bops to the Beach Boys. Greig and director Matthew Lutton don’t indulge in the “emotional sauce” that so repelled Lem, and they do go some way to catching the all-encompassing impersonality of that ocean, in black-and-white videos of surging waves and in lighting by Paul Jackson that flushes and blanches and blues the stage.It’s a coolly intriguing evening. Polly Frame is very adroit as the psychologist (in Lem’s novel the genders were the other way around) who arrives from Earth to find things in a bit of a pickle, but she has to spend an awful lot of time looking aghast with mouth open. As her love interest, Keegan Joyce is a beguiling will-o’-the-wisp, but obviously not a good bet as a boyfriend: his skin has the texture of cling film, his eyes do a lot of rolling and he often simply repeats what is said to him. Not a penetrating look at human interaction, but an arresting picture of physical isolation.More H2O power in Sabrina Mahfouz’s A History of Water in the Middle East: part lecture, part gig. This exploration of mainly British interference – from the 1916 Sykes-Picot treaty to Suez to Palestine – throws out and throws away possibilities at each turn. As a British Egyptian, Mahfouz has a promising double focus and a riveting tale of being recruited as a spy after working as a cocktail waitress. Swaying as she – almost – raps, she draws on the musical talent of Kareem Samara on drums and oud, and on the magnificent voice of Laura Hanna.But the ingredients are not melded together: anecdote and didacticism fight each other. Save in one amazing episode. A flash-forward to 2050 and a female plumber in Jordan, designated the plumbing capital of the Middle East: a place where it is possible for a girl to say “pass the spanner” with no sexual innuendo. The vision is delivered in a cascading aria at once funny and provoking: “Leeeeaks!” Get that on tap.Star ratings (out of five)There Are No Beginnings ★★★★Solaris ★★★★A History of Water in the Middle East ★★There Are No Beginnings is at Leeds Playhouse until 2 NovemberSolaris is at the Lyric Hammersmith, London, until 2 NovemberA History of Water in the Middle East is at the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs, Royal Court, London, until 16 November This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I Have Met the Enemy (and the Enemy Is Us) review – ticking bomb of Britain's arms trade,"Byker Community Centre, NewcastleThis explosive, techno-soundtracked assault on the military machine cuts between war-zone combatants and anxious families in the weapons industry",Mark Fisher,2019-10-18T20:00:08+0100,"Two men look each other in the eye and remember the first time they met. By rights, they should never have come into contact, this Welsh squaddie and this Palestinian actor. In other circumstances, they would have been enemy combatants. They are wise to be wary. But, as soon as they discover a shared love of techno (both are DJs), the cultural divide evaporates.Their testament to a real-life friendship is a sweet and tender moment at the centre of Evie Manning and Rhiannon White’s volatile production for Common Wealth and Northern Stage. But already something is amiss. No sooner have Alexander Eley and Mo’min Swaitat bonded than Jamie Grier’s soundscape booms like the showering of bombs, and all around the room a phalanx of digital metronomes begin ticking neurotically: there are 72 of them, as many as Saudi Arabia has UK-built Eurofighter Typhoon jets.The shift in tone is characteristic of this restless production, in which scenes are less crafted than grafted together, rubbing abrasively against each other in a provoking juxtaposition of ideas. Devised by the company, the show starts by casting the audience as prospective buyers at an arms fair before taking us to an Afghan warzone, a Yemeni wedding and a Palestinian rave. If the structure of I Have Met the Enemy (and the Enemy Is Us) seems precarious, its political purpose is not.We lurch from Swaitat’s memories of surviving Israeli border checks to Eley’s accounts of escaping Taliban IEDs. Their stories are interspersed with video commentary from artist Shatha Altowai, who lost her home in Yemen to an air strike. As we follow the action around the hall, members of the community cast add details about working-class employment in the arms industry and the export of UK weapons.The linking theme is the military machine that makes all this possible. In the everyday stories of dog walks, family gatherings and worried mothers, the personal entangled with the political. And in the face of a unifying dancefloor beat and the calm of a post-rave chill-out, an industry dedicated to killing looks all the more outrageous.• At Byker Community Centre, Newcastle, until 26 October."
For All the Women Who Thought They Were Mad review – a great unravelling,"Hackney Showroom, LondonZawe Ashton aims high with an intricate dissection of race and gender but a smart ending can’t save this muddled show",Arifa Akbar,2019-10-18T13:51:14+0100,"Zawe Ashton has described her play as both an “investigation into the fallout of colonialism” on the women of the African diaspora and an exploration of what it means to be a black woman in Britain today. Her script uses dreamlike sequences and non-realist dialogue to create a seemingly ordinary world that is skewed and bent to hark back to other times and dimensions. It skitters from past to present, from the living to the dead, from the individual to the collective.It is a profoundly original and ambitious way to approach the subject of inherited intergenerational trauma and the toxic legacy of racial oppression. In practice, the play only partly pulls it off and leaves us frustrated given the potential of Ashton’s creative vision.The drama revolves around Joy (Mina Andala), a career woman working long hours to get ahead in a 40-storey office block. Early on, someone jumps out of the building and this suicidal act triggers Joy’s inner unravelling. Five women and a young girl stand at the sidelines of Joy’s life, occasionally intercepting the action but for the most part foreshadowing her fate in doom-laden tones.They are a chorus, both witnessing and reflecting Joy’s distress as well as relating African village life to her urban existence. They speak in opaque riddles imbued with poetry and mysticism that verge on the hammy (“You can’t stop a river”, “She loved the water and the stars”) and hit a note of thudding urgency right from the start that comes to sound loud and unrelenting.The central mystery is hinted at but never fully articulated. Some clues are dropped about the source of Joy’s distress but the plot unfolds in seemingly non-sequitur, elliptical scenes. “I can’t put the pieces together,” says one character, and she speaks for us as well. Natalie Pryce and Ultz’s stage design seems deliberately withholding, too: the set is bare but for some chairs and a window at the back.The best moments are darkly comic. There is a spark of magic realism when Joy realises she is pregnant, her stomach growing instantly. Jumoké Fashola plays Joy’s mother Ruth, a charismatic character who brings a fizzy satire to the stage in one scene and is so vividly drawn that you wish for more in this register.The other characters feel less developed, as does Joy’s relationship to them. Many important themes are touched on – the scapegoating of women as “witches”, natural healing, complicated motherhood, ancestral hauntings, the trauma of memory, modern-day racist micro-aggressions – but it is all too much for anything to be explored fully. The final, startling scene makes sudden sense of the play’s various puzzles, and it has a clever, retrospective logic. But it comes together a little too late.At Hackney Showroom, London, until 9 November"
Alicia Alonso obituary,Star ballerina and choreographer passionately committed to dance in Cuba,Judith Mackrell,2019-10-17T18:56:46+0100,"When Alicia Alonso was 20, and launched on a dancing career in New York, her future seemed assured. She had just been recruited to the city’s newly formed ballet company, Ballet Theatre, and already she was being cast in principal roles. But she had one anxiety: the flashing lights and dark spots that crisscrossed her vision. When she eventually went to be tested, she was diagnosed with severe retinal detachment.During the following two years, Alonso was forced to undergo three major eye operations with long periods of recovery during which she was unable to leave her bed. Yet she never stopped dancing. The role she had always aspired to perform was Giselle, and lying flat on her back she began to rehearse it – imagining the steps in her head and dancing them with her fingers on the sheet.The doctors told Alonso that she would never regain her peripheral vision and that her sight would progressively deteriorate. Despite all their warnings, Alonso not only returned to Ballet Theatre in 1943 but also made her debut as Giselle that year, stepping in at the last moment for the company’s injured ballerina Alicia Markova.She was greeted as a new star, the critic Edwin Denby hailing her as a “meticulous stylist”, and Giselle became the role with which she was most identified. Over the next four and a half decades, Alonso continued to defy doctors’ orders. She performed using specially placed lights to guide her onstage as her vision got worse, trusting to the whispered guidance of her partners, and to a precautionary wire stretched across the front of the stage.Alonso, who has died aged 98, had been stubborn and ambitious from a very early age. She was born Alicia Ernestina de la Caridad del Cobre Martínez y del Hoyo in Havana to wealthy Spanish-Cuban parents. Her father was an officer in the army. In pre-revolutionary Cuba, life for a young woman of her class could be pampered, but from the age of nine Alonso was obsessed with ballet, training at the Sociedad Pro-Arte Musical in Havana. As a teenager, she danced Odette in an edited version of Swan Lake, using the stage name Alicia Martínez.At this time she also fell in love with a fellow student, Fernando Alonso, and in 1937 they married and left for New York and its promise of greater professional opportunities. Despite giving birth to a daughter, Laura, shortly afterwards, Alonso’s progress was remarkable. She continued her training at the School of American Ballet and with noted teachers such as Anatole Vilzak, Ludmilla Schollar and Antony Tudor; by 1938 she was dancing on Broadway and by 1939 she was touring with George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein’s Ballet Caravan (the company with which she danced her first major role as the Mother/Sweetheart in Eugene Loring’s Billy the Kid).By 1940, when she joined Ballet Theatre, Alonso was developing an exceptional technique. She displayed an almost masculine strength and control in her balances and pirouettes but she possessed a distinctively feminine quality of expression – sensual, lyrical and vividly dramatic.Despite the grim years of enforced immobility her career continued on its swift upward rise. Following her success in Giselle, in 1943, she was cast in an increasing number of leading roles. By 1946 she had been promoted to principal rank. That year Igor Youskevitch joined Ballet Theatre and became her regular stage partner. The chemistry between them was soon being compared to Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire in its emotional and physical rapport and was enshrined in Balanchine’s Theme and Variations, created for them in 1947.The following year Ballet Theatre was suffering temporary financial problems , at which point Alonso opted to return to Havana to found her own company, Ballet Alicia Alonso. She brought several New York dancers with her and performed as the company’s ballerina as well as choreographing and staging works including Giselle and a full-length Swan Lake.She was determined to nurture some kind of professional ballet culture in Cuba, and for several years commuted between New York and Havana, sustaining the company with Fernando as general director, his brother Alberto as choreographer and artistic director and with financial assistance from wealthy Cuban families and the ministry of education.During the second half of the 1950s the repressive regime of Fulgencio Batista made it difficult for her to keep her company going and Alonso was largely abroad. She toured with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, performed with the Bolshoi and Kirov (she was the first western ballerina to be invited to the Soviet Union) and reunited with Ballet Theatre.By 1959 she was at the peak of her international celebrity as well as her professional artistry. Yet when Fidel Castro’s revolutionary party came to power and Alonso was invited to return home to relaunch her company as the National Ballet of Cuba she responded almost immediately. With Castro’s support and financial aid, the remarkable process was set in motion by which Alonso, with the help of Fernando, turned Cuba into a world centre for classical ballet.Integral to the success of the project was the excellence of the National Ballet School that they opened in 1962. Trawling the island’s towns and villages for possible talent, offering some of Cuba’s most underprivileged children the chance of a prestigious career, the school was able to nurture an exceptional concentration of dancers. Most exceptional were the men. Cuban families valued ballet as a profession – on a par with medicine and the law – and unlike most countries there was as much enthusiasm for the new school among the boys as the girls.But Alonso understood that she needed not just dancers. She needed to create audiences too and in the early years she and her company undertook extensive tours around the island, performing in factories, military centres and farms. With state subsidy keeping ticket prices low, ballet became one of Cuba’s favourite national entertainments – almost as popular as sport.During subsequent decades Alonso’s personal importance to the company remained immeasurable. US economic sanctions against Castro’s regime meant that ballet along with the rest of Cuba suffered from chronic financial difficulties and cultural isolation. Alonso filled in as many gaps as she could – creating much of the repertory herself as well as training new choreographers. She also used her international contacts, securing precious invitations for the company to dance abroad, and attracting foreign gifts and subsidies to bolster the inadequate state funding.From the 1990s onwards, however, critics of Alonso’s regime felt she could have done more to keep pace with changing trends and styles, that she could have surrounded herself with more alert and challenging advisers. She did not pick up on the dissatisfaction among her dancers until until early 2019, when she named Viengsay Valdés as her deputy artistic director.Over the years Cuba began to lose some of its finest talents, such as the dancers Jose Manuel Carreño and Carlos Acosta, who went abroad for more varied artistic opportunities. Among those who stayed at home, the atmosphere within the National Ballet became factional.Yet Alonso remained an inspiration. Well beyond her 90th birthday she continued to go into the company office and to attend almost every performance. When she entered the theatre, the audience stood up for her as though she were royalty. As a passionate patriot she remained committed to the importance of dance in Cuba and as a passionate artist she never lost her own sense of vocation. She often lay awake at nights remembering past performances, and wondering how she could have improved them. “I looked for perfection every day,” she said “and I never gave up.”Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1975. She is survived by Laura, and by her second husband, Pedro Simón.• Alicia Alonso (Alicia Ernestina de la Caridad del Cobre Martínez y del Hoyo), ballerina, choreographer and ballet director, born 21 December 1920; died 17 October 2019"
Hannah Gadsby: ‘Quit comedy? I can’t – I’ve got no other skillset!’,"The comic was due to retire, until her show Nanette made her an overnight star. So how does she plan to top it?",Brian Logan,2019-10-19T07:00:36+0100,"Over her 10-year standup career, Hannah Gadsby had played to more than a few thin midweek houses. So when she was making her 2017 show Nanette, and beginning to sense it might be rather good, the Australian comic dared to dream an impossible dream. “I remember thinking: ‘Wow, it would be great to be able to not worry about whether I’ll sell the room on a Wednesday.”Reader: her dreams came true – and then some. Nanette, a disavowal of comedy (its lies and omissions, the damage it can do) disguised as a standup show, became one of the major entertainment events of the decade. It won the biggest prizes at the Melbourne and Edinburgh comedy festivals, toured the world, and its Netflix special became a cultural phenomenon, earning Gadsby a best writing award at last month’s Emmys. Far from worrying if anyone will show up, she now counts Emma Thompson and Monica Lewinsky among her many famous fans. “It really is mind-boggling what’s happened to me,” says Gadsby, mid-tour and cheerful on the phone from the US. “Literally my mind is boggling.” Then – never one to leave an imprecision hanging – she qualifies: “Actually that’s not literal: I don’t know what boggling means.”The show she is touring is her first post-Nanette offering, entitled Douglas. It is playing to audiences far bigger than Gadsby had become used to (even the Wednesdays are selling), and will land in the UK this month. As we shall see, it’s a reaction to the furore around its predecessor, as well as a placeholder while Gadsby calculates what to do with her new status. She has not adjusted to it yet – her life has changed beyond recognition – and is still puzzling over what made Nanette so profound an experience for so many.“As I toured Nanette,” she reflects, “the #MeToo movement hit its straps. There was a zeitgeist that made it blow up like it did.” Nanette was about Gadsby’s sometimes brutal experiences of sexism and homophobia, particularly in her native Tasmania. With meticulous control, it spoke about how she turned those experiences into jokes – and, by doing so, collaborated in her own oppression. At least to begin with, it didn’t stint on classic one-liners (“I’m not lesbian enough … I mean, I keep my hand in”) but it repurposed them to radical effect (“I wouldn’t want to be a straight white man if you paid me, although the pay would be substantially better”). Then – bait-and-switch successfully accomplished – it set the gags aside, and instead delivered a savage critique of how comedy works and which stories it will and won’t let us tell.That may be why, Gadsby speculates, a lot of people “who don’t feel catered for by standup as it has usually been” flocked to her show. “But also,” she admits, wrestling with the reasons for Nanette’s impact, “I have no idea. I could give you a lot of theories. I put a lot of work into that show. It’s not an accidental piece of work. But I wouldn’t be able to tell you what the recipe was that made it land like it did.”If the explanation is elusive, there is no doubt about the show’s transformative effect on the 41-year-old’s life. Gadsby was a respected fringe-festival regular. Her style was downbeat bordering on dour, with the low energy redeemed by forensic wit (often at her own expense) and the kind of heavy sardonicism signalled by 2011’s show title Mrs Chuckles. It all added up to a credible – if not lucrative – standup career: until Nanette, she “didn’t believe I’d ever be able to afford a home of my own”.The show’s success put the kibosh on Gadsby’s plan to retire from standup. She made the “I quit” announcement onstage as part of the show; it was a key part of Nanette’s excoriating effect. Now, she reclassifies that as a theatrical device. “It became this very odd mix of a conceit and also: ‘I mean it.’ What it meant was: ‘I don’t care about my reputation as a comedian. I don’t care about the artform of comedy. I care more about what I’m saying, not how I am saying it.’ But it became cathartic for me to say it onstage and kind of believe it.” She pauses, then – as if she needs to justify still being a comedian – adds: “but also: what am I going to do? Sit on a park bench? I can’t quit. I’ve no other skill set.”So here she still is, a full-time, gigging comedian, albeit one whose sense of herself has changed dramatically. “Before Nanette,” she says, “I didn’t feel like a powerful person at all. I was always very low status. And now I have high status. I have a platform, and a lot of people will read or listen to what I say. I am not, as an individual, oppressed any more,” she says, the amazement audible in her voice. “But I still represent a collection of identities that are oppressed minorities.”As an art history graduate (she has made shows on the subject; one of Nanette’s most pointed routines was about Picasso), it amuses Gadsby – a self-described “big queer woman from a low socio-economic background” – that her work is now canonical. “It’s really funny to me that if there’s a canon of comedy – which is not an idea I’m a fan of – then I’ve just sort of plopped myself in there.”But the adjustment she is having to make is practical as well as conceptual. Her life is busier and harder to navigate now – which is not easy for a woman who has been vocal in the past about her social unease. “I am finding it hard,” she agrees, “because I like familiarity and there’s not much about my life just now that is familiar.”Which brings us to Douglas, one of the standout themes of which is Gadsby’s autism. She was diagnosed as autistic just before she made Nanette. It made sense of her lifelong feeling that her brain worked differently – an understanding that in turn helped her make her breakout show. Now she is addressing it directly onstage. Because “people don’t understand autism,” she says, “particularly the experience of women on the spectrum. Medicine has not prioritised the study of the female experience at all.” The show is named after the so-called Pouch of Douglas, a part of the female anatomy “discovered” by 18th-century midwife James Douglas. (Douglas is also the name of the comedian’s dog.)Beyond the gender issue, the show finds Gadsby “trying to pull into focus the ableism that is inherent in the structures we have to navigate. There is an assumption that if you’re not typical then you’re a burden,” she says. “And I think that’s an arrogant assumption.”That may give the impression that Douglas is as serious-minded as Nanette – which very much isn’t the case, says Gadsby. “It’s really playful, she says. “I’m having more fun onstage. Which is important for me, because I put myself through the wringer performing Nanette.” In Douglas, she riffs on men who play golf, her unlikely new life in LA – and Where’s Wally. (“[He] should have to find himself like the rest of us do.”) Intentionally or otherwise, the lighter tone addresses the most common criticism of Nanette, which is that, because of its seriousness, it wasn’t comedy – and Gadsby, by implication, wasn’t a comedian at all.That arose in part, she says, from the “very different comedy culture [in the States]. In Australia and the UK, where comedians have long been writing concept shows and pushing boundaries, Nanette was not that unusual. But in the land of Netflix specials, it was very different.” But far from losing sleep over the criticism, which she sees as just another attempt to silence a non-mainstream voice, Gadsby addresses it in her new show. “I really enjoy the anatomy of hate,” she says, then corrects herself. “Not enjoy, but I’m fascinated by it. I like to hold what people throw at me and study it and bring it to the stage.” Or, as she has said elsewhere: “Why not troll the trolls?”At any rate, she is having fun with Douglas, developing a show in front of her vast new audience, who are “very happy in the auditorium before I’ve even done anything”, she marvels. “Which makes the job easier.” She sounds like an artist wholly liberated, her Nanette journey having convinced her that “we really don’t know what audiences want, because we’ve stopped asking them. I thought Nanette was going to be really divisive. But instead audiences went: ‘We really like this!’ And I think that’s fascinating.”So what is Gadsby going to do with these legions of new fans – and with an entertainment world that is, all of a sudden, at her feet? Well, she is clearly not going to squander the principles that got her here in the first place. “I am now personally a rich and powerful white woman,” she says, hooting with laughter at the thought. “And I have to be careful about that. My platform has always been: I hate people who abuse their power. I want to keep speaking to these identities that I still see as being vulnerable.”Artistically as well, “it’s important for me,” she says, “not to protect where I’ve got to. Not to write and perform from the standpoint of: ‘I need to hold on to this new patch.’ I want my stance still to be: it’s more important to care about what you’re saying than where it’s going to get you.”Just as it has been exciting to look on as Gadsby’s life has transformed overnight, it is a thrill to watch her unpick that success and puzzle over how to use it. What seems certain is that she will remain one of comedy’s most considered and critical voices. And that, however she deploys her newfound celebrity, it won’t be accidental. “I have a lot at my fingertips,” she says. “I did take some meetings in Hollywood. And I ended up feeling: I don’t know what I want to do. But I know I don’t want to do something just because I can.“So I’m going to make sure that what I do is something I can do well. And that will give to the world more than it takes. For now,” she says, “I’m having a think about that. And I’m taking my time.”Hannah Gadsby plays New Theatre, Oxford, Thursday 24; Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Friday 25 October; touring to 23 November"
"'God, I was disgusting!' – Ali Wong on why women's bodies are the last taboo","The standup behind Baby Cobra found fame with her candid material on sex and pregnancy. Back with a memoir, she talks about her work ethic, the taboo of miscarriage – and performing in front of her in-laws",Emine Saner,2019-10-17T06:00:59+0100,"In her memoir, written as letters to her two young daughters, Ali Wong tells them she would be worried if they wanted to become standup comics like her. Wong, who slogged it out on the open-mic circuit, presents a grim account of life on the road: dying onstage, bad food, bad men. She did it for more than a decade before becoming a star seemingly overnight with her first Netflix special, performed while seven-and-a-half months pregnant. Did she ever consider giving up? “There were times when I thought to myself: ‘I really don’t know if I can do this for the rest of my life,’” she says on the phone from her home in LA. “You know, staying at those motels, getting paid that little amount of money. I’m certain I would not have endured. I couldn’t. Especially after having kids.”Luckily for Wong, she didn’t have to; instead, her career blew up. In 2016, Netflix launched her special, Baby Cobra, and she has since had a second, Hard Knock Wife. She has also co-written and starred in a romantic comedy film, Always Be My Maybe; had her two children; and published Dear Girls, the memoir written for them. Her tours sell out and her peers rave about her (Amy Schumer calls her “revolutionary”, Chris Rock championed her). “It’s been an unbelievable three years,” she says with some understatement.Offstage, she seems softer and more laid-back than her fierce and foul-mouthed standup persona. In the book, she recalls starting out: “I was very dirty back then. Even now, I’ll look back on those days and think: ‘God, you were disgusting.’” Which is very funny if you have seen any of Wong’s comedy, because you will know how filthy she is now. In Baby Cobra, there are gags about anal sex and vaginal secretions; in Hard Knock Wife, there are jokes about the things she would like to do to their nanny if he was 25, male and “not ugly”.When Wong first performed comedy, she was repeatedly told it was all too much. “All of these people in the industry kept on telling me: ‘You’re likable and you’re cute, or whatever, but the jokes are really dirty and you’d get booked a lot more, and you’d be a lot more appealing if they were clean,’” she says. “Maybe people were half-laughing, half-cringing at my jokes. But if you’re successful, people should be too busy laughing to cringe.” Her jokes may not have got cleaner, but they did get better.Even now, she says people (men) told her that her material on childbirth and breastfeeding, which made it into her second special, wasn’t interesting enough. “There was one guy who said: ‘It was so much better when you were talking about dating because people can’t relate to breastfeeding,’” she says. “But it’s all I wanted to talk about. That’s kind of the whole point for me with standup, that this is not a network TV sitcom where I have to appeal to everyone.” She pauses for a split second: “I ignored that advice.”Wong is not the first female comic to tell dirty jokes, or talk about sex, but what does feel unusual is her insistence on busting the idea that at the raw, biological level, women aren’t every bit as revolting as men. Why is it still so taboo for women to talk about bodily functions and all the fluids and secretions that ooze out of us? “I was raised to be very open about my body,” she says. Her father was a doctor, and she says her parents were always very straight with her about everything, from sex to the nonexistence of Santa Claus. She thinks for a moment about the question of taboo. “Maybe it’s because women feel they want to maintain some mystery that they’re not gross, to be more attractive or something. For me it’s all part of intimacy. That’s how I define intimacy – living closer and being more honest, closer to what your real desires are – and it’s exciting.”Still, people thank me for making them feel less embarrassed, less ashamed and less sad about having a miscarriageHer parents have been to her shows. Worse, so have her in-laws. (She is married to Justin Hakuta, who worked for a tech company but gave it up to support her career.) “That was nerve-racking. I was much less polished then and I think I talked about Japanese porn and how they blur out the genitals, and I did an imitation of a Japanese porn star screaming. That was pretty wild. But they were really supportive.”I wonder if she is unembarrassable (there are jokes about defecating at work and her promiscuity during her 20s). “No. For sure, no. I’ll give you an example.” She says that the other day, she and Randall Park, her friend and co-star in Always Be My Maybe, were guest judges on the TV show Top Chef. “I saw his face sort of scrunch up and I was like: ‘Oh my God, I’m so sorry, I think I accidentally farted.’ He moved his chair away from me and he was laughing hysterically, too. It smelled so bad and I was so embarrassed.” She laughs: “I’m definitely embarrassable.”When she had a miscarriage, which she talked about in her first Netflix show, one of her emotions was embarrassment. “I felt a lot of things. I felt sad, but then when I had to tell everybody the news it was something …” She pauses. “Embarrassment is when you wish you didn’t have to tell somebody something, and it wasn’t something I really wanted to share with everybody but I had to because I had bragged that I was pregnant.” There was a huge reaction to Wong talking about her miscarriage at the time. “It was very taboo for women to talk about miscarriage and it still kind of is. Still to this day, people walk up to me on the street, thanking me for making them feel less embarrassed, less ashamed and less sad about having a miscarriage.”Wong writes that “comedy requires taking risks”, although she says this is less about subject matter – nothing is off-limits as long as the joke is well-written – than about being unafraid of failure. “I guess that’s what I meant about taking risks: for every polished joke you see onstage, there are maybe 100 I tried out that failed. And people in the audience thinking I was a terrible comedian. I was always kind of OK with that.”As a child, Wong was funny but, the youngest of four, she was also a quiet observer. “I would say that I grew up listening, a lot. I have vivid memories of details, things people said and how exactly they said them.” She grew up in San Francisco, where her father, born to Chinese parents, was an anaesthetist, and her mother, born in Vietnam, was a social worker. What was it like to write about her family’s experience of being immigrants? “It was great because I think about it all the time,” she says. Her paternal grandfather came to the US from China as an eight-year-old, travelling alone by ship. “I see kids and how young they really are and I cannot imagine them coming on a boat by themselves, going to another country to work and be separated from their parents. It really humbles me and makes me grateful and it gave me a huge sense of …” She thinks for a second. “It’s part of my identity and gave me a very strong work ethic.”A few hours after she got married in San Francisco, Wong performed in her wedding dress at a club in the city; some nights early on in her career, while living in New York, she would perform up to nine sets at different clubs. She has only had four breaks from standup – her honeymoon, after the births of her two daughters, and when she was shooting the film. These days, once the children are in bed, she turns up unannounced and unpaid at comedy clubs up to five nights a week to try out new material. She describes it as a “calling. I just really like telling jokes”.I used to dress like a kid, to desexualise myself. I'd be terrified if my daughters wanted to be standupsShe writes that she has an “unusual amount of Asian pride”. That came from her parents, she says. “A lot of people talk about how they never saw themselves on screen but my parents actively made sure I saw myself on screen all the time. And we had friends who were artists and we would go to their gallery shows.” Now, she says, she makes an effort to see what other Asian American creators are up to – whether in TV, literature, art or fashion – and will introduce her children to it. “I think [if you] consume mainstream pop culture and don’t activate a search for any other niche outlets then you can fall into this feeling that you are inferior.”One male comic once told her that her career was only taking off because she was female and from an ethnic minority. “That they have that attitude towards me is an indicator of why they are lacking in success. If you think that is the winning combo for success then you’re in trouble.” Wasn’t it infuriating? “You know, it’s not. If it was someone that I respected it would really bum me out.”When Wong first started performing, she would wear her hair in two cute buns, and dress in “huge cargo pants”. “I used to dress like a kid, to desexualise myself,” she says. “I think that’s the main reason why I would be so terrified if my daughters wanted to be standup comics – it’s not because of them being onstage, it’s because of the road. You kind of have to go through that.” The comics she respects are the ones who came up through the circuit, rather than those who got famous on a sitcom or YouTube videos. “But the road is very scary. It always felt unsafe. Even now, when I perform at shows around town, I always ask somebody to walk me back to my car.”With the #MeToo movement, comedy has come under scrutiny and there have been allegations of sexual harassment made against several male comics. Has Wong ever experienced sexual harassment at work? She is hesitant for a while, trying to find the words. “I think I’m just not ready to share all that stuff yet, but of course there has been not-great stuff that’s happened. So … yeah. In terms of how things have changed, I guess nowadays the culture has changed, so that when people do some joke that you’ve heard before about women being ‘naggy’ or something, it just feels dated. A lot of material that would make fun of women that used to be maybe kind of funny doesn’t feel funny any more.”Wong runs jokes about her husband past him before they make it into her shows. “A hilarious joke that performs well in front of strangers but that my husband hates is not worth getting divorced over,” she says. “My marriage is much more valuable than a great joke.” Does he mind being talked about? “I get asked that all the time but male comics have been making fun of their wives for so long and I wonder if male comics get asked the same thing. This is what standup comics do: they talk about their life and if they have a partner, they talk about their partner. But I don’t feel like male comics are ever asked about what it’s like for their wife.” I think she is right, but a male comic probably would get asked, were he to make jokes, as Wong does, about the most intimate details of their sex life. “Right,” says Wong, with a laugh. “Yes, yes. That’s true.”While her hilarious and unrelenting filthiness is what got Wong noticed, her comedy is full of more nuanced commentary on what it is to be a woman: the double standards of mothering, the pressures of out-earning one’s husband, the reconciliation of bringing up two children under four and doing a job she loves. “I constantly feel like I’m failing at both working and being your mom,” she writes in Dear Girls. In Hard Knock Wife, she talks about the scandal of the US’s lack of paid maternity leave; is she interested in being more political? “I don’t know,” she says, then, as an aside: “As a British person, don’t you think it’s just so barbaric that we don’t give maternity leave?” Topical, political jokes, she says, have “never been my forte. I’m also a little bit intimidated because there are so many other comics who are so good at that.” She is well placed to skewer it in the current climate in the US, increasingly hostile to immigrants, but doesn’t seem sure if she wants to go there. Still, she points out, by doing what she loves and doing it well, “even me putting myself out there sometimes is political. You know what I mean? Some people can’t stand that.”Dear Girls is out today, published by Canongate, available for £13.19 from Guardian Bookshop.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

On my radar: Josie Long’s cultural highlights,The comedian on the history that inspired her new podcast and her favourite new music and theatre,Kathryn Bromwich,2019-10-13T10:00:10+0100,"Josie Long began performing standup at 14 and won the BBC New Comedy award at 17. After studying English at the University of Oxford, she won Chortle awards in 2005 and 2007 and has been nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy award for best show three times. Her new podcast, Speaking With Shadows, an English Heritage series about overlooked people in history, is out now. She performs at Soho theatre, London, 11-20 November and tours the UK in early 2020. This is the funniest show I have seen in years. I love how sweet-hearted and loving it is. It’s about an incompetent lettings agent, Stath (played by Jamie Demetriou), and his sister Sophie (played by his actual sister Natasia). They have such a kind, funny relationship on the show: it feels real, actually capturing the ways people have fun with each other. The whole programme is written with a true and clear comic voice that is also incredibly big and silly. I watch every episode two or three times just so I don’t miss anything. I’m already desperate for there to be another series and this one only finished a couple of weeks ago.I’ve got a 16-month-old baby and I was recently away for work for a few days – I was nervous to be away from her, but it was really exciting because I never get to read a book these days. I read The Handmaid’s Tale 15 years ago and I’ve been enjoying the TV series, so it was a joy being back in that world and knowing more about the characters. It felt like a feast. She’s a bit kinder to the characters, so it’s almost consoling. By the end, it’s slightly less of an unjust universe.I love Jeanie Finlay’s work – I think I’ve seen everything she’s made. Seahorse tells the story of a guy called Freddy McConnell who gave birth to a son, and about what it means for him to become a dad as a trans man. It’s so brave of him – he really puts himself out there, all of the emotional difficulty, all the vulnerability. There’s so much transphobia around, so it’s a really good film to come out now: it’s loving, and tender, and you come away from it so happy for him and his family.Eight years ago, I was part of a group of people who climbed Mount Kenya for charity, and we all did a gig at the top of the mountain. Roxy was singing and I’ll never forget what a beautiful, otherworldly experience it was to hear someone with a voice like hers in that environment. I was reminded of that trip recently and I realised her record’s been out for a year. Her voice and songwriting are sublime, and she has really diverse influences. Pull Me Down is a great song.This play is about young people in Margate – the main character has been forced to move there and she’s feeling homesick, but then she notices the parakeets she loved in London are also in Margate and she starts to feel better. I don’t know anyone else who can structure shows the way Aphrodite does: she’s able to immerse you in a completely full world. Her partner, Gaz, whose nom de plume is Quiet Boy, makes the music, and it’s funny and silly and also beautiful and moving. The lead, Michelle Tiwo, was incredible: it was such a charming performance.I was really lucky to get to go into the old cells here and see some graffiti from conscientious objectors from the first world war. It was the most thrilling experience: it’s such a rare thing to get to see pencil graffiti from 1916. It’s a miracle they survived to this day. Every one of them tells you so much about the person who wrote it: there’s religious stuff, there’s all these ones that are like “Socialism now!”, which I love, and there are really personal ones – one guy did a beautiful portrait of his sweetheart.

Rob Beckett: 'Comedy is just a hobby that got out of hand',"TV’s most relatable comic – with TV’s most distinctive teeth – talks about sleeping in toilets, being ‘chavvy’ and how Twitter trolls drove him to therapy",Hannah J Davies,2019-10-08T16:07:49+0100,"‘Have you ever been to Disneyland?” Rob Beckett asks, buzzing with the energy of a small child as he bounds into a bar near the Guardian. “I’ve just come back from the one in Paris. My girls’ faces when they saw Daffy Duck ... it was magical!” Talking over chips and mayonnaise, Beckett is as wholesome and family-oriented in person as he is in his act. “I lead quite a boring life really,” he assures me in his chipper, estuary voice. “I go to work, come home, look after my kids and go Nando’s. It’s not like, ‘Oh my god, remember that crazy time I grew up in a brothel!?’”Beckett is, of course, downplaying his own appeal in a way that only primetime TV personalities can. Now 33, he only landed his first TV gig in 2012, having started comedy three years before that, but now he rarely seems to be off screens, a pre-watershed geezer who can also slip into the post-9pm slots with ease.You can find him doing his thing on 8 Out of 10 Cats, where he trades barbs with host Jimmy Carr, often based around Beckett’s distinctive teeth. He’s also a fixture of Celebs Go Dating, on which he provides a “harsh, pisstake-y” voiceover that knowingly prods contestants such as Blue’s Lee Ryan. He also does Saturday night extravaganzas like the Beeb’s recently cancelled All Together Now, which he compered alongside Geri Horner.With his Brylcreemed blond hair and those trademark gnashers – larger than average, though smaller in real life – he has an air of relatability. It’s a winning combination, which has seen him swiftly join the ranks of Michael McIntyre, Jon Richardson and Jack Whitehall as one of those TV comics-cum-hosts we seem to see more often than our own families.Although he sounds as if he could have been genetically engineered by TV commissioners, Beckett is quite real. He doesn’t mix too much with the celeb crowd – though he has, he says proudly, become pals with Martine McCutcheon, who lives close to him. He’s still based in London, near to the suburb, Mottingham, where he and his four brothers grew up. His is a big, happy, working-class family, providing Beckett with much of his early material – including a bit about how he much preferred eating dinner off his lap and watching You’ve Been Framed at his folks’ house to talking politics in his girlfriend’s family’s conservatory.He studied tourism management at Canterbury Christ Church University (“it was the Blair years, everyone went”) before moving back home, working in a pub, flogging bags of compost alongside one of his brothers at Columbia Road flower market in London, and eventually temping in an office. Inspired by a range of comics from Peter Kay to Eddie Murphy, Beckett tentatively ventured to open mic nights and competitions in London, and was soon gigging five nights a week. “It was just a hobby that got out of hand, basically,” he explains. Before shows, he says, he would “go and get the £1 sushi from Tesco and sleep on the toilet floor at the office I worked at”.Despite a gruelling time at the Amused Moose Laugh Off competition in Adelaide in 2010 – evading tram fares and playing to empty rooms – Beckett was now serious about pursuing comedy. He headed for the bright lights of the Edinburgh festival on his return, performing a show, Summer Holiday, which focused mostly on his family and his girlfriend, now wife, Louise. While he gained acclaim (one review said his show “meanders between the brazen and the subtle”), unlike most new-ish comics, he wasn’t destined to spend the next few years traipsing up and down the M1. Instead, the bigwigs called, and he was soon back in Australia, presenting the I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here companion show, Extra Camp, alongside seasoned reality TV hosts Joe Swash and Laura Whitmore.I'm a Celeb is the hardest job on telly for a newbie – you're in a jungle working nightsDoes he ever wish his ascent had been less rapid? “Sort of,” he says tentatively. “But I’ve not met anyone who’s said they really enjoyed it taking longer to get to that point. Maybe it wouldn’t have been so stressful and full-on, but it’s never the perfect time to do anything.” Besides, I’m a Celeb wasn’t the kind of thing he could bluff. “It’s the hardest job in telly as a newbie,” he says. “You’re writing standup every night on your own and presenting live TV. It’s like a really tough apprenticeship in front of two million people.” Plus, he adds with a laugh and a panicked look, “you’re in a jungle working nights”.It was a huge opportunity for Beckett, but also one that opened his eyes to the reality of online trolling. The team on the show, he says, “looked after us really well. But it was when Twitter was taking off, and the abuse I’d get … I was getting 1,000 followers every night and hundreds of messages. I’d read every one of them, like, ‘You’re shit’, ‘You’re fat’, ‘You’re unfunny’. I was in a really bad way after that.”It was at this point that Beckett sought NHS counselling, as well as getting into meditation and mindfulness. “I’m so glad I did that early doors because it gave me coping strategies. Even now, if you do get chucked on telly, the first couple of years, everyone goes at you until they just get used to seeing you. It’s not healthy to read such extreme opinions of yourself – it’s not like you’re a brand like Coca-Cola or McDonald’s because it’s so personal.”Ironically, his impressive new gig had taken away one of his best defences. As a standup, he would open his early sets by reeling off lists of “lookalikes”, among them the Honey Monster, Princess Diana and Pat Butcher, to get ahead of the heckles. “People think Twitter’s the problem but it’s not, it’s people. When I was doing standup, I couldn’t get through a set without someone going, ‘You look like someone,’ or ‘Hello teeth!’ and being heckled. So I used to address it at the top.”While performing live has its own challenges, Beckett is keen to stress how much he’s looking forward to his upcoming tour, Wallop, which focuses more on his own family and fatherhood. “I can’t imagine a time I don’t want to do standup,” he says. “It sounds quite mad, but once I’ve got a show up and running, walking out on stage is the easiest part of my day. All I’ve got to do is talk until they laugh and then I stop, let them laugh and talk. It’s a bit like meditation really.”He started out as a working-class comic, now he is just a comic. Would he still make jokes about, say, the “chavvy” way his family ate dinner watching dogs fall in puddles on TV? “In my new show, I say I’m related to some absolute scum,” he says with a laugh. “But everyone is in a way, int they? I don’t think I’ve ever directly called my family chavvy but sometimes you use a word that an audience will know or understand. And I can be quite chavvy – but then I don’t necessarily see it as that big of a negative.”In any case, Beckett is keen to emphasise how important his parents have been to him, as both a source of material and of support, especially in the middle-class world of comedy. When he was sleeping on that toilet floor, it was his dad – a black-cab driver – who would give him a lift home. “I didn’t have the connections or the money, but I had the ultimate backing of my parents,” he says. “That was worth so much more than, ‘Here’s a phone number’ or ‘You can stay at someone’s flat in Edinburgh’.”It’s clear he adores his parents; in 2017 he made a sweet – if not rapturously received – pilot called Static, in which Alison Steadman and Phil Davis played characters based on his mum and dad, while Beckett played an exaggerated version of himself. When he’s got more time, he says, the sitcom is something he’s keen to return to. He speaks excitedly about the importance of working-class narratives getting on TV, from The Royle Family and Phoenix Nights to newer offerings such as People Just Do Nothing, Tez Ilyas’s late night chat show The Tez O’Clock Show and Joe Gilgun’s comedy Brassic.That will have to wait, though. Right now, Beckett is busy with the tour and other TV commitments, the latest of which – a show gently ribbing celebrities’ online mess-ups, Savage Socials – has just begun on E4. He’s itching to get back on stage he says, with a show that offers an escape from a seemingly apocalyptic world. “There’s no politics – it’s literally me being funny for an hour and a half. It’s a distraction rather than an answer to your worries.”He polishes off the chips before continuing. “Really,” he says. “I just want to take your mind off things – you’ll go home and go, that was fun weren’t it?” While some might roll their eyes at such earnestness Rob Beckett – more likely to be at Nando’s than Nobu – knows his crowd. “I know how hard it is to get a babysitter, get dressed and go out again after work. I’m like, right, I owe you lot a good show.”Rob Beckett’s tour starts at Brighton Concert Hall on 10 October. Rob Beckett’s Savage Socials is on E4 on Sundays."
Content warning: this festival is for 'generation snowflake',"Handle With Care, a three-week festival at Camden People’s theatre, aims to contest perceptions about millennials’ entitlement, fragility and offence-taking ",Catherine Love,2019-10-16T07:09:01+0100,"Handle With Care, the title of a new theatre festival in London about “generation snowflake”, is smartly ambiguous. Read as an instruction, it suggests fragility and echoes the accusations of hypersensitivity levelled against young people. But it also implies content that needs to be approached with rigour and treated seriously.“If I tell you ‘handle with care’, that can be a warning, a threat, or a really deeply generous thing,” says Pablo Pakula, one of the artists featured in the festival at Camden People’s theatre. The three-week programme of performance and live art will take on contested ideas such as safe spaces, freedom of speech and identity politics, explore today’s polarised political landscape and unpick the millennial stereotype.Among the many criticisms hurled at millennials such as myself, our apparent tendency to take offence is second only, it seems, to our expensive passion for avocado toast. Pakula’s show Yes No Black White uses a succession of projected images and texts to question what does and does not offend us – and what we then do about it. The performance, he explains, prods at “pressure points and sore spots”, challenging audiences to examine their own offence-taking mechanisms. We’ve been told we’re all special and have something to give. We totally buy into that, that’s why we’re artists!Australian theatre company TomYumSim are poking fun at another popular perception of millennials: our “uniqueness”. “We’ve spent a lifetime being told that we’re all special and we have something special to give,” says Tom Halls, one half of the company. “We totally buy into that, that’s why we’re artists!” laughs fellow company member Simone French. “But we’re taking the piss out of that idea of the specialness in us.” Their show, Nothing Special, is an interactive self-help seminar that satirises millennials’ desperate desire to stand out from the crowd.The festival is headlined by Eurotrash’s show Trigger Warning. Styled as a budget airline safety briefing, the performance delves into the language and politics of content warnings and disclaimers, using a mixture of text, clowning and dance. It’s not a polemic, explains Marcelo Dos Santos, one of the creators of the show, which will be about “rolling around in the complexities of it, more than coming down one way or another on the issues”. Co-creator Natasha Nixon adds: “It’s clown: you watch people fail at trying to work out a problem.”The shows in the festival explore the millennial mindset, while challenging the idea that they are generation snowflake. “I certainly think millennials get a hard time,” says Dos Santos. Halls suggests the “snowflake” label feels like “something that’s been imposed”, adding: “older generations blaming and poking at younger generations is not a new thing.” There’s also a sense of humour to how these artists deal with the snowflake accusation, not least in the tongue-in-cheek gesture of programming a festival about millennials for Camden People’s theatre’s 25th anniversary. “They’re 25, you know, they’re the peak millennials,” says French.Despite what the festival title may suggest, these artists aren’t afraid of making provocative statements. Pakula, for instance, challenges some of the thinking around safe spaces and no-platforming. While insisting on the crucial distinction between free speech and hate speech, he also suggests that taking offence can sometimes be “a silencing gesture”, and he believes it is rash to dismiss all the opinions of those we disagree with politically. “I think it is very unproductive, uncreative and inhuman to disregard somebody’s positions completely just because I disagree with them fundamentally on this,” he says, giving the example of Brexit.Theatre should not necessarily be an innately safe space. It should be a space where ideas are challengedNixon likens Trigger Warning to “a white-knuckle ride – thrilling, exciting, difficult”. The show aims to touch on uncomfortable topics and to keep knocking audiences off balance. “You might think in this piece that we’re going ‘Yeah, millennials are oversensitive’, and just at that point it flips back and we’re on the other side,” she says. Likewise, TomYumSim’s French stresses: “We’re not shying away from the provocative in our work.”These shows share an aim: to create dialogue. “I’m hoping people come out of it wanting to have a stiff drink and a really long chat with other people,” says Pakula of Yes No Black White, adding that he intends to “invite my so-called enemies to the party”. Similarly, Nixon says Trigger Warning is about starting conversations rather than proposing solutions.“Theatre should not necessarily be an innately safe space,” says Halls. “It should be a space for dynamic conversation, for people to feel like their ideas are maybe being challenged or supported, and to open a dialogue about that.”“Theatre and performance has to be a place where dangerous things can happen in a safe space,” insists Pakula. “Unless dangerous things can happen, what’s the point?”• Handle With Care is at Camden People’s theatre, London, from 22 October to 9 November."
Hottest ticket in town: the mega sauna hosting a Euro theatre contest,A drama competition for 200 naked people in a giant sauna? Our writer gets a sweaty taste of ‘aufgass’ in the Netherlands,Arifa Akbar,2019-10-13T15:00:09+0100,"I am standing behind a partition rope, waiting for the theatre to open. An excited hum rises off the crowd, and there is jostling when the stewards throw open the doors. As a theatre critic, I have stood in countless such queues. I should not feel the fear that I do, but there is one vital difference here: audience members are wearing nothing more than bath robes and flip-flops.And then they’re not even wearing those. All clothes are discarded as they race to claim a seat on the tiered wooden benches inside the auditorium and lay down towels to mark their spot. In a matter of minutes, there is a neatly arranged room of almost 200 naked people sitting in a heated amphitheatre, waiting for the show to begin. I am as disrobed as the rest of them.This is not an anxiety dream. It is aufguss in action: a theatrical experience inside a huge sauna where gym-fit performers throw essential oils on to a central stove and wave towels in choreographed ways. They combine this ritual with a 15-minute drama involving costume changes, music and movement. The audience zips out between acts to dunk themselves in freezing cold water before running back in for the next show.It is the final day of the week-long world aufguss championships at Thermen Berendonck, a stunning sauna complex in Wijchen, near Nijmegen, where nearly 100 contenders and 11 European countries compete for medals. Surveying the room, I see friends chatting, couples clasping hands. Some banter and clap. No one avoids eye contact or stares at their feet. This could be any spirited theatre crowd, were it not for the nudity.The first acts seem to be channelling Las Vegas pizzazz crossed with Eurovision camp, but I slowly put my cynicism asideThere are several languages being spoken. Many are wearing woollen hats, which I am later told serve to keep body temperature levelled. The hats look comical in the sea of bare flesh, but I am too dry-mouthed to laugh. Two men in Viking caps make space for me on the crowded lower benches. I break out into a sweat the minute I am squeezed in between them, not only because it’s so snug but also because the heating is cranked up to 85 degrees and the stewards are about to seal the doors.The acts vary from adaptations of The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Life of Pi to original scripts that include a Danish production about polluting the oceans and a show about the suffragette Emily Davison, whose protest at the Derby in 1913 led to her death.The auditorium is a state-of-the-art, tile-panelled sauna with surround sound and a large screen as a backdrop. The acts are heavy on showmanship and special effects including smoke and floor lighting, and the actors speak English. The first few acts seem to be channelling Las Vegas pizzazz crossed with Eurovision song contest camp, but slowly I put my cynicism aside.Britain is not a competing country here and while aufguss might inspire snickering among some buttoned-up Brits, it is part of a booming European industry that intersects wellness with the arts. According to Martijn Vanhoorelbeke, a juror at the aufguss and three-times former Belgian champion, the benefits include not just the detoxifying effects of a sauna but emotional catharsis, too. He regards it as a “total experience” of the senses: “Aufguss does what other kinds of theatre cannot do with the smells [of the oils], the sounds and sights, the feeling of the heat as well as the emotional drama of the story and the effect of all of those things combined.”We are more vulnerable when we are more exposed, he adds, and so the experience not just bring out physical toxins but “emotions rise up, too.”He gets a standing ovation, which is a bold move from a naked audienceHe might be right. I am instantly drawn into an adaptation of Billy Elliot. It is by Ondrej Sochurek, a dancer and circus performer from the Czech Republic who begins with a high-octane routine to Duran Duran’s Wild Boys in an imaginary boxing ring before switching to Swan Lake, in which his towels turn into beating swan’s wings. Astonishingly, it works, and by the end it is not just Sochurek’s rosemary and bergamot infusions that are misting up my eyes. I am not the only one moved: he gets a standing ovation, which is a bold move from an entirely naked audience.He is followed by Poland’s Marcin Ciesielski, whose upbeat show, The Shoemaker, combines comic skits with tap dance and ballroom. Suffragettes, by Italy’s Charoulla Demetriou and Salvadori Morgana, is dark yet exhilarating, with its rousing message of gender equality and stark image of Davison’s death projected on to the screen.The nudity takes on a different dimension in the context of this drama. There is no hint of giggling. The suspension of disbelief changes the tone of the room. Michael Niedermaier, an Italian champion who is a sauna master at Preidlhof Spa Hotel in South Tirol, thinks that aufguss heightens emotions and could help people overcome embarrassment around nudity. Sabrina Telfser, also at Preidlhof, agrees: “If people are introduced slowly and correctly to the experience, the shyness can be overcome.”Vanhoorelbeke has recently been helping Britons do just that by running aufguss training sessions in Brighton, which may not instantly dismantle entrenched views around nudity, but may chip away at the English reserve. I had feared that the sight of such nudity en masse would conjure scenes reminiscent of Carry On comedy in my mind. How wrong I had been, and what giddy liberation I felt as I floated off for my cold shower."
Gaslight: the return of the play that defined toxic masculinity,Patrick Hamilton could never have imagined his 1938 drama would give today’s world such a powerful term. A wave of revivals suggests we still have a lot to learn from its insights,Natasha Tripney,2019-10-08T13:08:27+0100,"The term “gaslighting” – psychological manipulation intended to make the victim question their sanity – has become embedded in our language. This year, accusations of gaslighting were aimed at Love Island housemates Michael and Curtis. In the Netflix series Jessica Jones, David Tennant’s character played mind-control games with his victims (intensified by the fact that he could actually control minds). Taylor Swift even declared that the US public had been gaslighted by Donald Trump’s politics.The term derives from Patrick Hamilton’s 1938 play Gaslight, which is itself fittingly deceptive. On the surface it’s a Victorian melodrama, a real potboiler, but it is uncannily insightful and accurate in its depiction of an abusive relationship.The play was the basis for a 1940 film directed by Thorold Dickinson and for George Cukor’s 1944 film starring Ingrid Bergman. Along with his drama Rope, Gaslight made Hamilton wealthy. In the play, Jack Manningham manipulates and undermines his wife, Bella. His temper is constantly fluctuating; he dismisses and belittles her and, by turning the lights on and off, starts to make her think she is going mad. “It’s so acute in its portrayal of psychological domestic abuse and toxic masculinity, but people can lose sight of that,” says Richard Beecham, whose production of Gaslight is at Watford Palace theatre this month.“Patrick Hamilton the commercial playwright could never quite leave behind Hamilton the literary novelist,” says Beecham. “He was a complicated man and, reading his biography, it seems he had some understanding of some of the behaviours he’s writing about.” Hamilton’s tendency to become infatuated with unsuitable women seeped into his fiction. His obsession with Soho sex worker Lily Connolly made its way into Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky. The protagonist of the Gorse trilogy is a predator, a superficially charming swindler who takes advantage of women.The Watford production is one of several Gaslights staged this year. There have already been revivals at Perth theatre and the Mill at Sonning; a version starring Martin Shaw is touring the UK and another Gaslight is coming to the Playground theatre in London.Beecham was inspired by Safe at Last, a Channel 4 documentary that allowed cameras behind the doors of a women’s refuge. His production has an all-female cast playing survivors of domestic abuse who are enacting Hamilton’s play as an exercise in drama therapy. To prepare, Beecham worked closely with a women’s refuge. The cast created individual backstories for the modern women they are playing and they remained in character when a care worker took them through a workshop designed for survivors of abuse. The cast are simultaneously playing the women in the refuge as well as Hamilton’s characters, so when Bella delivers an impassioned speech towards the end, it becomes “a sort of exorcism”. This approach also means that, in the context of Beecham’s production, a survivor of abuse is also taking on the role of the abuser, which makes the scene in which Jack attacks Bella more emotionally complex.The character of the police inspector Rough, who is Bella’s rescuer, can be problematic for a director today: he is another dominating male presence. In Kai Fischer’s production for Perth theatre, a woman – Meg Fraser – was cast in the role. Beecham has merged the character with the figure of the drama therapist and has “pruned the text to remove some of the lazy sexism and the patronising attitudes”. Is there not, I ask, also an issue with a man directing a cast of women in a play about emotional control and power imbalance? It’s something they’ve discussed. Watford Palace’s artistic director Brigid Larmour stipulated that if he was to direct it there would need to be an otherwise all-female creative team.Imy Wyatt Corner’s forthcoming production for the Playground theatre in London will stick more closely to Hamilton’s original. Her version will retain the Victorian setting and look to horror for inspiration. She wants to “push the audience to feel uneasy – even scared”. Inevitably, lighting will play a large part in this; she cites the film Midsommar as an inspiration.Having first read the play 10 years ago, Corner was inspired to direct it because “its depiction of abusive relationships has not dated and remains alarmingly relevant”. The Crown Prosecution Service recorded 960 offences of coercive and controlling behaviour between 2017 and 2018, a three-fold increase from the previous year. Ninety-seven per cent of defendants prosecuted in these cases were male.But Corner is concerned about the prevalence of the term in the media. It has become a buzzword, she says, “but also in some ways lost any attachment to the actual gravity of this type of abuse and the sensitivity this topic can require”. “Now is a very good time to revisit the play,” she says, and “consider what – if anything – has changed.”Richard Beecham’s production of Gaslight is at Watford Palace theatre until 26 October. Imy Wyatt Corner’s production is at the Playground theatre, London, from 21 October until 10 November."
"Tinuke Craig on capitalist families, panto and The Color Purple casting row","The fast-rising director talks about staging Maxim Gorky’s Vassa with a last-minute lead, her passion for musicals and the joy of brain-digging in rehearsals",Bridget Minamore,2019-10-09T06:00:43+0100,"When I meet the director Tinuke Craig she’s just finished the final run in the rehearsal room for Mike Bartlett’s version of Vassa by Maxim Gorky. Now it’s time to take it to the Almeida in London, a bit later than planned, with a couple of previews cancelled. Lead actor Samantha Bond has had to withdraw due to injury and her replacement is Siobhan Redmond. Craig is upbeat despite these difficulties. “She’s played a blinder, learned lines at the speed of light, been extraordinary!”This isn’t the first time the director has dealt with cast changes. This year, her production of The Color Purple at Leicester Curve hit the news when actor Seyi Omooba was sacked for homophobic comments made several years earlier on social media. Omooba had been cast in the role of Celie, a famously queer character. The role was recast and Craig’s production received good reviews (as did new lead, T’Shan Williams). Omooba recently announced her intention to sue Curve theatre and her old agency for breach of contract and “religious discrimination”.“I wasn’t really involved in any of that decision-making either way, so it was really hard at the time,” says Craig. “People were being absolutely vile to me on Twitter. I think [they] assumed I’d somehow known her position and cast her anyway, which obviously wasn’t the case. But do you know what? It’s fine. I feel very attached to the show. It was one of the creative joys of my life.” Craig is a lifelong fan of musicals. “I was scared that I would do a musical and then realise I didn’t like them, and actually the opposite happened. I’m like, ‘I want to do at least one musical a year until the day that I die!’”Vassa, Craig tells me, is “a play about a mother and her grownup children. The family own a business. The patriarch is dying, and when he dies they will be able to get their inheritance and take their shares out of the business. The mother does not want them to do this because that way the business collapses, and the business is the most important thing in the world to her.”Is Vassa a political play, then? For Craig, it is more about family and how politics can muddy the waters. “One thing Mike and I talked about a lot is that families are mostly based on a kind of socialist structure when they work. Which is to say that everyone is considered to be equal; if people are worse off for whatever reason we help them out; there’s a leader but the leader is there to make sure everyone is elevated; we share. In a nice, good family all those things are in place, right? We don’t have favourites, there’s equity, there’s equality, and we like that in families.” In Vassa, however, the central family “have drifted into a capitalist structure, essentially. So there are winners and there are losers, and gains and losses, and they are like ‘Are you useful to me or not?’ Which is a question in the capitalist world, [and] how capitalism fucks over loads of people. So you’re looking at a family who have rejected the socialist structure. What does that do? And can you sustain it? The answer, I think, is no.”Vassa is the first time she has tackled work that wasn’t originally written in English. It was important for her and Bartlett to modernise the language and balance Gorky’s intentions with their own. Craig has cast non-white actors in some roles. “When Gorky wrote it they were white. Aside from me not being particularly interested in putting an all-white cast on stage, it felt quite important that these people didn’t look or sound like each other. That they’re meant to be a family and yet have no connection, and they’re stuck in the house. The house has become sort of a prison. They’re waiting for someone to die, they can’t leave until this person dies, they don’t like each other, they don’t want to be there.”Raised in Brixton, south London, Craig entered the theatre world via playwriting; she was on the Royal Court’s Young Writers programme at 17 years old. “That happened if you grew up in London in the 90s; I was one of those very extracurricular kids. I think there’s something very particular about people who are about my age, 32, in the arts, which is that we were the real beneficiaries of peak scheme time.” She began directing “via the practice of having to read plays. I got into imagining what they would look like and how they would sound.”Craig says she has always been quite shy and awkward but what she found in directing “is an opportunity to properly sit down with how people work. It’s probably not very healthy in real life but if you’re in the rehearsal room you can spend a whole day being like, ‘But why did she do that?’ You get this amazing four-week stint where you’re allowed to dig into brains and work out what the hell is going on with people, which I love.”The day Vassa opens, Craig begins her next job: Cinderella, the pantomine at the Lyric Hammersmith. Why panto? “I have done a lot of plays recently that have dealt in one way or another with trauma. I did Dirty Butterfly about domestic violence, and I Call My Brothers, which is about terrorism and the effects of terrorism on South Asian and Muslim people. I went back to debbie tucker green, the Aids crisis and then knife crime [in random/generations], then The Color Purple, about a girl who’s repeatedly raped by her father in the first act. And now I’m doing a big old Russian play about succession and bad mothers.” She pauses. “When the Lyric said ‘You’re on our list’ I was sort of like, actually a lot of people who ‘don’t go to the theatre’, in inverted commas, they go to panto. They go to Lyric, they go to musicals, they go to Stratford East, especially if we talk about class. It suddenly occurred to me: there are people who I grew up with, that I can make work for. Work for everyone.”Vassa is at the Almeida theatre, London, until 23 November."
"Shelagh Delaney: playwright on probation - archive, 1960","20 September 1960 Promoting her latest play, The Lion in Love, Delaney says ‘I would rather write a terrible play than a mediocre one’",,2019-09-20T05:30:51+0100,"Surrounded by a clutch of journalists and looking, in a grubby white mackintosh and a hastily tied scarf, her usual determinedly unfashionable self, Shelagh Delaney was busily parrying questions about her love life and her taste in clothes.A press conference to herald the Manchester opening of her latest play, The Lion in Love, had produced a large attendance, for to journalists Shelagh Delaney is the nearest thing to a homegrown, contemporary Garbo.She has not, apart from the tall austerity of her height, anything like the looks but she has the same talent for creating, almost in spite of herself, racy headlines. The proscenium arch of the Palace Theatre had, for instance, chosen to collapse on the arrival of her already controversial play and it was announced that the Manchester opening would be delayed for a day.In between denying that she was engaged to be married and defending her taste in clothes, she found some time to talk about the theatre. She does so in a modest, down-to-earth way and values herself in a different sort of language from the gossip columnists’ now hackneyed line about the “slum girl from Salford who has arrived in the West End.”“A probationary or an apprentice playwright” is the description she prefers, and she repeatedly acknowledges her debt to Joan Littlewood and Theatre Workshop. Her rejection of the “slum girl” label is quick but not well publicised. “My mother has a nice council flat overlooking Salford park and I divide my time between there and London.” About the gossip columnists she is only “sad” and has long since given up accepting any responsibility for what they print.She is not, like her contemporaries, worried about class. “I write about working-class life only because it represents the background of my experience.” Roots she regards as unimportant. “I could go on writing plays if I never saw Salford, Manchester, or any northern working-class district again.”She is not even concerned about the British theatre being a middle-class theatre and she does not accept Arnold Wesker’s assertion that theatre going is only a middle-class habit. “The working classes in the gallery have supported the British theatre ever since Elizabethan times. Give them good and well publicised plays and they will go to the theatre.”She is interested in attracting young people to the theatre and draws some consolation for the bad notices her play received at Coventry from the fact that it attracted a young audience. Her writing, she says, advocates no political philosophy other than “common sense and kindness.”The bad notices which The Lion in Love has received have not worried her. She has a bland self-confidence which puts the hostile reception down only to the fact that critics expected the play to be “almost exactly the same as A Taste of Honey. “I expected bad notices and those I have read, if they had been written about any other play, would make me want to dash out to go and see it.”She is prepared to admit that she may have something to learn about the construction of a play, but adds that critics who have complained about her technique have missed the point that her new play is meant to be “loose and sprawling.” “I would rather write a terrible play than a mediocre one,” she says. The success of A Taste of Honey has not, she claims, been a disadvantage, because it has been “a useful obstacle.” “I tend to be lazy and only work when I have the sort of challenge which is presented by a successful first play.”It is almost three years since A Taste of Honey was produced and her new play has taken a long time because she “thinks slowly and only writes quickly.” She does not think she could write a successful novel and at 21 regards herself as a writer only for the theatre. Before she turned to answer the next question about her romance, or the lack of it, she did, however, make the qualification that she would like to write a good film script."
Bernardine Evaristo doubles lifetime sales in five days after joint Booker win,"Almost 6,000 copies of Girl, Woman, Other sold in the week after Evaristo’s win alongside Margaret Atwood",Alison Flood,2019-10-22T17:25:45+0100,"Bernadine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other more than doubled its lifetime sales in the week following its Booker prize win, with joint winner The Testaments by Margaret Atwood also flying off bookshop shelves.New sales figures from Nielsen BookScan show that, in the five days following its win last Monday, Girl, Woman, Other sold 5,980 copies, a stratospheric 1,340% boost in sales week on week. In its previous five months on sale, the polyphonic novel, mostly narrated by black women, had sold 4,391 copies.This puts Evaristo in seventh place in this week’s hardback fiction chart, behind Atwood’s already-bestselling follow-up to The Handmaid’s Tale. The Testaments sits in third place after selling 13,400 copies following the prize win, adding to its lifetime sales of 191,108.Waterstones fiction buyer Bea Carvalho said that there had been “sales uplift for both titles” following the controversial joint Booker win, but it was Girl, Woman, Other that has seen the greatest spike. “We have also enjoyed an uplift for some of Evaristo’s backlist, and look forward to building on this further,” she said.Chair of judges Peter Florence announced last week that the panel of five judges had been unable to settle on a winner for the £50,000 prize, and instead – against the rules of the institution and the advice of its literary director – had decided to split it. “The more we talked about them, the more we treasured both of them and wanted them both as winners … We couldn’t separate them,” he said.A chorus of mounting criticism followed, over the fact that the first black woman to win the Booker has to share it, and over fears that Atwood’s celebrity could overshadow Evaristo’s win.Readers expressed frustration with the lack of copies of Girl, Woman, Other on display in some bookshops, with some sharing images of tables stacked high with The Testaments and only a few copies of Girl, Woman, Other alongside. On Twitter, former children’s laureate Malorie Blackman wrote: “This makes me sad. This makes me tired. I’ve seen other bookshops display only Margaret Atwood’s book as winner of the Booker Prize. Do better.”One Twitter user, Liz Whitehouse, showed Waterstones Liverpool with a big table of The Testaments under the banner “winner”, with no sign of Evaristo’s book. “No mention on the sign, or on ANY surrounding table on the upstairs displays, and a tiny display downstairs overshone and tiny in front of a HUGE Testaments display. Pretty disgraceful,” she wrote.Carvalho said copies of Girl, Woman, Other had sold out in most Waterstones branches “very quickly” after the announcement, while most shops still had many copies of The Testaments following the significant publicity around its launch in late September.Evaristo’s publisher, Hamish Hamilton, rushed through a reprint of 90,000 copies of the novel following its win, and praised “the outpouring of love and support from booksellers all over the country” that it has received. Stock reached most Waterstones branches by the weekend, Carvalho said, adding that sales of Evaristo’s book exceeded those of The Testaments on Saturday across the chain. "
Struggling with The Golden Notebook? The hard work is worth it,"For every moment of high drama, there are also sections of intense tedium. But Doris Lessing’s masterpiece delivers a big payoff",Sam Jordison,2019-10-22T13:08:09+0100,"In my edition of Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook, the text that forms the titular volume arrives on page 531. These climactic thoughts, supposedly recorded by the novel’s central character, Anna Wulf, take up only 26 pages. That’s not to say Lessing’s title is a misnomer. The story builds towards these 26 pages and finds a kind of resolution within them.Lessing’s decision to divide her novel into many sections is crucial to the book’s power. She very deliberately split her novel across different aspects of Anna’s personal story and her fractured psychology. The result still seems unique in fiction – it makes for a strange, troubling and difficult reading experience.The black, red, yellow and blue notebooks of the novel are Anna’s different approaches to making sense of herself. In the black one, she reflects on her writing life. In the red, she tracks her political development. Yellow contains her attempts to write (highly autobiographical) fiction, while blue is a diary of her daily life. Meanwhile, the Free Women sections describe Anna in the third person, taking us outside her head in an attempt to record her scattered thoughts.It would be impossible to discuss everything in these sections in a single article. The book features hilarious pastiches about mid-20th-century literary London and bitter satires of film and television producers. There are agonised accounts about the end of the communist dream, and frank commentaries on sex, male impotence and female desire. There are shocking descriptions of the racist politics of white colonialists in Africa. There are insights into both inequality and the privileged bohemian lives of Anna and her friends. (It’s bewildering to read the book in 2019, and encounter all those young artists who have spurned regular employment but live in huge houses in London – that they own!)Sections from each notebook are interspersed throughout the novel, providing numerous cliffhangers and sometimes keeping readers waiting for dozens, even hundreds, of pages before there is a resolution. At the end of the second section, comes one of the biggest shocks I’ve encountered in fiction for a long time. We learn, via a frantic, confusing phone call, that something dreadful has happened. Then we’re cut off, and because of the way the book is set out, if feels only natural that we should have to wait before we get answers. But this just gives Lessing another opportunity to set up more surprises.Alongside this high drama, there are also sections of intense tedium. Even once I was fully invested in the story it could be hard work. Reading the section entitled The Golden Notebook often felt like chewing concrete.But this book is meant to be hard work. There would be something wrong with an entirely enjoyable account of a nervous breakdown. The novel’s longueurs are also partly why it works: Lessing makes us slowly climb this mountain of a story so we can better appreciate the view from the top. Sometimes, I needed to be reminded that there’s a real person writing this story. As we watch Anna writing about her fictional character, Ella, we are reminded of Lessing writing about Anna (and, I suppose, Ella). How much of Lessing’s life feeds into Anna’s, in the same way that Anna’s life feeds into Ella’s’?We can’t know. It seems prurient to demand the exact correspondences between events in Lessing’s life and scenes in her novel. But it would be equally wrong to ignore the importance of the actual world to this fiction. And that isn’t interesting only because of the natural curiosity we have about the author’s life. It is because it raises the stakes, and makes the politics, the madness, the emotion, all more feel more real. Anna’s suffering is not confined only to this novel. It also happens out in the world, to people like Ella, Anna, Lessing – or you and me."
'Only a quid': woman reunited with childhood book in museum shop,Zoe Andrews found her copy of The Secret Garden in Reading’s Museum of English Rural Life,Alison Flood,2019-10-22T11:52:08+0100,"A woman has been reunited with a copy of The Secret Garden she owned as a child, serendipitously discovering it for sale on the shelves of the Museum of English Rural Life shop.The MERL, which made news last year for sending an 18th-century schoolboy’s doodles of a chicken in trousers viral, acquired the Ladybird Children’s Classics edition from a charity shop in Wallingford for its collection of second-hand books. On Friday, it was picked up by its former owner, Zoe Andrews, who looked inside and saw it had her sister’s name in the front cover, written in characters that she’d dreamed up as a child.The MERL’s digital editor Joe Vaughan tweeted about the discovery. “Today, the past sent something back, in our museum, in our strange house of time, like a letter returned to sender,” he wrote. “It’s not every day that you pick up a book, open it, and, in the inside cover, find your sister’s name, in hieroglyphics … the ones you wrote when you were kids.”Andrews “couldn’t believe it when I found this book … Had to repurchase it. What are the chances?!” She couldn’t remember any details about the secret language her and her sister had written on the book. “I had a grid on a sheet of paper with a ‘key’ as to what symbols meant what. This is going back many years, probably 1993/94.”MERL director Kate Arnold-Forster said: “One of the most unexpected yet fascinating aspects of libraries is discovering books that bear traces of their readers’ lives, moving us to speculate about how they were read and enjoyed. That it’s The Secret Garden – a novel that has survived generations and provided a magical escape for so many readers – makes this story all the more wonderful.”The discovery prompted other readers to share on social media stories of unexpectedly discovering their former books. One person wrote that their “father-in-law unpacked a box of books one day and found a hardcover Biggles given to him by auntie Eva – 60 years before, 11th birthday in a totally different part of the country. Awesome roundtrip. His most treasured book now.”Of her Secret Garden find, Andrews said: “When things work their way back to you, they were never meant to leave you in the first place.” She added on Twitter that “it feels right to have the book back”, and after all, it was “only a quid”."
Energy suppliers could face tougher financial checks,Ofgem considers barring fast-growing UK firms from taking on too many customers,Jillian Ambrose,2019-10-22T16:44:37+0100,"Energy suppliers could be blocked from taking on too many customers under proposals designed to ensure fast-growing companies are financially fit to handle expansion.Ofgem, the industry regulator, plans to run financial health checks on growing energy startups before they reach a certain number of customers after more than a dozen company failures in the sector in the past two years.If the suppliers fail the test they will be barred from taking on more customers and forced to prove they are financially fit before growing past the next threshold.Ofgem said it would put the checks in place before a supplier reaches 50,000 customers, and again at 150,000 and 250,000. The next threshold would be set between 500,000 and 800,000.The regulator may also demand that suppliers write a “living will” that sets out how they would continue to provide customers with a good service as well as an “orderly exit” if it cannot survive in the market.Mary Starks, an executive director at Ofgem, said the plans would create more accountability in the energy market and reduce the risk and cost of further collapses.The tougher standards for existing energy providers follow proposals to raise entry requirements for new suppliers to stem the rise of unsustainable firms.The regulator encouraged a large number of startups to enter the market to increase competition and drive better customer service. However, it exposed customers to a raft of unsustainable energy suppliers, many of which gave poor customer service before going bust.Fourteen suppliers have crashed out of the market since January 2018. In August, thousands of homes and hundreds of companies were left without an energy provider when Solarplicity collapsed.Matt Vickers, the chief executive of Ombudsman Services, said the crackdown was good news for consumers. He said he supported Ofgem’s plans because there had been spikes in complaints about fast-growing energy companies that were unprepared for rapid growth.Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the proposals would limit the cost to consumers of failed suppliers and provide better protection.“Our research estimates that recent supplier failures led to an additional £172m being added to bills. Most of these costs arose from companies leaving behind unpaid industry bills for renewable schemes,” she said.“The government should legislate to require suppliers make these payments more regularly, and further limit the costs to consumers when these companies fail.”"
Seeking a butler who acts just like Jeeves – is this the worst job ad ever?,"An ad posted by a wealthy Russian family asks for a butler who can ‘solve any issue’, is familiar with Jeeves and Wooster – and isn’t a Libra or Aries",Stuart Heritage,2019-10-22T17:06:00+0100,"Butlering doesn’t exactly look like fun. When Buckingham Palace posted a recruitment advert for a butler last week, it made the job sound absolutely gruelling. Not only was it a seven-day, 45-hours-a-week position, but the salary paid almost £1.60 an hour less than the London living wage. You would have thought that the literal queen of England might have had deeper pockets.Much better, at least at first, is the butler vacancy recently posted to Jobs in Childcare by a wealthy Russian family, which pays three times more than the Buckingham Palace gig. However, it does come with a number of quite specific instructions. The successful applicant must live in London and speak at least two languages with, at minimum, a working level of Russian. They must know all the best restaurants in London and the south of France. They must be able to “be a diplomat and be able to solve any issue at school, at a shop, at a salon for the benefit of the family”. They must watch the televised adaptation of Jeeves and Wooster “to see what is expected from the butler”. And, since the family has an astrological bent, the candidate will preferably be a Sagittarius, Virgo, Aquarius, Capricorn or Leo.Getting shoved around by a Wodehouse-obsessed billionaire family with a horoscope fixation sounds terrible, and makes this advert one of the most unreasonable of the year. It joins the one posted by an anonymous Australian entrepreneur in January, which stated that the successful applicant would have to be “stable” and “loyal”, “expect after-hours and weekend calls”, able to “deal with profanity” and not “take things personally”.Then there was the 56-year-old divorced man who in 2017 posted a Craigslist ad because he wanted to take someone to Coachella. Except not just anyone, because his criteria included: someone between the ages of 19 and 25, who “must keep hands and feet moisturised at all times ... be OK with periodic hand-holding ... allow me to brush your hair once per day” and: “At least twice during the festival you must tell me in a playful manner that I am naughty.” Suddenly, butlering doesn’t sound so bad."
How to save: Martin Lewis’s four top tips for putting money away,"As incomes are squeezed and millions of Britons put nothing aside, the savings expert explains how best to build a healthy bank account",Emine Saner,2019-10-21T16:52:18+0100,"According to NatWest, which looked at the data of 750,000 anonymised customers, around half are not saving any money each month. Household finances are under pressure – earlier this year the Resolution Foundation thinktank described it as “an unprecedented income squeeze over the past decade”. Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, agrees: “There are people in this country who have less income than their minimum outgoings, and that is a real crisis,” he says. However, part of it may also be an attitude problem: the NatWest survey found that those earning over £90,000 were just as likely not to put anything away. So, if you have money coming in and a potential to free up cash, how can you get into the savings habit? Lewis has some tips.If you have expensive debts, it’s better to clear them than to save. If you are debt-free except for your mortgage, the interest rate on that will probably be higher than savings rates, so you should consider overpaying your mortgage, although I would like to see a minimum of three months’ worth of bills put aside.Sit down with three months’ worth of bank and credit-card statements, factor in Christmas and other expenses. Make sure you are not overpaying your gas and electricity bills, you’re getting the best deals on things like your digital TV, and work out your necessary expenditure. Look at your discretionary spending – that £3 coffee every working day is £750 a year. Set up different accounts, and as soon as you get paid, put money away – but manage your cash so you don’t go overdrawn, because that defeats the point. You can start to learn what spare money you really have, and start to discipline yourself. We are very unrestrained when we don’t have a budget.The minimum anybody should be earning on savings right now is 1.45%, which is the rate of the top easy-access account. There are ways to earn more, such as locking money away. If you are young and saving for a property, open a Lifetime ISA, which will give you a 25% boost. For those people on a low income, the government has a Help to Save scheme – I was worried it would encourage people to keep money in savings when they should be clearing their debts, but it’s a clever scheme.If you are able to free up some cash, saving is about a mindset change. Some people like a challenge – put a penny aside on the first day, 2p on the second day, 3p on the third. Anything that gets you into the habit is worthwhile. For younger people, if you’re lucky enough to get a pay rise, put a quarter of it into savings straight away, because once we get used to having more money, we find it very difficult to have less. It’s a difficult time to save at the moment because interest rates are so low, but anything you can do break your habitual pattern, and start to put money aside – if your finances have room – will be helpful."
"British pensioners in Europe struggle to make ends meet, committee told","Retirees suffer ‘real hardship’ and fear Brexit will impoverish them further, says Jeremy Morgan QC",Lisa O'Carroll,2019-10-22T17:34:38+0100,"Retired Britons in Europe are not sipping prosecco on a warm terrace but are struggling to make ends meet and fear further poverty because of Brexit, a parliamentary committee has been told.Jeremy Morgan QC said retirees in the EU living exclusively or almost exclusively on British pensions have already suffered a decrease in their income because of the depreciation in sterling since the referendum.They were hit by a second blow last month when the government revealed it would not give a lifetime guarantee to index-link their pensions if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal.“There is real hardship. The impression sometimes given by the tabloid press is that everyone on pension age living in the EU is supping prosecco on a terrace in Tuscany or something like that.“There are huge numbers of people who made a very rational decision years ago to move because they could afford to move because they could make their pension go a bit further in countries like rural France or in Spain and they are in desperate straits because of this,” Morgan told peers on the House of Lords EU justice sub-committee.The committee chair, Lord Morris, identified the pension issue as of “fundamental concern” to the 220,000 British pensioners living in the EU. He said the issues “have got to be resolved”.Morgan said it was not good enough for the British government to expect other EU countries or the European commission to guarantee their rights.“Britain can’t just wash its hands of its citizens abroad,” said Morgan.The committee heard that pensioners were desperately worried, with one peer relaying reports of a story about a 99-year-old Briton who had lived in Poland for 50 years and had received a letter from the Polish authorities saying her healthcare would no longer be covered in the event of a no-deal Brexit.While Boris Johnson is hoping his Brexit deal can be passed sooner or later, the prospects of the UK leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement remains real with the prime minister facing another knife-edge vote on Tuesday night.Morgan, who is a retired barrister living in Italy and part of the British in Europe campaign group, said the costs to the UK government would double if they had to pay healthcare for returning British pensioners“If Britain pays healthcare of its pensioners abroad it would cost roughly half what it would cost to come back here and be treated by the NHS,” he said.The Department for Work and Pensions said it would increase the state pension for UK citizens in the EU for the next three years under the “triple-lock” arrangements – which guarantee a rise by either 2.5%, average wage growth or by the consumer price index, whichever is higher – as announced last month.“During this three-year period the UK government plans to negotiate a new arrangement with the EU to ensure that uprating continues,” said a spokesperson."
Seaside residents dominate personal debt league in England and Wales,Stoke-on-Trent tops list but coastal towns such as Scarborough and Blackpool dominate,Rupert Jones,2019-10-21T06:01:18+0100,"Seaside towns and cities dominate the list of areas with the highest numbers of people getting into serious difficulties with debt, according to new figures.Scarborough, the largest resort on the Yorkshire coast, ranked second out of 347 local authorities in England and Wales for personal insolvencies, while Torbay in Devon – which includes the town of Torquay – came third, said the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young.Plymouth, on the south coast of Devon, was ranked fourth, while Blackpool was in sixth place.However, it was the city of Stoke-on-Trent in the Midlands which had the highest rate of personal insolvencies, recording just over 51 per 10,000 adults in 2018. The national average was 25, said the firm.The insolvency rate includes personal bankruptcies, debt relief orders and individual voluntary arrangements.UHY Hacker Young said the data suggested many of the locations “are still a long way from recovering from the decades of contraction in their traditional coastal industries such as tourism, shipbuilding and fishing”.It added that the slump in sterling and the resulting rise in the numbers of people taking staycation holidays had apparently had little tangible impact on traditional holiday destinations such as Scarborough and Blackpool.Scarborough had 47.8 insolvencies per 10,000 adults, while Torbay had 45.7, and Plymouth had 45.2.Other coastal locations or regions featured in the firm’s “top 20” included Weymouth and Portland in Dorset, which includes the resort of Weymouth, which was in 12th place (39.6 insolvencies per 10,000 adults); the Isle of Wight, in 13th place (39.3 per 10,000); Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, in 14th place (39.2 per 10,000); Cornwall, in 17th place (38.5 per 10,000); and Hastings in East Sussex, in 19th place (38 per 10,000).The accountancy firm said many coastal towns outside south-east England had struggled to replace their traditional industries with faster growth sectors such as financial services and technology.A number of the locations named in the survey, including Scarborough, Blackpool, Plymouth, Great Yarmouth, Ryde on the Isle of Wight and Hastings, are among 69 English towns and cities that will benefit from a £95m regeneration fund announced by the government in September 2019."
Lowest October rise in UK house prices since 2008 financial crisis,Rightmove says sluggish market and Brexit uncertainty are putting potential sellers off,Rupert Jones,2019-10-21T00:01:10+0100,"UK house prices have registered their lowest October rise since the 2008 financial crisis as Brexit uncertainty continues to take its toll, according to the property website Rightmove.Its data also showed that some parts of London are continuing to see asking prices fall, in some cases by £15,000 or more in a month.The price of property coming to market at this time of year usually experiences an “autumn bounce,” with an average rise of 1.6% recorded in the month of October over the last 10 years – but this year saw a “more sluggish” monthly rise of 0.6%, which was the lowest since October 2008.The current state of the housing market combined with the ongoing political uncertainty from Brexit appears to be putting off many would-be sellers. Rightmove’s average number of new house sale listings per week has fallen to just over 24,000 – its lowest at this time of year since October 2009. This is down 13.5% on the same period a year ago.By contrast, many buyers “seem undeterred”, with the number of sales being agreed virtually unchanged on a year ago, according to the site, whose latest data was based on the asking prices of more than 122,000 properties put on sale between 8 September and 12 October.Miles Shipside, a Rightmove director, said: “With upwards pricing power now pretty flat, some sellers who are motivated by maximising their money seem to be holding back. They may be waiting for more certainty around both achieving their price aspirations, and also the Brexit outcome.”Marc von Grundherr, at the estate agent Benham & Reeves, said that while the sector was more subdued than usual, “the UK property market is yet to disappear down the Brexit abyss”.Rightmove’s detailed data paints a mixed picture for London, with some boroughs seeing sizeable price falls and others experiencing price growth. The average price of a home in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London, has fallen by more than £17,000 in a month – from £605,000 in September to £587,000 in October. Wandsworth in south London recorded a typical £16,000 price fall. But in other boroughs, including Britain’s most expensive area, Kensington and Chelsea, average prices continued to climb."
"Pacer train passengers deserve fare cuts, say northern England leaders",Northern Rail urged to compensate people forced to use outdated ‘buses-on-rails’,Maya Wolfe-Robinson,2019-10-21T10:38:51+0100,"Leading politicians in northern England have demanded a cut in fares on routes that still use the much-derided Pacer trains.In a letter to Northern Rail, they say passengers deserve financial compensation for having to use the “buses-on-rails” that were due to be retired by the end of the year.The Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, the Sheffield city region mayor, Dan Jarvis, and the Leeds city council leader, Judith Blake, told the train operator that the continued use of the old carriages was “unacceptable” and that an urgent commitment to reduced fares “is the very least that could be done”.The diesel-powered Pacers, built as a temporary stopgap in the 1980s from bus frames set on train wheels, do not comply with disability regulations that come into effect in the new year and still have toilets that flush on to the track. It emerged over the summer that, because of a delay in manufacturing their replacements, they would not be scrapped by 2020 as promised by the rail franchise.The city leaders express “deep disappointment and frustration” in the letter, which was sent to David Brown, the managing director of Arriva Rail North, which owns Northern rail. They also ask for “urgent assurances” regarding the arrangements planned for customers with accessibility requirements while the Pacers remained in use.They say the “widening disparity between transport investment” in northern England, compared with the south has been underlined by the continued use of Pacers, but also acknowledge that withdrawing them before the replacements were ready would be a worse solution. The “retention, for a short, time limited period appears to be the best of an extremely poor range of options”, they write.Blake said the withdrawal of Pacers was “one of the centrepiece commitments made in the Northern franchise”, adding: “The fact they will still be running in 2020 is symbolic of the broader issues with this franchise which continues to deliver an unacceptable level of service to passengers.”The three politicians have requested a meeting to iron out a compensation package and promises regarding accessibility over the next week.Last week, the transport secretary signalled that the Northern rail network could be renationalised after years of late and cancelled trains. Grant Shapps said he had asked the company, which runs routes from Newcastle to Leeds, Liverpool, Hull, Manchester and Stoke, to draw up proposals to improve the service, saying it could not “continue delivering in the current delivery method”. He also said he was “hugely impatient [to see] the extinction of Pacer trains”.A spokesperson for Northern said “a small number of Pacers units” would need to be used “for a short period of time in 2020”. It said the first Pacer went into retirement in August, and “the majority of Pacers” were expected to be removed by the end of the year.The company, acknowledging that “customers will be disappointed”, said it was “finalising proposals for customer support and offers” for passengers who travel on Pacers in 2020.It added: “From today, Monday 21 October, we will have 29 of our 101 new trains in service for customers and a further 27 new trains are in final testing or being used for driver training.“We agree the north deserves the best possible rail service and are working hard to improve performance and reliability for customers.”"
Regulator acts after ‘illegal’ airport parking scheme collapses,"Investors were told paying £20,000 to acquire places at Gatwick and Glasgow would bring returns of 12%",Hilary Osborne,2019-10-20T09:00:50+0100,"Investors who put their money into an airport parking scheme that went into liquidation earlier this year are hoping for compensation after the Financial Conduct Authority announced it was taking legal action against those behind the scheme.The Park First scheme, which collected more than £230m from thousands of people, offered returns of up to 12% to those who invested £20,000 a time on individual parking spaces at Gatwick and Glasgow airports.But the FCA claims it was an “illegal collective investment scheme” that was “promoted to the public using false or misleading statements”.Park First is just the latest in a string of schemes, many related to property, to have disappointed investors who were hoping for decent returns. While it is not always possible to sort the good from the bad, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself.• “As a starting point, never invest in anything that you don’t understand,” says Patrick Connolly of financial advisers Chase de Vere. If something sounds highly complicated, or if the explanation of how the returns will be achieved doesn’t seem to stack up, ask questions. If it still doesn’t make sense, it might be a sign that something is wrong.• It’s an old adage, but true: “If an investment seems too good to be true then it probably is,” says Connolly. “And if it is promoted with a very high interest rate then that means it is very high risk.” With returns on bank accounts still languishing in the low single figures, high rates of return may be a sign of high risk.• “Stick to investing with reputable and established firms,” says James Daley, managing director of consumer group Fairer Finance. The FCA publishes a register of companies that it authorises – you can check it at register.fca.org.uk. It also has a list of unauthorised firms – these are firms that it has received complaints about, but do not assume that a company that does not appear on this list is legitimate.Also look out for the badge of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme – as its name suggests, this is set up to pay out if a company goes wrong and leaves investors out of pocket.• Treat unsolicited calls and emails with suspicion. Often people who have bought into one investment scheme will get calls about others – it may be that some companies sell their lists. There are also fraudsters who make a business out of offering to buy up failed investments – they typically ask for an upfront fee of some kind, then disappear. Do not agree to anything without doing some research first.• Do not assume property is good security. Many schemes offer ownership of a leasehold in return for your cash, and it can be reassuring to know that you own the rights to a room or a piece of land. But as investors caught up in landbanking schemes can vouch, even property can be worthless if you can’t use it and no one else wants to buy it.• Use a reputable financial adviser. “If you’re parting with any serious sums of money, it’s worth taking advice from a good professional,” says Daley. “Look for advisers who are chartered or certified, which means they’re qualified to a higher level.”"
Extinction Rebellion: what price could you pay for taking a stand?,"How being arrested on a climate or anti-Brexit protest could affect your job, mortgage or travel",Miles Brignall,2019-10-19T07:00:24+0100,"For many people, this weekend could be their first experience of protest, whether on the anti-Brexit march on Saturday or as part of Extinction Rebellion’s rolling campaign. But what about those willing to go further and be arrested?Extinction Rebellion launched a wave of civil disobedience on 7 October to highlight the escalating climate emergency, and by yesterday, more than 1,700 people – including the Guardian columnist George Monbiot – had been arrested, with some now facing an anxious wait to find out what comes next.Guardian Money has spent the week looking at the possible financial implications of being arrested in this type of protest, and talked to lawyers, experts and those who have put themselves on the line for environmental causes.We found that, depending on the outcome of arrests, those involved could face issues with their personal finances, including mortgages, insurance and future employment.One of the big unknowns, say those behind the protests, is how many people will be prosecuted. Following previous Extinction Rebellion action, only about 10% of those arrested were charged, but it could well be higher this time. There has been a hardening of attitudes this week at the Home Office and the Metropolitan police, and the Met has warned it will be pushing for more prosecutions this time round.Prosecutions can lead to unspent convictions and – while that might sound technical – it is these that can cause the biggest problems. Extinction Rebellion does not duck this issue on its website, which has downloads and FAQs covering this area. “Before attending an action, it’s crucial that all rebels inform themselves about their rights as protesters and the possible consequences of arrest,” it says.This article is not designed to put anyone off participating in protests. The aim is to clearly spell out the implications that being arrested could have so individuals can make an informed choice.A criminal conviction can be for anything from a serious crime resulting in a prison sentence to littering or speeding leading to a fine. It is likely that in the case of most of those charged this week, it will be for failing to leave a controlled area of London when instructed to do so by a police officer.Once someone has been convicted, that conviction is deemed to be current – or unspent – for a period based on the sentence. The more serious the conviction, the longer it remains unspent.In short, convictions are what insurers, mortgage companies, employers and other organisations do not want to see on your “file”. For example, British Heart Foundation does not accept volunteers to work in its shops if they have any type of unspent conviction.John Briant, an Oxford-based criminal barrister who has been advising local Extinction Rebellion protesters about the implications of being arrested, says most of those previously arrested who chose to go to court have ended up with a conditional discharge of six months and/or a fine related to income. Conditional discharges are only considered to be spent at the end of that term – typically six or nine months.For those who are fined in court, the conviction is only considered to be spent a year from conviction. Those given a community order face a year on top of the order’s length.The extraordinary 15-month prison sentences meted out to anti-fracking protesters are a much bigger problem, as the conviction is not considered spent for a further four years on top of the sentence.It may sound ridiculous, but a 70-year-old retired teacher who may have never claimed on their home insurance is unlikely to have their policy renewed once they reveal they have an unspent conviction.Christopher Stacey, a co-director of the charity Unlock, which was set up 20 years ago to help people with all types of convictions, says most big insurers will not renew, or issue a new household policy, when they learn someone in the insured household has an unspent conviction. Several insurers including Direct Line, LV= and Aviva told Money this was the case.“Getting insurance can be a big problem for people with an unspent conviction. For those with existing house insurance, if you don’t notify them of the change when you next renew, the firm could refuse to pay out if you later try to claim. We have seen this happen in the past, particularly when people have let their policy simply automatically renew,” he says.Convicted protesters given a six-month conditional discharge would be fine if their renewal came up after it was considered spent. However, if it fell within the six months, it would be unlikely to be renewed – if you admit it. Unlock has produced a list of specialist brokers who will help those with an unspent conviction find insurance cover, but this is likely to come at a cost.Some insurers have a clause in their terms and conditions that requires the customer to inform them of a conviction, at any time. One of the UK’s largest, Aviva, told Money it insists customers inform it of any new non-motoring convictions “as soon as reasonably possible”. It admits it could lead to a decline or cancellation of the policy, either at the time or at the point of renewal. As soon as your conviction is spent, you have no obligation to mention it to an insurer. The Unlock calculator can help with this.Car insurers are not so obsessed with non-motoring convictions unless they are serious and relate to theft, fraud or handling stolen goods. Again, you will have to declare any unspent convictions at renewal. However, Aviva said it would insure a driver with a minor protest conviction who had an otherwise clean record – but again at a cost.No, there is no obligation to tell your insurer or other financial company that you were arrested. If you accept a caution, that is considered to be immediately spent. However, it can have long-term consequences, as it stays on your police file for life – and will be likely to appear on any enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check carried out later.The credit reference agency Experian told us criminal fines and convictions have no impact on credit scores, and only a fraud conviction would show up as a “marker”. Banks generally take a similar stance. Nationwide says it does not ask about criminal convictions when someone is opening an account. Only serious financial crimes such as money laundering, bribery, tax evasion or mortgage fraud would lead to account withdrawal, it adds.However, things become a bit murkier when it comes to mortgage applications, says Stacey at Unlock. Mortgage companies do ask about unspent convictions, and every year, the charity hears reports of people having their mortgage application seemingly turned down for this reason.Stacey says most lenders will ask about criminal records – typically: “Have you ever been convicted, or have any prosecutions pending for any criminal offence (other than motoring offences)?” Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, spent convictions do not have to be disclosed as part of a mortgage application, irrespective of what questions are asked. Mortgage companies should be clear about this, but often aren’t, he says.If your conviction is unspent, you will need to disclose it.Ruby Dinsmore, an employment law specialist at Slater and Gordon, says: “Strictly speaking, employees are under no legal obligation to tell their boss if they have been arrested or charged with an offence, but there are exceptions. For example, if their contract of employment states that they must disclose such matters, or the conviction affects their ability to do the job, such as a taxi driver banned from driving, or if they work in certain regulated professions.”She says honesty is usually the best policy, as the consequences could be much worse if an employer were to find out at a later stage.“While information about arrests is not publicly available – unless an employer were to carry out an enhanced background check – details of charges and convictions are,” Dinsmore says.“And if the employer decided that their trust had been broken, that the person’s behaviour posed a threat to colleagues or customers or had brought the business into disrepute, they could be within their rights to dismiss them, even before the outcome of any criminal case.”For many younger protesters, this will be the biggest issue, particularly if they decide to change career.Most big employers conduct a basic DBS check before they offer a new employee a contract. This will show up only unspent convictions and conditional cautions, which will not be a problem for most first-time environmental protesters.However, if you decide you want to work with children or vulnerable adults, even on a voluntary basis, and the organisation does an enhanced check, it will show all convictions – including spent ones – plus cautions and any other information the police deem to be relevant. Most cautions given to first-time Extinction Rebellion protesters would likely only come off their enhanced check after six years.It would then be up to the employer to decide whether to carry on. Would a caution following a climate protest lead to a teacher being denied a job offer?It is worth noting that plenty of people taking jobs in finance have been caught out after telling their employer they had no convictions, as they were spent, only to have the offer withdrawn when the employer did a DBS check. Arguably, as more people are arrested at climate protests, employers will have to stop lumping them in with every other convicted or cautioned person.Generally, anyone travelling to the US for less than 90 days can travel under the visa waiver programme. However, if you have been arrested, you are ineligible to travel under the scheme, and will have to apply to the US embassy for a visa. A typical six-month conditional discharge given to a climate protester would probably not be grounds for a visa refusal, but the visa process can be a real pain. Equally, those planning to emigrate in later life will have to disclose any brushes with the law, and it could be a problem depending on the country.Miranda Cox, who was one of a number of people arrested after locking themselves to the entrance to Cuadrilla’s fracking site near Blackpool, says environmental protesters need to go into the process with their eyes open.Along with 11 others, she pleaded not guilty in 2017 to obstructing the highway, but was convicted. They each received a 12-month conditional discharge and had to pay a total of £270 in costs.“Looking back on it, I think we were a little naive about the consequences. We knew we wouldn’t be visiting America any time soon but we didn’t really think about the other consequences. I think we were lucky that most of us were a bit older and we weren’t about to make big career changes or similar,” says Cox, 50, who was a councillor at the time.She says she did not have insurance problems but others in the group have faced rises in car premiums. No one lost their job, she says, but she suspects that was more due to their circumstances.“To anyone thinking of joining an environmental protest I’d say go for it, as you will be on the right side of history. However, you need to go into it with your eyes open. Being handcuffed and thrown in the back of a police van and spending several hours in a police cell was really unpleasant – much worse than I thought it would be,” she says."
Mortgages: 40-year terms are becoming the norm – but watch out,First-time buyers could end up paying a lot more – and not be mortgage-free until their 70s,Rupert Jones,2019-10-19T07:00:25+0100,"Mortgages with a maximum term of 40 years are now becoming the norm, according to new data this week. However, with the average age of a first-time buyer standing at 32, that raises the prospect of a generation of homeowners not achieving mortgage-free status until they are in their 70s.Latest research from the data experts at Moneyfacts.co.uk shows that 57% of the residential mortgage products currently available have a standard maximum term of up to 40 years – up from just under 36% in March 2014.It provides more evidence that the traditional 25-year mortgage is increasingly becoming a thing of the past, particularly when it comes to first-timers.Yorkshire building society this month became the latest big provider to increase its maximum term to 40 years.By stretching the term, borrowers can reduce their monthly payments and are therefore more likely to meet banks’ strict affordability rules.But there’s a big sting in the tail. Moneyfacts gives the example of a £250,000 repayment home loan with an interest rate of 2.5%.Over 25 years, that equates to a monthly repayment of £1,121, and the total interest payable would be £86,463.The same mortgage taken over 40 years would cut the monthly repayments to £824, but whack up the total interest to £145,733. That’s an additional £59,270.Shaun Church, a director at mortgage broker Private Finance, says: “Continued efforts need to be made to ensure home ownership remains attainable early in adulthood to avoid jeopardising this generation’s financial security later in life.”Darren Cook at Moneyfacts says an extended mortgage term may well go beyond pension age, “so it is imperative these borrowers consider their options and attempt to make provisions if their personal circumstances change”."
DIY travellers risk being tripped up by lack of protection when booking via comparison sites,Booking a villa through an online platform can leave the holidaymaker with little or no recourse to compensation when the property fails to live up to its description,Anna Tims,2019-10-20T08:59:50+0100,"It was early evening when Victoria Morley arrived at her €6,000 holiday villa on the Maltese island of Gozo. The five-bedroom farmhouse had been described on TripAdvisor as a “unique experience of luxury accommodation” and Morley had spent her savings on a fortnight’s stay to reunite her family after the recent death of her husband. The luxury turned out to be restricted to the seductive photos on the TripAdvisor listing. “It was dirty, some of the furniture was broken, toilets were blocked, cable TV had been advertised but wasn’t subscribed to, the whirlpool bath didn’t work and the pool had lots of tiles missing,” she says. “The whole place was rundown and, more worryingly, it failed to meet European safety standards, with no fire extinguishers or smoke detectors.”Morley was unable to find a phone number for TripAdvisor on its website and, since it was getting late, the family went to bed. She emailed the company at 6am the following morning to report her concerns and was called by a representative who assured her that she would be covered by the company’s payment protection scheme.The ensuing holiday was interrupted by plumbers and builders called to repair leaks and other defects, and by regular emails to TripAdvisor as new evidence of the villa’s condition emerged. At the end of their stay, the company announced that they would not be covered after all, because Morley should have informed them of the problems on arrival, then vacated the property. “We weren’t told this at the time and we would in any case have been unable to find another property at such short notice,” she says. “With my two autistic sons and an 85-year-old mother in our party it wasn’t viable to walk out with all our luggage in the evening, after a long day of travelling and with nowhere to go.”Morley tried to claim via PayPal’s buyer protection scheme, but was told that since the accommodation had been “delivered”, it could not help. She could not issue a claim via her credit card issuer because transactions through third-party payment systems, such as PayPal, are not covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. The only agency to act on her complaint was the Maltese tourist board, which barred the owner from renting the property again until it complied with safety standards. However, the listing remains on TripAdvisor’s website.Morley’s experience was a painful lesson in the lack of protection available to travellers who book through comparison platforms such as TripAdvisor, Skyscanner or TravelSupermarket. And it serves as a warning to those who, in the wake of the collapse of Thomas Cook and other travel companies, decide to organise a holiday themselves.Unlike most travel agents and tour operators, comparison platforms are not members of Abta or Atol, which offer insurance-backed safety nets and, in the case of Abta, a code of practice and arbitration. Nor can travellers rely on the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations, which offer degrees of protection when two or more components of a holiday are booked through a single provider. Because bookings via comparison platforms are made directly with a hotel, airline or travel agent, they don’t count if the provider for each part differs. TripAdvisor only handles payments for private accommodation rentals, like Morley’s, but the contract is with the property owner, so customers who book a flight as well are unprotected.Confusingly, bookings via similar-seeming websites, such as Ebookers or Hotels.com, may be covered under the regulations because they are brokers and handle all transactions themselves. A trawl through the usually well-hidden terms and conditions can be the only way to distinguish between a broker and comparison site.Moreover, while travel agents and tour operators must take responsibility for the accuracy of their adverts, travel platforms are not necessarily held to account for misleading listings. According to the Advertising Standards Authority, the advertiser is usually held liable, rather than the platform hosting the advert, and substandard accommodation is a matter for council trading standards departments which, as Morley was to discover, won’t help if the advertiser is based abroad. This leaves the courts as the only recourse for dissatisfied customers.Last month the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced a crackdown on hotel booking sites to ensure they complied with consumer protection law. Twenty-five firms, including TripAdvisor, Skyscanner and Travelsupermarket, agreed to commit to make their websites fairer and more transparent. The move followed enforcement action against six sites (which did not include TripAdvisor, Skyscanner or Travelsupermarket) that had been found to have exploited customers with pressure-selling tactics, hidden fees and misleading discount claims.TripAdvisor is a fantastic resource for researching holidays, but consumers need to treat it as just that“Sites have a responsibility to ensure the information on their platforms is reliable and, if they continue to fall short, they should be compelled to make changes so holidaymakers are no longer at risk of being duped by dodgy reviews or misleading photographs,” says Which? Travel’s Naomi Leach. “We have exposed sites like TripAdvisor for failing to take action on activity, such as suspicious hotel reviews that artificially boost rankings, as well as glossy marketing photos used by accommodation owners that turn out to be a far cry from reality.” Tripadvisor responded that it is “aggressive” in catching fakes.TripAdvisor eventually paid Morley €1,000 for the “inconvenience” after pressure from the Observer. It insisted that she had breached the terms of its payment protection policy by spending the first night in the property and claimed that when she contacted customer services the following dawn, the money for her stay had already been released to the villa owner, who offered a €200 “refund”. Moreover, it said its policy does not cover “maintenance issues with amenities or services” only “material differences” between a listing and the reality, a distinction which will be lost on travellers who find a pool exists but is filthy, or a garden too overgrown to use.However, it accepts Morley was misinformed. “An agent incorrectly advised that Ms Morley would be covered by our payment protection policy, but [as] this was the second day of Ms Morley’s booking, this was not the case,” said a spokesperson. “We fell short of the standards which we hold ourselves to on this occasion, which is disappointing, and we hope the gesture of goodwill helps to make up for this inconvenience.”The company states that it always works with travellers and property managers to resolve problems. It confirms that although the substandard villa was delisted by the property agent, a listing for the same property under a different name by the owner remains on the site.Morley hopes that her experience will warn others of the pitfalls of DIY holidays. “Travellers need to be aware of the complaints system and not think they can sleep on a situation, no matter how jetlagged they are,” she says. “TripAdvisor is a fantastic resource for researching holidays, but consumers need to treat it as just that. They’re not a travel agent, which I falsely assumed they are. People may feel protected and secure buying their holiday through a huge firm that regularly advertises on television, but it relies on consumers to review their stay and that isn’t foolproof, as the reviews can be taken down by the owners, or, as in my case, the owner can simply take down the original advert and re-advertise under another name. For me it was never about getting a free holiday, just the holiday promised by the advert.”• This article was amended on 21 October 2019 to remove potential ambiguity from the headline and to add details about the CMA announcement last month."
Domestic & General ‘peace-of-mind’ policy turned out to be a washout,I have an autistic son and I was left for three weeks relying on friends and the launderette,Anna Tims,2019-10-23T07:00:29+0100,"My six-year-old son is autistic which means he has acutely sensitive hearing, wets the bed daily and is a very messy eater – our washing machine is in constant use and, until now, it was quiet. For this reason I took out a Domestic & General £5.99 a month “peace of mind” care plan when I bought the machine in 2016, which allows me a replacement like for like should anything go wrong. Four weeks ago my machine stopped working. D&G said it would be three days before they could send a technician. When the technician arrived, he had to order a spare part and promised to call when it was in. Having heard nothing for five days, I called D&G. It said that the replacement time frame was 28 days, which was not flagged up when the key facts of the policy were explained. After six more days of chasing, there was still no news and no updates. It was only when I called two weeks after the technician’s visit that I was told the machine had been written off and would be replaced. I stressed that the noise level was a critical issue and was assured the replacement would be equivalent to my old one. However, the new machine was 10 times louder than my old one. The sound pierces my son’s ears and his reaction is devastating but D&G explained that decibels were not a key specification. I have had to pay £48 for a third party to collect the machine and will have to shop for a new one. I have paid in excess of £220 into the care plan and spent three weeks using launderettes and friends’ machines. Had I not had a care plan, I would have had a new machine immediately and probably for not much more money.LP, Southsea, HampshireAs you’ve discovered, extended warranties are rarely worth the money. The manufacturer’s warranty should cover appliances for the first couple of years – often more – and the Consumer Rights Act allows up to six years to complain about a fault, although you have to prove it’s a manufacturing defect if it’s more than six months after purchase.If appliances last longer than that you could end up paying more in the monthly premiums than the cost of a new machine. And if you have to wait up to 28 days for a repair or a replacement, it may be quicker to sort a problem yourself.Your experience is dismaying on several counts – the long wait, the waste of a machine that had been deemed reparable and the indifference when the replacement did not meet your needs.Predictably, D&G softened when the Observer put your case. It removed the unsatisfactory machine for free, gave you a cash sum to buy a replacement and added an extra sum in goodwill. “We are sorry the customer had a bad experience with us,” it says. “Delivering quality customer service is our priority, so any complaint is disappointing and we work hard to resolve these incidents.”If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Taliban fighters in makeup: Barbican to show rare pictures,"Photographs, found in Kandahar, Afghanistan, taken despite ban on photography",Mark Brown,2019-10-23T06:00:45+0100,"They are probably the least likely men to ever be willingly pictured in heavy makeup, painted nails and holding plastic flowers against a kitsch background of Swiss Alpine chalets.But pictured they were, all gun-toting Taliban fighters often holding hands and posing for photographs which will be shown in a UK exhibition for the first time next year, the Barbican has announced.The photographs were found in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in 2002 by the Magnum photographer Thomas Dworzak.They are “visually arresting,” said Barbican curator Alona Pardo, and remarkable because they are real. “These are not constructed photographs, these men have chosen to have the photographs made and present themselves to camera like that. It just shows you the agency of images to destabilise our perceptions.”Photography was banned by the Taliban but a handful of photo studios were allowed to remain open, not least because passport photographs were still needed.Dworzak was in Kandahar for the New Yorker a few weeks after remaining Taliban fighters had been chased away. He came across the photographs in the backroom of a studio and offered to buy them.“They were more than happy. They said ‘look they’re not going to come back to pick them up.’”He said the photographs could be seen as an extreme form of hypocrisy. But he also found them “incredibly touching”.“I’m almost envious of the photographer that they could take these portraits of these guys … the Taliban then were the absolute personification of evil and you have them holding hands with plastic flowers. It is very confusing but I like that.”Dworzak published a book of the pictures and was criticised by some for making fun of the men; by others of showing them in too positive a light.“I never expected that reaction. A lot of people also thought I took the pictures.“What is important I think is that this is not a Taliban-specific aesthetic. It is something you can find in the sub-continent, in India and Pakistan. The extra twist is the Taliban banned photography.”The photographs will be included in a major group show titled Masculinities: Liberation Through Photography featuring work by 50 artists including Annette Messager, Richard Avedon, Isaac Julien and Catherine Opie.It is part of a wider year-long season at the Barbican called Inside Out, exploring the relationship between people’s inner lives and creativity.Theatrical highlights will include two shows directed by Ivo van Hove – an adaptation of Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice and Tennessee Williams’ The Glass Menagerie starring Isabelle Huppert as Amanda; and a new production from Belarus Free Theatre which is being staged 10 years since it was put in political exile.• Masculinities: Liberation through Photography is at the Barbican art gallery 20 February-17 May."
"Lucian Freud: The Self-Portraits review – menacing, elusive ... orgasmic?","Royal Academy, LondonWhether he’s just a shadow or staring at us, open-mouthed and wide-eyed, the great self-dramatist remains curiously unknowable",Adrian Searle,2019-10-22T18:30:08+0100,"Lucian Freud at 18, his head ballooning out of the frame, flat-faced, a glint in his liquid eye where the light catches the varnish. His eyebrows are millipedes. Then Lucian in 1943, big-eared, gawky, oddly calm, a white feather in his hand.With each work in this exhibition of Freud’s self-portraits we witness an increasing occupation with his own portrayal, the person moving in and taking up residence in his own unstable image – the one he’s been given and the one he’s making for himself. Sometimes we see Freud in glimpses, or peering round a corner, uneasy but knowing. Then he’s hanging about by a streetlamp, beside a wall surrounding a big house. I hear a lonesome harmonica, and imagine him reaching into his pocket for a packet of Strand cigarettes. (“You’re never alone with a Strand,” the advert went.)Open-mouthed and surprised, he draws himself with soft black crayon and pencil in a deceptively plain 1948 image. The caption talks about some Rembrandt etchings from 1630 and Courbet’s 1843 self-portrait The Desperate Man. Instead, I see a young man wide-eyed in orgasm, his head tilted slightly back, the chin closer to us than his forehead. Who’s on top? Is anybody there? There is shading around the edge of his ears and his neck, as if he were pressed against a pillow. Maybe he is imagining what he would look like in that instant to a lover. Behind Freud’s teeth his mouth is a black cavern that could swallow the world. I imagine it going all the way down, but maybe that’s just me.Once, he’s only a shadow, cast on the bed where his model lies naked. Like a stain or trace evidence, this looming, enlarged patch of grey on the sheet almost isn’t there, while everything else in the painting is solid; the woman on the bed is raw and fleshy. This shadow puts us in the painter’s place, hovering invisible over a naked woman. It looks like a movie murder scene; I think of Sickert and of Alfred Hitchcock’s Frenzy. A section of this exhibition is devoted to works in which Freud’s own presence is secondary: a pair of small self-portraits sit at the bottom of a wall in the background to his portrait of two Irishmen in their suits. My eye wanders past and out of the window in the background to the open-skied views of west London’s stuccoed streets and tower blocks beyond. Is he misdirecting us?These glimpses are always more than incidental, even when all we see are Freud’s pacing shoes beyond his sitter, caught in the studio mirror as he turns between the canvas and his model. You think you hear the sound of his feet. And then you see a bit of his leg, reflected dim in the night-time window between the blind and the sill, as his son Freddy, naked and stark, stands in the corner of the room.Sometimes he is cropped and sometimes he is unfinished, his face petering out into smears and lost brushstrokes. In their way, these false starts are as complete as any portrait gets. He is always beginning again. “When I see photographs of painters staring into the distance I always think, ‘What complete cunts. I don’t want to be one of those,’” Freud once remarked. I don’t think he wanted to be one of those painters who portray themselves all constipated and brow-furrowing, smug and supercilious, either. Even when he is at the centre of things, he’s unknowable.Freud is a great self-dramatist, and seems to take pleasure catching snatches of himself in mirrors, peering between the foliage of a potted plant, looming and menacing like a 1960s London gangster, then suave and louche, or a sly old git, fixing us from the corner of his eye with a horrible knowing glance as he passes by. Life, like painting, is a kind of self-invention, but along the way things intervene. Shit happens to us and around us, in paintings as well as life. Accidents and mistakes pile up – just like that thick, granular and poisonous lead-white Freud used in his later work. The mistakes and accidents include other people, their presence and affect as they pass through the studio. Their bodies, clothed or naked, are always in the way.Hell isn’t only other people. One must include oneself and one’s body in this comedy of errors and terrors and that’s what Freud does. Then, later, naked in the studio, he raises his palette knife aloft with a kind of comic defiance. Along with the sallow, sagging skin, he is a mess of revisions and repaintings, the pigment piling up and moiling over his cock and balls, the face redone and done again, the room emptying out behind him. It is only him there now.Freud may have resisted his grandfather Sigmund’s influence on his own paintings, but both worked in self-consciously contrived stage-set rooms where other people come and go, leave and return and have secrets to tell. In Freud’s paintings the secrets are the one’s the body tells, rather than the things they say. How complicated, how fascinating it all is.Lucian Freud: The Self-Portraits is at the Royal Academy, London, from 27 October to 26 January."

A handful of words can hardly do it justice. With just two tail-ender wickets remaining and needing 107 runs for victory, Australia produced an epic fourth-day fight-back led by Brett Lee. England’s bowlers squirmed as the run chase narrowed, knowing defeat would put them 2-0 down in the series, yet when Michael Kasprowicz edged Steve Harmison’s rising delivery to Geraint Jones the tourists agonisingly fell two runs short of their target. Unusually, the defining image of that match is not the winning delivery itself or even the wild celebrations that followed, but this quiet moment of sportsmanship displayed by Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff, England’s talisman, towards Lee, his crestfallen rival. England would go on to win the series 2-1 and reclaim the Ashes for the first time in 18 years, lending this remarkable image even greater resonance.Photograph: Tom Jenkins / The GuardianWords: Jonny WeeksBuy your exclusive print herePrice £55 including deliveryPrintsPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100-plus years.

MPs reject Boris Johnson's attempt to fast-track Brexit deal,PM fails to restrict scrutiny of bill to just three days in effort to meet 31 October deadline,Heather Stewart,2019-10-22T20:28:33+0100,"Boris Johnson’s plan to fast-track his Brexit deal through parliament in time for next week’s 31 October deadline was blocked by MPs on Tuesday night, even after he threatened to pull it and press for a general election.The prime minister said he would speak to EU leaders and urge them not to agree to a prolonged Brexit extension after former Tory cabinet ministers Philip Hammond and Rory Stewart joined with Labour to inflict a humiliating defeat on the government.But the European council president, Donald Tusk, suggested almost immediately that he would recommend the EU27 accede to the UK’s request for a three-month delay. That request was set out in the letter reluctantly penned by the prime minister at the weekend in compliance with the backbench-led Benn act – despite his previous insistence that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than countenance a delay.Following PM @BorisJohnson’s decision to pause the process of ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and in order to avoid a no-deal #Brexit, I will recommend the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension. For this I will propose a written procedure.The EU is expected to comply with the UK request for a three-month extension with the option to leave before 31 January if the deal is ratified earlier.After a day of cajoling and inducements from the prime minister and the Conservative whips, the government lost a crunch vote by 322 to 308 – a margin of 14.MPs rejected the “programme motion”, which set out a blistering three-day timetable for them to scrutinise the 110-page withdrawal agreement bill, despite having backed Johnson’s deal in principle by a majority of 30 in a separate vote just minutes earlier.The passage of the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament was automatically paused as a result of the defeat, with the Speaker, John Bercow, saying it was officially “in limbo”.Johnson told MPs: “We now face further uncertainty, and the EU must now make up their minds over how to respond to parliament’s request for a delay … One way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal.”The prime minister and his aides will have to decide whether to ask MPs to support an election – in line with his threat to MPs earlier in the day – or to draw up an alternative programme motion allowing more time for debate and continue to try to push his Brexit deal through parliament in the coming weeks.No 10 continued to strike a bellicose tone on Tuesday night despite Johnson’s refusal to repeat his election threat after the government’s defeat.A Downing Street source said: “Parliament and Corbyn have repeatedly voted for delay. On Saturday parliament asked for a delay until January and today parliament blew its last chance. If parliament’s delay is agreed by Brussels, then the only way the country can move on is with an election. This parliament is broken. The public will have to choose whether they want to get Brexit done with Boris or whether they want to spend 2020 having two referendums on Brexit and Scotland with Corbyn.” Johnson may be swayed to give more time for debate by the larger-than-expected majority of 30 the government won for the principle of his deal in the earlier vote. That appeared to signal there could be enough leeway for the government to succeed in passing the legislation, although some of the Labour MPs who supported it, including Gloria De Piero and Gareth Snell, said they could withdraw their backing at a later stage, if they were unable to amend it.Johnson said: “May I say how welcome it is, even joyful, that for the first time in this long saga this house has accepted its responsibilities, come together and embraced a deal … We should not overlook the significance of this moment.”MPs tabled a string of amendments, on issues including a customs union, environmental standards and avoiding the risk of a no-deal exit at the end of 2020. At least five pro-deal MPs have said they would support a customs union amendment tabled by a cross-party group of MPs including Ken Clarke and Ruth Smeeth.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: “We will seek a very clear commitment to a customs union, a strong single market relationship, hardwired commitments on workers’ rights, non-regression of environmental standards, and loopholes closed to avoid the threat of a no-deal Brexit once and for all.”After the government’s defeat, Corbyn urged the government to agree to an alternative timetable, to allow the legislation to continue to be debated.The rebellion against the programme motion was led by Hammond and Stewart. They were keen to secure reassurances that if the government had not succeeded in negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU27 by the end of 2020, the UK would not leave without a deal.Another potential rebel and former cabinet minister, David Gauke, was won over by a last-minute concession from the government on the issue.During six hours of debate in the Commons on Tuesday, Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, accused the prime minister of “bullying” tactics.Nick Thomas-Symonds, closing the debate for Labour, condemned “a flawed bill implementing a fundamentally bad deal” and said the timetable was far too brief.“This government, having tried unlawfully to shut down parliament altogether, now tries to shut down the ability of members to properly scrutinise the most important piece of legislation that’s been brought to this House for generations,” he said. “Weariness with the politics of the past three years is no good reason to wave through a bill of such huge significance in less than 36 hours.”Responding for the government, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland – a former remain supporter who said the 2016 referendum result had been “a bitter blow” – said the overwhelming message from voters was to “just get on with it”.He appealed to MPs to back the second reading and the programme motion, saying a Brexit date of 31 October was vital for keeping the trust of the EU. “The time for decision making is now,” he said. “The time for proposing nothing, opposing everything, and seeking to play old-fashioned politics is over.”"
Royal experts question wisdom of Harry and Meghan documentary,Couple’s interview about impact of press intrusion could ‘just feed media machine’ ,Caroline Davies,2019-10-22T18:40:45+0100,"The decision by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to agree to a highly emotional TV interview about their treatment at the hands of the press could open them up to further damaging headlines, according to PR experts and royal watchers.In the ITV documentary, Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, Harry appeared to give credence to long-standing rumours of a rift with William when he admitted the brothers had “good days and bad days” and that they were following different paths.As fallout over the extraordinary interviews continued, the PR expert Mark Borkowski said the couple’s participation in Sunday’s “heart-on-sleeve” programme had broken all the normal royal family rules of “never complain, never explain”.“You should just say, ‘that’s off limits’. But he made a story,” said Borkowski, who called the documentary a “complete and utter disaster”.“The population is split. I think younger people get it and are more attune with it. But the rump of people who are monarchists still probably go out and buy the Daily Express. Those are the people he is not convincing.”With William destined to be king and Harry to slide further down the line of succession, their future paths will be different. But Harry’s comments were overwhelmingly interpreted as concrete evidence of a rift, in a blizzard of headlines.“You allow the intrusive lens into your life, and you are out of control. No matter how much editorial control they had with their mate, Tom Bradby, he’s caused chaos,” Borkowski said.The decision by Harry and Meghan to speak out so openly about their struggles, he said, had a hint of the A-list celebrity Hollywood PR strategy. But the rules were “totally different for celebrities and royals”.He said: “The royal family are a publicly-funded heritage business, and as anybody that has entered in to the royal family has discovered, the rules go out of the window. [Celebrities] don’t have the same responsibility, don’t have the love of the nation to deal with.”While celebrities could demand “approved quotes, approved pictures, playing hardball, controlling photo opportunities”, he said, “with the palace there is an uneasy relationship with the media and the public”.The royal biographer Penny Junor said: “My instinct is it is best not to tell the entire world about your emotional state. I suppose in a way, it is a generational thing, and everyone will have a different view on it.”The documentary was filmed during the couple’s recent 10-day tour of southern Africa, a highly successful “textbook royal” tour which was then overshadowed by the legal action by Meghan against the Mail on Sunday, over allegations that it printed extracts of a private letter from her to her estranged father, Thomas Markle.Harry also issued a furious statement railing against the tabloid press, whom he accused of a “ruthless” campaign against his wife.Meghan’s almost tearful gratitude when she was asked in the documentary if she was “OK” and about her struggle with the intensity of tabloid interest, was seen to have parallels with Martin Bashir’s Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales.“I had a great feeling of deja vu watching Meghan with her face beginning to crumple,” said Junor. She said the film raised concerns over the mental well being of the couple. “I don’t doubt they are finding it very difficult. Fundamentally, all these negative stories, I guess, have taken their toll.”The couple have announced they will take six weeks off from royal duties, during which they are expected to travel to the US.But the documentary had served only to give everybody more headlines – and of the wrong sort, Junor believed.“It just feeds the media machine, and that is the one thing Harry really hates. This whole documentary has exposed him. In a way it is the very reverse of what he has said he wants for him and his family, namely, privacy.”"
Harry Dunn death: a timeline of key events,"Nineteen-year-old died after collision involving Anne Sacoolas, wife of a US diplomat",Mattha Busby,2019-10-22T16:55:40+0100,"The death of 19-year-old Harry Dunn following a collision involving Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official who claimed diplomatic immunity and promptly returned to her home country, has placed a renewed focus on the laws protecting foreign diplomats.On Tuesday, the chief constable of Northamptonshire police force where the fatal incident occurred gave a press conference to provide greater clarity on the circumstances surrounding the teenager’s death.A fuller picture of the timeline of events has now become clear.27 August:Sacoolas is believed to have been driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit the teenager riding on his motorbike outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.She cooperated with police at the scene and was breathalysed. However, this first account was not treated as an interview under caution.Officers decide not to arrest her in what in what Northamptonshire police chief constable Nick Adderley later said was the right decision.28 August:Officers visited her address where she provided an account of events and said she had diplomatic immunity.Northamptonshire police applied for a waiver to render this void.US embassy notifies the FCO that the spouse of a member of staff at RAF Croughton had been involved in an accident.29 August:Specially trained liaison officers are embedded with the Dunn family, including parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, and Northamptonshire police’s investigation continues in the belief they cannot detain Sacoolas.30 August:The US asserted that Sacoolas was covered by diplomatic immunity.5 September:The Foreign Office formally requests the US embassy to waive immunity.13 September:The FCO was informed by the US embassy that it would not waive immunity and she would be leaving the country imminently, unless the UK had strong objections.However, foreign secretary Dominic Raab immediately objected in “strong and clear terms”.15 September:Sacoolas leaves the UK on a US Air Force plane.16 September:The FCO approaches the US embassy and was informed that Sacoolas had departed.It immediately notified Northamptonshire police that the waiver had been declined and Sacoolas had left the UK.Officials asked police to delay telling the family by up to two days so it could decide next steps.18 September:Harry Dunn’s funeral takes place at an Oxfordshire crematorium.23 September:The Dunn family inform the liaison officer they have been made aware of a suggestion that Sacoolas had left the UK. Police confirm this is true.24 September:Police had wanted to meet the Dunn family, but the parents were unable to.26 September:Police meet with the Dunn family to officially confirm her departure, and officers go through what they know.7 October:Raab expresses his disappointment over the decision with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.Boris Johnson said: “I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.”8 October:Number 10 confirms the prime minister would personally appeal to Donald Trump if the Pompeo does not act to ensure justice is served.US government said her immunity was “no longer pertinent”, given she had returned to the country.9 October:Johnson raises the case with Trump.13 October:The Dunn family’s lawyer, Mark Stephens, protested that: “[Sacoolas] wasn’t entitled to diplomatic immunity in the first place.”15 October:Dunn’s parents visit the White House following an invitation by Trump, and the former reality TV host told them that Sacoolas was waiting for them in an adjoining room and wished to meet them.19 October:Dunn’s parents said they were “not impressed” with the US president’s offer, which he delivered unannounced and which they refused to comply with.21 October:Raab tells the Commons he had commissioned a review into immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at RAF Croughton in light of the case.He told the House: “The UK government had been notified of the American family’s arrival in the UK in July 2019, and this diplomatic immunity was the result of the arrangements agreed between the UK government and the US government back in 1995. Under those arrangements, US staff at RAF Croughton and their families were accepted as part of the US embassy in the UK. Pursuant to these arrangements, staff and their families were entitled to immunity under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. Under the exchange of notes in relation to the Croughton annexe, these arrangements waived immunity for employees, but the waiver did not cover spouses.”22 October:In a press conference, Adderley reveals that Sacoolas, without naming her, has requested for officers from the force to personally interview her under caution in the US.Adderley confirms the Crown Prosecution Service will decide whether it will seek to bring charges, potentially death by dangerous driving which could trigger an extradition request. However, they can only do so after they have received the suspect’s account."
Special educational needs reforms 'failing generation of children',"Pupils unsupported and families caught up in ‘conflict and despair’, says inquiry",Sally Weale,2019-10-23T00:01:16+0100,"A cross-party committee of MPs has accused the government of failing a generation of children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in a damning new report which calls for radical change across the system.The report, by the education select committee, said ambitious government reforms, introduced in 2014 to improve the experiences of Send pupils and their families, had been poorly implemented with damaging consequences for many.Children had been left without the additional support they merited, impacting not just on their education but in many cases their mental health. Their beleaguered families, meanwhile, were caught up in a nightmare of “bureaucracy, buck-passing and confusion” in a system which “breeds conflict and despair”.During the course of the 18-month inquiry, the committee heard from 70 witnesses and received 700 written submissions, among them accounts of children as young as nine attempting suicide while others had suffered anxiety, depression and self-harm.A significant funding shortfall for children with Send was also highlighted in the report. The government recently announced a £780m increase in local authorities’ high-needs funding for Send, as well as its own review of the impact of the reforms, which were introduced under the Children and Families Act 2014.MPs warned, however, that any additional money would be wasted unless there was a culture change within the government, schools and local authorities. They went on to criticise a lack of accountability in the system and an “unwillingness to grapple with unlawful practice”.The report called for a more rigorous inspection framework with clear consequences for failure, and suggested a direct line for parents and schools so they can appeal straight to the DfE where local authorities were not complying with the law.“The distance between young people’s lived experience, their families’ struggles and ministers’ desks is just too far,” the report said.MPs recommended a greater focus on Send in school inspections and additional powers for the local government and the social care ombudsman. The report also called for more employment and training opportunities for over-16s.The Conservative chair of the committee, Robert Halfon, said: “Despite the good intentions of the reforms, many children with Send are being let down day after day. Many parents face a Titanic struggle just to try and ensure their child gets access to the right support.“The DfE cannot continue with a piecemeal and reactive approach to supporting children with Send. Rather than making do with sticking plasters, what is needed is a transformation, a more strategic oversight and fundamental change to ensure a generation of children is no longer let down.”Labour’s shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, described the report as devastating and said it exposed a system on the verge of breakdown. “It is the latest evidence that the most vulnerable children are paying the highest price for this government’s cuts.”A DfE spokesman said the additional £780m recently announced for Send brought the total amount spent on supporting those with the most complex needs to more than £7bn in 2020/21. “This report recognises the improvements made to the system over five years ago were the right ones, and put families and children at the heart of the process. But through our review of these reforms, we are focused on making sure they work for every child, in every part of the country.”A wide variety of campaigning organisations supporting families and Send children welcomed the report. Jane Harris, the external affairs director at the National Autistic Society, said: “Autistic young people and their parents will be relieved that MPs have shown they understand the devastating experiences they have been through.“But being heard isn’t enough. The government must act now to make sure that schools and local authorities have the resources they need to support children properly.”Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Schools and local authorities want to provide the best possible support for SEND pupils, but the tools needed are generally no longer available due to cuts to local services.”The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: “Councils support the reforms set out in the Children and Families Act in 2014, but we were clear at the time that the cost of implementing them had been underestimated by the government.”"
Refugee age rows having 'devastating' impact on children,UNHCR says children arriving in UK whose age is disputed likely to be denied services,Jamie Grierson,2019-10-23T00:01:18+0100,"Age disputes are having a “devastating impact” on unaccompanied and separated refugee or asylum seeker children arriving in the UK, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has warned.Evidence from an assessment conducted by the UNHCR found disputes over a refugee or asylum seeker’s age impeded and delayed access to services and environments that can assist integration.Children whose age is in dispute are liable to be placed in inappropriate accommodation together with adults, presenting a risk to their safety, the report said, and they are likely to be denied access to education.The mental and physical health of such children may deteriorate, they are at increased risk of absconding or being trafficked and of being detained as an adult in an immigration removal centre, the report said.“For many children these initial mistakes take at least months, and often years, to correct,” the report said.“In the meantime, children are exposed to harmful and protracted disputes: not only denied the support to which they are legally entitled, but also forced to challenge the very people charged to look after them.”The assessment identified numerous cases where asylum seekers, initially judged to be adults, were later determined to be children as young as 15.International best practice specifies that age assessment procedures should only be undertaken as a measure of last resort, when there are grounds for serious doubt about the person’s age and once informed consent has been obtained. Prior to the assessment, all age-disputed individuals should be given the benefit of the doubt and treated as a child unless this would be clearly unreasonable.But the UNHCR report says significant changes in UK policy and practice are required to bring age assessment processes in line with these principles.The report was one of three commissioned by the European commission and published by the UNHCR on Wednesday, which make the case for taking steps to ensure unaccompanied or separated child refugees and asylum seekers arriving in the UK can more quickly recover from trauma."
Emergency detentions of young adults and teens soar in Scotland,Rates of short-term urgent care have seen increases of more than 100% over the last decade,Severin Carrell,2019-10-23T00:01:16+0100,"Mental health experts are to hold an inquiry after it emerged that emergency detentions and compulsory treatment for young women and teenage boys in crisis are at record levels in Scotland.The latest figures show a 122% increase in short-term detentions since 2009 for women aged under 25, a group which also had the highest rate per capita in Scotland for emergency detentions in hospital last year.The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland (MWC), a statutory body, said teenaged boys aged 16 and 17 showed the sharpest increase in emergency detentions with 26 cases recorded last year, more than double the number in 2009-10. In addition, 33 girls aged 16 and 17 were held in hospital last year, compared with 12 a decade ago.Emergency detentions are intended for people in need of urgent care, and allows them to be held in hospital for up to 72 hours. Over the past decade, emergency detention rates had grown the fastest among both boys and girls aged 16 and 17, the commission added.The figures were disclosed in a new MWC report into the use of emergency detentions and compulsory treatment orders authorised under Scottish legislation dating to 2003, which is also about to reviewed by the Scottish government to bring it up to date.Dr Moira Connolly, the commission’s chief psychiatrist and interim executive director (medical), said it was unclear why these age groups were most affected. That had led the commission to prioritise that with its new inquiry, being set up by her successor, Arun Chopra, early next year.“The rise in numbers of times detention is used in relation to young people is concerning,” she said. “We already know of the increased number of children and young people seeking help for mental health issues, but we need to understand more about whether those pressures are now being reflected in our data regarding compulsory hospital treatment.”Connolly cited a recent report by Dame Denise Coia, former chair of Healthcare Improvement Scotland, who found increased waiting times for child and adolescent mental health services, and a lack of good data. Coia called last year for much greater focus on prevention, social support and early intervention.The commission’s study, published on Wednesday, found record levels of compulsory treatment across the population, including emergency detentions, short term detentions and compulsory treatment orders, at 6,028 cases in 2018-19, compared with 4,114 a decade ago.The national rate for compulsory treatment for all age groups and both sexes grew from 35 to 53 people per 100,000. The data show wide variations in their use by different National Health Service boards in Scotland, with Greater Glasgow and Clyde the most likely to use emergency detention.Alex Cole Hamilton, a Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP who campaigns on child welfare and mental health issues, said the data was a revelation. “These shocking statistics show people aren’t getting help fast enough, when they first start to feel unwell,” he said. “It also shows Scotland isn’t getting this right.”The Scottish government suggested the increase in compulsory detention and treatment could be a result of the larger number of people coming forward for help, and a general increase in awareness of mental health.Connolly said it was “a bit of a leap” to tie the welcome decrease in the stigma attached to mental ill-health with emergency detention orders. She said a lot of things had to happen for someone to be subject to compulsory treatment.A government spokesman said ministers were investing £250m over the next five years on improving mental health provision for children and young people, and were hiring 350 additional school counsellors and 250 school nurses."
Energy suppliers could face tougher financial checks,Ofgem considers barring fast-growing UK firms from taking on too many customers,Jillian Ambrose,2019-10-22T16:44:37+0100,"Energy suppliers could be blocked from taking on too many customers under proposals designed to ensure fast-growing companies are financially fit to handle expansion.Ofgem, the industry regulator, plans to run financial health checks on growing energy startups before they reach a certain number of customers after more than a dozen company failures in the sector in the past two years.If the suppliers fail the test they will be barred from taking on more customers and forced to prove they are financially fit before growing past the next threshold.Ofgem said it would put the checks in place before a supplier reaches 50,000 customers, and again at 150,000 and 250,000. The next threshold would be set between 500,000 and 800,000.The regulator may also demand that suppliers write a “living will” that sets out how they would continue to provide customers with a good service as well as an “orderly exit” if it cannot survive in the market.Mary Starks, an executive director at Ofgem, said the plans would create more accountability in the energy market and reduce the risk and cost of further collapses.The tougher standards for existing energy providers follow proposals to raise entry requirements for new suppliers to stem the rise of unsustainable firms.The regulator encouraged a large number of startups to enter the market to increase competition and drive better customer service. However, it exposed customers to a raft of unsustainable energy suppliers, many of which gave poor customer service before going bust.Fourteen suppliers have crashed out of the market since January 2018. In August, thousands of homes and hundreds of companies were left without an energy provider when Solarplicity collapsed.Matt Vickers, the chief executive of Ombudsman Services, said the crackdown was good news for consumers. He said he supported Ofgem’s plans because there had been spikes in complaints about fast-growing energy companies that were unprepared for rapid growth.Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the proposals would limit the cost to consumers of failed suppliers and provide better protection.“Our research estimates that recent supplier failures led to an additional £172m being added to bills. Most of these costs arose from companies leaving behind unpaid industry bills for renewable schemes,” she said.“The government should legislate to require suppliers make these payments more regularly, and further limit the costs to consumers when these companies fail.”"
"Blood pressure drugs work far better if taken at night, study shows",‘Chronotherapy’ benefits of bedtime doses discovered in huge trial ,Nicola Davis,2019-10-23T00:05:16+0100,"Taking blood pressure medication at bedtime rather than on waking halves the risk of events such as heart attack and stroke, a major study has revealed.Experts say the findings could potentially transform the way such medications are prescribed, but questions remain, not least why taking the medication at night has such a profound effect.Prof Ramón Hermida, first author of the study from the University of Vigo in Spain, said the effect was thought to be down to the body’s internal clock that means processes and chemicals within our bodies vary over a 24-hour period.The upshot, he said, was that the same drug could have vastly different effects if taken at a different point in time, something that has been dubbed “chronotherapy”.“The same antihypertensive medication, the same molecule, at the same dose, ingested at two different times have totally different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and therefore they behave as two totally different medications,” said Hermida.Previous research has shown that high blood pressure during sleep, and only small differences between blood pressure during the day and night, are both important risk factors for cardiovascular problems.There have also been studies suggesting blood pressure medications are more effective when taken in the evening and might result in fewer heart attacks and strokes.As a result, the team set out to compare the long-term implications of adopting a bedtime, rather than waking time, routine for taking blood pressure medication in a large trial.Writing in the European Heart Journal, the team report how they randomly split more than 19,000 adults with high blood pressure into two groups. Half of the patients were asked to take all their medication at bedtime while the other half were asked to take it upon waking. Crucially, said Hermida, fixed times were not given so that participants took their medication at the same point in the daily routine.The patients were then followed for between four and eight years, with blood pressure measured over a 48-hour period at the outset and at least once a year during the study. In total 1,752 cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, death from cardiovascular disease and heart failure were recorded during the study.While the impact on daytime blood pressure was similar, those taking their medication at bedtime had a small but significantly greater reduction in blood pressure during sleep compared with those taking medication on waking, as well as a greater difference in blood pressure when sleeping compared with being awake.Among possible explanations, Hermida said it was known that the hormone system that regulates blood pressure peaks in activity during sleep, meaning it might be that medications that interact with this system have a greater effect when taken just before bed.After taking into account factors such as age, sex, smoking status, history of cardiovascular events and typical decrease in blood pressure when asleep, the team found patients who took their medication at bedtime had a 56% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease, a 49% lower risk of stroke and a 44% lower risk of heart attack compared with the other group.The team say the findings need to be confirmed in a more diverse range of ethnicities, while it is not clear if they would hold among those undertaking shift work.Prof Stephen MacMahon, the principal director of the George Institute for Global Health at Oxford University, who was not involved in the study, said such a profound effect on cardiovascular events was surprising given the modest differences in blood pressure. However, Hermida said the blood pressure medication could be operating on many different biological processes that vary in their activity over the course of the day.Besides the effect on blood pressure, the team found those who took the medication at bedtime also showed better kidney function and cholesterol measures, both of which are important factors when it comes to cardiovascular disease.Paul Leeson, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Oxford University, said the next step was to unpick why the timing of the medication had such an effect, something that could soon become clear with results from other big studies.“This study has the potential to transform how we prescribe blood pressure medication,” he said.﻿"
Report calls for more support for relatives of Britons murdered abroad,Bereaved ‘should be eligible to criminal injuries compensation and FCO-translated documents’,Owen Bowcott,2019-10-23T00:01:17+0100,"Bereaved families who lose a loved one to homicide overseas deserve far more support from the Foreign Office and other agencies, a report by the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales urges.As many as 90 Britons are killed abroad every year, leaving relatives grappling with foreign legal systems, untranslated documents, large bills and problems about how to repatriate bodies, according to Vera Baird QC.The study, Struggling for Justice, says help offered is often patchy and sometimes inadequate. Highlighting individuals’ difficulties, the review makes 17 recommendations to the government for improvement.Baird, a former solicitor general and Labour MP, said: “To lose a loved one to murder is a horrific experience no matter where the crime takes place. However, for the families of people who lose their lives to homicide abroad there are additional financial, legal and logistical burdens which add to the stress and emotional turmoil of sudden bereavement.“That these families are not entitled to criminal injuries compensation is particularly unjust given the additional financial burdens they face. One of the victims we spoke to had to sell her house to cover the legal costs associated with her mother’s death; this cannot be right.“I want these families to have the same access to interpreter and translation services that are on offer to victims and defendants in the UK where English is not their first language. I also want to be sure support agencies, including the FCO, National Homicide Service and the police are working together seamlessly to provide timely information and in a sensitive and supportive way.”Her report draws on the experiences of bereaved families. A few had positive stories but most encountered significant problems. One case study explained how Claire received a knock on the door at home in the UK from two local police community support officers. “They asked if James was her son and told her that James had been killed on a quad bike in Greece,” the report states. “They wrote down the number of the FCO on a newspaper and promptly left. The whole conversation took place in the hallway before Claire even had a chance to invite them in to sit down.”In another case, Emmy heard nothing from the British police and called American officers herself to confirm what she had been told. “Sometime later,” the report says, “when Emmy called the Home Office to ask why she had not been informed by the authorities about her daughter’s death, the official’s response was: ‘Well, you are informing us now’.”Unless a victim’s body is repatriated, there can be no inquest in the UK. One relative was reported as telling the charity Murdered Abroad: “As painful as it was to hear that there were marks on Joanna’s wrists where she had been tied up and strangulation marks on her neck, I needed to be sure of the facts. I was hearing it in English, in a British court and I believed that what I was hearing was the truth about what had happened to Joanna. You can handle the facts, it’s the unknown which is most painful”.Among recommendations made in the victims’ commissioner’s report were that the bereaved should be eligible to claim criminal injuries compensation, the FCO should take responsibility for translating all key documents including postmortem reports and that only police officers trained to deliver death notifications should be allocated to the role wherever possible.Trudy Cowan lost her husband in suspicious circumstances when he was traveling through Italy three years ago, but says she received little support from either the Foreign Office or the police.Russell Cowan, 44, from Chesterfield in Derbyshire, had gone with friends on a charity car rally in June 2016, raising funds to combat prostate cancer.They had stopped near Lake Como and he had been due to return home a few days later. On Saturday 4 June, they went out for a meal and Russell left alone to go back to their hotel. His body was found after he had supposedly fallen over a steep perimeter wall. The inquest later said it could not rule out third party involvement in his death.Trudy has hired private investigators and an Italian lawyer to try to find out what really happened. She believes it may not have been an accident.“The Foreign Office said they could not interfere in another country’s jurisdiction,” she said. “I don’t think I have heard the truth yet. “The Foreign Office just directed me to a website and some leaflets after he died. I was told they didn’t have anyone able to translate for me. You go into a country where you don’t speak the language or understand the legal system. That’s really poor. There was no family liaison officer provided to give advice and help out. That would have made a huge difference.” Her case in Italy continues next month."
‘What a day to be gay in Northern Ireland’: marriage equality becomes law at last,"As the law changed at midnight, same-sex couples celebrated the culmination of a rollercoaster campaign",Rory Carroll,2019-10-22T17:31:52+0100,"Amanda Milnes proposed to her partner Christina Conlon in January when same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland was illegal. It was an act of love and hope.On Tuesday, 10 months after Milnes went on bended knee and offered a ring, the Belfast couple celebrated a historic change to the law.“What a day to be gay in Northern Ireland,” said Milnes, 29. “What a day to see history happen. It’s just a phenomenal feeling knowing that I will marry Christina, the love of my life, and celebrate until our feet can’t hold us up any longer.”Same-sex couples across Northern Ireland erupted in jubilation at the stroke of midnight on Monday when a law extending marriage equality took effect.It was the culmination of a rollercoaster campaign to align Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK in the face of opposition from the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and other social conservatives.“We stayed up till 12 and counted down the seconds like it was New Year’s Eve,” said Milnes, a bank worker. “Today we can just take a deep breath and say it’s actually legal, we’ve the same rights as everybody else.”She proposed to Conlon, 30, during a ski holiday, unsure if same-sex marriage would become legal. “Now we can start planning the wedding. We have our guest list sorted. We can go shopping for wedding dresses knowing we’re not doing anything wrong in the eyes of the law.”England and Wales enshrined marriage equality in 2013, followed by the Republic of Ireland in 2015. Opinion polls showed a big majority favoured same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but the DUP blocked change at the Stormont assembly.Then in 2017, a dispute between the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed the assembly, creating a vacuum. MPs at Westminster stepped in by passing an amendment in July by a backbench Labour MP, Conor McGinn, extending marriage equality to Northern Ireland.Monday was the last chance for opponents of change to restore Stormont and avert the legislation. The DUP and others attempted a recall to block the extension of abortion rights – a far more contentious change – but the effort failed, allowing liberalisation of both marriage equality and abortion rights.Julian Smith, Northern Ireland’s secretary of state, said the first gay marriage was expected the week of Valentine’s day 2020.“You don’t grow up saying ‘I can’t wait to have a civil partnership’,” said Cara McCann, director of Here NI, a charity that advocates for lesbian and bisexual women. “You grow up saying ‘I want to be married’. They’re different things.”She and her partner Amanda McGurk, 39, had a civil partnership ceremony in Belfast in February. They plan to convert that into a marriage once guidelines are published, said McGurk. “It’s validation for us.”McCann’s son Ryan, 25, hailed the law change in a Facebook post. “The day my rock my mum and her amazing wife Amanda have the same rights as me and my partner.”Overt homophobia has ebbed in Northern Ireland. Pride parades have grown in popularity, drawing corporate sponsors, clerics, families, politicians and police. The murder in April of Lyra McKee, a writer and LGBTQ activist who was planning to marry her partner, Sara Canning, channelled grief into demands for change.Anthony Flynn, 28, and his partner Cory Quinn, 25, celebrated the legislation with a bottle of prosecco.“I was incredibly cynical and sceptical of it passing right up until the last moment because we’ve been pushed back so many times in the past,” said Flynn, a software developer and Green party councillor. “Today shows that progress can be made.”After six years together marriage is on the cards, said Flynn. “I’m threatening to pop the question. Both of us come from a traditional family life where marriage is a building block in growing up. I’d be a traditionalist – I want to marry the person I love and build a family around that.”"
Foreign Office unable to confirm how many UK children trapped in Syria,Government accused of not doing enough to help children whose parents joined Isis,Dan Sabbagh,2019-10-22T17:42:39+0100,"A Foreign Office minister said there was no official estimate of how many British children were trapped in Syria during a testing Commons debate in which politicians of all sides accused the government of not doing enough to help.Andrew Murrison told MPs the government was seeking to repatriate orphans and unaccompanied children, but was not in a position to confirm estimates released on Monday by Save the Children that at least 60 children needed assistance.The Foreign Office minister admitted, in response to an urgent question in the Commons following a report in the Guardian, that “we are not in a position to make an accurate estimate of the number” of British children who could be brought back to the UK.But while he would not be drawn on details, Murrison insisted that the government had been actively engaged in the past four days. “We hope to facilitate the return of unaccompanied or orphaned children where feasible,” the minister said.Last week, in response to the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish area in Syria, UK ministers confirmed that government would now consider repatriating orphans and unaccompanied children, possibly using British special forces to help extract them from the territory’s overcrowded refugee camps.David Davis said Murrison’s commitment did “not go far enough”. Only three of the children identified by Save the Children were orphans, the senior Conservative said, adding that “children who have not been orphaned still deserve United Kingdom protection.”.Davis said: “The children are there through absolutely no fault of their own. They should not be punished for their parents’ mistakes”. He highlighted how they had to endure “brutal fighting” as Isis was gradually defeated.Murrison said that he did not recognise the figures cited by Davis, although he gave a slight hint that the government may look at other cases of other trapped British children, describing orphans and unaccompanied children as “a priority”.Emily Thornberry, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, accused ministers of missing an opportunity to act when the Kurdish-dominated region of north-east Syria was relatively peaceful, prior to the Turkish invasion of earlier this month.The invasion had been given the green light by the US president, Donald Trump, who said he would not stand in the way of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in creating a “security zone” in Syria cleared of the Kurdish military.Thornberry said: “If we were having this discussion two months ago, we would have been talking about negotiating the repatriation of these children with our Kurdish and American allies.”The situation had become much more complex, she added: “Now, as a result of Donald Trump’s actions, that negotiation will need to involve the Assad regime, Russia and what are now their Kurdish allies.”The former defence secretary Penny Mordaunt said that ministers should also consider whether “taking a child to a war zone … was seen as a form of child abuse”, which could justify repatriating British children who are currently with their parents in Kurdish-run refugee camps.She asked if government lawyers could examine this “to see whether we can strengthen our hand in taking children back” and “to prosecute those who have taken children overseas”. Murrison said in reply that separating children from their mothers was particularly difficult.Prior to the invasion, ministers had refused to help children trapped in Syria, arguing there was no Foreign Office support available. They argued that their parents had travelled to join Isis at their own risk.But one of Murrison’s predecessors, Alistair Burt, complained that sometimes practical difficulties were used to “mask a failure in government to make the decisions it needs to make”.Ultimately, ministers would have to decide how to deal with the children’s parents, Burt said, adding that the UK would “have to recognise an international responsibility to take them back, even those who have been indoctrinated and radicalised, in order to protect the children”."
Palazzo of dreams,Living above Leonardo’s Milanese vineyard is a constant source of inspiration for fashion designer Massimo Alba,Scarlett Conlon,2019-10-19T16:00:28+0100,"Not many people can say that they share an address with Leonardo da Vinci, but Massimo Alba can. The fashion designer’s Milan apartment is part of the Casa degli Atellani, an elegant palazzo and one of the city’s most celebrated museums. It is also home to the vineyard gifted to da Vinci by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Maria Sforza, in 1498.“Every time I come home, I feel privileged to be living in this terrific place, surrounded by good energy,” says Alba as he leads the way through the museum to the garden where the Renaissance artist tended to his vines.Alba’s home, which he shares with his wife Marilena and their 14-year-old son, Nicolò, is situated on the first floor, but our tour starts in the sun-dappled gardens. Alba is keen to highlight the harmonious juxtaposition between past and present that inspires not only his work but his apartment, too. The 59-year old designer and his family moved here shortly after their home on the island of Ischia was destroyed by the 2017 earthquake. They had already sold their other two properties in and around Milan to raise capital to set up his eponymous label, so when the Casa degli Atellani’s current owners, the Portaluppi family, suggested Alba rented one of the storied dwellings, the family saw it as an opportunity to start their next chapter.“You don’t really own things [in life], only emotions,” reflects Alba, explaining that no longer being a proprietor – much like running his independent brand – makes him feel, “in a funny way, free”.The apartment is peppered with mementos from the past. When you step into the apartment you’re met with a treasure “from a lifetime ago”: an exquisite Tibetan chest that sits beneath a high ceiling. Beyond is an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living area with a retro floor-to-ceiling shelving system that acts as a room divider.Taking centre stage, the shelving unit is covered in dog-eared paperbacks piled high, unframed canvases, souvenirs, family photographs, hand-written notes, candlesticks, paperweights and small vintage lamps picked up at markets and auctions. It acts as a captivating storyboard of lives spent and shared.So, too, the artwork that covers the walls. Black and white photography and abstract oil paintings by Lillian Bassman, Kenro Izu, Evelyn Hofer and François Berthoud sit on floating shelves along one wall that stretches the length of the apartment. Meanwhile, giant scenes by French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier and the Sicilian photographer Ferdinando Scianna stand side by side on the floor next to a small sculpted chair by Tom Dixon.On the opposite wall, giant windows frame the view of the Santa Maria delle Grazie church across the road where da Vinci, commissioned by Sforza, painted The Last Supper in 1498, where it still hangs to this day.“In a certain way, our home is a melting pot, everything is slightly different, from a different place in time,” says Alba. As with the collections that he and Marilena design to be seasonless, comfortable and worn with everything else in your wardrobe, his home is a holistic extension of that. “We never look at each item; we look at the way items work with other items. We don’t want to change every season – we want to follow our inner voice and instinct.”Many of the pieces have sentimental value. Midcentury chairs by Danish and Italian designers including Hans Wegner and Gio Ponti are decorated with cushions Alba had embroidered by his friend, the artist Roberto Reale. They read: “Happiness is not in another place but in this place, not in another hour, but in this hour,” and “Hello there.” A lampshade also features needlework by Reale that reads: “M’illumino d’immenso.” It translates as: “I flood myself with the light of the immense,” and is a quote from the late Italian modernist poet Giuseppe Ungaretti, whose poetry Alba’s son was recently studying at school.Tibetan rugs, which overlap each other across the floor, have been hand-painted by Alba – himself a keen artist whose line of painted handkerchiefs has become a signature of his brand. Beds are draped in blankets he designed with the Scottish cashmere company Begg & Co. The kitchen, where I’m told generous servings of pasta and wine are served up for regular dinner-party guests, is decorated with classic Sicilian head vases, vintage mismatched glassware and family relics passed down from parents.“Personally, I like it when things from different times become friends and live together – something from the 50s, something from the 30s,” explains Alba. “I really feel it’s home. I feel close to everything I like.”Warm and inviting, it’s a home that is lived in, not looked at; the kind of space that speaks style and whispers “well-travelled” with a curiosity in every corner and a cup of coffee on the table.It’s kept feeling cosy by the walls and ceilings which are the same shade of matt grey throughout. They were done this way, says Alba, so that the rooms not only “become circular” and create intimacy but also complement the view of Santa Maria delle Grazie. It brings the outside in – as do the pots of Monstera deliciosa, along with unidentified succulents and vases of wild eucalyptus.One of the most memorable pieces from Alba’s home is a glass sculpture of a salmon by the glass artist Hugh Findletar, which Alba says he was drawn to “because salmon swim against the tide”. In creating this very personal space inside this world-famous landmark, Alba and his family have created a Renaissance of their own."
Tunnel of love: a wartime Nissen hut brought to life,"When a three-generation family moved to a smallholding in Wales, they reimagined an old military shelter as a stylish second space",,2019-10-19T10:59:22+0100,"A rusting wartime Nissen hut was not in the gameplan when architect Damon Webb moved from Brighton to mid-Wales with his daughter and her family four years ago. Tired of the fast pace and density of people where he lived, Webb, 52, was searching for an alternative. He wanted space to keep bees and chickens, and to pursue his interests in permaculture, self-sufficiency and the humane rearing of animals.His daughter Bella, son-in-law James and granddaughter Olive were living near Brighton in a small flat; they, too, craved a more sustainable lifestyle, with land for their daughter to roam, but could not afford it. They decided to join forces, and found a smallholding that suited their budget in Powys. They fell in love with the farmhouse with its surrounding hills, five acres of land and outbuildings; the 1940s corrugated steel Nissen hut in the yard, used to house German and Italian prisoners during the second world war, was incidental.Just before Christmas in 2015, the family moved into the main house, which was originally a pair of farm workers’ cottages built in 1620. To give family and guests more space, Webb decided to decamp to the Nissen hut – and found, unexpectedly, that he liked it. “I really appreciated its simple form,” Webb says, “two-thirds of a cylinder, like a vaulted church. I have always been interested in well-designed, small, quirky spaces.”The hut has windows on three sides and cladding on the end, which Webb painted black. The walls are lined with thin hardboard, and he patched up the plastering and repainted it. He and James built a small shower room and a tiny kitchen area from marine plywood.Webb packs a lot into his small open-plan space: alongside the kitchen is a desk area, dining table, living area and sleeping space. A waist-height bookshelf separates the sleeping and living areas, and rugs define the dining space. A wood-burner sits at the heart of the hut and plants fill ledges and hang from the ceiling.During the long, wet Welsh winters, Webb has to get up several times in the night to keep the stove stoked. He has only left the hut once to sleep in the main house, when the temperature fell below -10C.“It’s elemental – the hut creaks in the wind and you can hear every raindrop. As it’s in the yard, it’s close to the livestock. I can hear the ducks, and the cockerel at 5am.”Webb commutes to work in Brighton (he co-founded the practice Chalk Architecture) every other week, and stays with his parents or friends. Bella, 25, and James, 26, run the smallholding, which includes fencing, haymaking and maintenance, and taking care of the goats and pigs, helped by Olive, four, and Otto, two. Webb maintains the vegetable patch and garden.The three generations co-exist harmoniously: the children wander in and out of Webb’s hut in their wellies, enjoy colouring at his table on Saturday mornings, feed and collect the eggs, and check the beehives. The goat herd is growing and provides milk and some meat. The family experiments with cheese and butter-making. There are two pigs, Nozzle and Flower, and the bees provide several kilos of honey annually.The family eats together two or three times a week and share shopping and cooking. In winter they play board games, and Webb sometimes babysits. Arguments and fallings out are rare.Webb has grown to love the simplicity of the hut and the fact that everything he owns is visible and close to hand. He says: “We all wanted a more rural existence, and we have found it.”"
Our forever home on the Kent coast,Remodelling an old house by the sea gave this family the chance to shape their future – and meet the community,Nell Card,2019-10-12T16:00:25+0100,"Marine Parade is a dead-straight road that faces the cliff-top lawns of Tankerton Slopes just outside Whitstable on the north coast of Kent. The grassy slopes, popular with cyclists, dog walkers and joggers, lead down to a row of wooden beach huts and a quiet, shingle beach divided by wooden groynes. At low tide, a natural causeway known as the Street appears, making it possible to walk along the shingle spit with the estuary’s waters on either side. Six miles out to sea, the turbines of the Kentish Flats wind farm are just about visible. This is the view from Mel Payne’s first floor.“We were looking for something that was a bit life-changing,” she explains. “We’d lived on an island for quite a long time. Autism and twins will do that to a family, I think. You can be accidentally isolated, and this house takes us off that island.” Mel lives with her husband, Steve, a project manager for the NHS, their 11-year-old son Gus, who is autistic, and their seven-year-old twins, Tess and Elsa.“Previously, we really struggled to find a place that we could call home with everybody getting what they wanted and needed,” she says. “Now, we can have friends coming round all the time and anyone who wants to not be around can hide and do their own thing, or be part of the action. This house does it all. The seafront is the icing on the cake, really.”The family moved to Whitstable in 2015 before noticing the detached house for sale. Built in the 1970s, it was being sold by the family of the couple who had built it. “That family are still local,” says Mel. “They’d obviously lived here so happily. What we wanted to do was keep some of that love in the house.”They bought the house in 2016 and enlisted the help of their friends, Sonya Flynn and Mark Baker, founders of the local architecture firm Meme. “We sat in their garden and talked about what the house could become. They listened to us so carefully. They knew us and how we wanted to live and the first design they had is pretty much what we’re sitting in now.” A year later, work began.The house has been completely remodelled with extensions to the front and rear. The exterior is clad in dark render with black timber fins at ground-floor level, and expansive glazing and balconies on the first floor that maximise the views of the sea and sky. The architects have kept the original pitch of the roof, opening up the loft space and inserting two glass triangles into the roof gable. Dark and “stealth-like” on the outside, the interior is full of light and blocks of bold colour.Mel, a former deputy headteacher, made all the colour choices, starting with the pink, green and gold kitchen by Rochlin Bespoke. Dark greys and navy blues are counterpointed with rooms in yellow, mint green and peach (“Straight out of my 80s bedroom”). Bespoke, brass-trimmed cabinetry features throughout the house, while furniture is a combination of high-street and high-end: rattan Ikea rockers for the kids, Fritz Hansen easy chairs for the grown-ups.Where possible, the couple have spent much of their budget locally. The architects, joiners and the kitchen company are all from the area. Even the main contractor was a dad from the twins’ school. “We felt that was really important,” explains Mel. “You don’t expect it, but it did mean we got such personal touches.”The floorplan is cleverly divided into generous day spaces (there is a 6m opening from the kitchen-dining area to the rear, south-facing garden) and cosier, more reclusive areas: there’s a playroom on the ground floor, a family snug off the kitchen where the kids can lie on the floor and watch telly. Upstairs, there’s a library and workspace for the children. The house has also been future-proofed for family life, Mel explains.The downstairs guest room and family snug will eventually become Gus’s bedroom and front room, should he decide to live with them as an adult. If he wants more independence, there is a studio space at the end of the garden, which they could convert.The design-and-build process took two years from start to finish. Six weeks after completion, Mel was still finding spurious reasons to call the builders back in. “I got really upset when the work finished, because the buzz had gone and the people had gone.” In the end, she held a party to thank everyone for their input on the project. “I got real energy from it,” she remembers. “Nothing was a bind and I never felt stressed: I just loved every part of the process.

The Berlin apartment: living with the ghosts of the past,Architect Gisbert Pöppler’s home is a shrine to the city’s past – and a collection he’s built up over the 30 years since the Wall came down,Philip Oltermann,2019-10-12T11:00:28+0100,"Whenever Gisbert Pöppler has people over for dinner, the ghosts of Berlin’s past are guests of honour. Grouped around the dining table in his apartment in Berlin’s central Mitte district are three velvet armchairs the interior architect salvaged from what he calls the “Honecker lounge” at East Germany’s State Council Building, moulded over time by the well-nourished bottoms of Soviet apparatchiks. The table itself was formerly a conference table at Berlin’s Evangelical Academy, and if you look under the table top you realise the short legs are propped up on some old-fashioned metal money boxes, like a piece of concept art. “I’ve always wondered why this table is so low,” Pöppler says as he strolls through his apartment on sunny autumn morning. “One theory is that the Protestant church didn’t want people in important meetings to be able to hide behind the furniture. Isn’t that a beautiful idea?”Pöppler, whose practice usually designs and builds living spaces for other people, lives in an apartment that not only speaks of his love for the ideas behind everyday objects, but also doubles as a museum of the German capital’s tumultuous history.Originally from outside Bremen, in the north of Germany, Pöppler arrived in Berlin in autumn 1989, when the city was still divided. At the time, living space was hard to find in the western half, and the young architecture student spent weeks roaming the streets, ringing doorbells to see if tenants would let him explore and admire their buildings. “As a student, it felt as if there was a point when I knew every house in Berlin.”Two months after his arrival, the Berlin Wall fell, opening up swathes of new territory to the architectural magpie’s searching mind. In 1995, Pöppler found this 150 sq m apartment, in a tenement building from the 1890s, not far from the Checkpoint Charlie border-crossing. Partly derelict, the building had been earmarked to be torn down and replaced by a Plattenbau (concrete prefab) like the one on the opposite side of the road. There was no central heating, only a coal-burning oven that required constant attention – “a bit like looking after a dog”. But Pöppler and his partner took the plunge.The interior of the average Berlin altbau (period) apartment is pared back: for years the prevailing fashion was to leave walls white and let the battered herringbone parquet or the period plastering on the ceiling serve as the sole adornment. “For ages, even sofas were considered too bourgeois,” Pöppler says .Entering his second-floor apartment is an entirely different experience: the entrance hall’s walls wash over you in a warm Wedgwood blue, the ceiling glimmers with a hint of masking-tape yellow. A dusty pink table Pöppler picked up from a tailor in West Berlin greets the visitor coquettishly. In the living room to the left, there are explosions of colour: a Chinese export carpet from the 1920s, and a collection of abstract paintings by Hans Brosch, an East German painter who used a study trip to the Musée d’Orsay in Paris to escape to the west in 1979.Raised in a family home in “shades of beige and black”, Pöppler has made use of colour his practice’s signature, though he insists there is no underlying theory behind his choices, just instinct. He’s not a fan of the trend for Farrow & Ball-style British paints, because they tend to be “quite foggy”, preferring instead French manufacturers, which he says pack more of a punch.One characteristic feature of 19th-century tenement buildings in the city is the so-called Berliner Zimmer, an awkward, often dark room that connects the street-facing part of the apartment with the inner courtyard behind, once decried by Friedrich Engels as a “haven of darkness, stale air and Berlin philistinism”. But in Pöppler’s apartment, the Prussian cobwebs are blown away by an almost baroque gusto for playful design ideas. In his Berliner Zimmer, the flat’s kitchen, a vintage cabinet he has “dragged around since I was 14” hangs next to an artwork made out of salad forks with deer-antler handles, assembled by his long-term American associate Remo Lotano.In the adjacent bedroom, a central ceiling lamp is replaced by four coloured lights in each corner of the room. A stuffed jay peers down from its perch above the doorway.Stories from Berlin’s past reveal themselves only as you enter a room for a second or third time: there is the garden table on the courtyard terrace that Pöppler found on the street in Prenzlauer Berg, bent out of shape by the weather and riddled with worm holes. There is the sputnik ceiling light salvaged from the foyer of an East Berlin sports hall. Or there are the shelves he got from a bookshop that was subsidised by the East German regime and closed down after the fall of the Wall, which are built to hold only slim paperbacks of Marxist theory.In recent years, however, Pöppler and Lotano have spent less time roaming junk shops and closing-down sales, and more time designing and manufacturing their own pieces of furniture. In the apartment’s brightest spot, in front of the window that looks out on to the street, pride of place belongs to a elegant chaise longue with feet of curling steel, and a porcelain cupboard that looks as if it is made of, rather than made to store, fine china.“I wouldn’t want to say vintage is over,” Lotano says. “But there’s also a type of vintage that blinds you to the idea behind the furniture.” The ghosts of the past are still there, they just need to be kept on their toes."
Why my new regular haunt is the auctioneers,So much to see – and best of all win – at my local auction house,Eva Wiseman,2019-10-06T09:00:23+0100,"It seems I have… a hobby? When I wasn’t looking a new trapdoor opened in the panelling of my personality and now I am an auction person. Every Monday I waddle to the auction house at the end of my road, and calmly finger the tchotchkes and platters and tables and prints, choosing which item I don’t need that I need that week. I know it’s a hobby because my boyfriend alternates between disapproval and patronisation, sometimes both, depending on the size of the teapot.eBay has been my main shopping mall since 2007, because I both love old clothes and enjoy the chase. But the differences between a website and a real auction are vast and grounded largely in touch and smell, and the sense that a real person has curated this weekly museum of loss and memory.A small chipped vase is thus both elevated and grounded by its position on a table beside an art deco ring and a Polaroid of Diana. I still use eBay and, though I also dabble in online catalogues (last week I absentmindedly bid £10 on a picture, learning after winning that much of the artist’s collection is displayed at the Whitney, thank you), I am very much committed to my local auction house. This was the place my parents bought the furniture I grew up with and, after Ikea failed me through three flats and I was called back to the suburbs, the place I ended up in search of a chest of drawers that would not buckle under the weight of a bra.A recent house clearance meant one auction was awash with elephants. Elephant paintings, elephant-shaped umbrellas, bottles with trunks, and an elephant rug, and so on. Someone had loved elephants, and then they’d died. His was an acceptable collection. Some months earlier, I walked in to find a number of vivid mannequins, each dressed in bright-red lingerie; on the wall various pieces of erotic art appeared, hungry women hanging alongside the usual watercolours and adorable amateur attempts at hands. Boxes of specialist porn magazines piled comfortably next to the encyclopedias, and on the ceramics table sat a bronze woman grasping her nipples through what appeared to be a wet dress. Though, in bronze, tricky to say. A local man had died the way he lived, surrounded by massive tits. His inner life, shame and sexuality had been priced per piece. Bids started at £5.The issue is taste, a bulbous boil that grows on our neck, swollen with class anxiety and things your auntie once saidEvery week I feel fresh pangs at the lack of interest in anything large, or ornate, or mahogany. Family pride in the shape of wardrobes or sideboards stands waxed and varnished like bikini models. But despite the craftsmanship and years of reliable service, they don’t sell – they don’t fit modern lives, they eventually go for £30 a pop. They have a new name, in the interior design world – OBF. Old Brown Furniture. It invites, doesn’t it, a wrinkling of the nose at best, at worst a sort of gag reflex. It’s not just that modern homes don’t have room for these Victorian or Edwardian forests of dovetailed wood, though that’s part of it. It was reported this week that nine out of 10 London house-shares don’t have living rooms, as landlords squeeze the juice out of every square inch. But the real issue is taste, that bulbous un-poppable boil that grows on all our necks, swollen with class anxiety and things your auntie once said at Christmas.The stage on which we can see the evolution of taste play out is the auction house. According to the New York Times, wealthy people are having trouble selling their homes because they have too many antiques. The new generation of rich people are not reassured, but instead disgusted by OBF, their tastes having been moulded not just by years of picking shot out of pigeon at their parents’ dining table, but by telly. “At a time when home design television shows… emphasise light colours and pared-down interiors, it can be harder to sell homes that are furnished with antiques,” the New York Times reports.I feel for the couple that bought a “George V game table and chairs” for $10,000 in 2006, selling it today for 90% less. More and more, as I study Succession and Ivanka Trump and Kim Kardashian, I am learning that it is horrible to be wealthy, partly because there is so much further to fall. They look away as the van pulls up, grey blankets shrouding their heirlooms, giving them the look of hungover ghosts.Which is where I slide in with my greasy debit card, one eye trained on quality, the other on exceptional whimsy. It’s not just about finding something I need, or even finding something I like. It is more base, more basic a need, a feeling that sits quite low, near my bowels. I am no athlete, nor am I particularly bright, competitive or gifted at cards. So I am chasing a moment. When the hammer goes down at the auction, I truly know what it feels like to win.Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman"
Shack up: a new spin on an old beach bungalow,"A holiday home on the Norfolk coast combines superb modern energy efficiency and a traditional, local look and feel",,2019-10-05T15:00:46+0100,"Building a home in a beautiful rural setting carries with it a special sense of responsibility. This was Simon Fenn and his partner Mitra Cvijanovic’s view from the moment they decided to create a new family home on the Norfolk coast, in the hamlet of Waxham. They were determined to make as light an impact on the surroundings as possible, designing a modern eco-friendly home that would be modest in scale and with the smallest possible carbon footprint. Their super-insulated “beach shack” is now heated by just two tiny electric radiators and even these are seldom used.We love how calm the house feels. It’s a complete retreat out of season, where we can get away from it all“When we first moved into the house it was winter and so I went out to the shops and bought us all some thick socks and blankets, because I thought we would be cold,” says Mitra, who works in the finance industry. “We just didn’t know what to expect, but within a day we were all walking around in T-shirts. No socks, no blankets – nothing. It was wonderful.”During a regular working week Simon, Mitra and their two sons, Alex, 18, and Sam, 11, are based near Cambridge, where they built a house for themselves some years ago with the help of Mole Architects. But eventually they decided they wanted another project – a weekend and holiday house that they could use themselves, but also rent out at times to make sure it was almost fully occupied. They began looking around Cambridgeshire and East Anglia until eventually they found a small bungalow on the coast in a property auction.“It was a prefab bungalow from the 1930s made by Boulton & Paul,” says Simon, an IT consultant. “They were quite popular back then, but this one was beyond repair. At first we thought we might be able to do something with it, but when we really started looking closely at the building we realised there was no chance. So we began moving towards the idea of a fresh start and a replacement dwelling. Normally you wouldn’t be able to build something new in a place like this, but we knew that we had a good chance because it was replacing the house that was already here.”Simon and Mitra had the old kit house taken apart and recycled. Having already worked with Mole Architects in Cambridgeshire, it was a natural step to ask them to design the family’s very own Shangri-La, a concept that became the name they gave their next home. The design uses Passivhaus principles, meaning that the house is super-insulated and works to a rigorous low-energy spec, so that very little heating or cooling is needed. Mole Architects – who have plenty of experience in low-energy, sustainable design – joined forces with Beattie Passive in Norwich, a construction company that produces energy-efficient, zero-carbon buildings.“Beattie are local and were a really good fit,” says Ian Bramwell of Mole Architects. “They delivered a great result in terms of airtightness and thermal efficiency, but we were still able to design the house we all wanted. Essentially, we have these two rectangular volumes, side by side, and a spine wall down the middle that does most of the structural work without anyone even realising it. But they slide past each other, so that one extends outwards, which was really important in defining the layout of the house.”The four-bedroomed house sits on the footprint of the old and takes some inspiration from the idea of the beach bungalow vernacular, with a twin pitched roofline and its broad verandah. Yet the house is also distinctly modern, with big sheets of triple-glazed sliding glass facing southwards to maximise not just the views over the fields but also the solar energy, which helps to warm the house; in summer the glass windows slide back to allow natural ventilation. The house is built of timber, mostly larch, with thick walls packed with insulation, as well as a ventilation and heat-recovery system.Inside, the yellow front door leads into a central hallway, with two bedrooms to either side, and then the house opens up dramatically at the point where one part of the house begins to slide past the other. Here, there’s a largely open-plan living area with big views and plenty of light. But the layout also allows for an intimate seating area within an alcove, defined by a lower ceiling height. Then there’s a more fluid dining area and, to one side, the kitchen, lightly separated from the rest of the space by a waist-high counter that tops some of the kitchen units.Joinery by two local carpenters lends a warm, organic feel to the spaces, while Simon and Mitra – who project-managed Shangri-La themselves – also sourced an engaging mix of contemporary and mid-century furniture and lighting. At one point, before the house was finished, the family thought about putting in a wood-burning stove to keep them warm. But the house is so efficient that Simon and Mitra are now relieved they decided against the idea.“The Passivhaus principles rely on people being in the building and cooking and doing the usual things, which helps to warm things up naturally,” says Simon, who is now working on plans for a work studio back in Cambridgeshire. “We always have this very even heat, so the energy use is incredibly minimal, and we just love how calm the house feels. It’s a complete retreat, especially out of season, where we can just get away from it all. We have this wonderful view and the other thing is that you have this fantastic beach down the path where you can walk for miles in either direction. It is a very tranquil place to be.”shangri-la.house"
Braingasm ASMR class – like being drunk on a night bus and waking up in nirvana,"It promises the blissful, tingly sensation of ASMR combined with yogic relaxation. Little more than a wellness word salad with zeitgeist sprinkles? Maybe, but I had a divine nap",Rhik Samadder,2019-10-22T08:01:09+0100,"In the dark, a man whispers something in my ear about my root chakra. I’m perched on a block on a yoga mat in a gym in east London, wearing a glowing set of headphones. My eyes are closed: I can’t see the others around me, or hear the David Guetta soundtrack or the slamming of weights downstairs. Just the voice. Lie down, it says. I’m not getting the goosebumps I had hoped for, though. It’s not him, it’s me, I think. Relax, the voice says.ASMR, or aspirated sexy microphone rubbing, is très popular on the internet, but today I’m getting a live version. If you are unfamiliar with ASMR – which actually stands for autonomous sensory meridian response – take a dive into the countless online videos of supreme weirdness. Its breathy practitioners, mostly women, chew ice or stroke towels or click tweezers, with the intention of giving their audience, listening through earphones, “the tingles”. I don’t understand it, but I find it utterly fascinating.People have always found natural sounds soothing, yet exploiting the latent sensuality of modern, unlikely objects is a subversive, even artistic, provocation. All of which means big companies want in. There is even an (unofficial) ASMR KFC advert in which Colonel Sanders talks about his pocket squares for two and a half unsettling minutes. Now ASMR has been packaged into a marketable wellness system. Mmm. *Whispers into mic* Capitalism. *Runs nail along raised lettering of a debit card*The marketing for Braingasm, a new class from Gymbox (from £73 a month; £20 a day for non-members), is hardly subtle. Braingasm sounds like an ITV2 gameshow that thinks it’s Mastermind, but is really Catchphrase with glitter cannons. “Feel your brain get blown,” the website blurts. “Happy endings guaranteed.” I’m hoping they don’t deliver on that promise. Our class is led by Paul Selvey, an experienced yoga teacher. He explains sensitively that the class isn’t just a wellness word salad with zeitgeist sprinkles. The tingly, deeply relaxing sensation of ASMR perfectly complements a yoga nidra relaxation practice. Selvey usually teaches a combination of vinyasa flow, yin and sattva kriya. Braingasm offers a style that speaks more directly to where I am spiritually and emotionally. That is, one where you lie on the floor and everyone leaves you the hell alone for an hour. Bliss.We connect to our breath. We vocalise in Sanskrit, while looking in different directions with our eyes closed. All the while, Selvey whispers instructions. Yoga nidra uses spoken guidance to access deep “interiority”, and these soothing susurrations are an effective delivery system.Like any ASMR, the intimacy may be … a bit much. I can hear the saliva clicks and trickles in the teacher’s mouth, breath catching on palatal ridges. “Try not to fall asleep,” Selvey advises, but being a natural rebel/deeply exhausted, I start to drift. I’m not fully out – rather, floating in a rich semi-consciousness. I’m dimly aware of Selvey’s voice, telling us a George Harrison-esque story. Some weeks, this may be cosmic in nature, or geographic, but this week he is taking us on a journey through inner space. I feel as if I’m in a lucid dream, vaguely aware of stopping off at my heart, navel and assorted other chakras. It’s like being drunk on a night bus and waking up in nirvana. I don’t get the famous tingles, but not everyone does.It’s tricky to be definitive about ASMR’s legitimacy: there is insufficient research, and it’s mostly a self-reported phenomenon. Nonetheless, I like it. It’s an introverted practice in an extroverted world. It rewards those who pay attention to little things, who find their bliss in Blakeian miniature. Stillness, sensitivity and listening are good for the nervous system and the soul. The class’s saucy postcard pitch may be over-promising, but I had a great time regardless. Whisper it, but I may have reached the point where a nap is more desirable than a braingasm. Good lord: now there is something to meditate on.Are the videos meant to be sexytimes? These breathy people, un-crinkling Tunnock’s wrappers and running lint-rollers up the cat – should I be pants-free when I listen? ASM-asking for a friend.ASM-aybe. But the nap was truly divine. 3/5"
Making my own clothes transformed my body image – and my life,"As a teenager, the styles I liked never came in my size. So discovering that I could sew my own was profoundly freeing – and led me to help curvy women all over the world",Jenny Rushmore,2019-10-21T08:00:27+0100,"If you had told me when I was 29 that in 10 years time I would have made my entire wardrobe, run a sewing pattern company and finally found peace with my body, I would have said that was impossible. But learning to sew a simple pillow started a journey that blossomed into a total life transformation.Ever since I was a toddler in ballet class being told off for having a sticky-out tummy, I have been on the bigger side. No matter how many diets I tried, or sit-ups I did, I stayed stubbornly chubby, even if I had brief forays into being a smaller clothes size. By the time I was a teenager, I was resigned to it: not only did I feel like an unattractive failure for being a size 16 at 16 years old (how I laugh now at the idea that that is huge), but there was also no way I would be able to dress as I wanted to, despite the fact I loved clothes, because there simply weren’t clothes I liked in my size in the shops.Of course, my size wasn’t the only thing that defined me. An enthusiastic adopter of hobbies, I was creative from a young age, always starting up a new art or craft. So, when I was looking for a new challenge when I turned 30, I thought I would learn to sew. I vividly remember the first lesson I took, making a “rustic” pillow – as I sewed the first seam, I caught the bug. Before long, I was spending every evening and weekend learning new techniques; soon I was trying to make my own clothes, as I had the exciting idea that maybe I could make things that fitted.Imagine my disappointment, then, when I found out that, just as so many clothing shops ended at a size 16, so did most sewing patterns. Plus, they tended to be made for a B-cup bra and I was much bigger than that. So, I had to learn to alter patterns to fit me, mastering the complex “full bust adjustment” and learning how to make a single garment with different sizes at the bust, waist and hips. It took a long time to refine my alteration skills, but once I did I could create any garment, in any fabric, in any style – and it would fit me.Learning this skill of changing my clothes to fit my body, rather than changing my body to fit my clothes, was profoundly freeing: from the constant internal narrative I had when I was in a changing room willing a size 14 to fit; from having to wear what other people had decided was suitable for someone my size; from being assigned a number that was meant to dictate my worth as a person. I realised I had been tormenting myself to fit into an “average” that had never existed. It became evident that, contrary to what I had always believed, anyone can wear anything, as long as it fits. There is no magic rule that says when women hit a size 16 they no longer want to wear silk dresses, biker jackets, swimsuits or crop tops. All you need is enough fabric and sewing and fitting skills – then anything is possible. I learned that there was nothing inherently wrong with my body, and trying on only clothes that were custom-made for me was total bliss.Still, I was frustrated that I had to make so many alterations to every sewing pattern – and I knew I wasn’t alone, because the average UK woman is a size 16 and a DD cup size. So, one night, about four years after I learned to sew, I had an idea that would change my life again: I was going to help other curvy women experience the body positivity transformation I had, by creating sewing patterns that were designed for our size and body shape – no adjustments required.A year later, I launched Cashmerette Patterns with the Appleton dress, a wrap dress that doesn’t gape at the bust, that comes in sizes 16 to 32 and in cup sizes C to H. It turned out I was right: so many other women felt alienated by sewing patterns, and being able to whip up a dress “straight out of the packet” was not only convenient but also liberating. Since then, I have quit my job to run Cashmerette full-time. We have more than 20 patterns, from simple T-shirts and a swimsuit with a full underwired bra inside, to a shirt that doesn’t gape at the buttons. They are sold all over the world.My 29-year-old self would be astonished to see what my life looks like now, but I know she would be proud and perhaps a little overwhelmed to know how much I have changed and how I have been able to help other women like me. Learning to sew changed almost every facet of my life, and I will always be grateful to the small cushion that opened my mind to what was possible."
Five ways to deal with head lice and nits,"Parents dread discovering an infestation of the itchy menaces, but with the right approach you can stop them in their tracks",Amy Fleming,2019-10-20T15:59:03+0100,"“People are not treating an infestation at the earliest stages,” says Ian Burgess, the director of the Medical Entomology Centre in Cambridge, whose research is cited in the Nice guidelines for this persistent problem. “We quite often find people with hundreds and occasionally thousands of lice,” he says. Dee Wright, the owner of The Hairforce, a chain of self-styled “lice assassins”, says: “If you check your child’s hair and find a bunch of nits [eggs], you should be combing immediately, rather than waiting to spot a live one. It’s good to do a weekly check.”Many of Britain’s bestselling nit combs are ineffective, says Burgess: “They have gaps so wide that lice and nits can slip through.” He recommends using a plastic detection comb. “It needs to be rigid, and the front needs to be squared, to catch the legs of the lice.” The Bug Buster Kit sold by the charity Community Hygiene Concern contains these types of combs, with different sizes for lice and nits, and is available on the NHS (free for children diagnosed with lice). “It’s not going to be done in five minutes,” says Burgess. “With thick or long hair, you need to spend 20 to 30 minutes per session. If you’ve found a dozen and think you’ve done a good job, you probably haven’t – there’ll be at least another dozen hiding.”“Lice are movement-sensitive and scarper when you touch the hair,” warns Wright. Dividing the head into sections helps avoid missing any. Detangle the hair first and use conditioner. Metal combs, especially, can shred individual hairs, says Burgess. “We have even come across pseudo nits, where the comb has peeled back little knots that look and feel like nits,” he says. “So if you’re going to comb, you need to use a lubricant and do it carefully.”Burgess says that we have known about pesticide-resistant lice in the UK since 1995, yet chemical pesticide treatments are still sold – and frequently recommended by pharmacists and prescribed by doctors. “GPs aren’t listening,” he says. “It’s hardly surprising there are a lot of lice.”Silicone-based shampoo treatments, otherwise known as physical pesticides, may effectively smother the lice, but some of the dreaded nits can survive. “We looked at nearly 1,895 case records,” says Burgess. “Most of those who had baby lice appear after a treatment had them within the first week, but the longest case was 13 days.” Either treat again a week or so later, or keep combing for a few weeks to catch any late hatchers."
I wanted the boy’s first shoes to be posh – but he had other ideas,"It turns out miserliness is in the genes, as my son’s choice of footwear reveals",Séamas O’Reilly,2019-10-20T09:30:51+0100,"Often, when I see nice clothes in the bougie shops near where I live, I entertain a mild fantasy of myself as one of those dads who garbs their child in cooler-than-cool threads. I don’t think that would be a particularly noble vice, of course, but naively imagine it could be one of those annoying eccentricities – like vaping or making jewellery – that people would forgive so long as I occasionally made fun of myself for it.The only problem with this ambition is that freelance life has turned me into a miser, unwilling to buy any children’s clothes that aren’t made in runs of 40,000. When some snazzy jumper or beautiful hat catches my eye, I’ll invariably discover it’s priced as if it was hand-woven instore, by Richard & Judy. I don’t buy these items. No - like you, I place them back on the rack and, gripped by some odd horror that I will appear cheap, continue a discretionary period of fake ‘browsing’ to disguise my eventual exit, presumably out of a fear that the staff will know that the £79 price tag on that pair of mittens just made my soul leave my body.I thought I’d buck that trend this week by investing in his first pair of proper walking shoes. I was told a solid, more expensive pair would be best, presumably because they’d make walking more comfortable, not because he’d be inspired to display his sweet new kicks to the neighbourhood.In fairness, he might well feel cheated, since back when he was born we were gifted with so many clothes that he was covered head to toe in much nicer things. But I spent my entire childhood either wearing hand-me-downs from my eight older siblings, or freshly bought plastic shoes displaying non-copyright text like ATHLETIC SPORT 1999.Such bargains weren’t just common in Derry, they were mandatory. By law, raincoats had to boast the clumpy consistency of something fashioned from melted credit cards, and teachers would do spot checks to make sure every stitch of your clothing was flammable. What need for designer T-shirts when you could support the local polyester industry for a fraction of the price? And why would anyone settle for Giorgio Armani, when there was a perfectly good George of Armagh, NI, just down the road?Clearly such tightness is hereditary, since my boy had no interest in the spangly rubberised trainers we tried in the fancy shop and cried at the pleather beauties from a fancier one still. No, my penny-pinching progeny only had eyes for a drab pair of cloth clogs, which cost £6 and came in plastic tubing usually reserved for tennis balls and Pringles. I might not be a cool dad, but if he’s happy to save me a few pennies, I’ll let him. If that makes me a miser, I just ask you don’t judge a man until you walk a mile in his ATHLETIC SPORT.Follow Séamas on Twitter @shockproofbeats"
How we live together: the family and the weekday lodger,‘I love reading to the children at bedtime and I have all the joy but none of the hard work. There’s a photo of them on my fridge at home’,Camilla Palmer,2019-10-19T09:30:24+0100,"Having a weekday lodger seemed like a big shift, and we had loads of trepidation about a stranger living in our flat. But the financial benefits won over the awkwardness factor.Eight years on, it works because we get on. We don’t see each other very often, but when we do it’s a pleasure. Alan is self-sufficient. He doesn’t want to be a flatmate, and we don’t want one. That – and total honesty – is the key.We’ve gone from being a couple to a family with two children. When I was first pregnant, I was worried about what would happen, Alan-wise, when I went into labour. He said he’d go to a hotel. He understood instinctively.The children, now three and five, adore Uncle Alan – although my friends think he’s imaginary. We met his family for the first time recently and I felt like I knew them already.Our relationship is like one between neighbours rather than flatmates. We have distance and closeness, without it being awkward. We’re friends, but we don’t have to share chores. I work long hours and I eat out in the evenings with colleagues. I’m off home to Dublin to my own family at the weekend – my kids are grown-up.It’s hugely important to me not to encroach on Mike and Sarah’s privacy, but at the same time, they’ve always included me.

"Tim Dowling's dad, Bob: I’m 98, and life is still mayhem",Bob Dowling on the lessons he’s learned,,2019-10-19T06:00:15+0100,"First of all: why me? The whole family knows I never write anything. An old girlfriend once said my letter read like a social security card. My favourite poem is Ode To A Girdle*, partly because of its brevity. And this is a fine time to try to get me to start writing. I’m 98: when I get an idea into my head, I forget what it was before I can write it down. Why not wait till I’m 100?I live with three of my six grandsons, a seven-year-old and three-year-old twins, in Connecticut. It’s mayhem, but we had four children in four years, so I’m used to mayhem. One time we were going to visit my wife’s parents and had all the kids and the dog in the car. When I started driving, I realised we had left a suitcase on the roof, because our clothes were flying all around the road. When I stopped to retrieve them, the dog tried to get out and I accidentally shut the door on his ear. He flew around the car, shaking blood everywhere and scratching up the kids until everyone was howling.The twins’ father – Tim’s brother – has them enrolled in every athletic event in North America. He recently had them challenge me to a running race. We went down to the beach, where my son drew a starting line and a finish line in the sand, and shouted: “Ready, set, go.”I had a bad start and came in third. A few days later there was a rematch: 25 yards, this time on grass. I lost, because I stepped in a chipmunk hole; the little bastard dug two holes six inches apart. I’m working towards a third race, somewhere flat. Now that the state has taken away my driver’s licence and I have to walk everywhere, my legs are starting to round into shape. I’ll leave those shrimps in the dust.Actually, the state didn’t take away my licence. When I got notice that it would expire on my 98th birthday, I figured they would never give me a new one, so I sold my car. Then I found out that, in America anyway, they will renew your licence no matter how old you are, as long as you pay the fee. I went to get one, just for identification purposes. They asked if I wanted to renew it for six more years, but I only did two.I do miss my car. There was never a chance of me having an accident. Everybody got out of the way as soon as they saw me coming. I’m thinking about getting a golf cart instead.Lately, I’ve been looking into medications for memory loss. I can’t recall what I had for lunch, but I can clearly remember things that happened 90 years ago, like the fight between Florence Parker and Sylvia Needles on the lawn of the Methodist church. That’s where all the kids went to fight, because it had a nice grassy lawn. Kids seemed to fight a lot back then.But the doctors say the medication route is not promising; they say it’s a waste of money. What they recommend is exercise, and a good diet.I think fear is the greatest problem of the elderly. It prevents you from doing the things you like doing. I used to be a distance swimmer, racing across harbours all over the state, but now I swim only where I can touch the bottom. Lately, I’ve been swallowing water when I swim, so I started doing backstroke. It works fine, as long as I don’t swim into a boat.The point is not to worry about the fear too much: do as much as you can, and take advice from friends and relatives.Anyway, where was I?This is news to me. I can only imagine my father is referring to On A Girdle, by the English lyric poet Edmund Waller (1606-1687), which begins:“That which her slender waist confin’d,Shall now my joyful temples bind.”He’s right, though, it is brief: three stanzas, 12 lines, a mere 83 words in total."
My partner’s ex texts him every day. Should I be worried?,"People stay in touch with exes for all sorts of reasons. Some do it to bolster their ego, says Annalisa Barbieri",Annalisa Barbieri,2019-10-18T15:01:55+0100,"Two years ago, I started a relationship with a wonderful older man, but from the beginning something seemed a little off. After we celebrated our first anniversary, I had the shameful impulse to ask to see his phone. He agreed. There I saw what was bothering me: a previous girlfriend had been texting him every day, and he had been replying: photos, kiss emoticons, five-minute-long voice messages. It had been going on every day for the year we had been together.They apparently had an intense, somewhat problematic, two-year relationship, but she moved abroad. He says they were going to break up anyway. I felt they were being disrespectful towards me and towards themselves, putting all this energy into something that had theoretically ended and not allowing new relationships to fully blossom. He said they texted because they remained good friends, that’s all. That is hard for me to believe. He said he was not aware this could be so damaging to me. He told me he had stopped messaging her so often and that, for him, it made no difference.A year has passed and everything is great. However, I still have moments of doubt. He travels a lot and works in the same field as his ex, sometimes travelling to the same places. I can’t help but imagine emotionally charged encounters, if not more. Does my insecurity have some sort of foundation, or I am making a bit too much of this?I wonder what made you ask to see his phone after a year? And I wonder what made you write now?I think we can become insecure when we know something’s not right, and that some people make us feel more insecure than others. We tend to lack confidence in situations, or people, when we feel information is being withheld and we don’t know the full story – so we fill in the gaps with our own imagination.I would have liked to know a bit more about your past relationships and if you’ve always been like this. If so, then it’s worth looking at why relationships make you feel insecure. Or maybe this is your first serious relationship and you don’t have exes, so you can’t understand why people stay in touch with theirs. When I found out my first boyfriend still occasionally saw his ex, I couldn’t understand why, either. But people stay in touch with exes for all sorts of reasons, some of them benign and some not so much. Some people like to have their exes on the back-burner to bolster their ego. I’ve known men like that.Five-minute-long voice messages and texts every day is quite a commitment, however: does he lavish the same attention on all his friends? What’s the context? I’m also intrigued that he’s older, has experience of relationships, but doesn’t seem to think that being in touch with his ex might bother you. Plus, so much texting yet it “made no difference to him”? Then why do it? I think he’s being disingenuous.Gavin de Becker writes (brilliant, fascinating) books about how we ignore our intuition, often to our detriment. It has made me realise the power of intuition, which social conditioning has largely taught us to ignore for fear of seeming silly or paranoid. We don’t feel we can trust our instincts, so often look for proof instead – as you did with your boyfriend’s phone.In De Becker’s book The Gift Of Fear, he writes about giving a talk and asking how many people in the audience had children. Then he asked: “How many of you have left your children with a babysitter?” And finally he asked: “How many of you aren’t absolutely sure about your babysitter?” A few hands went up. So he said: “What are you doing here? Go home.”This isn’t really about who your boyfriend is in contact with or not; it’s about the fact that you feel something isn’t quite right. Pay attention to that feeling and explore it. There may be nothing going on, or you may just feel doubtful about him and have pegged all those doubts on to this one thing. For this relationship to have a future, you need to be able to trust him with your fears and know he will try to understand them; he should not only respect them, he should assuage them. A relationship where you doubt both him and yourself will eventually exhaust you. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

'My daughter wants me to respect her – and I secretly do',Coco Khan’s mother shares her thoughts on millennials,,2019-10-18T14:00:54+0100,"Being a parent, and a Muslim Asian in London, I have many thoughts about the younger generation. When I think of the millennials, I think of my daughter, Coco. She is a true example of her speedy generation, living in a society that no longer considers patience as a virtue. She values self-sufficiency and independence more than the old-fashioned ideas of obedience and respect for her elders. She finds no logic in respecting someone who is arrogant and unkind, just because he or she is 20 years her senior. She thinks this is illogical and, maybe, “typically Asian”.I was brought up in a different world. Elders were obeyed without question. By the time my children became teenagers, I’d figured out that to get respect, I would have to prove to them that I know what I’m talking about. That’s why I enrolled in college. (I embarrassed my son by going to the same one as him.)Now the children are grown, they want me to respect them (which I secretly do). My millennial daughter believes in equality, and I admire that. She is truthful and assertive, and she really loves cats.The older generation has a lot to catch up on: we can do so by gaining more education, learning about technology and engaging in social media. On the other hand, young people must find time for their parents, to help bridge the gap. I read that, in 2013, China ordered children to visit their ageing parents, or face a fine or jail. It was heartbreaking that they needed to.Maybe our generations are not so different. Plato wrote, 2,300 years ago: “What’s happening to our young people? They disrespect their elders, they disobey their parents. They ignore the law. They riot in the streets, inflamed with wild notions. Their morals are decaying. What is to become of them?” And that sounds very familiar."
'I’m cursed with a sporty family': keeping up with my Ironmum,"While I binge on crisps, watching Love Island, my 65-year-old mother collects triathlon trophies and snorkels in bogs. Can I ever keep up?",Joe Stone,2019-10-18T12:00:54+0100,"At midday on 9 June this year, my 64-year-old mother was approaching the halfway point of her second Ironman triathlon. I, meanwhile, was eating breakfast in bed (three packets of Quavers, white chocolate Magnum), too hungover to open both eyes at once. We’d both dedicated our weekends to testing the limits of human endurance. It’s just that I’d done so at a festival for gays, watching Samantha Mumba announce, “I refuse to leave this stage without acknowledging Martha P Johnson”, before dropping that train of thought as quickly as it arrived and launching into her 2000 banger Body II Body.I’m cursed with belonging to a sporty family. It’s not that I am particularly unathletic, more electively idle – a condition that is thrown into sharp relief by the attention-seeking antics of my mother, who once ran 100 miles over the Himalayas in five days, and brother, who has won three cycling gold medals at the Paralympics. Next to them, perfectly reasonable activities – such as eating five Creme Eggs in the bath while listening to Stevie Nicks – begin to look lazy or unwholesome.Mum has exercised compulsively for as long as I can remember, first swimming, then running, then running marathons. She is not great at directions, so schoolmates would report opening their curtains on winter mornings to be greeted by the sight of her jogging through their garden in a sports bra and head torch, trying to locate a footpath. There was even a short-lived foray into bog snorkelling; she came 13th in the world championships, neglecting to mention that only 14 people had been mad enough to enter. But things stepped up several gears when she discovered the fitness app Strava. Instead of encouraging people to compare their children (Facebook) or thigh gaps (Instagram), Strava tracks users’ run and cycle times and ranks them against others who have downloaded the app. To say that Strava ignited Mum’s competitive spirit would be like saying Donald Trump doesn’t love the people of Mexico.Once a year I do a day of gym classes with Mum as a kind of annual MOT; if I don’t die, I consider myself to have passedThe app compares your performance across a number of metrics, including age and gender, meaning there is always plenty of urgent data that Mum wants to discuss. A number of missed calls at an unsociable hour used to indicate a family tragedy. Now, it means Mum has won a Strava trophy (she’s in the top 10 fastest women to have completed a particular segment of a race) or – better yet – a “Queen of the Mountain” crown (she is number one, the fastest of all). When she’s displaced from the top spot, lunches are abandoned and conversations halted mid-flow, so that she can rush out on her bike and attempt to reclaim her crown. On a cycling holiday in Colombia, she instructed one of the men to race just ahead of her in order to decrease wind resistance and unseat a rival on the app. “After we finished, we couldn’t get wifi for a couple of hours,” she told me. “It was a tense afternoon.” I could imagine.My sister’s lack of interest in Mum’s analytics is so violent that she has placed restrictions on how much Strava chat she’ll tolerate (three minutes before she hangs up). I try to be more encouraging, and even joined Mum on a run as she trained for her latest Ironman. I managed 8k, prompting frenzied claims from her that I could probably run a marathon if I trained really hard. Perhaps I could, but what would be the long game? A plastic medal and a JustGiving page to make my colleagues hate me?Maybe my problem is that a lifetime surrounded by Lycra has rendered sporting achievements unremarkable – encouraging the mistaken belief that I could probably run 100 miles over the Himalayas, too, if only I weren’t so well-balanced. The only sportsperson I’ve ever truly admired is the Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon, and that’s mostly because of a competition where he refused to skate and instead lip-synched to his own heavily Auto-Tuned version of a Rihanna song. Don’t try and tell me that’s less iconic than traditional sporting achievements such as running fast or jumping high.That’s not to say I never exercise. I’ve been known to slutdrop to Little Mix for upwards of five hours at a time, and I cycle to work, inspiring one editor to remark (quite unkindly) that she’d seen me “wobbling along the canal”. Once a year, when I go home for Christmas, I do a day of gym classes with my mum as a kind of annual MOT; if I don’t die, I consider myself to have passed.I briefly abandoned this homeopathic approach to physical activity in 2017, when a stranger at a house party prodded my belly and told me to “suck it in”. After I’d disposed of his body, I embarked on one of those 12-week transformations that you see advertised on the bus. When the trainer asked me my fitness goal, I said it was to look like Tom Daley, but aged 13, because I wanted to manage expectations. For the next three months I subsisted on dry chicken and rice cakes, going to the gym every evening and dreaming of Minstrels every night. By the second month I was so immune to discomfort that I dislocated my shoulder while using a dumbbell and popped it back into the socket myself. In my protein shake-addled mind I’d become He-Man, minus the Anna Wintour bob.For someone who sits at a desk all day, it felt good to challenge myself in a way that wasn’t seeing how many packets of crisps I could eat during a single episode of Love Island Australia. But when the 12 weeks ended, I immediately degenerated into my old ways. Exercising every day hadn’t given me more energy, or filled me with endorphins, or made me look like Brad Pitt in Fight Club – it had just driven me dangerously close to becoming the kind of person who posts changing room selfies. Faced with such a sobering prospect, I gave up. Perhaps my mistake was being motivated by vanity alone, whereas my mum is driven by a higher cause: her own immortality.This year she turned 65, moving her up an age category at events, and so increasing her chances of winning competitions. “It feels like a landmark age,” she told me, “and rather than be defined as someone old, I want to be defined as someone who wins medals.” She’s never been massively tactful (on my boyfriend: “You’re better-looking, but he’s a nicer person”), and in recent years I’ve watched her grow increasingly frustrated with some of her peers. “They’re boring,” she complains whenever she meets someone new. “All they want to talk about is their ailments.” These days, she prefers going on group holidays where the average person is 20 years younger, and upending their expectations of what a grandmother on a bike looks like. In the end, perhaps we’re both motivated by the same spirit of rebellion. As a pensioner, Mum isn’t expected to be hitting the gym five times a week. As a young-ish gay man, I emphatically am.Watching her compete, I feel proud. But also grateful to have been spared whichever gene compels you to snorkel in a bog.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."
A letter to… my teenage son,‘You will live for ever with the memory of your dad dying just before you turned 11’: the letter you always wanted to write,,2019-10-19T06:45:16+0100,"At 17 years old, you are getting ready for your first big night out and you are looking for a tie. Proudly, I tell you that I have some of your dad’s, hung up in the wardrobe alongside his best suit.“Why are you keeping a dead man’s suit?” you mock.I had always imagined that, in the same way I was curious about my mum’s wedding dress, you might want to try on your dad’s suit. But, as ever, I could not be more wrong, and my head and heart retreat into a black hole of shame, guilt and inadequacy.Even though I know I can never be, I have tried to be both mum and dad, but so often I fail. I know I am not always the one you want or need, that I cannot and never will be enough. I am a hopeless driving instructor and know nothing of cars. If your dad were here, he would do it so much better.I know I frustrate you when I fret and worry about safety, your lack of fear, your fragile confidence and vulnerability as a new driver. But I am your mum, and that is my job. Your dad was so cool. I know and I am sorry.And now your 18th birthday is imminent. Birthdays are always a tricky time and you will live for ever with the memory of your dad dying just before you turned 11. Today, for some reason, I remember the suit. Taking the heavy, now musty-smelling, dust covered bag from the wardrobe, I unzip it, revealing the dark blue wool garment that fitted your dad so perfectly.As I lay it on the bed, tears come. Do you remember the rare occasions when he wore it to work? We would tease him that he was off to be a grown-up for the day.Another twist of my bruised heart and it is time to let another bit of your dad go. I imagine your bewilderment and teenage revulsion as I lie on the bed to have one last cuddle (“Mum that is soooo creepy”). Please allow me one final trip down memory lane, to picture him: awkward, uncomfortable, but just a little bit sexy with his hippy hair and greying, unshaven profile.But the suit is empty, limp, old and out of fashion, and the smell of him no longer lingers. He is gone.Charity shop it is, then. After all, you have no need of a dead man’s suit. You are your own man now.• We will pay £25 for every letter we publish.

A letter to... my unloving adoptive dad,‘I wonder now whether you secretly resented me’: the letter you always wanted to write,,2019-10-12T06:07:44+0100,"I don’t think you ever really wanted children. But they were important to my mother, and you loved her very much.Parents who adopted children in the 60s were given no advice on how to care for their new babies. It was considered enough that the couple were married and respectable, and you ticked all the boxes. So when a sick, screaming six-week-old arrived in your suburban house, it must have been a shock. My mother rose to the occasion. Unfortunately, this was not how you imagined your child would be. And it was only to get worse.I was loud and lively; you were quiet and studious. The door to your study was closed, and I was told not to bother you.At the age of six, my mother told me that my real mother had been unable to keep me. I was secretly petrified that it was only a matter of time before my new parents would feel the same and give me away. I became even more boisterous, seeking attention to validate my place.When I was older, my mother told me that it was her fault you couldn’t have children, that she had suffered an early menopause. Over 40 years later, I gained access to my adoption file and found out the truth. You were diagnosed with almost complete aspermia, a failure to produce sperm, which meant it was highly unlikely you could father children. Did you ask my mother to take the blame to protect your male pride, or did she offer, knowing how fragile your ego was? I wonder now whether you secretly resented me for being a constant public reminder of what you were unable to do.One thing I know for sure is that your ego caused the distance between us. You not only wanted a daughter who was like you; you wanted a daughter who would admire your carefully constructed academic persona; who was meek and mild, and easily moulded. You needed to be right, and I made you wrong. During one of our frequent arguments, you pushed me up against a wall and shouted in my face: “You are the only reason your mother and I argue!”I can see now that we craved the same thing – to be admired for who we were and what we had achieved. I also wanted to feel loved. Maybe you did, too. On your deathbed, I told you I loved you. “That’s nice,” you said. It seems we disappointed each other right to the end.• We will pay £25 for every letter we publish. Email family@theguardian.com, including your address and phone number.

A letter to… the man on the train who smiled through my baby's tantrum,"‘When she shrieked, you didn’t look at me as if I was failing as a mother; instead I saw empathy in your eyes’: the letter you always wanted to write",,2019-10-05T06:45:36+0100,"You’ve probably forgotten all about what I am now calling “that incident where Harmie properly lost her wotsit on the train”. But you made a big difference to me.You had the misfortune of being allocated a seat opposite us on the 15.17 from Birmingham New Street to Penzance. After shuffling into the carriage with a baby and enough bags to sink a small ship, I made a quick assessment of the situation. I admit to being hugely judgmental. I made a snapshot decision that the middle-aged lady next to you would understand if Harmie was unsettled, but that you might not.It soon became apparent that Harmie had had enough of being sociable. She really wasn’t fussed who knew that she was thoroughly fed up. In fact, the whole carriage was soon in no doubt.My earlier assumption that the lady next to you would be of some reassurance was quickly quashed. She avoided eye contact and remained deadpan. However, you smiled and attempted to engage with the now squirming bundle of noise on my lap. Harmie wasn’t going to be calmed by your waving or kind words, but you certainly made me feel less uncomfortable.When the rumblings turned into inconsolable shrieking, I realised that I had nowhere to go. The train was packed and the aisle was full of passengers standing – an aisle full of people who now had front row seats to the plot being well and truly lost. As she ramped up another notch, I felt hot tears stinging my eyes.Then you said that you had two girls and another baby on the way. You continued to smile. Continued to try to win over my not-so-joyous bundle of joy. You didn’t look at me as if I was failing as a mother; instead I saw empathy in your eyes. In that moment I felt that maybe I could get through this after all.I still felt the hot creeping shame overwhelm me when the tweed-coated man began to clap in the two minutes that Harmie was catching her breath, ready for her next onslaught. But I didn’t feel so alone.So thank you, for making an unbearable journey a little bit less so. For enabling me to have the courage to smile, shrug and apologise to the rest of the carriage as we finally made our hasty exit. Thank you for making me feel less alone. And for helping me to realise that, actually, we are all in this parenting club together.• Helly Westwood blogs at fledglingflamingos.co.uk/. We will pay £25 for every letter we publish.

A letter to… our friends who share autism success stories,"‘These stories don’t show the child who is non-verbal, who screams and growls for hours on end and attacks his or her parents on a daily basis’: the letter you always wanted to write",,2019-09-28T06:45:59+0100,"At least once a week, for the past five years, well-meaning friends have sent me a “success story” about a child or adult with autism. I also often read similar stories in the media. They are always inspiring, with their descriptions of how people don’t let autism define them or hold them back. With each story, I’ve grown sadder and angrier.Seeing autism presented at all in the mainstream media is incredible, but it’s always the shiny side: a child is a musical genius or, after many years of setbacks, an adult has completed a law degree. While these are things to be celebrated, it makes it even harder for families like mine to be accepted in public. It makes the “Oh, he’s autistic” explanation sound like an excuse, because people haven’t seen the other side of the spectrum.They haven’t seen the child who is nonverbal, who doesn’t understand a word you say, who screams and growls for hours on end, the child who needs locks on all the doors and windows, and still needs a pram and reins if we attempt to go outside. They haven’t seen the child who attacks his or her parents and loved ones on a daily basis – because there’s been a slight change in their routine and they can’t find a way to process it.We have both ends of the spectrum in our house; each comes with its challenges and delights. We love our children unconditionally, but we’re isolated, alone and often excluded from so-called “autism-friendly sessions” at play places. They just don’t cater to the autism that we know. Their version of accessible is to dim the lights a bit and lower the music when they play games. Our version would be to have no escape routes and a maximum of three other children present.We realise that businesses can’t cater for these requirements, but nothing makes us feel more alone than reading about “autism-friendly” places and knowing that they are still not suitable for us. I believe that if the other end of the spectrum were depicted more honestly, the world would adapt and try new things.For once I’d love to see a story that celebrated a child managing to say “drink”, rather than screaming for two hours. That’s our idea of success.For now, we feel like a tiny voice in a crowd of millions of happier people.• We will pay £25 for every letter we publish.

When young cousins come to blows…,A little dust-up between cousins at nappy-change time is a reminder of the real virtues of family,Séamas O’Reilly,2019-10-13T09:00:21+0100,"It wasn’t a particularly hard smack. His fists are small, doughy things; fat and soft with dimples for knuckles, sunken into the flesh like the buttons of a sofa cushion. But it was a low blow, against his own cousin, and while she was having her nappy changed, no less. Even the most unreasonable prize fighter would never hit an opponent while they were lying down and, though I’ve never checked, I imagine that rule would count doubly if they were having their arse cleaned.We had taken the boy to stay with his cousins, Ardal and Nora, last week. My son is the baby of the entire family, so all his cousins fawn over him, despite being only negligibly older themselves. At just under two, Nora is the second youngest, an incorrigibly sweet-natured girl with a blazing smile and a mop of tight blonde curls, yet she acts like she’s never seen something so delightfully childish as my son in her long and storied life.The 162-day head-start she has on him has bred a certain airy superiority – a bit like that you get from being four episodes ahead of your friend in a true crime podcast, wincing each time they say they still suspect the boyfriend.I loved growing up in a big family, and spending time with his 14 cousins allows my son to experience the best bits of that experience without me having to sire a dozen kids myself. And he’s a fan of the hand-me-downs he gets by way of Lego, jumpers and wellies. Alas, he’s less fond of our attention being divided while babysitting, and this trip led to his first fight. My wife had been tending to Nora’s nappy when the smack happened, as he’d crawled across the room in a fit of jealousy and slapped his cousin’s head.It was startling to see his frowning little face and Nora’s sense of betrayal; to see the fury in his eyes when we remonstrated with him. Parenting often forces you to inhabit your child’s emotions, to learn or relearn some long-lost state, of sheer joy, unbridled excitement, devastating loss – some emotion you haven’t felt for 30 years, present once more. Here was rage, pure and simple. And then, minutes later, they’d made up as if nothing had happened.As much as I recall those fights, I also remember them not meaning much for very long. I’m used to extolling the virtues of family as being those of togetherness. But that’s forgetting its hidden treasures; the thousand dry runs it allows you for antisocial behaviour, a place where you can do and say stupid, hurtful things in a controlled environment, suffer the consequences, and still be friends a few minutes later. This, the chance to cannon around the house like a rabble of inter-personal crash test dummies, is the true benefit of family. The wellies and Lego are just a bonus.Follow Séamas on Twitter @shockproofbeats"
"The grief over my daughter's suicide never ends, but I can help other junior doctors","As a doctor myself I know how isolating this job can be, which is why I am raising awareness of mental wellbeing at my trust",,2019-10-10T10:32:52+0100,"I first heard of my daughter Lauren’s disappearance in the early hours of the morning on 1 March 2017. Her car was found abandoned near a beach in Devon after she had been reported missing from her job in the A&E department of a NHS trust.I remember suddenly feeling old, helpless and awfully afraid. Lauren was 26 and in her third year as a junior doctor in the south-west of England; I am a senior hospital doctor, approaching retirement and working in the midlands. It took only days to come to the inescapable but shocking conclusion that Lauren had taken her own life. Something I thought was unthinkable and only happened to other people had happened to me.In the weeks afterward a new normality emerged from the unbearable and primal pain of the first few days – there are only so many nights you can lie, awake and crying, before exhaustion brings relief. Messages of support and sympathy arrived by text and WhatsApp; I was swathed in goodwill and empathy by family, friends and colleagues. I wondered why and how someone successful, solvent, resilient and outwardly happy could reach such a state of despair. How did I, her father, not know that Lauren was in such a dark and hopeless place? She was resilient, but resilience alone cannot counter the isolation and depression that comes from the repeated hits of inflexible rotas, hostile working environments and assaults by patients.From the moment they start, all newly qualified doctors encounter sexism, racism and verbal, physical and sexual abuse, as well as extremes of distress, rage and despair. They are in a highly stressful working environment where mistakes may prove fatal to their patients and career.Young trainees are individuals with differing life experiences, resulting in varying strengths and vulnerabilities; some will need shielding from certain situations at the start of their careers. If we are lucky enough to identify someone in a crisis we should not merely signpost the route to help, but guide and accompany them along the path to recovery.I returned to work after three months. Being involved in healthcare has given me a feeling of legitimacy in being able to comment on the welfare and mental wellbeing issues facing junior doctors in general, and Lauren in particular.Prompted by my own experience and other junior doctor suicides, colleagues and I constructed a wellbeing and resilience training day for foundation year doctors at our trust. It was delivered by senior doctors with a responsibility and interest in junior doctor training and supervision, and was quite separate from the already congested induction programme. I introduced them to Lauren through a video telling her story. Then there were lectures and roleplay sessions about coping with stress and talking about mental health and suicide.Feedback has been very positive – one person told us: “Thank you for caring.” Most importantly, we are raising awareness of the importance of mental wellbeing among all our new starters and enlisting their help. They are the ones best placed to recognise peers who are struggling, to ask whether they are thinking about suicide, and to offer their hand in friendship. If we can only equip them to make that approach and ask that vital question, then nobody need die believing they are worthless, beyond help, a burden, or that no one cares. We are the caring profession and we can do this.I do feel optimistic for the future. There has been an increase in media coverage of mental health issues in the past 12-18 months. Royals, athletes and celebrities have spoken openly and frankly about their struggles with mental health, which has helped to raise awareness and reduce stigma. The topics of wellbeing and mindfulness are addressed in leading medical journals, and major conferences include sessions and workshops around mental welfare and supporting those in difficulty. There is a real recognition that this is a subject that has been largely overlooked in the past, and there is an urgency to do something about it.In my trust, World Mental Health Day is being marked with talks, stands and people who can tell employees what help is available locally and nationally to maintain their mental health. I have just completed my mental health first aid training (provided free by the trust), and have already had enquiries from colleagues asking how they can apply. Life will always be less certain than it was, more fragile and of diminished value. It is a path I tread warily. Every day I yearn to see Lauren again. Two and a half years on, the grief is unending.The British Medical Association offers free, confidential support to doctors and medical students on 0330 123 1245.

The 12-week pregnancy rule makes the pain of miscarriage worse,"The secrecy around early pregnancy means that many women grieve in private, weighed down by feelings of guilt and failure",Katy Lindemann,2019-10-07T08:00:42+0100,"Most of us will be familiar with the “12-week” rule – the longstanding social convention that dictates that women mustn’t tell anyone they’re pregnant before the 12-week mark, “in case something happens”. It’s time to talk about the insidious effect it has on women who suffer a miscarriage early in their pregnancy.An estimated 650 babies are miscarried every day in the UK, with the vast majority occurring during the first trimester. Most of these losses will be suffered in silence, because it’s considered so socially unacceptable to reveal that you’re pregnant before 12 weeks – let alone that you were pregnant, but now you’re not. It’s baffling that in 2019 we seem so wedded to an anachronistic superstition about tempting fate that shames women into keeping quiet and heaps blame on the woman who dares to “tell” and subsequently loses her baby – as though we were still in a bygone era where the stigma of miscarrying could mark you out as cursed. Social mores around the 12-week rule are brimming with contradictions: it’s fine to broadcast the minutiae of our daily lives on Instagram, yet disclosing that we’re pregnant, even just to close friends and family, is somehow transgressive.As a result, the first trimester is a sort of Schrödinger’s pregnancy: you’re legitimately pregnant when it comes to dos and don’ts such as taking folic acid, but if you miscarry you’re often told that it wasn’t a “real” pregnancy anyway. Before I went to the operating theatre to have my dead baby surgically removed from my uterus, a nurse remarked that until the invention of home pregnancy tests, most women probably wouldn’t have known they were pregnant at that stage, and would have assumed their miscarriage was a heavy period.While it’s certainly thanks to modern ultrasound technology that my husband and I had seen our baby’s beautiful heartbeat twice before I miscarried, a host of early pregnancy symptoms and having to pass a not-insubstantial gestational sac would probably have tipped me off.We’re often told that miscarriages are no big deal because they’re really common; so is divorce, but you don’t often hear anyone say, “Sorry your husband left you – but it’s really common, and you can always get married again.” Yet for something so common, it can feel so incredibly lonely, precisely because the 12-week rule perpetuates the notion that early pregnancy loss is something to hide and we shouldn’t make a fuss.This establishes a hierarchy of grief determined by the stage of gestation, that glibly dismisses early miscarriages as “just a ball of cells”, deeming only later losses worthy of mourning. But the meaning of any pregnancy is deeply personal, and we can’t neatly fit the impact of losing it in its own discrete box. Ellie Jesky experienced miscarriages on both sides of the 12-week line. “The moment you get that positive test, however much you know that it’s precarious and that things can go wrong, it’s your baby,” she told me. “You plan and imagine what their life will be like. And then when that’s totally ripped away in an instant it’s a genuine loss, regardless of how far along.”The 12-week rule perpetuates the notion that early pregnancy loss is something to hide and we shouldn’t make a fuss.The consequence of this culture of secrecy and lack of compassionate discussion is that many women grieve for their miscarriages in the shadows, weighed down by heavy feelings of guilt and failure. Desperate for answers beyond unsatisfactory explanations such as “it’s just one of those things”, “it’s nature’s way”, or “it wasn’t meant to be”, we’ll seize upon any excuse to blame ourselves. Most early losses are due to chromosomal abnormalities; but according to Prof Arri Coomarasamy, director of Tommy’s National Centre for Miscarriage Research, fewer than half of women who suffer repeated miscarriages ever find out why.The decision about how, when and if we share our experiences of fertility, pregnancy and loss should be a personal choice, not an enforced obligation. Miscarriage will always be a sad reality in many people’s lives, but greater understanding and empathy could alleviate much of this pain.We’re starting to see more open discussion around miscarriage in public discourse. I’m hopeful that the more comfortably we can each own our story the more we’ll feel empowered to seek support when we suffer losses at any stage of pregnancy. “Even if we can’t cure miscarriage,” says Dr Jessica Zucker, a psychologist specialising in women’s reproductive health and creator of the #IHadaMiscarriage campaign, “why don’t we at least attempt to cure the conversation?”• Katy Lindemann is author of a forthcoming book that shares real women’s stories about the emotional experience of infertility and pregnancy loss"
"Lost bears, lost causes and a trip to the library","For the sake of my sanity, we urgently need a new favourite book for my son",Séamas O’Reilly,2019-10-06T09:00:21+0100,"I took my son to the library for the first time last week. This wasn’t so much for his benefit as my own. Despite his newfound passion for story time, he has no real desire for more books, since he would happily hear one in particular until the end of time. No longer does he seek the narrative heft of Happy Dog Sad Dog, nor the earth-shattering revelations of What’s This on the Farm? for he has become hopelessly infatuated with a new favourite, a desultory effort about a runaway bear.I’d always, quite bravely, said the Nazis were wrong for banning books. Even their reasoning – that indecent literature could warp your mind, or inspire evil in a well-balanced reader – seemed absurd. I now know it makes a kind of sense, because if I read this book one more time I will break into a zoo and head-butt every last bear I find. I hate this book with a passion that frightens me, and I hate the runaway bear himself most of all. If he was my bear and he ran away from home, I’d throw a street party. Its asinine plot and feckless protagonist have no such effect on my son, however, who will drag it to be read 20 times a day.For the sake of my sanity I buried it under a heap of toys and took him to the library to expand his collection. I felt a surge of guilt as I walked in because, like so many who love the idea of libraries, I haven’t used them much since smartphones were invented.I spent a great deal of my childhood in libraries and was delighted to find certain truths remain comfortingly universal – carpet tiles so well-trodden they might as well be lino, arrestingly artful bubble writing in the handmade shelf displays and, of course, the ancient lore of librarian staff… For every two or three pleasant employees there is one who is incoherently furious that people keep coming into their place of work and, rudest of all, reading the books therein.So it was that Todd, all sweetness and light, showed me where the newest picture books were, the best place to pop my pram, and where the little toys might be found. It was left to his colleague Agnes to scowl at me when I asked for a pen, to sneer at my son like he was a stranded, foam-mouthed rottweiler, and to monitor my itinerary around the shelves as if I might, any minute now, pause by the Mystery section and start recruiting for Isis. It was, in short, a little slice of heaven. We left with eight books, a brochure for a culture evening we will not attend, and – joy of joys – Agnes’s last pen.Back home, I produced our dragon’s hoard of new literature for my son, who took one look and, straight away, began rummaging through his canvas box to find his favourite. His little friend has run away again, it seems, and we will all have to bear it a little longer still.Follow Séamas on Twitter @shockproofbeats"
Hillary Clinton said it was 'gutsy' to stay with Bill but what did she mean? It's complicated,How a marriage should be conducted can only be known by the key participants – and they might not even be in agreement,Jean Hannah Edelstein,2019-10-02T18:50:45+0100,"Hillary Clinton has a deep well to draw from when asked about the challenges she’s faced. But her admission yesterday that staying in her marriage was the “gutsiest” thing that she’s done in her personal life was remarkable. In part, remarkable because over the years she’s stayed pretty quiet when it comes to discussing being married to one of the world’s most exposed philanderers, only occasionally alluding to what must have been some very painful experiences. In part, remarkable because who doesn’t like a glimpse into what makes a well-known marriage tick?As a central and defining arrangement that so many diverse cultures have in common, marriage is a unique (and dare I say it, strange) institution. A public-facing framework for, well, feelings. While religious bodies, governments, society and your gossipy neighbors next door have long done their best to set clear rules around what marriage is and means, how a marriage should be conducted can only really be known and understood by the key participants – and they might not even be in agreement.(Ask my husband and I why we got married, and he’ll say ‘for love!’ and I’ll say ‘for health insurance! Also, love!’ )“Why do they stay together?” is a fun question to ask, because who doesn’t like to discuss the love lives of others? And of course they’re especially easy questions to ask about people in the public eye, whose lives we feel like we have access to, even as we don’t know what goes on when, say, they’re hanging out in their yoga pants in Westchester.The answers, if they’re not unknowable, are sometimes very unromantic. Sometimes the reasons why a couple stays together might feel a little bit icky, but if another person’s marriage makes you uncomfortable, that’s on you: you’re imagining how you would feel if you were in that marriage, rather than allowing the people in question to feel their own feelings. Our thresholds of acceptance and intolerance are so personal and complex. I’m sure that over the years a lot of people have regarded Clinton’s marriage and thought, “she should leave him”, while just as many have thought, “yes, that makes sense to me”.Does Hillary feel like a gutsy wife because she stayed in her marriage despite public exposure and disapproval? Maybe. It’s brave to withstand the pressure of public opinion. Or does she feel like a gutsy wife because she stayed married to a man who is difficult to be married to? It’s brave under any circumstances to commit yourself to sharing a life with another person, even when they do things that are not loving or kind.Maybe the gutsiest thing of all is to recognise how challenging it can sometimes be, to do it, and to not feel the need to explain."
The Guardian view on the People’s Republic of China at 70: whose history?,Seven decades of Communist rule have seen notable advances but at horrific cost,Editorial,2019-09-30T19:23:22+0100,"The 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, which will be marked on Tuesday by a mass military parade in the heart of Beijing, is less a historical commemoration than a political event. The Communist party of China (CPC) has understood the power of history ever since it seized the reins in 1949: in its earliest days, it encouraged citizens to “recall past bitterness”, to make the New China all the sweeter. Xi Jinping understands history’s importance better than any leader since Mao Zedong. Not long after taking power, he warned his colleagues that “historical nihilism” was an existential threat to the party’s rule on a par with western democracy.The tanks, planes, troops and missiles tell a story: in 1949, the republic’s 17 aircraft were ordered to fly over twice, to make the display look more impressive. This time the west will watch closely as the People’s Liberation Army unveils new missile, stealth and unmanned vehicle capabilities. The PRC has outlived its big brother, the Soviet Union, and outgrown western economies. Yet it now faces new challenges.Many in China are grateful for the party’s rule. It enjoys a level of support that many democratically elected governments would envy, and not only because of its mammoth propaganda and censorship apparatus. The last 70 years have seen extraordinary progress in lifespan, literacy and incomes: hundreds of millions are no longer living in poverty. Yet people were not lifted out of poverty; they worked their way out. The party banned the family tyranny of forced marriages, but brought the official tyranny of the one-child policy, and even now polices the womb. The advances came at a terrible and wholly unnecessary cost. The famine sparked by Mao’s Great Leap Forward took tens of millions of lives. Tens of millions more people were hounded in the Cultural Revolution.Even some of those worst affected see cause to celebrate today. Yet many in China are angry, cynical or despairing. The party-state’s cruelties are both vast and petty. In Xinjiang, perhaps 1.5 million Muslims are locked up in camps which the party euphemistically calls vocational training centres. Meanwhile a six-year-old boy is forced out of school because his father has sought to use China’s own law to uphold basic rights.The party-state’s embrace of pomp and majesty itself has a remarkably brittle quality. The military parade is by invitation only; nearby residents are under order to keep their curtains closed. Elderly “Tiananmen mothers” who lost their children in the brutal crackdown on pro-reform demonstrations in 1989 have police guarding their homes today.Since the massacre, the CPC has doubled down on “national education”, and the construction of a history in which its central role is not class struggle but putting an end to “national humiliation”. This narrative grows all the more important as the costs of spectacular economic growth – fractured families, grotesque corruption, inequality and environmental devastation – are succeeded by its slowing, and as conflict with the US looms large.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, a huge swathe of the population has shown that not everyone is grateful for the party-state’s rule. The 17-week-long protest movement, and the reaction to it, has in turn has boosted support for Taiwan’s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, in the upcoming elections – undermining Beijing’s hopes.Under these circumstances, the party is promoting its historical message more assiduously than ever, at a time which, though very different from the past, bears distinct echoes of it. The “people’s leader” has overseen growing repression, a resurgence of ideology, and is increasingly invoking the idea of struggle. China is seeking to reshape the international order once more. Xi is already looking ahead to the republic’s centenary, 30 years hence. Might another story be told by then?"
My role as chief storyteller to our son is being challenged,"I do accents, bulging eyes and giant hand gestures – but it’s time to up my thespian game",Séamas O’Reilly,2019-09-29T06:00:29+0100,"There are aspects of parenthood I could be better at. I’m forgetful (twice last week, I packed no nappies in his nursery bag) and selfish – I eat roughly 35% of the food I’m meant to feed him. But one thing I am ready for is story time. My voice-work is unparalleled, my back stories deep and weighted. I bulge my eyes and strain my neck as I inhabit a score of characters for my son’s delight. ‘The actor,’ wrote Lee Strasberg, ‘creates with his own flesh and blood all those things that the arts try to describe.’ It’s tragic he never got to see me do my version of Supertato, the masked vegetable superhero I consider my finest vocal realisation.Though not a reader per se, my son has a passion for books that has come on in leaps and bounds. More accurately, it’s come on in sprinting crawls, his doughy little paw holding whichever book he wants us to read just one or two or eight more times. I’m biased, of course, but he likes some pretty advanced stuff, particularly really boring dramas that are only interesting because they features an unlikely protagonist: a dinosaur loses his hat, a fire engine does its taxes, a moth deletes its Facebook account – that kind of thing. But he really likes those thick, hard little books for babies, squat and square like carpet-swatch booklets.You can tell the books he likes best because he will wear them to pieces until they hold together via individual atoms. Once square and regular, Happy Dog Sad Dog now hangs together like a collapsed Frank Gehry building. Just opening it propels the acrid disjecta of several previous meals into the air, and sends random pages clunking to the floor, like those magazine inserts for a wine club you’d like to think you’ll join, but never will.The only complication is my wife, who fancies herself a better storyteller than me, even though I’m an almost famous Twitter humorist, and she does some other job I’ve never really quite gathered in the 10 years I’ve been with her. (I want to say something to do with computers?) She’s taken to attacking these stories with a venom she doesn’t get from her daily life. (In accounting, maybe?) Either way, she’s working my side of the street and I don’t like it. ‘A scouse potato?’ I think. ‘Dear oh dear, what would Strasberg make of that?’My son is not yet sophisticated enough to spot this, and laps up her clearly inferior story times, leaving us in roughly equal esteem. Trapped in an endless stand-off of regional accents, giant gestures and screamed rhymes, we strive to be the one to whom he brings the next book, gesticulating until our veins pop. Now, if you’ll forgive me, I will take my leave. It’s not you I’m trying to impress, my son has returned and this maestro must take his place on stage.Follow Séamas on Twitter @shockproofbeats"
My partner’s ex texts him every day. Should I be worried?,"People stay in touch with exes for all sorts of reasons. Some do it to bolster their ego, says Annalisa Barbieri",Annalisa Barbieri,2019-10-18T15:01:55+0100,"Two years ago, I started a relationship with a wonderful older man, but from the beginning something seemed a little off. After we celebrated our first anniversary, I had the shameful impulse to ask to see his phone. He agreed. There I saw what was bothering me: a previous girlfriend had been texting him every day, and he had been replying: photos, kiss emoticons, five-minute-long voice messages. It had been going on every day for the year we had been together.They apparently had an intense, somewhat problematic, two-year relationship, but she moved abroad. He says they were going to break up anyway. I felt they were being disrespectful towards me and towards themselves, putting all this energy into something that had theoretically ended and not allowing new relationships to fully blossom. He said they texted because they remained good friends, that’s all. That is hard for me to believe. He said he was not aware this could be so damaging to me. He told me he had stopped messaging her so often and that, for him, it made no difference.A year has passed and everything is great. However, I still have moments of doubt. He travels a lot and works in the same field as his ex, sometimes travelling to the same places. I can’t help but imagine emotionally charged encounters, if not more. Does my insecurity have some sort of foundation, or I am making a bit too much of this?I wonder what made you ask to see his phone after a year? And I wonder what made you write now?I think we can become insecure when we know something’s not right, and that some people make us feel more insecure than others. We tend to lack confidence in situations, or people, when we feel information is being withheld and we don’t know the full story – so we fill in the gaps with our own imagination.I would have liked to know a bit more about your past relationships and if you’ve always been like this. If so, then it’s worth looking at why relationships make you feel insecure. Or maybe this is your first serious relationship and you don’t have exes, so you can’t understand why people stay in touch with theirs. When I found out my first boyfriend still occasionally saw his ex, I couldn’t understand why, either. But people stay in touch with exes for all sorts of reasons, some of them benign and some not so much. Some people like to have their exes on the back-burner to bolster their ego. I’ve known men like that.Five-minute-long voice messages and texts every day is quite a commitment, however: does he lavish the same attention on all his friends? What’s the context? I’m also intrigued that he’s older, has experience of relationships, but doesn’t seem to think that being in touch with his ex might bother you. Plus, so much texting yet it “made no difference to him”? Then why do it? I think he’s being disingenuous.Gavin de Becker writes (brilliant, fascinating) books about how we ignore our intuition, often to our detriment. It has made me realise the power of intuition, which social conditioning has largely taught us to ignore for fear of seeming silly or paranoid. We don’t feel we can trust our instincts, so often look for proof instead – as you did with your boyfriend’s phone.In De Becker’s book The Gift Of Fear, he writes about giving a talk and asking how many people in the audience had children. Then he asked: “How many of you have left your children with a babysitter?” And finally he asked: “How many of you aren’t absolutely sure about your babysitter?” A few hands went up. So he said: “What are you doing here? Go home.”This isn’t really about who your boyfriend is in contact with or not; it’s about the fact that you feel something isn’t quite right. Pay attention to that feeling and explore it. There may be nothing going on, or you may just feel doubtful about him and have pegged all those doubts on to this one thing. For this relationship to have a future, you need to be able to trust him with your fears and know he will try to understand them; he should not only respect them, he should assuage them. A relationship where you doubt both him and yourself will eventually exhaust you. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

I can only climax from oral or manual stimulation. Is this normal?,"I enjoy sex, and have had long-term partners, but I have never experienced an orgasm from penetration",Pamela Stephenson Connolly,2019-10-22T08:00:59+0100,"I’m a 35-year-old woman and have never been able to orgasm from penetration. I have had a few partners, some long-term, and I enjoy sex, but can only climax from oral/manual stimulation. Is this normal? Sometimes it’s hard to explain to a partner that I do enjoy it if they do it right (they think there’s something wrong with them or me if I don’t climax from penetration). And sometimes with a newer partner I’m too embarrassed to ask for what I really need. But I don’t want to fake it.For you – and for most women – the most heightened sensations of sexual pleasure emanate from stimulation of your clitoris. Vaginal penetration will only bring you to orgasm if the nerve endings in your clitoris are sufficiently engaged. But many people do not know this, and the politics of sex and gender have meant that incorrect beliefs have prevailed, and feelings of inferiority and frustration remain widespread. There is nothing wrong with you; your sexual response is completely normative. From now on, take charge of your pleasure. Try to find ways to receive more direct clitoral stimulation during intercourse, perhaps manually (your partner’s hand or yours) or through experimenting with different positions, styles or toys. But if you prefer, just relax and allow yourself to be brought to orgasm separately the way you like. Educate your partners and show them exactly what you need. In most cases they will be grateful for the clear instruction, and you will more profoundly appreciate them – and yourself.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

I can’t come to terms with my boyfriend’s female friendships,"You must master your jealously or it will play havoc with your relationship, says Mariella Frostrup",Mariella Frostrup,2019-10-20T07:30:50+0100,"The dilemma My partner of three years sent a female colleague a pornographic joke, and I can’t get over it. He said they’ve been friends since school days, but it doesn’t sit right with me. He can’t explain why he did it, apart from banter, and he thought she would find it funny. He’s said it won’t happen again and he made an error of judgment. Ten days before this he invited a female golfing colleague to his house for a curry (albeit with his male lodger). It sends out the wrong message, and if he feels this is acceptable, what else is he capable of? My mind is running riot. I know I have trust issues – my ex was unfaithful at least six times, and the reason I found out about the pornographic text was because I checked his phone. He’s the love of my life and he feels the same. There has always been strong chemistry between us and I don’t want to let my past get in the way, but I’m really struggling.Mariella replies Poor you. Having endured the ravages of paranoid (and sometimes not so paranoid) jealousy in my youth, I know how agonising it can be. Luckily, it’s a debilitating condition that most of us manage to control over time. Allowed to flourish, jealousy becomes your master, sapping emotional energy and any hope of happiness.Last time I checked, a romantic union is sustained on the basis of mutual trust and desire. No partnership can survive the scrutiny, strictures and control you’re enforcing. This will lead to the very deceit you’re fearful of, based on the reasonable desire on your partner’s part to have freedom of choice when it comes to his friendships. Hooking up isn’t about placing your beloved in lockdown. It’s about finding someone you can open up to, who enhances your life experience and whom you place in pole position in your affections. That doesn’t mean they should enter a state of purdah, curtail all encounters with the opposite sex, strike friends bearing proscribed genitalia from their address book and only make single-sex social engagements.Risqué jokes and a curry are not the cliff edge of salacityWe know that love is an irrational collision of pheromones and feelings, an arbitrary emotional reaction to another human being. Jealousy is also irrational, but deserves inclusion as envy’s cousin on the list of seven deadly sins. Jealousy is born of fear, laced with insecurity and topped with a heady mix of personal, often historic foibles that make every case unique.Sending a long-term friend a pornographic joke may raise questions about your boyfriend’s sense of humour, but that doesn’t make it an entrée to an affair. Having supper with a sporting colleague is perfectly reasonable behaviour – and even more so in the company of a flatmate. Most of us no longer live in a society where every encounter with the opposite sex is a match-making moment – and how much better off we are for that. Here in the 21st century, those who are sexually compatible also regard each other as equals, work shoulder to shoulder, and play and party together. And we do all that without it having to end in sexual intercourse – often enjoying interactions more because of that.You ask what else your partner is capable of if he can send risqué jokes and share curries with golfing friends, as though those two activities represent the cliff edge of salacity. I’d argue that there’s nothing healthier than a man who still considers other women his friends, while choosing you to be his lover. You’ve already identified the real problem you are struggling with and it’s one of trust. Like innocence, it’s something we should assume and place in others until, and only if, they prove themselves not to be worthy of our assumptions.Your insecurity, currently playing havoc with your imagination, is damaging your ambition for a healthy relationship and is, ironically, the element most likely to prevent you achieving it. Affectionately referred to as a “little green monster”, jealousy is not, in fact, benign. It’s expansive, both in the person feeling it and in its ability to wreak destruction in our romantic lives. So, whether with expert help or a decided determination to overcome your pattern of distrust, I would urge you to tackle it. Obviously, I can’t promise that your partner will be faithful for ever and, as I don’t know him, I can’t even confirm he’s worthy of your trust. I do know, however, that a relationship built on suspicion, where your energy is focused on policing your partner rather than enjoying him, is a relationship doomed to disaster.With the best will in the world, your surveillance powers aren’t omnipotent, and if your man is intent on enjoying extra-curricular activities, he’ll find a way. What a squandering of your time and energy it is to focus on curtailing them. You’d be far better developing a great and irresistible relationship rather than invading your boyfriend’s privacy and keeping tabs on who he mingles with when he’s not in your eyeline. Your toxic levels of jealousy are as likely to destroy your relationship as any infidelity. Obsessive control is neither healthy nor tolerable and the sooner you deal with the origins of your trust issues the better for all concerned.If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.

I can't stand my best friend's alpha male boyfriend. Do I tell her?,"When you’ve chosen the wrong person, sometimes other people can help you see it. But honesty rarely works, says Eleanor Gordon-Smith",Eleanor Gordon-Smith,2019-10-23T00:18:41+0100,"I don’t like my friend’s boyfriend. He’s been quite rude and makes no effort. From his behaviour, it seems he favours an “alpha male” position and doesn’t like to be contradicted, even in a very trivial way. Is it awful if I can’t stand my best and oldest friend’s partner? I’m sure he adores her but I fear she deserves better. Can I express something along these lines or do I risk putting her in a difficult situation? Is it imperative we try to get along with our friends’ partners?I, like you, have heard dozens of versions of the story that begins with “she chose the wrong man” and ends in tears. If we’re honest with ourselves we might even have been the protagonist in a few. It puts the truth to Sartre’s old remark that hell is other people. Hell is also, and especially, the people we put up with because they love the people we love.There are two questions here. One is whether you should say something by some kind of moral principle, and the other is whether you can pragmatically get any foothold in her mind by saying it.The problem is that in more or less all the stories you and I already know about the girl who chooses the wrong person, it’s very seldom the intervention of other people that gets her to see it. Sometimes it is. But very rarely. More often she has to go through a whole lot of heartbreak and self-discovery and betrayal before she sees what everyone else sees.The psychoanalyst Alfred Adler suggested that people often find complicated ways to cause themselves suffering, because there’s an underlying need that that suffering answers. Maybe we find ourselves with manipulative people because we don’t want to make our own decisions; maybe we find ourselves with cruel people because we believe we deserve suffering.I don’t know whether something like that is going on for your friend, and she might not either, but ask yourself deeply and truthfully, do you think there’s any chance she really doesn’t realise he’s a jerk? Or is it that right now, for her reasons, his specific brand of jerk is just what she needs?If that’s what’s going on then there’s another question for you: what kind of friend do you want to be? Are you the one who points out what underlying pain she might be outsourcing to this guy? Or are you the one who lets her unravel in her own way, confident you’ll be there to help her pick up her unspooled self at the other end? Only you can answer that.Then there’s the moral question. There’s an old principle due to Immanuel Kant: “Ought implies can.” The question of whether you ought to try to get her to see this guy’s bad character depends on whether you really think you can – and even if you can, whether you want to, or whether you prefer to let her see it in her own way. Friendship asks all kinds of peculiar, unconditional things of us. Perhaps now you’re in a position to offer her the kind of genuine, patient love that this guy doesn’t seem to.*************************************Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

Why I worry about men who marry women 40 years younger than them,65-year-old Dennis Quaid is engaged to 26-year-old Laura Savoie – which will be his fourth marriage and continue an interesting pattern,Poppy Noor,2019-10-22T18:12:08+0100,"Dennis Quaid, a 65-year-old man who already looks like his own waxwork, yesterday announced his engagement to Laura Savoie. At 26, she already looks like every one of his three ex-wives – if none of them ever aged. And while I do think we should all be able to date anyone we like as long as it’s consensual, I do worry about him a little bit.In general, I worry about any man who chooses to date a woman 40 years younger – mainly because she will always outperform him in sports, but also because it’s awkward when people can’t tell if your companion is your daughter or your wife.Quaid’s first wife, the actor PJ Soles, of Carrie fame, was three years older than him when they married and no one batted an eyelid. When Quaid married his second wife, also a blond actor – Meg Ryan, heard of her? – everyone wished them well. Ryan is eight years younger than Quaid.If once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and the third time is a pattern, perhaps we should have seen the next one coming – a bit like a Russian doll.At the tender age of 50, Quaid married his third wife, Kimberley Buffington, then 34, and the couple had twins. Could anyone have guessed what happened next?Well, probably. Quaid is well-known for his starring role as the father of twins in the Parent Trap. As actor Elaine Hendrix, who played his 26-year-old fiancee in the Parent Trap pointed out, the real life script had already been written: in the movie, Quaid’s character, the father of twins, splits from his wife and gets engaged to a 26-year-old blond woman.Watch out for those twins. 👯‍♀️ https://t.co/Rloat1gLCyNow, I hear some of you already: so what if Quaid is now marrying a 26-year-old? Maybe she is wise beyond her years, or maybe Quaid is just immature. That’s not to mention that his new young fiancee has the free will to marry whomever she likes – it would be unfeminist not to point this out, right?I agree that as long as they’re happy, we should be happy for them. But if Quaid keeps on consecutively marrying younger and younger, then disregarding the math in this case would be reckless.As one very astute commentator has pointed out, the trend foretells a very worrying future for Quaid’s future engagement prospects.“His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger. His fourth wife will be forty years younger.”The logical end to this pattern? “Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet.”His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger.His fourth wife will be forty years younger. Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet. https://t.co/J4agZTE4hF"
Match of the day: meet the people who helped their ex find new love,"You may find the idea of setting up your ex-partner with a date ridiculous – but, for some, it couldn’t be more natural",Sirin Kale,2019-10-22T10:00:55+0100,"After Elliot broke up with his girlfriend Kelly, they stayed friends. Why wouldn’t they? The breakup had been amicable; after dating for a year and moving in together, they started squabbling over silly things and figured they were better off apart. They were on a night out in April last year with their friendship group when Elliot, a 27-year-old childcare worker from Lancashire, bumped into Tom, an old work colleague. They made small talk for a bit, before going their separate ways. But Tom had caught Kelly’s eye, and the next day she called Elliot with an unusual request: could he set them up on a date?Elliot wasn’t opposed to the idea, but there was a problem. “I said: ‘I have no idea who you’re on about!’” he remembers. “We’d had such a brief conversation that it didn’t stick in my memory.” A few days later at work, Elliot’s team leader mentioned Tom’s name. “I thought: ‘That’s who she meant!’ I texted her saying: ‘It’s this guy.’” Kelly and Tom started messaging; Elliot even helped her craft the initial, flirtatious texts. It worked: Kelly and Tom now live together.There are countless articles online about how to find love after a breakup – or win your ex back, if that’s what you want. Helping an ex-partner find love with someone new is an entirely different and much rarer phenomenon. But it happens. This month, New Zealand couple Damien and Whakarongotai Nikora’s Facebook statuses went viral. They had posted announcing their split, and both had included a personal ad on behalf of the other. The pair, who were married for 21 years, titled their posts: “Why you should date my ex.” “If you get the chance to date her, lucky man,” wrote Damien of Whakarongotai.Most people – at least those whose relationships were not abusive or vitriolic – want their exes to be happy. But actively working to help your ex find love? It is unusual, particularly in monogamous circles. Some of Elliot’s co-workers struggled to understand his actions. “They said: ‘I’d hate to see my ex getting with someone else.’ But I thought, why? You’re not together any more. Why should that concern you?”An advantage of setting up your ex is that you know their quirks and foibles better than almost anyone else, and can vet prospective partners for compatibility. “You know your exes, and you know your friends, so you can basically tell what sort of people they will like in relationships and what they do like and don’t like,” says Andrea Campos, 25, a lawyer from London. Two years ago, she was on holiday with a female friend in Dubai when Campos’s ex-boyfriend messaged her. He had seen her friend in the photos Campos had been sharing, and found her attractive.“I said: ‘Do you want me to play Cupid?” Campos says. He agreed. They dated for a short while, but nothing long-term came of it. She doesn’t view her actions as remarkable. “I’m not a jealous person. If I think people will get on, I’ll introduce them. You want the people you care about to be happy, and if you think they’d be happy together, you might as well help.”Although it might seem tempting to launch into your address book and begin setting up your former flames and friends, a word of caution: it is not a risk-free exercise. Perhaps you will discover that you are not over them or, if the resulting relationship turns sour, you may get caught up in the fallout. But if you are thinking of setting up your ex with someone new, the first thing to do is check they are happy with it before you do. “It’s healthy to hope an ex-partner goes on to form other healthy relationships,” says Ammanda Major, a therapist with the relationship charity Relate. “But it depends on whether your ex wants you to do that. Otherwise, you’re treating them like a commodity, and selling them on.”Ask yourself why you’re trying to set up your ex. Are you genuinely motivated by feelings of altruism, or are you doing it to assuage guilt, or to prove a point? “If you ended the relationship and don’t want them to feel bad about it, you might think that fixing them up with someone new will take their mind off it,” Major says. “But it can be disrespectful to what you had, if it can quickly be overcome by being set up with someone new.” Above all, respect a firm no. “We all think we know best and so-and-so might be perfect for them. But doing things without someone’s permission is never a good idea.”Setting up your ex with someone new is an acid test for whether you are truly over that person. If the thought fills you with horror, you may still have feelings for them. “You have to be honest with yourself,” says Christina Gale, 27, who lives in London and works in social media. “If you’re funny about an ex, you’ve obviously still got feelings. If you’ve moved on, why wouldn’t you want to see them in a new relationship? I’m not a jealous person. I think everyone should be able to find love.”Setting up her friends with her exes has become Gale’s signature move. “I’ve done this so many times!” she laughs. “I date people and think, actually, you’d be better suited to someone else I know.” One ex sticks out: they had been together for six years, but ended things amicably. He had started hanging out with another woman – as friends – but Gale was convinced it could be something more. “I went to her and said: ‘Do you think he’s good-looking? She said: ‘Yeah!’” Gale let him know – and they started dating.Not everyone can understand a decision to set up an ex. “I have straight friends that say I’m crazy,” says Leo Camanho, 23, a student from Rio de Janeiro. “They say: ‘You’re so mature; how can you do this?’” He set up his ex-boyfriend Lucas with his best friend, Fabio, after he and Lucas broke up. He thinks setting up your exes is more common in queer circles. “In Rio, if you’re not friends with your ex, you don’t have any exes, because everyone dates everyone here.” After Fabio and Lucas started dating, they came to Camanho for his blessing. “I said: ‘Totally, you are both friends of mine, I love you both, go and be happy.’”In New York’s queer scene, 28-year-old Remy Duran is a legend. The reality-TV star became known across the city for his little black book – in reality, a mobile phone full of contacts, with subfolders categorising sexual preference – that he uses to connect ex-partners looking for love (or sex). Duran didn’t set out to be New York’s answer to Cilla Black: his matchmaking was an incidental byproduct of his dating life. As he dated his way around New York, his social circle grew, and former partners would hit him up for advice if there was someone they had their eye on.“People would be like: ‘Do you know that person? I’ve wanted to hook up with them for ever. And I’d be like: ‘Sure, I don’t own them, you can totally see them!’” His matchmaking is primarily altruistic – he wants to ensure people are having a good time. But there is also a deeper motivation. “It feels liberating,” Duran says. “You don’t own anyone, and it gives you a sense of closure.” He has set up at least 20 former partners, ranging from hookups to ex-boyfriends. So far, so good. “They say thank you,” says Duran. “I don’t think I’ve had any complaints.”Polyamorous people may be more relaxed than monogamous people about helping their exes date someone new. One polyamorous person, who prefers to remain anonymous, says: “I don’t see it as ‘setting people up’. I mean, they’re poly, they bang whoever; I just introduced them.” But outside of polyamory, setting up your ex with someone new is the ultimate affront to a monogamous dating culture that views ex-partners as possessions, rather than autonomous beings with free will. “We live in a possession-based culture where we see human beings as objects,” Elliot says. “You – you’re mine. Monogamous relationships can be like that. Even after you break up, people can’t let go of that sense of ownership. But I don’t think relationships should be possessive in that way.”Sometimes, setting up your ex with a friend happens so organically, it feels like an act of God. When Joanna Delooze was 20, she dated a man named Aaron. On one of their dates, Aaron mentioned that he had a list of qualities he looked for in a potential spouse. Delooze, who is now 55, made Aaron show her his list. “I read it and said: ‘I’m not joking, but with the exception of one thing, my roommate Linda ticks every single box on your list.’” She laughs. “It was completely her! If I was a guy, and this was my list, I’d date my roommate.”Delooze was absolutely right: Linda and Aaron have been together for 35 years and have six children. She is delighted to have helped engineer their happiness. “I see pictures of their family and all their kids and how they’re still together and I think it’s just great.”Some names have been changed"
I can only climax from oral or manual stimulation. Is this normal?,"I enjoy sex, and have had long-term partners, but I have never experienced an orgasm from penetration",Pamela Stephenson Connolly,2019-10-22T08:00:59+0100,"I’m a 35-year-old woman and have never been able to orgasm from penetration. I have had a few partners, some long-term, and I enjoy sex, but can only climax from oral/manual stimulation. Is this normal? Sometimes it’s hard to explain to a partner that I do enjoy it if they do it right (they think there’s something wrong with them or me if I don’t climax from penetration). And sometimes with a newer partner I’m too embarrassed to ask for what I really need. But I don’t want to fake it.For you – and for most women – the most heightened sensations of sexual pleasure emanate from stimulation of your clitoris. Vaginal penetration will only bring you to orgasm if the nerve endings in your clitoris are sufficiently engaged. But many people do not know this, and the politics of sex and gender have meant that incorrect beliefs have prevailed, and feelings of inferiority and frustration remain widespread. There is nothing wrong with you; your sexual response is completely normative. From now on, take charge of your pleasure. Try to find ways to receive more direct clitoral stimulation during intercourse, perhaps manually (your partner’s hand or yours) or through experimenting with different positions, styles or toys. But if you prefer, just relax and allow yourself to be brought to orgasm separately the way you like. Educate your partners and show them exactly what you need. In most cases they will be grateful for the clear instruction, and you will more profoundly appreciate them – and yourself.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

Why Helen Mirren’s Catherine the Great is a sexual revolutionary,"In her portrayal of the much younger queen, the actor is reminding us that many women continue to enjoy sex as long as men do",Jane Martinson,2019-10-22T07:59:54+0100,"The majestic Helen Mirren is showcasing how much more straightforward it is for a woman to play at being royal than it is to marry into royalty.Even better, by playing, at the age of 74, the title role of HBO’s Catherine the Great, Mirren is portraying a woman “half her age”, while simultaneously reminding the world that many women actually like sex. And continue to do so as long as men do. Shocker.We have grown so used to wrinkly old men being found fabulously attractive by young women on screen that we even have a term for it: the Woody Allen syndrome. Yet Mirren, who literally pants for her key ally, Grigory Potemkin, on screen, is very unusual – I can’t think of any other female septuagenarians showing flesh on screen (unless they are playing a corpse).That Mirren is a generation older than the 50-year-old Jason Clarke, who plays Potemkin, is one thing, but the fact that she genuinely seems to be wanting – nay craving – post-menopausal sex is the real surprise.It is unprecedented and has drawn comparisons from some reviewers with other TV hits that subvert sexual power play – the lesbian love triangle in The Favourite, for instance, or Gentleman Jack.The power shift of Catherine the Great comes because she was a monarch. There still aren’t quite as many of those who are women as there are men, but maybe, as the stories we see on screen become more diverse, we will see many more brilliant older women playing romantic roles against younger men. Then we can call it the Helen Mirren syndrome."
How we met: ‘I’m a staunch Brexit critic – but it did lead to us falling in love’,"Tom Browne, 43, and Nara Falcón, 36, have been together since 2018. They have a baby daughter",Nell Frizzell,2019-10-21T14:15:38+0100,"Tom and Nara met in a queue last year. “I’d spent three years living in the UK,” jokes Ireland-born Tom. “I’d picked up some of your ways.” Forced to relocate to Madrid because of Brexit, he had been in town only three weeks and had a friend visiting from Dublin, so he was ticking off some of the local attractions.“We’d done most of the tourist stuff, so we ended up in El Retiro park, queueing to go on a boat ride,” he says. Waiting in front of them was Nara. “There was a vibe from the start. Nara is beautiful and has this warm personality that I could see when she was talking to her friend, even though I couldn’t understand the words she was saying. She’s gorgeous, open and friendly.”His ice-breaker was hardly the stuff of romcoms. “We were in the queue, exchanging glances, and I think I said something very basic like: ‘Do you know how long we have to wait?’ It wasn’t exactly a Hollywood opener.” He and Nara, who is Mexican, and their friends Paula and John decided to hire a boat as a foursome. “I trapped her for an hour on a little rowing boat, so she had to listen to all my nonsense,” Tom says. “My friend John and I did most of the rowing. We were showing off a little bit, I suppose.” The lake is small enough that you can cover it in half an hour, but they were there for an hour. “We took the piss a little bit.”The attraction was mutual and immediate. “I was trying to stop myself, of course, and take it step by step,” says Nara. “But it was the perfect timing. When we met, I was single. Also, for me, Tom was so perfect that I was surprised he was single. Everything was just perfect.” After their time on the lake, the quartet went to a bar for tapas and a drink. “Paula and John were enjoying it, too,” says Tom. “But it was clear as day, I’d say, that Nara and I were falling in love.”Tom, an engineer, works for an EU project called Galileo, which is why he had to move from Southampton to Madrid. “I am a staunch Brexit critic,” he says. “I think it’s a regressive idea and too divisive, but in this case it did lead to falling in love. It’s a cliche and all of that, but it was instant and amazing. If I’d written a list of all the characteristics of the perfect girl, she ticked every single one.”The couple had been together for about four months when Tom was due to fly to Thailand for a month-long Thai boxing training camp in the middle of the forest. “I didn’t know if I should cancel, because we’d only just got together,” says Tom. “But Nara is a synchronised swimmer – she was once on the Mexican Olympic team – and appreciated the importance of an active, physical, adventurous life.”“I basically said: ‘This is your personality, this is who you are, if you don’t go and do it I’ll kill you,’” Nara laughs.Although he had not met Nara’s parents by this point, Tom got in touch with her father, Carlos, to ask if he could fly to Mexico and surprise her at Christmas, after he’d finished in Thailand. “He said that I was making her daughter very happy, that I’d be welcome any time. He gave me the nicest reaction,” says Tom. “Both parents were so lovely.”It was quite a journey. “I went from Madrid to Thailand, then from Thailand to China, China to Canada and finally Canada to Mexico. They were the only flights that weren’t €10m.” By flying so slowly through so many time zones, he managed to have three Christmas Eves and two Christmas Days. When he arrived, Nara’s father collected Tom from the airport while Nara was in bed, somehow managing to keep the entire thing secret. “When I came back to the house she was asleep,” says Tom. “I think her cousin has it on video, but she just didn’t know what was going on.”Almost exactly nine months after that surprise reunion in Mexico, Tom and Nara’s daughter, Chloe, was born in hospital in Madrid. “I can’t wait to tell Chloe this story of how we met,” says Nara. “I think she’ll love it.”Want to share your story?

I can’t come to terms with my boyfriend’s female friendships,"You must master your jealously or it will play havoc with your relationship, says Mariella Frostrup",Mariella Frostrup,2019-10-20T07:30:50+0100,"The dilemma My partner of three years sent a female colleague a pornographic joke, and I can’t get over it. He said they’ve been friends since school days, but it doesn’t sit right with me. He can’t explain why he did it, apart from banter, and he thought she would find it funny. He’s said it won’t happen again and he made an error of judgment. Ten days before this he invited a female golfing colleague to his house for a curry (albeit with his male lodger). It sends out the wrong message, and if he feels this is acceptable, what else is he capable of? My mind is running riot. I know I have trust issues – my ex was unfaithful at least six times, and the reason I found out about the pornographic text was because I checked his phone. He’s the love of my life and he feels the same. There has always been strong chemistry between us and I don’t want to let my past get in the way, but I’m really struggling.Mariella replies Poor you. Having endured the ravages of paranoid (and sometimes not so paranoid) jealousy in my youth, I know how agonising it can be. Luckily, it’s a debilitating condition that most of us manage to control over time. Allowed to flourish, jealousy becomes your master, sapping emotional energy and any hope of happiness.Last time I checked, a romantic union is sustained on the basis of mutual trust and desire. No partnership can survive the scrutiny, strictures and control you’re enforcing. This will lead to the very deceit you’re fearful of, based on the reasonable desire on your partner’s part to have freedom of choice when it comes to his friendships. Hooking up isn’t about placing your beloved in lockdown. It’s about finding someone you can open up to, who enhances your life experience and whom you place in pole position in your affections. That doesn’t mean they should enter a state of purdah, curtail all encounters with the opposite sex, strike friends bearing proscribed genitalia from their address book and only make single-sex social engagements.Risqué jokes and a curry are not the cliff edge of salacityWe know that love is an irrational collision of pheromones and feelings, an arbitrary emotional reaction to another human being. Jealousy is also irrational, but deserves inclusion as envy’s cousin on the list of seven deadly sins. Jealousy is born of fear, laced with insecurity and topped with a heady mix of personal, often historic foibles that make every case unique.Sending a long-term friend a pornographic joke may raise questions about your boyfriend’s sense of humour, but that doesn’t make it an entrée to an affair. Having supper with a sporting colleague is perfectly reasonable behaviour – and even more so in the company of a flatmate. Most of us no longer live in a society where every encounter with the opposite sex is a match-making moment – and how much better off we are for that. Here in the 21st century, those who are sexually compatible also regard each other as equals, work shoulder to shoulder, and play and party together. And we do all that without it having to end in sexual intercourse – often enjoying interactions more because of that.You ask what else your partner is capable of if he can send risqué jokes and share curries with golfing friends, as though those two activities represent the cliff edge of salacity. I’d argue that there’s nothing healthier than a man who still considers other women his friends, while choosing you to be his lover. You’ve already identified the real problem you are struggling with and it’s one of trust. Like innocence, it’s something we should assume and place in others until, and only if, they prove themselves not to be worthy of our assumptions.Your insecurity, currently playing havoc with your imagination, is damaging your ambition for a healthy relationship and is, ironically, the element most likely to prevent you achieving it. Affectionately referred to as a “little green monster”, jealousy is not, in fact, benign. It’s expansive, both in the person feeling it and in its ability to wreak destruction in our romantic lives. So, whether with expert help or a decided determination to overcome your pattern of distrust, I would urge you to tackle it. Obviously, I can’t promise that your partner will be faithful for ever and, as I don’t know him, I can’t even confirm he’s worthy of your trust. I do know, however, that a relationship built on suspicion, where your energy is focused on policing your partner rather than enjoying him, is a relationship doomed to disaster.With the best will in the world, your surveillance powers aren’t omnipotent, and if your man is intent on enjoying extra-curricular activities, he’ll find a way. What a squandering of your time and energy it is to focus on curtailing them. You’d be far better developing a great and irresistible relationship rather than invading your boyfriend’s privacy and keeping tabs on who he mingles with when he’s not in your eyeline. Your toxic levels of jealousy are as likely to destroy your relationship as any infidelity. Obsessive control is neither healthy nor tolerable and the sooner you deal with the origins of your trust issues the better for all concerned.If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.

Why I worry about men who marry women 40 years younger than them,65-year-old Dennis Quaid is engaged to 26-year-old Laura Savoie – which will be his fourth marriage and continue an interesting pattern,Poppy Noor,2019-10-22T18:12:08+0100,"Dennis Quaid, a 65-year-old man who already looks like his own waxwork, yesterday announced his engagement to Laura Savoie. At 26, she already looks like every one of his three ex-wives – if none of them ever aged. And while I do think we should all be able to date anyone we like as long as it’s consensual, I do worry about him a little bit.In general, I worry about any man who chooses to date a woman 40 years younger – mainly because she will always outperform him in sports, but also because it’s awkward when people can’t tell if your companion is your daughter or your wife.Quaid’s first wife, the actor PJ Soles, of Carrie fame, was three years older than him when they married and no one batted an eyelid. When Quaid married his second wife, also a blond actor – Meg Ryan, heard of her? – everyone wished them well. Ryan is eight years younger than Quaid.If once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and the third time is a pattern, perhaps we should have seen the next one coming – a bit like a Russian doll.At the tender age of 50, Quaid married his third wife, Kimberley Buffington, then 34, and the couple had twins. Could anyone have guessed what happened next?Well, probably. Quaid is well-known for his starring role as the father of twins in the Parent Trap. As actor Elaine Hendrix, who played his 26-year-old fiancee in the Parent Trap pointed out, the real life script had already been written: in the movie, Quaid’s character, the father of twins, splits from his wife and gets engaged to a 26-year-old blond woman.Watch out for those twins. 👯‍♀️ https://t.co/Rloat1gLCyNow, I hear some of you already: so what if Quaid is now marrying a 26-year-old? Maybe she is wise beyond her years, or maybe Quaid is just immature. That’s not to mention that his new young fiancee has the free will to marry whomever she likes – it would be unfeminist not to point this out, right?I agree that as long as they’re happy, we should be happy for them. But if Quaid keeps on consecutively marrying younger and younger, then disregarding the math in this case would be reckless.As one very astute commentator has pointed out, the trend foretells a very worrying future for Quaid’s future engagement prospects.“His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger. His fourth wife will be forty years younger.”The logical end to this pattern? “Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet.”His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger.His fourth wife will be forty years younger. Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet. https://t.co/J4agZTE4hF"
I can't stand my best friend's alpha male boyfriend. Do I tell her?,"When you’ve chosen the wrong person, sometimes other people can help you see it. But honesty rarely works, says Eleanor Gordon-Smith",Eleanor Gordon-Smith,2019-10-23T00:18:41+0100,"I don’t like my friend’s boyfriend. He’s been quite rude and makes no effort. From his behaviour, it seems he favours an “alpha male” position and doesn’t like to be contradicted, even in a very trivial way. Is it awful if I can’t stand my best and oldest friend’s partner? I’m sure he adores her but I fear she deserves better. Can I express something along these lines or do I risk putting her in a difficult situation? Is it imperative we try to get along with our friends’ partners?I, like you, have heard dozens of versions of the story that begins with “she chose the wrong man” and ends in tears. If we’re honest with ourselves we might even have been the protagonist in a few. It puts the truth to Sartre’s old remark that hell is other people. Hell is also, and especially, the people we put up with because they love the people we love.There are two questions here. One is whether you should say something by some kind of moral principle, and the other is whether you can pragmatically get any foothold in her mind by saying it.The problem is that in more or less all the stories you and I already know about the girl who chooses the wrong person, it’s very seldom the intervention of other people that gets her to see it. Sometimes it is. But very rarely. More often she has to go through a whole lot of heartbreak and self-discovery and betrayal before she sees what everyone else sees.The psychoanalyst Alfred Adler suggested that people often find complicated ways to cause themselves suffering, because there’s an underlying need that that suffering answers. Maybe we find ourselves with manipulative people because we don’t want to make our own decisions; maybe we find ourselves with cruel people because we believe we deserve suffering.I don’t know whether something like that is going on for your friend, and she might not either, but ask yourself deeply and truthfully, do you think there’s any chance she really doesn’t realise he’s a jerk? Or is it that right now, for her reasons, his specific brand of jerk is just what she needs?If that’s what’s going on then there’s another question for you: what kind of friend do you want to be? Are you the one who points out what underlying pain she might be outsourcing to this guy? Or are you the one who lets her unravel in her own way, confident you’ll be there to help her pick up her unspooled self at the other end? Only you can answer that.Then there’s the moral question. There’s an old principle due to Immanuel Kant: “Ought implies can.” The question of whether you ought to try to get her to see this guy’s bad character depends on whether you really think you can – and even if you can, whether you want to, or whether you prefer to let her see it in her own way. Friendship asks all kinds of peculiar, unconditional things of us. Perhaps now you’re in a position to offer her the kind of genuine, patient love that this guy doesn’t seem to.*************************************Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

"Today, I aim to get arrested. It is the only real power climate protesters have","By putting our bodies on the line and risking our liberty, we make this great neglected issue impossible to ignore",George Monbiot,2019-10-16T05:59:08+0100,"A few hours after this column is published, I hope to be in a police cell. I don’t yet know what the charge will be, where I will be arrested or when, but I know that if I go home this evening without feeling the hand of the law on my sleeve, I will have failed. This may sound like a strange ambition, but I believe it is a reasonable one.If I succeed, I will be one of many. In the current wave of Extinction Rebellion protests, more than 1,400 people have so far allowed themselves to be arrested. It’s a controversial tactic, but it has often proved effective. The suffragettes, the Indian salt marchers, the civil rights movement and the Polish and East German democracy movements, to name just a few, all used it as a crucial strategy. Mass arrests are a potent form of democratic protest.They work because they show that the campaigners are serious. When people are prepared to jeopardise their liberty for their cause, other people appear more likely to listen to what they say, and more likely to recognise its importance. Those who founded Extinction Rebellion researched these histories and sought to apply their lessons to the greatest predicament humanity has ever faced - the gathering collapse of our life support systems.Nowhere on Earth does government action match the scale of the catastrophes we face. Part of the reason is the remarkably low level of public discussion and information on this crisis. Another is that the political risks of action are higher than the perceived rewards – a balance the protesters want to redress. But perhaps the most important factor is the brute power of the pollutocrats driving this disaster. As the Guardian’s The polluters series shows, the big fossil fuel companies have used political funding, intense lobbying and gross deceptions of the public to overwhelm environmental protections and keep harvesting their massive profits.Those who confront them have no such power. We cannot buy television channels and newspapers, pour billions into political lobbying or seed dark ads on social media. We have only one strength: our vulnerability. By putting our bodies on the line and risking our liberty, we make this great neglected issue impossible to ignore.So far, the campaign has been remarkably successful. Alongside the youth climate strikes, Extinction Rebellion has changed the global conversation about climate and environmental breakdown. These movements are directly responsible for the declaration of a climate emergency by the UK parliament and many other political bodies. But this is not enough. It is one thing to recognise an emergency, another to act on it. We must do more. I cannot justifiably say “we” if I don’t mean “I”.I know this action will expose me to criticism as well as prosecution. Like other prominent activists, I will be lambasted for hypocrisy: this is now the favoured means of trying to take down climate activists. Yes, we are hypocrites. Because we are embedded in the systems we contest, and life is complicated, no one has ever achieved moral purity. The choice we face is not between hypocrisy and purity, but between hypocrisy and cynicism. It is better to strive to do good, and often fail, than not to strive at all.Other criticisms carry more weight. Extinction Rebellion is too white, and too middle class. Both charges are true, as the organisers recognise: they know that they must do more to break down the cultural barriers the movement unconsciously erects, engage with community leaders, and listen to voices that have not been heard.But I cannot help who I am. I accept that the costs of arrest for people like me – a white, middle-class man with an established career – are lower than for other people. But this means I have a moral duty to use my privilege.The victims of climate breakdown have so far been mostly voiceless and invisible to us. But we know that, even with just 1C of global heating, climate chaos is already a bigger cause of forced migration than either poverty or political oppression. Large numbers of people in Somalia, Mozambique, Bangladesh, the Caribbean, Central America and many other parts of the world are already losing their homes and livelihoods. The poor parts of the world are the least responsible for climate disaster but the most likely to suffer its effects. They carry the cost of our consumption. We have imposed this crisis on others, and must do what we can to curtail it.Since I began writing this article, getting arrested has become easier: the police have imposed a blanket ban on “any assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion autumn uprising” across London. This looks to me like a breach of article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: “Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.” Over the past four decades, the police have acquired an extraordinary array of powers – enabling them, in effect, to shut down any protest. But they deem even these insufficient: at a recent press conference they demanded new “banning orders” for “habitual” protesters. Given that regular protest has proved throughout history to be an essential mechanism for political reform, this looks like a direct attack on democracy.Far from deterring me, the draconian ban this week and the police demand for even greater powers has strengthened my determination. Now I feel I am standing not only for the habitability of the planet but also for the continued right to protest. This is my duty, and I intend to fulfil it.• George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
Donald Trump’s sanity is not the question. The real issue is how he got into office,"To reduce his presidency to a frail mind is to ignore the fact he’s an emblem of free-market, white supremacist nationalism",Gary Younge,2019-10-18T06:00:43+0100,"While writing a New Yorker profile on Donald Trump in the late 1990s, Mark Singer attempted to discover something about the businessman’s private thoughts, as opposed to his outsized, public persona. When Singer asked him what he thought about when shaving in front of the mirror, Trump did not really understand the question.“OK, I guess I’m asking, ‘do you consider yourself ideal company?’” Singer said. “You really want to know what I consider ideal company?” replied Trump. “A total piece of ass.”Divining, assessing and adjudicating the mental health of this US president has become more than just a parlour gameDivining, assessing and adjudicating the mental health of this US president has become more than just a parlour game. Following a 2017 conference, 27 psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental health experts wrote a book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, arguing it was their moral and civic “duty to warn” America that “for psychological reasons”, Trump was “more dangerous than any president in history”. They diagnosed him with everything from “severe character pathology” to “delusional disorder”, which can be added to the more common verdicts of “narcissistic personality disorder” and “antisocial personality disorder” which are regularly offered.His behaviour and comments over the past fortnight would appear to not only confirm these conclusions, but to suggest his condition is deteriorating. There has been the appalling treatment of Harry Dunn’s parents, and his reference to his own “great and unmatched wisdom”. He sent a letter to the Turkish president, Recep Erdoğan, warning him: “Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool. I will call you later.” On Wednesday, in a single press conference with the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, he attacked Google, Amazon, Germany, France, Spain, his guest and the European Union, as well as several US intelligence and law enforcement officials.Later that day, Democratic leaders walked out of a White House meeting with him after he continually insulted them. But not before he told House speaker Nancy Pelosi: “I hate Isis more than you do,” and claimed “I captured Isis … in one month.”As the threat of impeachment leaves him more isolated, and an election he may lose makes him more vulnerable, we can expect more bizarre behaviour and, consequently, more attempts to frame his actions as those of an unstable and unhinged despot. Such depictions are tempting. They should also be resisted.Trump’s state of mind is, of course, relevant. He is the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military forces in the world. He has the nuclear codes. He is impulsive and capricious. He lies constantly, unashamedly and apparently compulsively. It is deeply worrying that the executive powers of the presidency lie in the hands of a man who is at one and the same time so brittle, aggressive, vindictive, ridiculous and self-obsessed. His decision to abandon a longstanding ally in Kurdistan and pull US troops out of Syria, against all military advice, is a case in point.But to reduce his presidency to this – one man and his frail mind – is to ignore how he got there, all he has said and done since he has been there, and how he remains there. (It also risks reducing mental health to a lazy slur.) Just because he believes he will go down in history as a great man doesn’t mean we have to subscribe to the “great man theory of history” – the theory which claims events are moulded not by ordinary people, social movements and economic processes, but by key individuals who stamp their will on the world through force of personality.For along with Trump’s personal frailties is a series of political characteristics that underpins his anomie. He is a misogynist, a racist, a xenophobe and a nationalist. Those are not psychological descriptors but political ones, fortified by systems and ideology.As such, his behaviour has been irascible but hardly erratic. The rhetorical objects of his disdain are not random. He has not lashed out at the National Rifle Association, the religious right or white people. Politically, his tantrums invariably find their mark in the weak, the poor, the dark, the female, the Muslim, the marginalised and the foreigner. (He will attack powerful people, but not simply for existing. They must cross him first.)These inclinations were clear when he stood for the presidency. He has been every bit as bigoted, undisciplined, indiscreet, thin-skinned and braggadocious as his campaign promised. And he won.This was not because people didn’t see those things, but because they either didn’t care, cared about other things more, preferred him to the alternative, or simply didn’t show up. As such, his victory marked a high point for the naked appeal of white supremacy in particular and rightwing populism in general, and a low point for the centre-left, neoliberal agenda.True, he did not win the popular vote, but nonetheless close to 63 million people voted for him. True, his party lost the House of Representatives in the 2018 mid-term elections. But they also gained two seats in the Senate – the first time the party holding the presidency has achieved that since 2002 – in the wake of a synagogue shooting and mail-bomb attacks inspired by his rhetoric. True, more than half of the country wants to impeach him; but about 40% still approve of the job he’s doing. The one thing that stands between him and impeachment is the party behind him in both houses.Even his thuggish “America first” foreign policy stands as part of a tradition. In 1964, when the Greek ambassador tried to point out the shortcomings of the US plan to partition Cyprus, President Lyndon Johnson replied: “Fuck your parliament and your constitution … We pay a lot of good American dollars to the Greeks, Mr Ambassador. If your prime minister gives me talk about democracy, parliament and constitution he, his parliament and his constitution may not last long.” He would never have put that in a letter. But three years later, Greece was under a brutal military junta backed by the US from which it did not emerge for seven years.In other words, this particular form of insanity – if that is what it is – enjoys mass, if not majority, support, institutional defence and historical precedent. It is the mindset of more than just an individual. Trump’s presence serves a purpose and interests. If he is a lone wolf, how do we explain the likes of Boris Johnson or Silvio Berlusconi, who share so many of his “idiosyncratic traits”, from accusations of sexual harassment to a cavalier attitude towards democratic norms and casual racism.“The great man of the age,” wrote Friedrich Hegel – using “great” to mean powerful rather than wonderful – “is the one who can put into words the will of his age, tell his age what its will is, and accomplish it. What he does is the heart and essence of his age; he actualises his age.”As such, in his desire to blame everyone but himself, in his lies, bullying, despotism, insecurity, ineptitude, cheating, scapegoating, preening self-regard, vanity and ignorance, Trump is an emblem of the free-market, white supremacist nationalism that is ascendant in this moment.Ultimately there may be a medical or therapeutic intervention that can help him; but only a political intervention can help us get rid of him.• Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist• This article was amended on 18 October 2019 to correct an indiscrete/indiscreet homophone"
Saving the union will need imagination – and we’ve lost it,"As our common culture disintegrates amid Brexit and globalisation, the chances of holding the country together go down",Aditya Chakrabortty,2019-10-17T06:00:48+0100,"How do some countries tear themselves apart while others keep together? To the most vital question facing the UK the answer, it seems to me, lies in an old book. I can picture its burgundy spine, the black-and-white cover photo of three solemn Asian gentlemen wearing tuxedo jackets and sarongs, and that title so good it is almost a spell: Imagined Communities.Perhaps you know this classic study, for its influence still reverberates nearly 40 years after its first edition. In it, Benedict Anderson analyses how a national identity is manufactured, so that a hunk of rock can inspire men and women to kill or die for it. Prescribed it by a university teacher a quarter-century ago, I felt the thing practically buzzing with timeliness. The Soviet imperial glacier had broken apart, and politicians and pundits assumed the world’s future lay in the nation state. Yet Anderson argued that what nationalists saw as ageless and undeniable was to scholars modern and confected. The nation, he wrote, “is an imagined political community” – a collective waking dream fed by comparatively recent technology, such as books in the vernacular language and common consumption of the same media. Reading the same newspapers as one’s neighbours on the train or in the barbers reassured citizens that their “imagined world is visibly rooted in everyday life”.Every nation state stands on the brink of death; keeping it alive requires constant reaffirmation. And while the late Anderson focused on Asia, his argument applied equally to the land of warm beer and old maids cycling to communion. In her history, Britons, Linda Colley nailed Great Britain as “an invented nation superimposed, if only for a while, on to much older alignments and loyalties”.If only for a while. That clock has been ticking, and the time is nearly up. What was proclaimed in 1707 the “one united kingdom by the name of Great Britain” is slowly crumbling into pieces before our eyes. Chip! This week it is Nicola Sturgeon promising Scots another independence referendum by next Christmas. Chip! Last week it was a Telegraph column asking whether Britain really needed Northern Ireland.The same bunch of spivs, blimps and yahoos chuntering on this week about making Britain great again are more likely to shrink it, making the country smaller than at any time since the Stuart dynasty. Weeks before the 2016 referendum, the then prime minister David Cameron warned that Brexit meant national “disintegration”. This summer his predecessor, Gordon Brown, said: “The union is today more at risk than at any time in 300 years.” When it finally comes, the proximate cause of the UK’s demise will be easily ascribed: it will be death by hard Brexit. However deep the warm bath of mutual congratulation sunk into by commentators and backbenchers at potentially seeing off a no-deal Brexit, it doesn’t hide the ugliest truths. Westminster is still heading out of Europe, and Boris Johnson’s proposed deal is harder and worse than the one punted by Theresa May. Failing to agree on anything apart from the disaster of crashing out of the EU, the rebel alliance has won a battle yet stands to be utterly routed in the war.All that’s left now is the most negative way to hold together a nation: an imagined enemyIf Brown shares just one thing with Labour’s current leadership, it is this: both calculate that the Scottish nationalists will win a landslide at the next general election, spurring Sturgeon to demand a new referendum that Westminster will find near-impossible to deny her. And if remain-voting Scotland goes its own way, it will make the Brexit maelstrom look like a passing shower. Westminster’s relationship with the EU goes back four decades. The union with Scotland stretches back three centuries. At Stormont, the political arithmetic is far harder, but politicians there must be taking legal advice on whether the framework of the Good Friday agreement allows Northern Ireland to leave the UK and rejoin the EU.Signs of this were visible even in the hours after the 2016 vote, but the recklessness with which the Tory party has behaved since has made it only more likely. Look no further than Johnson, who spent decades at the Telegraph sneering at the “Jocks”, their hands outstretched for pocket money from “Uncle Sugar” down in Westminster. As London mayor, he declared: “A pound spent in Croydon is of far more value to the country than a pound spent in Strathclyde.”No wonder that when Scottish Conservatives battled this summer to block Johnson from becoming party leader they adopted the codename of Operation Arse. Yet Johnson’s greatest gift is to take the conventional wisdom of his class and wrap it in outrage, and on Scotland he is no different, merely expressing the attitude of a ruling party that long ago stopped giving a tinker’s cuss about anywhere or anything too far over the horizon.While it would be easy to argue that this national instability is the fault solely of Johnson and his red-faced, jabby-fingered Brexiters, it would also be wrong. What just a few weeks ago Brown bemoaned as “the unravelling of a community of mutual interests, common purpose and shared ideals” is a process that has taken decades and that has been led by London.As described by Anderson and others, nation-building is a long journey of establishing common interests and promulgating them through an engineered common culture. The UK’s store of both is dwindling. As recently as Margaret Thatcher, the country had only four TV channels; today you need never watch the same thing as either your spouse or your offspring. Last year, media watchdog Ofcom reported that the third-biggest source of news in the UK was Facebook. It also found that social media users were mainly drawn to stories that were “trending”, or “commented on by friends or people that I know”.So a national culture gets fragmented into friend groups, even while the idea of a national economy becomes ever more laughable. Thatcher’s legacy is summed up by historian David Edgerton in The Rise and Fall of the British Nation as “a new kind of economy … in which there was no longer any concern for national champions, for the ownership even of firms operating in the UK, or the balance of payments”. What’s left is the idea of a territory sullenly governed and subsidised by central London, which is itself a global entity – a host to multinational businesses, an international tax haven, a laundromat for the world’s hot and dirty money.What happened to the idea of Britain? It lost the interest of elites who spotted easier, quicker ways to cash in. Perhaps all that’s left now is the most negative way to hold together a nation: an imagined enemy. It used to be the Frogs and the Krauts and all those other ugly words. Now? It’s the SNP, who used to have Ed Miliband in their pocket, the saboteurs in the judiciary and in parliament, the remoaner establishment. The inventiveness essential to hold a nation-state together has largely disappeared, to be supplanted by the language of loss and sourness and existential threat.• Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"
David Cameron’s ‘greased piglet’: the perfect image for the Brexit moment,It’s entirely fitting that the former prime minister went there at a time of maximum national derangement,Marina Hyde,2019-10-18T17:22:30+0100,"There’s a real sense of occasion now we’ve almost reached the bit of Brexit where the elites who gifted it to us don’t have to pretend any more. Always ahead of the curve, David Cameron is leaning in to the coming winds of financial and ritualistic deregulation with demob abandon. Speaking in Harrogate to promote his book on Thursday night, Cameron predicted success for Boris Johnson and his deal. As the former prime minister put it: “The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people’s hands where mere mortals fail.”That’s it, mate. Why keep your mouth shut about pigs any more? We should just take it from one who knows: greasing a pig makes it go better. Given the dramatic degeneration of our public conversation over the past three years, it feels right that Cameron chose to finally “go there” on the porcine front in Harrogate, a town that was for so long a byword for a certain type of regional gentility.I would imagine his next tour stop will be in Royal Leamington Spa, where he will expand on the point with a demonstration comparing different means of lubricant. Local boars who’ve always wanted to put their daughter on the stage are invited to get in touch with his promoter.As for which atrocious timeline we are about to be flung into tomorrow, who can say? A lot of journalists would certainly like to say. Everything has improved, hasn’t it, since journalists decided their job is predicting what might happen in the future as opposed to reporting on what they do currently know, or scrutinising what they can currently see.Thus the 36 hours or so between Johnson announcing his deal in Brussels and the special sitting of parliament to vote on it feel like they have been mostly spent watching or reading hacks and pundits debating the complex question, “Will the agreement pass?” I don’t know, guys! I guess you could concentrate on what’s in it – or are you as committed to a no-spoilers Brexit as the government is?Lavishing hours of airtime and miles of column inches on speculating precisely how close it all is feels a bit like being given advance notice of a shitstorm, and frittering your day away taking spread bets on the possible wind speed. Six votes? Three votes? Would someone like to come on air and say they reckon there’s maybe just a couple of votes in it? What if it was a tie?Either way, the conclusion, which may of course be debunked tomorrow, is that it will be Very Close. Then, when it is, lots of people will be able to sweep online to declare that they “CALLED IT”. You can print out those tweets and burn them for warmth in the years when we’re discovering the true implications of the Very Close Vote on whatever it was a vote on.The only people who seem to have spent less time thinking about the detail are the likes of Andrew Bridgen. “It looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit,” he explained to Channel 4 News. “That’s Brexit for me.” Despite being even more cruelly miscast as a “Spartan” than cinema’s Gerard Butler once was, the likes of Mark Francois and Andrew Bridgen have succeeded in getting apparently serious commentators to use their self-styled nickname “the Spartans” without deploying airquotes so thrustingly sarcastic that they could be harnessed for wind power.Meanwhile, Michael Gove could be found lurching unsteadily towards the TV camera to bat away Andrew Neil’s inquiry about the possibility of a second referendum amendment. “That ain’t gonna happen,” drawled the bespectacled Clint Eastwood of Surrey Heath. “Ain’t gonna – ain’t gonna be no second referendum.” In retrospect, that may be the moment this once self-respecting nation had to officially admit it was over.We have created an environment so intensely deregulated that Michael Gove is emboldened enough to imagine he’s some kind of gunslinger. The system has already failed. We passed checks and balances three galaxies ago. Our executive defences have been breached by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man grown in a petri dish to provide Monty Burns with someone who could lose to him at arm wrestling.Given the problems Theresa May had, there was some sense of surprise that Johnson should have pulled off a deal acceptable to the more deranged elements of his party. But history is likely to judge that it’s easier than it looks when you’re a man whose sole ideological red line is frictionless abortions. Having given a speech in November 2018 insisting that “no British Conservative government could or should sign up” to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea, Johnson’s British Conservative government was just shy of three months old when it cheerily signed up to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea. That was a great outcome, explained foreign secretary and famous geography dunce Dominic Raab, who said it was a “cracking deal” for Northern Ireland on the basis that they’d keep “frictionless access to the single market”. There it is: the dream. Only a few more days of having to remember which lie you told.Speaking of Northern Ireland, the week has offered the chance to watch the Democratic Unionist party discover in real time who the sucker at the table was. It would take a heart of stone not to enjoy the disappointment of DUP hive queen Arlene Foster, who has carried herself throughout the Brexit process like the kind of maternal screen villain who tries to scupper their child’s every romantic attachment for not being good enough.The DUP have so enjoyed being at the centre of the soap opera since the 2017 election, and acting like divas, that they didn’t realise until they saw this week’s script that the producers couldn’t be doing with them any more and were killing them off. It’s a lot like what happened with Martine McCutcheon on EastEnders. She went off and showed them by having a 15-minute pop career; Arlene is not thought to have any musical ambitions, but will now always be a hero to those dreaming of a united Ireland.As for the prime minister, he seems to be enjoying himself, as much as is possible for a sort of middle-aged Kylo Ren who’s making all the correct self-care decisions. In Westminster, many judge that, whatever happens tomorrow, Boris Johnson is in a win-win situation, with the sole losing entity being the entire United Kingdom. As David Cameron continues to promote his bestselling book, and the rabid deregulators continue to promote Boris Johnson, it does feel as if the nation might end up the true sucker in all this. Then again, for all the mirth it produced, there was always a rather leaden sense of dramatic irony clouding the original Cameron/pig tale. People like David Cameron end up playing David Cameron. The rest of the public is in danger of being the pig.• Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"
'The time to be afraid is over': the quest for justice and healing in Liberia,Pressure is mounting in the west African country – recovering from 14 years of conflict – for a war-crimes tribunal to bring ‘closure’ ,Ruth Maclean,2019-10-23T05:00:24+0100,"As a child in Liberia’s first civil war, Rustonlyn Dennis remembers seeing dead bodies in the street. In 1991, her immediate family managed to get out of the shattered capital, Monrovia, and survived, but a dozen relatives starved to death.Civilians were attacked, child soldiers recruited and ethnic groups were targeted in that war, setting a pattern for many of the wars that were to follow on the African continent. Hundreds of thousands of people died.Like Dennis, now a legislator in the west African country’s parliament, most Liberians have a war story to tell. But decades later, a thorough reckoning has still not been had. The recommendations of Liberia’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), published in 2009, have never been implemented, and former rebels and their associates have held some of the country’s highest offices.The country’s president, George Weah, appears to be changing tack, however, writing to parliament in September to ask for advice on implementing the TRC recommendations including setting up the war crimes court that activists have long demanded, and telling the UN the country needs “closure” on the wounds of 14 years of war – though he stopped short of openly supporting the establishment of the war crimes court.Dennis has been instrumental in pushing for a resolution on a bill calling for the establishment of such a court, hailed as one of Liberia’s first steps towards addressing the legacy of the civil wars.“I feel all those souls that were lost – we should account for it,” she says. “If we don’t hold perpetrators accountable, we will have another war. People fought the war because of corruption, nepotism and greed. These things are happening again.”Dennis says she has faced threats from former warlords because of her fight to bring perpetrators of past human rights violations to justice.Momentum has built, with groups such as the Traditional Chiefs Council gradually coming on board. One of the recommendations of a recently held three-day National Economic Dialogue was to set up the court. At least 52 lawmakers signed the resolution, giving it the requisite support of two-thirds of the House of Representatives. However, recently the Speaker refused to include it on the House agenda, saying that members needed more time to consult their constituents.The country’s Nobel prize-winning former president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, did not act on the TRC’s recommendations, including one that she, along with others, should not hold office for 30 years due to her support for war criminal-turned-president Charles Taylor early in his career.Initially Weah showed every sign of following Sirleaf’s lead, despite having called for justice for those who recruited child soldiers 15 years ago.Addressing the UN in September, however, Weah said he had changed his mind because of a “rising chorus of voices” calling for a tribunal, including, he said, “alleged perpetrators who seem to wish to clear their names”.If we don’t set a precedent, there will always be bloodshed, there will always be killing.Although he said he was at a loss to understand why there was such clamour for the court now and not before, he said: “It is important to bring closure to the wounds from the 14 years of Liberia’s brutal civil war … we need to agree on a mechanism that will guarantee the sustenance of peace, stability, justice and reconciliation.”Returning to Liberia from the UN general assembly, however, Weah appeared to backtrack, saying that he had merely informed the UN about the calls for a court, not supported one himself. “I have never one day called for the war-crimes court,” he said. “Why should we focus on the war crimes court now, when we did not focus on it 12 years ago?”To win the 2017 election, Weah relied on the support of Prince Johnson, a warlord-turned-senator who was involved in the killing of the brutal former military ruler Samuel Doe on camera. Fear of upsetting Johnson, and his many supporters, may have been the reason Weah did not act sooner.Johnson argues a war crimes court would be illegal, though he has said he supports Weah’s request for advice on it from the legislature.People claiming to speak on behalf of Prince Johnson have issued threats to Dennis. She says “since then, there has been this unknown or unlicensed black vehicle that is always tailing me.”Johnson denied any involvement in phone calls to Dennis, adding that he is now a preacher and “vehemently condemn[s] any form of violence against people”.Dennis says she has also received more direct threats from other high-profile figures.Nevertheless, she says it is a cause worth fighting for.“I just want to walk in light, I just want to walk in justice, and I stand for justice,” she says. “I think the time to be afraid is over, I think they [the warlords] should be afraid now.”It would help the country economically, she says, because nobody wants to invest in a “totally lawless” country. The economy has sunk since Weah took over in 2017.If there is no accountability, she says, history will repeat itself.“How sure are we that another group of people will not rise up again for political power? If we don’t set a precedent, there will always be bloodshed, there will always be killing, there will always be murders.”"
University vice-chancellor stands aside over blackmail claims in Pakistan,Javed Iqbal denies involvement in scandal over alleged use of CCTV footage to extort money from students in Balochistan,,2019-10-22T12:29:54+0100,"The vice-chancellor of a university in the volatile region of Balochistan in Pakistan has temporarily stepped down from his role following the launch of an investigation into allegations of harassment and blackmail on campus.Javed Iqbal said on Sunday that he was leaving his post at the University of Balochistan until the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) concluded its inquiry into claims that CCTV footage of students was used by university officials to blackmail them. Most of the students allegedly affected were female.Iqbal refuted the allegations, telling the Guardian: “I have no involvement in this scandal.” Elsewhere, he has claimed the “allegations are based on lies”.News of the FIA investigation has sparked a wave of protests across the country.Hundreds of students have taken to the streets, including in the capital, Islamabad, and organised sit-ins at universities across the country.It is alleged that footage showing male and female students mingling – from CCTV cameras installed around campus for security reasons – had been used by university staff to extort money and sexually harass female students. If they didn’t comply, it’s claimed that students were told the footage would be sent to their families.Sharing borders with Iran and Afghanistan, Balochistan is the largest and least developed province of Pakistan. It is deeply conservative and it would be deemed “dishonourable” for a woman and man to be seen together unless they were married or with family members. The female literacy rate for the province is 24%, while the rate among males is 56%. Many fear that the university scandal will deter girls from entering higher education.According to local media reports, the FIA has been investigating the claims for a couple of weeks and has interviewed dozens of university officials.“We have traced 12 videos of harassment of female students,” a senior FIA officer, who declined to be named, told Dawn News TV. The report quoted the official as saying: “Most of the victims in the case are female students who were harassed by some officials of the university’s administration.”The student protests sparked by the investigation are unprecedented at a university where political activism is banned due to insurgency in the region. The university campus is used as a base by the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary force deployed in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to help keep order and patrol the border areas with Afghanistan and Iran. Soldiers are active on campus and students have to undergo security checks when they enter their hostel accommodation.Harassment is understood to have been occurring on campus for more than four years, and only came to light as a result of an investigation into an unrelated matter at the university.Talking to the Guardian, student Sadia Baloch said: “Most of the female students residing in the university’s hostels have already left for home, as parents asked them to come back.”She added: “We live in a tribal society and no girl would ever come forward to report harassment for fear of being killed in the name of honour. The harassers have used this fact to harass and blackmail girls when found mingling with male students, and threatened to send the compromising video footage to their families.”On the request of anonymity, a female Masters student at the university said: “Last year, my class fellow left the university when she was continuously harassed by professors and administration officials, as she could neither report it nor share it with her parents. This harassment has been going on for over four years.”Another female masters student said: “I have been harassed by a teacher and he asked me to date him to get good marks. We are harassed on a daily basis by teachers and administration officials. If we share it with [our] families, they would not let us continue our studies.“It is very disappointing that this harassment is institutionalised. We feel like we live in a war zone amid soldiers, not a university.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concern about the allegations, and on a recent fact-finding mission found “an alarming level of surveillance on campus at the university”.“While this is in place ostensibly for reasons of security, the recent allegations show how easy it is for surveillance to become a tool of harassment, most often at women’s expense. HRCP’s sources claim that the surveillance system is used as a means of moral policing as well as to disrupt any potential or suspected political activism among students, allegedly at the behest of the Frontier Corps personnel who are permanently deployed at the university.“HRCP supports those students who have called this a gross violation of their privacy and a means of coercion, and welcomes the Balochistan high court’s decision to take notice of the matter. The Commission also urges the university administration to identify and penalise the perpetrators.”The FIA said it would submit its findings to Balochistan high court on 29 October."
Lake Chad shrinking? It's a story that masks serious failures of governance,Our two-year study shows the lake has been stable since the 1990s. Costly ‘solutions’ shift focus from the complex causes of the region’s deadly crisis ,,2019-10-22T07:00:53+0100,"Lake Chad is a hydrological miracle – a life-giving, freshwater lake in the Sahara desert. But the region around the lake has been engulfed in a violent crisis for more than a decade, which has left nearly 10 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.Military crackdowns on insurgent groups such as Boko Haram have failed to end the violence. Bringing durable peace to the region requires unpicking a Gordian knot of many interlinked factors: poverty, sectarian mistrust, political marginalisation and corruption. The risks posed by the climate crisis to the rainfall-dependent livelihoods of the people of Lake Chad are an important strand of this challenge.For years, the prevailing narrative about Lake Chad is that it has been in inexorable decline as a result of the over-extraction of water and climate crisis. A much-repeated factoid is that the lake shrunk by 90% between the 1960s and the 1990s. This statistic is employed to back up a compelling series of causal links to explain the many problems that the region faces. The story goes as follows: the declining lake has done farmers and fishermen out of their jobs, who have been recruited into armed groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State, fuelling the ongoing violence that blights the region.Under this logic, refilling the lake might seem a step worth taking – to reverse the decline of both lake and region. And the Inter Basin Water Transfer project proposes to do just that.It calls on international donors to bankroll the 2,400km (1,500 mile) Transaqua canal from the Ubangi river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Lake Chad, through war-torn Central African Republic, at an estimated cost of $50bn (£39bn) – roughly a third of the annual global aid budget. A feasibility study is already under way. Nigeria, with the support of the African Development Bank, is actively looking to raise the money needed for the project.Our two-year study of climate change and security risks in the Lake Chad region charts the hydrological health of the lake over the last 30 years.The conclusion – uncomfortably for the pipeline’s proponents – is that the lake is not actually shrinking. True, the size of the lake did fall steeply between the 1960s and the 1990s. True, the lake fluctuates dramatically over the course of each year and across decades. However, since the 1990s Lake Chad’s size has, on average, been stable. By some measures, it has even been growing.The story of an ever-shrinking lake has been built on snapshots of data – the extremes of lake size in the 1960s and 1990s – taken out of their wider context. It has proved to be a doubly convenient narrative for leaders in the region: it takes the spotlight off serious governance failures, which set the stage for the conflict in the first place, and it also makes the case for a highly lucrative, technical fix as the solution. The danger is that the canal will not address the various problems facing the region and instead, at best, provide multiple opportunities for corruption and personal enrichment for those involved and, at worst, exacerbate the region’s environmental and conflict challenges.Let’s be crystal clear here: we are not suggesting that the Lake Chad region is immune to the effects of the climate crisis, quite the opposite. Temperatures in the region are rising one and a half times faster than the global average. The unpredictability brought by climate change is worsening the political and economic conditions that gave rise to the violence in the first place. But, so far at least, it is not happening due to a shrinking lake.Lake Chad is caught in a conflict trap that undermines people’s ability to deal with the changes that an increasingly variable climate is bringing.A thorough, fact-based understanding of the interlinked climate and conflict risks facing Lake Chad is fundamental to appropriate solutions to ensure that hugely costly responses do not actually make things worse.Oli Brown is an associate fellow with the energy, environment and resources department of Chatham House (the Royal Institute of International Affairs)Janani Vivekananda is a senior advisor on climate change and peacebuilding at thinktank Adelphi"
"'Whistles, warnings, kaboom!': a day with a landmine clearance team","Aki Ra was a child soldier for Pol Pot, laying mines around Siem Reap. Now he is using his expertise to clear land in rural Cambodia and make it safe again",Jamie Fullerton,2019-10-22T06:01:14+0100,"The rusty tailfin of the mortar round can be seen poking through the roots and mud of a small dirt patch, next to a skull and crossbones sign.Aki Ra thinks the bomb could have been lying in rural Siem Reap, Cambodia, for 40 years. If it hadn’t been found, it may have added another death to the approximately 20,000 people killed by explosives laid in the country from the late 1960s to the 1990s.Ra, founder of Cambodian Self Help Demining (CSHD), and his team have found about 100 explosives in the two months they’ve been sweeping this 23-acre (9.5-hectare) site in Chi Kraeng district. Despite handling the devices every day since 2008, when the CSHD was formed, none of its workers have been injured by them.“Just by cobras,” Ra says. “We cut grass, cobra lives there, bites hand. I cut the skin, push blood out. Three times, no deaths.”Unimpeded by snakes today, Ra’s team dig around the bomb then carry it to a deeper hole. They move back to the safe end of a 100-metre wire attached to the projectile. Whistles, warning shouts – kaboom! Another one down, up to 6m in Cambodia to go.The Cambodian government wants the country free of landmines and unexploded ordnance by 2025.But with landmine casualties rising in Cambodia – 62 in the first half of 2019, up from 31 in the same period in 2018 – the goal seems unrealistic, if urgent.A woman introduced as Mrs Yorn had her left leg blown off by a mine hidden in foliage a few metres from her house when she was a teenager. She set off another when cutting grass, sending shrapnel tearing through her mouth. Hobbling with a crutch outside her wooden house, which backs onto minefields, Yorn, now 55, says her life is “difficult. Sometimes it hurts a lot because there are still fragments [of metal from landmines] in my body.”Ra’s mine-clearing team offers basic medical help to poor villagers they work near, as an extra service to those who can’t afford to travel to hospitals or buy medical equipment and medicine. However, removing metal embedded inside bodies is beyond their skill set.“I had a better life before I lost my leg,” says Yorn. “I worked hard and had a lot of food.” Now her family largely relies on charity – Ra sends an associate to his car to fetch a blanket and some money, as a donation. Yorn and a few of her young grandchildren press their hands together in thanks, as he returns to the vehicle.Poor villagers such as Yorn are forced to live on land that’s cheap because it is littered with mines.With 40 employees working across 10 provinces, the CSHD, which says it has cleared 175 minefields in the country since forming in 2008, targets villages overlooked by larger NGOs and the government’s Cambodian Mine Action Authority.“Another village needs us soon,” says Ra, as his team breaks for a quick meal of rice and fish. “If we stay too long, other villagers aren’t happy. So we have to move.”It’s tempting to view Ra’s career as a story of redemption. In the mid-1970s, aged around 10 (he’s not sure of his age, but thinks he’s 45), he was recruited by Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge. His parents were among the millions of Cambodians murdered by the regime.Ra waged jungle warfare against incoming Vietnamese forces, laying mines around Siem Reap. He wrote about the brutality of Khmer Rouge communes, but says that after he was handed an AK47 things improved. “I was happy to lay mines … the guns looked like toys. Machine guns, artillery, grenades, rockets … explosions and bangs were like music, drums. We were happy singing songs and fighting.”Fun with guns didn’t convert to true loyalty to the Khmer Rouge’s genocidal vision, and in the early 1980s Ra was convinced to join Vietnam forces. After the Vietnamese withdrew in 1990 he joined Cambodia’s national army, then as fighting subsided he helped civilian volunteers clearing mines.Metal detectors were not available back then. “I made a tool to unscrew mines with,” Ra says. “Then we’d use grass or wood to burn and destroy them.”He was motivated by repeatedly witnessing the devices’ deadly effects. “When some people lose a leg, at first they don’t know there’s been an explosion. Then the smoke finishes and they understand: ‘Oh, my leg is gone.’ Then the pain. During the war, some people had both legs blown up then would kill themselves. I’d say, ‘Stop, my friend!’, but they’d shoot.”Ra cleared mines with the UN when it sent peacekeeping forces to Cambodia in the early 1990s. “The UN showed me that the outside world has schools, hospitals, food. Then I understood. I threw out the bad things of the past. I wanted to make my country safe.”Realising he had a knack for handling explosives – plus a stockpile of defused mines he charged tourists a dollar to see – Ra opened the Cambodia Landmine Museum near Angkor Wat in 1997. He and his wife, Hourt, added a small orphanage, relocating the museum just north of Siem Reap city in 2007.With funding from US charity Landmine Relief Fund, Ra founded the CSHD. His actions saw him hailed a hero, but recently earned him less welcome attention.In August 2018, a small fire in Ra’s museum compound led police to discover grenades, bullets and mines that are illegal to own in Cambodia. Ra was detained on firearms charges, and the museum was closed for three months as officials considered its licensed status.Ra already had an uneasy relationship with authorities. His work, and that of other NGOs, highlighted the government’s failure to fully deal with landmines since Prime Minister Hun Sen came to power in 1985. The government says it needs huge foreign donations for landmine clearing. Meanwhile photos of the prime minister wearing a wristwatch worth millions of dollars have circulated online.With government critics regularly arrested in Cambodia, Ra is understandably reluctant to talk about brushes with the law. He will say that rice meals in jail were “not fresh”, and that during his detainment he slept – or rather didn’t sleep – in a room with 30 other inmates. “I’m OK,” he says. “I follow the rule. The rule can take me to jail.”Avoiding a lengthy conviction, Ra was eventually able to re-open his museum and get back to work. He has many years of mine clearing left in him, but hopes that the CSHD will eventually be taken over by some or all of his three children. He named his second child Mine.Ra isn’t short of admirers, such as 33-year-old Hak Hort. In the late 1990s Hort’s right leg was blown off by a mine that killed his brother and sister. He met Ra when he visited Hort’s village near Siem Reap to clear mines. Hort then went to live in the orphanage.“I was happy to live with him – it meant I could go to school,” says Hort during a visit to Ra’s museum. About 100 children have passed through the orphanage so far.Looking at a painting depicting a group of bodies mutilated by mines, next to sobbing villagers, Hort adds: “He’s helped a lot of people.” "
Lawyers challenge UK imports of 'slavery-tainted' Uzbek cotton,Rights team argues preferential tariffs promote goods produced by hundreds of thousands of unpaid labourers in Uzbekistan,Annie Kelly,2019-10-21T11:18:30+0100,"The government is facing legal action to try and stop the importation of cotton harvested with state-sponsored forced labour from Uzbekistan into the UK.The Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights and the Global Legal Action Network (Glan), a team of human rights lawyers, are launching a judicial review of preferential tariffs applied to Uzbek cotton, arguing that it is promoting the importation of goods tainted with modern slavery. The country has faced sustained criticism over the mass enforced mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of Uzbeks to work as unpaid labourers during harvest and planting seasons.The preferential tariffs applied to Uzbek goods are part of EU-wide trade measures designed to bolster economic cooperation between member states and Uzbekistan. The Glan says that these preferential trade measures are expected to continue if the UK exits the EU on the 31 October but hopes that the legal case may prompt the government to change its stance.Uzbekistan is one of the world’s biggest cotton producers. The sector generates more than $1bn (£770m) in annual revenue and this year is expected to harvest 2.9m tons of raw cotton.In recent years, following bans by international fashion brands alarmed by the accusations of forced labour in the supply chain of Uzbek cotton, the government has pushed through a series of reforms promising to eradicate child labour and the conscription of public sector employees.Yet human rights activists say that forced labour continues. Last year, a report by the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights found that at least 400,000 people were subject to state-sponsored forced labour in the cotton harvest in 2018.This year, despite the Uzbek president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, stating that no public sector employees will be involved in this year’s cotton harvest, local activists report that enforced manual labour of government employees such as firefighters, police officers, oil depot workers and public water company workers is ongoing.The UK currently only imports a small amount of cotton from Uzbekistan. Despite this, the Glan and the German-Uzbek Forum says that it hopes the judicial review will ultimately lay the groundwork for new legislation that would ban all goods made with child or forced labour from entering the UK. This type of legislation already exists in the United States. According to the global slavery index, UK consumers bought £14bn of goods made by slaves in 2017.“The judicial review is designed to force the government to reconsider actively encouraging the importation of goods made with slave labour into the UK,” said Gearóid Ó Cuinn, director of the Glan.“At present there is a torrent of goods that are entering our supply chains and are being sold to unwitting consumers that could be tainted with modern slavery and human misery. Nothing like this has been tried in the European courts before and I hope that this action we’re taking in the UK could potentially reverberate across the European continent.”The network has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds towards the cost of the case."
'They paid a guy to kill me': health workers fight homophobia in Uganda,A lesbian activist in a rural town has developed a new strategy to reach those most at risk of HIV,,2019-10-21T09:00:25+0100,"Maria Nantale is enjoying a beer at a rickety wooden bar after a long day’s work. “Forty people tested today,” she reflects. “Found three positives. One of them is in denial. She has run away.”Twice a week, from dawn until dusk, Nantale holds an “outreach” in the town of Mbale, population 76,000. The aim is to combat HIV among those most at risk: LGBT Ugandans, drug addicts and sex workers.She asks a local person to play some music while her “peer” educators discuss condom use and sexual health, and invite people to get tested for HIV. Her mobile lab is run by a trio of nurses, a lab technician and a psychological counsellor.Uganda has the 10th highest rate of HIV in the world – 6.2% overall and 7.6% among women. Across the country, more than 1.2 million people are believed to carry the virus that causes Aids.It is also one of the most homophobic countries in the world. Earlier this month an LGBT advocate was killed in the eastern Ugandan town of Jinja, not far from where Nantale works in Mbale. Last week, lawmakers said they would introduce legislation to bring in tougher punishments for homosexual acts, conjuring memories of the so-called “kill the gays” bill that was proposed in 2013 and initially included the death penalty for certain cases.As the law stands, homosexual acts can lead to sentences of up to 14 years in prison. LGBT people routinely face human and legal rights abuses by employers and police, or violence and harassment in their communities. Because homosexuality is illegal, LGBT people are often hesitant to seek medical attention for HIV/Aids.That’s why Nantale’s primary goal is to reach Mbale’s gay and transgender populations, and sex workers, who are at a higher risk of HIV. Studies estimate that sex workers in Uganda are about a third more likely to be HIV positive.The problem, says Nantale, is that many people in marginalised groups don’t get tested for the virus due to the double stigma of being both HIV positive and queer in a homophobic country. Nantale realised she needed to offer tests to everybody or risk giving credence to the belief that LGBT people are “sick” or diseased.A further complication is the fact that many rural LGBT Ugandans are transient or even homeless, having been ostracised by their families. By inviting entire communities to get tested in a public setting, Nantale creates a safe space for the most vulnerable.“It’s a strategy we use so that the LGBTI, sex workers and drug users can come out and get tested,” says Nantale. “Whenever people here have HIV, they run in the opposite direction. That’s what the counselling is for. Telling them it will all be fine.”As a lesbian herself and an outspoken woman in a male-dominated community, gaining people’s trust was no easy task. “This has taken me years,” she says.Nantale, director of the Eastern Region Women’s Empowerment Organisation, is an anomaly in Uganda. Most Ugandan LGBT activists busy themselves with a plethora of other problems, such as being arrested or extorted by police, or blackmailed by neighbours. Many teenagers are disowned by their families, and some are forced to flee Uganda as refugees.The method employed by the impeccably dressed, energetic anti-HIV campaigner is to attack that stigma head on, testing and counselling people outside and in public, in front of their friends, neighbours and family. One afternoon, residents looked on as a tall man in his 40s walked up to the collection of tables, benches and blankets Nantale’s team had set up on a small patch of land in one of Mbale’s crowded, low-income neighbourhoods. A nurse cleaned the man’s finger with a swab, then lightly pricked the tip. A tiny droplet of blood appeared, which she smeared on to a small white strip of testing paper, then used a cotton swab to stop the bleeding. Ten minutes later, his result was announced in front of the dozen or so people who were standing around: negative.Nantale says that once a few people get over the initial hurdle of participating, the entire neighbourhood tends to join in. “Some of them go and bring their partners. They bring their man,” says Nantale. She describes one octogenarian great-grandmother who never misses a test, just to feel apart of what’s going on. Nantale’s peer educators hand out male and female condoms.Nantale’s approach has garnered the attention of Ugandan LGBT rights organisations such as Sexual Minorities Uganda, and works with them on HIV/Aids awareness events. Her work has also attracted international donors such as USAid , which has funded her mobile clinics and implements the President’s Emergency Plan For Aids Relief (Pepfar) , a multibillion dollar global initiative that has proven incredibly effective at preventing and treating HIV/Aids.But the work doesn’t always go smoothly. One evening after an outreach session, Nantale spent nearly an hour searching for an HIV-positive trans teenager who had run away, throwing her antiretroviral medication into a drainage ditch out of shame, desperation, or both. Nantale tries to counsel those who test positive by explaining that HIV is not a death sentence. But for LGBT Ugandans, the roots of their depression often go far deeper than concerns about their own health.“Of the three people who tested positive that day, one was a lesbian, raped by her uncle,” says Nantale. “She’s devastated. She’s resting just nearby.”Numerous LGBT residents say violence is a common occurrence. Nantale herself says she was thrown into the path of a truck by a man hired by a group of village elders. “They paid a boda boda guy [motorcycle taxi driver] to kill me,” she says. “Homophobes,” she shrugs. Her LGBT activism is what drew the hit, but it was also what saved her. “Fortunately one of our sex workers, he recognised me for giving him free condoms. He put me in his trailer and rushed me to the hospital.”Nantale spent several weeks in a coma. Now she lives with her partner and their son in a safe house, with a security guard. She takes different routes to her office and to the outreach sessions, to avoid a repeat attack.Verbal abuse has forced some of Nantale’s friends to leave Mbale for Uganda’s more metropolitan capital. Life in Kampala offers a certain anonymity and freedom but also leaves many of them feeling isolated, lonely or depressed. “I could go to Kampala,” says Nantale, “but my grandma lives here. My uncle lives here.” To move is, in some ways, to leave one’s family behind.But the same families can ostracise. According to a 2016 global attitudes survey, 53% of Ugandans say that homosexuality should be a crime – the highest margin of all 10 African nations that were polled – and 19% say they would be upset if their child fell in love with someone of the same sex. But in the same survey, nearly 40% agreed that bullying of LGBT people is a significant problem. Such awareness, Nantale says, is cause for optimism.Nantale believes that attitudes in Mbale are beginning to shift. Just five years ago, after Uganda passed its new anti-gay law, Nantale was outed by the local newspapers as a lesbian. She was fired from her job, ridiculed in public. But now entire neighbourhoods know her by name, and respect her for her work providing healthcare in neglected communities.“I want people to focus more on my work, not on my orientation,” she says."
The Nobel peace prize can inspire Abiy Ahmed to new heights in Ethiopia,Global acclaim for the peace he forged with Eritrea should buoy a leader facing the persecution of ethnic minorities at home,,2019-10-21T07:00:22+0100,"The Nobel prize awarded last week to Ethiopia’s prime minister, Dr Abiy Ahmed, honoured his achievements as a peacemaker. Most widely recognised was his success in thawing relations with Eritrea, the breakaway republic with which Ethiopia had remained on a war footing since the country gained independence in 1993.No less significant, however, was his management of the internal conflict between the Ethiopian government and protesters in Oromia, the region surrounding Addis Ababa, the capital. Rather than attempting to shut down the protests by force, Abiy acknowledged their grievances, and opened up political space. He freed political prisoners jailed by previous administrations, and restored the legitimacy of parties formerly branded as terrorist organisations.Almost single-handedly, Abiy appeared to have restored people’s faith in their political institutions. Not only in Addis, but in provincial towns, administrative posts and truck stops across the country, posters and T-shirts bearing his image were proudly displayed, often accompanied by the Amharic word andinet, meaning “unity”. After an assassination attempt in June last year, he impressed by pleading for forgiveness and brotherhood.Among those who saw new hope for the future were members of the country’s pastoralist groups, who had long been accorded a marginal place in Ethiopia – both literally and figuratively – including Somalis, Oromos and many others in the country’s far north, east, south and west. For the first time in their lives, many felt they could have a government that fostered respect among all citizens.“Abiymania” would soon be shaken, however, as new conflicts reared their heads. The system of ethnic federalism, devised as a way of uniting a diverse coalition of peoples who had fought against the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam, had succeeded in bringing people together, but at a cost. Those who found themselves on the wrong side of an ethnically defined border, such as the Gedeo in Oromia, were subject to a new wave of persecution. The resulting conflicts left more people internally displaced than in any other country.If these events received less international coverage than they deserved, others of equal gravity have gone almost entirely unreported. In the past month, government forces have carried out indiscriminate killings in the Lower Omo region. Multiple reports, from independent sources, suggest that among the Bodi ethnic group at least 38 people – including women, children and the elderly – were shot or beaten to death by the military. Women were gang raped. Scores more have disappeared or are in hiding.Among the neighbouring Mursi people, a similar process appears to be underway, with reports of houses set on fire, beatings and treatment that amounts to torture: soldiers forcing people to sit all day in the equatorial sun, and denying men and women the simple dignity of privacy for urinating and defecating.South Omo, where these abuses are occurring, is a site of major infrastructure investments by the Ethiopian state and corporate partners. In 2016 the Gibe III dam was inaugurated upstream. By reducing the river’s natural flood, it allowed large sugar plantations to be established alongside the river, connected to the regional centres by an expanding network of roads.The Bodi and their neighbours were not consulted before these projects began, and lost their lands and livelihoods as plantations, roads and camps for migrant workers were established. The campaign of violence to which the military are now subjecting them threatens to destroy their social fabric entirely.Regardless of who issued the orders, the peace prize bestowed on Ethiopia’s prime minister is a call to halt these atrocities. When Abiy assumed power, it was by riding a wave of discontent over the displacement of poor farming communities around Addis Ababa, whose grievances he – uniquely among senior politicians in the country – had the courage to acknowledge. Whereas the displacement of communities in the vicinity of the capital sparked outrage, the unjust treatment of ethnic minorities has not, so far, attained the status of a popular issue.For the people of the Lower Omo, the situation is desperate. But for Ethiopia and its friends, there is still a chance of salvage. Working for peace, as Abiy well knows, inspires most when it is carried out not in good times – when people are already united – but when power appears to reside with the forces of violence and division.When Dr Martin Luther King accepted the Nobel peace prize in 1964, he spoke of leaving Oslo “inspired with renewed dedication to humanity”. We hope that, like King, Abiy will interpret the prize not as a capstone to his efforts, but as a commission to work harder than ever for peace and justice. By championing the cause of those on the margins, he would be fulfilling the highest duty of a statesman.• Jed Stevenson is an assistant professor of anthropology at Durham University in the UK.

Aid agencies accused of failure to make good on Oxfam abuse scandal pledges,MPs point to lack of progress on promised safeguarding improvements for whistleblowers and survivors,Karen McVeigh,2019-10-18T07:00:51+0100,"MPs have accused aid organisations of “dragging their feet” over combating sexual exploitation and abuse in the sector, despite safeguarding pledges made in 2018 after the Oxfam abuse scandal.Work to improve protection and support for whistleblowers has “stalled”, and more needs to be done to protect survivors, a report by the UK international development committee (IDC) has said.While MPs recognised efforts across the aid sector to improve safeguarding, they were “disappointed” by the lack of progress in key areas.In a report published on Thursday, the committee found limited progress had been made among NGOs on transparency, with some organisations still reluctant to publish the number of sexual abuse allegations they had received, and the outcome of investigations.The committee expressed concerns about the Department for International Development and Bond, the UK network for aid organisations, both of which “seem reluctant to take responsibility for driving up standards on whistle-blower protection”, they said.Measures by DfID and Bond aimed at providing better reporting and complaints mechanisms have focused too much on theory at the expense of ensuring changes in practice, the committee said. The MPs called for “an end to voluntary self-regulation” of aid agencies, which they said “allows failures on sexual exploitation and abuse to slip through the cracks”.Pauline Latham, a Conservative member of the IDC, said: “Some of the most vulnerable people in the world are being abused and they are being abused by people they should be able to trust. We need to support these people. This is a huge issue within the industry. We need to move faster and they are just dragging their feet.”The criticisms came as Alok Sharma, the fourth international development secretary in two years, issued a statement outlining steps made by DfID since February 2018 to put survivors first and drive culture change across the aid sector.“The international work led by DfID over the last year has generated good momentum and is starting to deliver results,” Sharma said in a statement. However, the accompanying progress report acknowledged that providing support to victims and survivors remains a “crucial challenge”, and recognised that more needs to be done.Sharma highlighted the introduction of a sexual misconduct disclosure scheme for employers, which had prevented the hiring of at least 10 individuals. He also called attention to the creation of a £10m register, using Interpol and national policing databases, designed to strengthen criminal record checks and stop perpetrators moving around the sector, announced at a DfID safeguarding summit in October 2018.The MPs urged DfID to champion an independent aid ombudsman, proposed by the Dutch government, to allow an alternative form of access to justice for survivors, and to monitor the safeguarding of the sector as a whole.“I want Britain to lead the world on this,” said Latham.Stephen Twigg, the committee’s chairman, said MPs had previously urged the aid community to work quickly to develop robust protections focused on “victims and survivors”.“In the year since, this work has sadly not progressed to the point it needs to be,” he said.“The success of reforms can only be judged by how they support victims and survivors in humanitarian situations across the globe. It is clear that in this respect much more work needs to be done. There should be sufficient resourcing in place to provide access to safeguarding staff on the ground, and improvement in how whistle-blowers are supported and protected.”In June, it emerged that Oxfam is investigating the suspected involvement of its humanitarian workers in a new sex-for aid scandal. The charity was issued with an official warning from the Charity Commission after it found Oxfam had failed to disclose allegations of child abuse in Haiti.Commenting on the IDC report, Asmita Naik, co-author of research published in 2002 that exposed sexual abuse by aid workers in west Africa, said: “Until these organisations are prepared to speak up and be honest, how on earth do they expect victims on the ground to do so? At the moment, they are still too defensive, too secretive.”She added: “Where’s the sense of urgency? Where are the changes on the ground? It still seems stuck at that top level policy. That is where it has been for years.”A DfID spokesperson said: “We will continue to take robust action and are making sure UK aid doesn’t go to organisations who fall short of our expected standards.”Stephanie Draper, CEO of Bond, said: “We value the IDC’s commitment to working with all sectors and DfID to improve safeguarding practices. However, it is a shame that months of hard work from the NGO sector to up its game across a wide range of aspects of safeguarding seems to have been overlooked in the committee’s report.”"
Sudden deaths of hundreds of migrant workers in Qatar not investigated,"Exclusive: in majority of cases, authorities do not perform postmortems, despite recommendations from regime’s lawyers",Pete Pattisson,2019-10-07T12:46:39+0100,"Qatar is failing to investigate the sudden deaths of hundreds of migrant works, the Guardian can reveal.Hundreds of labourers in the World Cup host nation die each year, with the majority of the fatalities attributed to heart attacks or “natural causes” by the Qatari authorities. Many are young men who die in their sleep – a phenomenon locally dubbed “sudden death syndrome”.Last week the Guardian reported that hundreds of thousands of workers were being exposed to potentially fatal levels of heat stress, toiling in temperatures of up to 45C for up to 10 hours a day. High temperatures put a huge strain on the cardiovascular system and cardiologists say there is a direct link between heat stress and the high numbers of young workers dying in the summer months. In most cases no autopsies are performed on the bodies of migrant workers, whose deaths have been attributed to cardiovascular or “natural” causes.In 2014, a report from the Qatari regime’s own lawyers, international law firm DLA Piper, “strongly” recommended that it commissioned research into the deaths of migrant workers from cardiac arrest. Yet so far it has failed to take action.At least 1,025 Nepalis died in Qatar between 2012 and 2017, 676 of them from causes deemed to be natural. The causes included cardiac arrest, heart attack, respiratory failure and “sickness”, according to a number of official sources, including the Foreign Employment Board, a government agency in Nepal responsible for the welfare of migrant workers. The FEB’s data is largely derived from death certificates issued in Qatar.Data from the Indian government reveals that 1,678 Indians died in Qatar between 2012 and August 2018. Of these deaths, 1,345 were classified as “natural” – a rate of four each week.Qatari law prohibits postmortem examinations except in cases where a crime may have been committed or the deceased may have suffered from an illness prior to death.However, the 2014 DLA Piper report recommended that the law “be extended to allow for autopsies or postmortem examinations in all cases of unexpected or sudden deaths”.A forensic expert in Qatar told the Guardian that in the majority of these cases, only an external examination is performed to determine the cause of death.Qatar’s reluctance to perform autopsies has left families across south Asia confused and suspicious about how their loved ones died.Rupchandra Rumba was working as a scaffolder at the Education City World Cup stadium when he died in his labour camp in June this year. He was 24. Rumba’s death certificate identified the cause of death as “acute cardio respiratory failure due to natural cause”.Shortly after his death, Rumba’s wife, Nirmala Pakrin, received a call from his boss. “He said: ‘We tried our best to treat him but he didn’t survive. We took him to the hospital for autopsy.’”But no autopsy was carried out, said Pakrin. “There were some blood stains around his mouth and nose, but the rest of his body was untouched.”A Qatar government official said that according to the law, families of the deceased must approve an autopsy before it is carried out.“In most cases related to guest workers, families refuse an autopsy due to a desire to have the body returned as quickly as possible for the completion of religious burial or cremation rites. This creates a difficulty in respect of investigating the cause of death in some cases,” the official said.However, the Guardian spoke to the families of three Nepali workers who died in Qatar in the past 18 months, including Pakrin. None had been asked whether they wanted an autopsy.Kausik Ray, a professor of public health at Imperial College London, said: “People aged 20 to 50 in general don’t die in their sleep suddenly … You could not say they died from heart failure or respiratory failure without a postmortem, unless you had information about their prior [medical] history.”Ganesh Gurung, a member of the Policy Research Academy, a government thinktank in Nepal, said death certificates are largely a formality, issued to satisfy the requirements of the airlines that transport the bodies home.“Because it’s just a formality, the doctors tend to issue certificates based on hearsay. In most cases, they do not even bother to examine the dead bodies, let alone conduct a postmortem. Postmortems are extremely rare, because they require time and money. Why would they bother to spend time and money on the dead?”Gurung said mandatory postmortems should be incorporated into all bilateral labour agreements between Nepal and the countries where its migrant labourers work.Nick McGeehan, a director of Fair/Square Projects, an organisation that conducts research on Gulf migrant workers, said the findings expose a lack of concern for workers’ welfare. “The law on autopsies is further evidence of the different value that’s attached to the lives of low-paid migrant workers. If hundreds of Gulf nationals or westerners were dying every year in unexplained circumstances, there would be uproar and money would be thrown at this issue.”"
Revealed: hundreds of migrant workers dying of heat stress in Qatar each year,"As construction boom hits its peak ahead of Fifa World Cup, Guardian analysis shows workers toiling in potentially fatal temperatures",Annie Kelly,2019-10-02T06:00:18+0100,"Migrant labourers are being worked to death in searing temperatures in Qatar, with hundreds estimated to be dying from heat stress every year, a Guardian investigation can reveal.This summer, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers toiled in temperatures of up to 45C for up to 10 hours a day as Qatar’s construction boom hit its peak ahead of the Fifa World Cup 2022.The Qatari authorities, in line with other countries across the Gulf, have said they are protecting workers from heat-related injuries through a work ban that prohibits manual labour in unshaded outdoor areas between 11.30 and 3pm from mid-June to August.Yet a Guardian analysis of official weather data over a nine-year period showed that the working ban does not keep workers safe. In the hours outside the ban, anyone working outdoors is still being exposed to potentially fatal levels of heat stress between June and September, which cardiologists say is leading to high numbers of fatalities every year.Our analysis also found dangerous levels of heat exposure continues into the cooler months.Doha is currently hosting the World Athletics Championships, with athletes and sports professionals describing extreme heat conditions over the weekend. Yet outside of the air-conditioned stadiums, workers remain at risk of serious harm from heat stress between 9am and 12 noon throughout October.Working in high temperatures puts a huge strain on the human cardiovascular system, with extreme heat stress leading to fatal heart attacks and other cardiovascular fatalities, recent research has shown.Every year hundreds of workers – many young men between 25 and 35 years old – die while working in Qatar. The majority of these deaths are attributed to cardiovascular causes or “natural death” by the Qatari authorities.Yet recent research published in the Cardiology Journal by a group of leading climatologists and cardiologists concluded that the deaths were likely to be caused by heatstroke, exploring the correlation between the deaths of 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017, and rising temperatures.The research found that in the cooler months about 22% of deaths year-on-year were attributed to heart attacks, cardiac arrest or other cardio-related causes by the Qatari authorities. In the summer months this spiked to 58%.“From our research it was clear that workers are being recruited in their home countries partly on the basis of their health and are arriving in the Gulf fit for work,” said Dr Dan Atar, professor of cardiology and head of research at Oslo University Hospital, who co-authored the research into cardiovascular deaths and heat stress.In one minute I'm soaked in sweat“Young men have a very low incidence of heart attacks yet hundreds of them are dying every year in Qatar attributed to cardiovascular causes. The clear conclusion that I draw from this as a cardiologist is that these deaths are caused by deadly heatstroke. Their bodies cannot take the heat stress they are being exposed to.”Atar said that according to the research, as many as 200 of the 571 young men who died of cardiovascular causes between 2009 and 2017 could have been saved if effective heat protection measures had been implemented as part of occupational health and safety programmes.Qatar’s construction boom ahead of the 2022 Fifa World Cup has seen the country’s migrant worker population rise to 1.9m, many of these young men from Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan who travel to the country to build the stadiums, roads and hotels that will service the tournament.Of the 11 worker fatalities of workers linked to Fifa World Cup stadiums recorded by Qatar’s Supreme Committee, the body responsible for workers’ health and safety last year, nine were attributed to sudden heart attacks or respiratory failure.“With the World Cup only two years away, the high number of deaths of young men from cardiac arrest in Qatar must be investigated urgently,” said Nick McGeehan, director of Fair/Square Projects, which has conducted research on heat stress and migrant worker rights. “For years human rights campaigners have been raising the impact of heat stress on worker fatalities and yet the deaths continue.”In Doha, a sign outside one construction site warned workers to “Beat the heat” and “Quench your thirst – safety first”, but a Kenyan labourer dressed in sweat-stained pale blue overalls said there was no clean drinking water on the site. “When it’s hot it’s too tough. I’m not used to this climate … I never liked it since I came here. You feel so much stress,” he said.Speaking to the Guardian this August, migrant workers said they suffered from a range of heat-related conditions, including skin allergies, headaches, altered vision, light-headedness and difficulty breathing. “In one minute I’m soaked in sweat,” said one Nepali construction worker.The Guardian used weather data from 2008-2017 to calculate the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) for Qatar, an internationally used metric that uses wind speed, solar radiation, humidity and air temperature to assess the impact of heat stress on the human body.A WGBT reading of 28C and above is internationally accepted as the point at which the human body is dangerously affected by heat stress.Our analysis found that:In June, before the summer work ban comes into effect on the 15th of the month, it is only safe to work for a maximum of 15 minutes an hour between 9am and 3pm. Some days no work at all can be done without serious risk to workers’ health. In July, despite the summer work ban, workers are still exposed to high levels of heat stress between 6am and 3pm, and some days well into the evening. Anyone working outside should have worked a maximum of 15 minutes an hour between 9 and 12.In August it is unsafe to work outside in Qatar between 6am and 9pm. According to the WBGT analysis, between 9am and 12 noon outdoor work should be stopped entirely. From 3-6pm, work should only be resumed for 15 minutes an hour to avoid physical harm from the heat. After the outdoor working ban ends on 31 August, it continues to be very dangerous to work outdoors throughout September. Heat stress is a serious risk between 6am and 3pm. Until 19 September, work should be stopped entirely between 9am and 3pm.Qatar’s Supreme Committee, which is in charge of worker welfare on World Cup sites, said they had put in place a series of measures to mitigate the risk of heat exposure, including requiring contractors to run heat stress management plans and provide temperature and humidity readings during the summer period. This year it said it also provided thousands of workers with cooling towels and cooling vests.The Qatari authorities and the Supreme Committee also said it had conducted research with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and climate academics to assess the impact of workplace heat stress on workers, which looked at mitigation measures including on-site cooling rooms and improving rest break schedules.As well as the 11.30am-3pm work ban, the Qatari authorities have instructed employers that labourers should not work more than five hours during the summer period.However implementation appears patchy. In Doha this August, as temperatures reached 42C by 11am, migrant workers told the Guardian they were being forced to work in the searing heat for up to 10 hours a day.Fatalities from heat stress can be avoided if workers are able to access immediate medical assistance, yet some workers interviewed in Qatar said their employer refused to issue them Qatari health cards or allow them access to medical facilities if they fell ill.“We get a 30-minute break in eight hours,” said one man from Bangladesh working on a construction site near Doha. “If we take an extra 20-minute break, they tell us to do an extra 20 minutes’ work.”A government spokesperson said, “We know that working conditions, particularly in summer, can be challenging and that heat stress needs particular attention … which is why we have introduced legislation to manage this in 2007 and, more recently, national heat stress guidance.”The findings of the weather analysis highlight the significant challenges that rising temperatures across the world pose to industries like construction. Recent estimates from the ILO and UNDP shows potential losses of up to 10% of annual work hours by 2030 in the hottest countries.“As global temperatures rise because of the climate crisis, the health risk posed by heat stress will have devastating health consequences for millions, yet is still not being seen as the emergency that it is,” says Professor Tord Kjellstrom, a consultant on environmental and occupational health for the United Nations and co-author of the Cardiology Journal report. “This has to change.”The Guardian collaborated with Erik Hansson, a doctoral candidate at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, who calculated the wet-bulb globe temperature values at regular intervals for each day between May 2008 and October 2017. Our analysis used the median values for each day and interval.Wet-bulb globe temperature attempts to capture the full effects of heat exposure on human health. The internal heat production – the physical activity – should also be considered. Our analysis assumes construction work to be at least “moderate” intensity, as it is classified in safety standards.The thresholds for safe working practices were calculated using the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) guidelines. WBGT readings above 28C were considered to be dangerous for moderate work. Temperatures above this point were assumed to require breaks for 25-75% of working time. At WBGT values above 31.5, any work, regardless of breaks, was considered unsafe."
"From Qatar to Vietnam, global heating is making the workplace deadly for millions",Regular exposure to dangerously high temperatures poses a grave and growing threat to workers around the world,,2019-10-02T11:40:59+0100,"By now, many of us recognise that we are confronting a climate emergency on a vast scale, and that rising temperatures will threaten the lives of millions across the planet. Severe heat waves have already killed many thousands of people over the past decade, but what is less recognised is that rising temperatures are also, slowly but surely, bringing more dangerous heat stress into our daily lives.Millions of people work outside or in uncooled indoor environments every day. People working in construction, agriculture, fishing, forestry or the military often work intensively in direct sun for extended periods of time. Millions of workers in indoor factories, warehouses and workshops are also exposed to excessive workplace heat. A study of a garment factory in Cambodia predominantly employing young women showed indoor temperatures as high as 37C.Working in high temperatures is dangerous because extreme heat prevents the body from adequately cooling, causing the core body temperature to rise. The longer the body remains overheated, the greater the risk of heat-related illnesses such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and, in extreme circumstances, death.Heat fatalities are already happening. This summer, I collaborated on research that analysed the deaths of Nepalese construction workers in Qatar and showed the fatal effect of heat stress during the hottest months. We found that hundreds of deaths could have been avoided if workers had not been forced to toil for long hours outside in searing heat.On the other side of the world, hundreds of young sugar cane harvesters in Central America have already died from chronic kidney failure linked to excessive sweating and dehydration during heavy outdoor work.As the number and intensity of hot days increases, more and more working people will face even greater challenges to avoid heat stress, particularly the two-thirds of the global population who live in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Heat exhaustion threatens the livelihoods of millions and undermines efforts to reduce poverty.I was first confronted by the issue of hot working conditions while visiting factories in Vietnam where excessive heat seriously affected production during the hottest months of the year. Around the same time, I was part of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) meeting reporting on the effects of climate change on population health. I listened as successive speakers reported on the effects of climate change on agriculture, forestry and other industries. Not one mentioned the effects of heat on working people.Years later and the threat to human health and economic survival from excessive heat exposure still receives little attention in the debate about the global climate emergency. Yet the few analyses available on the negative economic effects of heat on working people and their labour productivity indicate major impacts. The International Labour Organization estimates global productivity losses equivalent to 80 million full-time jobs could occur by 2030 in the hottest countries.It is not enough to say that air conditioning or changing our working patterns will overcome the health threat of excessive heat. For many of the most affected, this is simply not possible. A migrant worker in Qatar or a sewing machine operator in Vietnam often have little control over their working environment or the potentially deadly levels of heat stress to which they may be exposed. Global heating is a serious threat both to workers’ lives and the livelihoods of millions of people. Emerging policies on climate must take this into account if we are to have any chance of getting to grips with what is ahead.Professor Tord Kjellstrom is a visiting fellow at the Australian National University’s national centre for epidemiology and population health"
'I fear for the children': the families battling to beat the odds in Kibera – photo essay,"Family takes many shapes and guises – and in Africa’s largest slum the ties of love and blood are especially tested, cruelly sculpted by epidemics like HIV as well as strained by economic and climate crises",Tracy McVeigh,2019-08-08T11:09:08+0100,"Rosemary Achia, 53, has two daughters. One has a job washing clothes in Nairobi and the other works in a hotel, so all seven grandchildren live with her.“I am a little old for this,” she says. “I have been 11 years a widow. He was a good man but God gives and God takes away.”Now she takes in washing, knits pullovers, and sells tomatoes.“When you are alone, you have to do everything. You cannot choose.”As she talks, twitching at the yarn dollies on the armchair that she crochets at a church women’s craft group, Velma, 12, Mary, 11, and 10-year-old Owen are poking through the plastic sheeting on the roof, looking for the small dead body of a rat we can all smell but not find.Along with Millicent, 26, Ashly, nine, and Junior, two, they live in two cell-sized rooms, swept and clean. “My biggest worry is my daughters will find new husbands and forget these children. I can just about feed them, but it is a challenge. I am afraid for these children growing up in this slum. Last week two were drowned because of the water, the river came into the house. The mother went after the baby when it was swept out. It’s sad, very sad. If anything happened to my children like that I would too follow them.“They tell us they are going to build proper houses here and knock down our homes soon. So I am preparing to take them all back to the country. I am saving, and I hope by December we can go.” Rosemary needs £60 to buy them all a ride on a lorry back to her village. But, like many in Kibera, she hasn’t been back to the rural area where she was born since 1974 and has only word of mouth to rely on for what might await her there.“I came here because of hunger. I’m still here.”Collins holds his baby daughter, Raquelle, who is 11 months old, as he stands with her mother, Sharon, 23, next to the Nygong river that flows through the centre of Kibera. The couple are not married, but have been together for four years and live with Collins’ aunt. His parents died when he was very young. “Life is hard in Kibera, there is no work and every day we must go out and find a way of feeding our baby.”Mary Anyang, 49, has been mending and sewing school uniforms for several generations of Kibera children in a narrow, doorless space between two shops on a busy lane. She came to the slum from western Kisumu as a young bride in “search of greener pastures”. Her eyes are not so good now but her daughter-in-law, Janet Anyang, helps her. Her son Elisha, a construction worker, has just turned up after work to look after Brighton for a while so that the women can work.“I cannot remember how long I have been sewing or when I learned it, but business is good and my family are all here. My son has a job in construction, my daughters both are here. Work is constant: I cannot keep up and my back can get very sore, but we are a good family, no trouble – and children will always need uniforms.”Construction worker Michael Wandera Kwoba sits on a damp sofa with his daughter, Elizabeth Akumu Kwoba. He isn’t sure how old she is. His wife suffered a mental breakdown in the slum and left Kwoba and their six children. He isn’t sure where she is. The other five children were sent to live with his mother in a rural area. He says he is an alcoholic.“I drink for something to occupy my life. I wake up around 6am for work and come back around 8pm and then I find [Elizabeth] in the neighbour’s house. She misses her mother, obviously, but also her brothers and sisters. But God willing I can keep affording the school fees for this one; sometimes it’s difficult.”The day after this photo was taken he relinquished responsibility for his daughter, accepting that his drinking made him unable to look after her. Her teachers found Elizabeth a place in a small residential school for girls run by a local woman.Cody Achieng wanted to be a singer, and a few years ago spent all her savings on making a music video that she cannot afford to show anyone because she has no data credit on her phone. She has a strong, soulful voice but for now she runs a stall, with piles of mixed secondhand socks on a tarpaulin.At 13, she was forcibly married off to an abusive man by her father. Now she is 29 and has four children. None of the fathers have anything to do with the family, and it is noticeable that her neighbours don’t treat her with the customary friendliness or warmth.Achieng’s husband abandoned her after she was badly burned by a cooking stove accident. Destitute, she was taken in by a man who raped her and pimped her.“I try to do the best for the children, my eldest son goes to school,” she says with pride, “but it is hard to find the rent [£30] every month.”Several years ago, Achieng met a foreign charity worker visiting Kibera who promised she would write to her and help her with her ambitions. She still hopes that woman might return.Jacqueline and James Onyango with their first baby Wesley at their home in Kibera. Jacqueline was badly burned down her arm and leg when the stove collapsed on her a few months ago.Sitting happily gossiping and laughing between two elderly friends, Mary Nasia is a widow with no children or relatives. “I have been here for 10 years, since my husband died and I had no way to support myself in our old home.“But I have friends here and I sell my beans every day and I have no one to please but myself. I am 63 and Kibera is my family. I am very happy here. Each day comes as a blessing to me and people like my beans.”Fred Openo, his wife Beatrice Ouma and their children pose for a photograph outside their home.The couple work together, buying ground nuts from market traders in Nairobi early in the morning and bringing them back into Kibera to sell in small packets or plastic bottles. With this money they are trying to save up so they can afford to send their children to school when they are older.Celestine, 19, holds her son Raven at a health clinic in Kibera. She is a single mother living temporarily with an aunt in Kibera, but she says “it’s difficult” because she doesn’t bring in any money and there are two mouths to feed. Her own mother threw her out of the family home when she fell pregnant. Teenage pregnancy is still a stigma in Kibera for unmarried young women. It is very hard for girls and women to access family planning services, both in terms of availability and because of the taboo around sex outside marriage.Roseline Amondi is known in her area of Kibera as “Mama Fish” for the fresh tilapia and Nile perch she sells. She owns one of the very few fridges in the slum and is always being asked to store things for neighbours. She is also a port of call for lost children. “Many children in Kibera get lost, they wander away and can’t find their way home. There’s so many people that do not know each other that it is very easy for a child to be lost and be unsafe. People will bring children to me because they know the child will be safe here. Sometimes I have many!” she laughs.Of her eight children, four are birth children and four are orphans that she is raising as her own. Amondi has a reputation for wisdom and is often called on to be both marriage and family guidance counsellor in her community.“I got married at 18, when I was still a child. It was not a good idea and he was not a good man. It takes a long time to have the courage to leave a bad situation when you are such a young girl. Many girls rush in to marriage at 13, 17 – it’s too young. I tell the young people, go to school, wait. My daughter was a teenage mum but I did not throw her out, I would not do that to my child, they should be allowed to make mistakes. I try to tell other mothers and fathers in Kibera, value your child. Love that child.”"
Life in the 'hairy underground': the lost history of Soviet hippies,"It was a subculture shaped by communism, inspired by the west – and watched by the KGB. Now, a new documentary charts the movement’s charismatic leaders, conflicts and future",Luke Harding,2019-10-23T06:00:45+0100,"In 1968, Aksel Lampmann was a teenager growing up in Soviet Estonia. That summer, he went to an international camp, where he met students from Czechoslovakia and began listening to the Beatles. He didn’t understand the lyrics (“No one spoke English back then”), but loved the sound. “We had no clue what they were singing about. What a strange vibration!”He learned guitar and grew his hair. By 1969, Lampmann had become a full-blown Soviet hippy. The iron curtain made a road trip to the US impossible, so he hitchhiked from his home in the Baltics to Crimea. “Our lives were more colourful, more alive,” he says. “Other people didn’t have the same encounters or emotions.”Lampmann is one of the stars of Soviet Hippies, a film by the Estonian writer and director Terje Toomistu about a lost period in Soviet history. The documentary explores a subculture that was inspired by the west yet distinctly homegrown – existing in a society shaped by communism and watched over by the KGB.“In the west, nobody was arrested simply for having long hair or wearing strange clothes,” Toomistu explains. The USSR, by contrast, wanted complete control of its citizens’ lives: how people worked, dressed, or even danced. Anyone who rejected the Homo sovieticus model could be in “big trouble”, including having their hair forcibly cut.The Soviet hippy movement emerged in Moscow and Leningrad around 1966 and 1967, in the early years of Leonid Brezhnev’s rule. The first red hippies were the sons or daughters of the privileged Soviet nomenklatura – well-behaved kids from elite families. They had access to music from the capitalist world and to jeans. By the early 70s, the movement had grown sufficiently big and unruly to alarm the authorities – though it probably only ever numbered a few thousand, Toomistu says. The secret police began tailing the long-haired to school. In June 1971, the hippies were given permission to demonstrate against the Vietnam war outside the US embassy in Moscow.This was a trap. The KGB rounded up and arrested demonstrators, with the goal of wiping out hippy culture. Some demonstrators were sent to psychiatric facilities and injected with insulin; others dispatched to the army and camps near the Chinese border. The film re-creates this grim clampdown and uses surveillance photos found in KGB archives in Lithuania.According to Lampmann, harassment by the police and KGB was common. “One of my close friends ended up in prison,” he says. Hippies were persecuted under criminal rather than political law. They could find themselves sharing a cell with gangsters and murderers. To avoid arrest, Lampmann always kept his documents in perfect order.By the late 70s, the hippies had developed a counterculture, with Russian slang and a music scene. There was what Toomistu calls “analogue Facebook” – notebooks listing names and numbers of contacts across the USSR, used by travellers seeking somewhere to crash for the night. This network is gloriously animated in the film, which features psychedelic drawings and cartoons.The underground subculture connected people from different social backgrounds, the writer Vladimir Wiedemann says. It included hippies, dissidents, mystics, religious activists and human-rights campaigners. Some embraced spiritualism, others yoga and veganism. All rejected the Soviet regime and thus played a role in its eventual demise.Wiedemann was exposed to rock’n’roll culture via Finnish TV and Radio Luxembourg, which he could pick up from his home in Estonia. “The iron curtain wasn’t that strong,” he says. Now based in London, Wiedemann wrote a book on hippies, Forbidden Union, which is currently running as a play, How Estonian Hippies Brought Down the Soviet Union!, on the Moscow stage...The film features interviews with Wiedemann and other survivors from the “hairy underground”, as Toomistu puts it. Most are men, still espousing hippy ideas and with beards and hair still flowing but grey. There are fewer Soviet female hippies, Toomistu says; many left the scene to have children. The movement’s charismatic leaders are largely dead, often from drink and drugs.These were widely available under Marxism. Forbidden from travelling physically beyond the eastern bloc, Soviet hippies instead became “psychonauts”, Toomistu says. They consumed weed from central Asia and the Caucasus, opium and poppy tea. Some drank Sopals, a Soviet cleaning detergent containing ether.Toomistu grew up in post-Soviet Estonia. She was interested in the hippy scene as a teenager, and was a fan of Jim Morrison. She spent half a year in Russia as a student, and wrote a thesis about memory culture. The idea for the film came together after her own road trip in South America, she says. She is currently completing an anthropology PhD. There is little archive material on communist-era hippies, whom the Soviet press ignored, Toomistu says, erasing them from history. She retrieved a box of video footage of festivals and gatherings from a hippy who had to leave Russia in a hurry. In 2017, several of her subjects went to a hippy reunion held every year at Moscow’s Tsaritsyno Park, to mark the 1971 demo busted by the KGB.The reunion is poignant. Russia’s war in Ukraine and its 2014 annexation of Crimea divided opinion. Some hippies support Vladimir Putin and his idea of a great spiritual Russia. Others take a more traditional pacifist view that all war is bad. The film ends with Putin’s police breaking up the party. It is a metaphor for state-hippy relations, now and then.Soviet Hippies is being screened by Dash Café at Rich Mix, London, on 23 October."
"Terminator: Dark Fate review – Arnie's back, and it's never going to stop",James Cameron co-produces the latest in the humans v machines odyssey – featuring a fierce Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg Grandpa Walton,Peter Bradshaw,2019-10-23T00:00:16+0100,"So in Terminator’s beginning is his end and in his time-travel action franchise is the ending that brings him back round to another beginning: basically replaying the famous elements from T1 and T2 with some new actors, new twists, newish attitudes to sexual politics, famous lines slightly changed (“Come with me or you’ll be dead in 30 seconds”) and with Arnie himself good-humouredly assuming a wise old-timer attitude, like a cyborg Grandpa Walton.The Terminator franchise has come clanking robotically into view once again with its sixth film – it absolutely will not stop – not merely repeating itself but somehow repeating the repetitions. Terminator: Dark Fate is co-produced by its original creator, James Cameron, who has also co-written the story. It’s that type of late-period action movie we have seen with Sly Stallone’s Rocky and Rambo properties: a kind of endstopped reboot, which gives the series a new lick of paint, younger cast members, a sprinkling of up-to-the-minute social touches, while also conveying a solemn finality, as if graciously acknowledging its own classic status – though certainly keeping the door open for more films.So much has happened since Cameron’s sci-fi action classic from 1984 made a mainstream icon and star of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The 1991 sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day – although in my view lacking the steely clarity and force of the original – was dynamically filmed and a huge smash. Then we had a tiresome run of rusty turkeys on a laborious back-to-the-future theme: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Salvation (2009) – without Arnie – and the irritatingly spelt Terminator Genisys (2015). In the course of all this, Schwarzenegger found time for a brief tenure as governor of California and Christian Bale, playing freedom fighter John Connor in Terminator Salvation, became notorious for an on-set rage-filled meltdown, tape-recorded and uploaded to the web.But now we are in Mexico, close to the Texas border, almost three decades on from the second Terminator, where smart young auto worker Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) finds herself being menaced by a terrifying humanoid-robotic figure who descends naked to Earth in a crackle of lightning in the time-honoured manner: Gabriel Luna has the stern but featureless T2-ish role of the Terminator-Who-Disappointingly-Isn’t-Arnie. But then another figure comes down to Earth stark naked and is apparently on Dani’s side: this is Grace (Mackenzie Davis): a female equivalent of the gallant Kyle Reese from the first film. Then the legendary figure of Sarah Connor herself, played by Linda Hamilton, appears with some heavy weaponry, also intent on saving young Dani, and she is not the only one who is to be on her side. It won’t be long before the great Austrian-American appears, the Terminator ancestor, now living incognito like someone in a witness protection programme, and pretending to be a curtain-fitter called Carl. It’s a pretty droll appearance for the great man.So you don’t need an MA in terminatorology studies to figure out that this Dani is someone destined to be of enormous importance to the humans’ resistance uprising against their future oppression by the Skynet tyranny. But wait. Wasn’t that supposed to have been forestalled by Sarah Connor’s heroic efforts? Erm, yeah, but then there was a new oppression from some machines called Legion. Oh.Basically, Arnold is called upon to reprise a character I always thought was fundamentally wrong: the nice Terminator, the Terminator on the side of the angels, although Hamilton’s Sarah Connor has some fierce dialogue scenes with him, unconvinced that he can be anything other than evil. It’s good to see Hamilton getting a robust role, although, sadly, she has to concede badass superiority to Davis. This sixth Terminator surely has to be the last. Yet the very nature of the Terminator story means that going round and round in existential circles comes with the territory."
We should feel sorry for Jared Leto. His Joker never had a chance,The actor’s Suicide Squad character had been sidelined long before Todd Phillips’s film starring Joaquin Phoenix as Batman’s arch enemy was greenlit,Ben Child,2019-10-22T13:21:45+0100,"Would it really be surprising that Jared Leto had tried to stop Todd Phillips’s Joker from being made? This is what a piece in the Hollywood Reporter suggests, though the claim is said to have been denied by a representative for Leto and by Warner Bros.It might seem ridiculous to fans that a film that has taken more than $700m (£541m) at the global box office and (at least initially) wowed critics could have been swatted from the schedules at the whim of an actor who barely appeared as the clown prince of Gotham in 2016’s Suicide Squad. And yet that would be to forget the circumstances in which Leto found himself cast as Batman’s nemesis five years ago, and was subsequently thrown to the slavering hounds by Warner Bros.In 2014, when the studio announced that Leto was to star as the Joker, the actor-turned-musician had just won his first Oscar, for playing a transgender drug addict in Jean-Marc Vallée’s Dallas Buyers Club. Before this, he had hardly acted for five years, preferring to focus on his suddenly successful rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars. By all accounts, Leto was choosing roles very carefully during this period, so it came as a shock (and coup for Warner Bros) when he was announced as the world’s most infamous supervillain.By all accounts, Leto threw himself into the role with method mania, reportedly sending a letter and video to fellow stars apologising for not joining them for early rehearsals, accompanying his missive with a live rat for Margot Robbie (his on-screen paramour, Harley Quinn), some bullets for Will Smith (Deadshot) and a dead pig for the entire cast. Warner suits, aware of the potency such a blend of recent Oscar-winner and iconic role would bring to the table, must have been head over heels at the publicity.With all this fuss, fans expected Leto’s Joker to emerge as the leader of the Suicide Squad, a gang of colourful Dirty Dozen-style supervillain miscreants put together by questionable authorities (Viola Davies’s Amanda Waller) to take down an even worse threat: Cara Delevingne’s acting. We will never know quite what the original plan was, but when David Ayer’s film finally emerged, Leto was reduced to a bit-part player. A bit of torture here and there, some hanging around with Harley in nightclubs, and then completely absent from the movie’s main narrative.The Oscar winner could perhaps have been forgiven for thinking that this would never have happened in the 70s. Imagine if Robert De Niro had gained 60 pounds for Raging Bull, only to be told that his scenes had been excised. Then imagine the shock when Warner green-lit a Joker origins movie starring Joaquin Phoenix as a completely different version of the supervillain. This was precisely the kind of movie Leto probably thought he was going to be making at some point when he signed on to play the part. The dream opportunity to get under the character’s powder-caked skin.Leto had every chance to assume he'd be playing the Joker in further movies – otherwise why cast him in the first place?This kind of thing would never have happened at Marvel, either. The last time a star was cast in a big role at the Disney-owned studio, then kicked to the kerb, was 2010, when it was announced that Ed Norton, the somewhat sickly green giant in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk, would not reprise the role in The Avengers (unless one counts Terrence Howard’s replacement by Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes in 2010’s Iron Man 2, reportedly over pay). Leto had every chance to assume he would be playing the Joker in further movies over the next decade – otherwise why cast him in the first place?Thanks to Warner’s chaotic approach to comic-book world building, that never happened. The Hollywood Reporter now suggests Leto-Joker is done as a going concern, something that ought to have been pretty obvious as soon as James Gunn’s Suicide Squad 2 and Cathy Yan’s Birds of Prey were announced without the actor’s involvement. In any case, neither movie had an obvious place for the cackling villain, so it would not be a surprise to learn that Leto turned them down – perhaps fearing a repeat of earlier experiences.Phillips’s Joker is the movie Leto really needed to showcase his talents and begin developing a multi-movie character arc, but Phoenix was handed the role instead. The whole thing smacks of terrible planning. Like the unfortunate Arthur Fleck himself in Phillips’s film, it seems Leto never really had a chance."
Jennifer Aniston’s daily schedule: a 16-hour fast – and celery juice as a treat,"The star’s wellbeing secrets include fasting, meditation and five workouts a week. But when does she have fun?",,2019-10-22T13:05:38+0100,"Name: Jennifer Aniston.Age: 50.Appearance: Almost the same.Almost the same as what? Almost the same as how she looked 20 years ago, when she was starring in the hit series Friends, according to MailOnline.Amazing. What is the secret of her youthful appearance? Not eating.That doesn’t sound ideal at all. Well, more specifically, she’s adopted an “intermittent fasting” regime, more commonly known as the 16:8 diet.Is it like the 5:2 diet, except you starve for 16 days and then binge for 8 days? No, in this case the numbers represent hours. “I noticed a big difference in going without solid food for 16 hours,” Aniston told the Radio Times.Sixteen hours without food? By the time you’re allowed to eat, it would be past your bedtime! Fortunately, your sleeping hours are counted as part of the fasting period. You just have to delay breakfast until 10am.I could probably just stay in bed until then, as long as I were allowed to eat what I liked afterwards. You eat anything, but you must stop by 5 or 6pm, when the fasting begins anew.And does it actually keep you young? Who knows. Some people believe it is supposed to keep you slim, improve blood sugar control, boost brain function and increase life expectancy.You know what’s guaranteed to make you feel old? Eating dinner at 5pm. Most intermittent fasters prefer the more convenient 12 to 8 eating window, but 10 to 6 is considered optimal.Optimally joyless, do you mean? Obviously Aniston isn’t completely rigid about the whole thing. She has a “cheat” day once a week where she treats herself outside fasting hours.And what does she have? Celery juice.She treats herself to a celery juice? What an example to us all. Indeed she is.I was being sarcastic. She is certainly an example to Reese Witherspoon, her co-star in the new series The Morning Show. “Jen knows so much about health and fitness that I always defer to her,” she told the Radio Times. “She’s great at wellbeing advice.”Is there more to her wellbeing regime? In addition to fasting, Jen does meditation, followed by five workouts per week. Witherspoon, the swot, manages six.I don’t understand how these people find time in their schedule to get drunk. They don’t need to get drunk; they get high on being a better person than you.Do say: “Fasting, meditation, exercise: what a great way to use up the hours between now and death.”Don’t say: “Focus, Jen. It’s nearly 6pm, and this box of doughnuts isn’t going to eat itself.”"
Superhero films are 'cynical exercise' to make profits for corporations – Ken Loach,"Director joins Martin Scorsese and Frances Ford Coppola in censuring industry, calling superhero movies commodities ‘like hamburgers’",Andrew Pulver,2019-10-22T11:16:35+0100,"Ken Loach has joined the chorus of auteur directors criticising superhero movies, saying they have “nothing to do with the art of cinema”.Loach spoke to Sky while promoting his new film, Sorry We Missed You, an account of the breadline existence of a gig-economy delivery driver in Newcastle.Loach said of superhero films: “I find them boring. They’re made as commodities … like hamburgers … It’s about making a commodity which will make profit for a big corporation – they’re a cynical exercise. They’re a market exercise and it has nothing to do with the art of cinema.”Loach, who has won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for The Wind That Shakes the Barley and I, Daniel Blake, echoes the sentiments of American directors Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola in criticising blockbuster superhero films. Scorsese called superhero cinema “theme park” films, while Coppola described Marvel as despicable. Directors such as James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Joss Whedon (The Avengers) have defended the genre, with Gunn writing on social media: “Superheroes are simply today’s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers.”"
The Rise of Skywalker trailer – five things we learned,"In the final Star Wars movie, Kylo Ren is devilish, Palpatine is spooky, C-3PO pegs out, Jannah leads the charge and Rey sparkles",Jordan Hoffman,2019-10-22T10:51:37+0100,"Back in my day, jocks and nerds didn’t get along much, but it seems such old distinctions are now gone. Making its debut at halftime during Monday Night Football, the final trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker delighted athletes and asthmatics alike. We are all united when it comes to Jedi, droids and Wookiees.The Rise of Skywalker is billed as the culmination of the sequel-trilogy, or non-ology, or whatever you call the main Star Wars storyline. There will be more from the galaxy far, far away (The Mandalorian is just around the corner on Disney’s streaming service) but for material directly connected with George Lucas’s 1977 original, this is it. Or at least until it’s Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the elder statespeople passing the lightsaber to the next generation. (Don’t think that won’t happen.)As the new trailer launched, there were many questions. Is Rey an everywoman, or is she to the cosmic manor born? Will Kylo Ren revert to the light side? Will Finn and Rose live happily ever after? Can Poe Dameron be any more dreamy?And how will Luke Skywalker fit in, now he is dead? How exactly will Emperor Palpatine, AKA Darth Sidious, fit in, since he’s been dead since 1983? How smooth will the repurposed footage of General Leia look, since Carrie Fisher died before production of this movie began? And for the hardcore, is that ship in the background really the Ghost from the animated series Star Wars Rebels? (All signs point to yes.)This is a JJ Abrams film, so zilch of substance was revealed in this latest promo. But here were the five moments where we made noises that most resembled millions of voices crying out in terror (in a good way).The third film in each Star Wars trilogy has, thus far, involved a reversal of what true nerds call alignment. In Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader became good. Yay! In Revenge of the Sith, Anakin Skywalker turned bad. Boo! Will this new one be the tiebreaker? We hope so. And we hope it involves Rey forgiving Kylo Ren his transgressions and the two of them having a big smooch somewhere with the wind blowing her robes and his wavy hair.But until that can happen, there’s going to be some fighting, and it looks like some of that will be on the high seas. Adam Driver looks diabolical emerging from the water and holding his red, cruciform lightsaber like some kind of upside-down trident.Palpatine is back in this new one. How how how? No one saw it coming, so we should have expected it.We’ve yet to see Ian McDiarmid in any of the promotional materials – is it really him, or his Force ghost? – but we’ve heard him laugh and now we’ve heard him say spooky things such as “Long have I waited!” (Never keep McDiarmid standing in a queue; he’s terrifying!) It’s unclear exactly what the Darth Formerly Known As Sidious has been waiting for, but we can guess as to the where: a crazy-looking stone throne that would make even Thanos wince!I thought we had got all the Star Death out of the way with The Last Jedi. Vice-Admiral Holdo sacrificed herself by hyperdriving the Raddus into a fleet of Star Destroyers and Luke Skywalker evaporated after his Force Projection. Then there was Carrie Fisher who actually died. Couldn’t our tear ducts maybe take a movie off?Well, no. I just didn’t think it would be C-3PO, the protocol droid who along with R2-D2 has been in every Star Wars movie thus far, to be the one to go. A solemn farewell moment in this trailer makes it seem as if that’s the case.When George Lucas (remember him?) was first dreaming up these stories (and giving them tongue-twister titles such as Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from The Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars) his influences were varied. Yes, he was reading Joseph Campbell. Yes, he was watching Akira Kurosawa. But he was always inspired by cheap, dopey film serials from the 1940s and earlier. To that end, this shot of our heroes on a fleet of interplanetary horses (they aren’t tauntauns!) really brings it all home. It’s fun to see new character Jannah (Naomi Ackie) leading the charge, and outstanding to see BB-8 zooming alongside them.Each trilogy is about one person’s journey. The prequels were about Anakin, the original trilogy was about Luke and the sequel trilogy is about Rey. The final shot of this trailer, with the digital sparkle added to her eyes (unless Abrams blinded her on set!), is a gorgeous image of a new icon. And the voice from elsewhere in the room (or maybe from beyond) echoes some memorable lines from the first film: “The Force will be with you,” says Luke. “Always,” adds Leia.Excuse me, someone must be chopping up space onions in here!"
Official Secrets review – Keira Knightley shines as a very British whistleblower,Knightley gives a sympathetic performance as Iraq war whistleblower Katharine Gun in this shrewd and relevant spy drama,Peter Bradshaw,2019-10-18T07:00:48+0100,"There’s something interestingly tough and forthright about this slow-burner from director and co-writer Gavin Hood. It is a beady-eyed spy drama that has shrewd things to say about the British establishment’s tendency to spite under pressure, about the eternal duality of cockup and conspiracy, about the Kafkaesque problems involved in defending yourself legally against a treason charge, and, importantly, about the kind of young, vulnerable people that we end up depending on to tell us how we are governed.Official Secrets shows that spy dramas from real life are very often not action thrillers such as Bond or Bourne or Homeland – or indeed Hood’s last movie, Eye in the Sky, from 2015 – but something more like nuclear-level office politics.It is based on the true case of Katharine Gun, a translator working for the British security services at the GCHQ surveillance unit in Cheltenham. In 2003, she was astonished to receive an email making it plain she was expected to find out incriminating personal details in the lives of UN representatives from small countries so that they could be blackmailed into voting for the war in Iraq. Gun printed out the email, and passed it to an anti-war friend, and it eventually formed the basis of a sensational front-page scoop in the Observer.Although it did not stop the war, as Gun dreamed of doing, it played an important part in turning press and public opinion. Gun herself was prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act.Keira Knightley gives a focused, plausible and sympathetic performance as Gun, and the film shows that she is in many ways the classic whistleblower. She has an idealism, work ethic and professionalism that made her an excellent intelligence operative in the first place, and yet it is precisely these things that made her rebel. Most importantly of all, she is young – like Edward Snowden, or Chelsea Manning, or Sarah Tisdall, jailed in 1984 for revealing details about American cruise missiles in Britain. Gun is still young enough not to have made an ineradicable career investment in GCHQ or formed loyalty links to its upper reaches.The working life of the Observer is boisterously and affectionately represented. Rhys Ifans plays renowned reporter Ed Vulliamy as a passionately angry critic of the government; Matt Smith plays Martin Bright – who wrote the original story – and Hanako Footman plays young journalist Nicole Mowbray, whose chaotic, innocent mistake in transcribing the email, replacing its American spellings with British ones, caused the story to be initially rubbished by online conspiracists in the US. Conleth Hill plays the Observer’s editor Roger Alton who, despite his pro-government line, comes out of this rather well. It is his honest lust for a good story that causes him to publish.But these journalists’ lives are basically comfortable. Gun, on the other hand, is marched into a hair-raising inquisition at GCHQ, and then into a police station, and then informed that she can’t reveal details about her work to her defending counsel, and then finds that her Turkish asylum-seeker husband, Yasar (Adam Bakri), has been mysteriously shuffled up the list for imminent deportation.The most intriguing relationship suggested by the film is that of the veteran human rights lawyer Ben Emmerson (Ralph Fiennes), who defended Gun, and his former colleague, the one-time liberal barrister Ken MacDonald (Jeremy Northam), who became the director of public prosecutions making the decision whether to press the charge against Gun, and how or if to make an example of her. What can have been the dynamic between these two men? The film depicts a kind of cordial wariness curdling into detestation.In 2019, we have arguably more complicated views on leaks and whistleblowing, now that the reputation of Julian Assange has clouded who we think of as the underdog hero. But Gun’s case is extraordinarily relevant; it shows a world that in some ways feels like yesterday and in other ways like a lifetime ago. It’s a world in which people store computer files on Zip drives, where a youthful-looking Tony Blair is interviewed on TV by David Frost and where the establishment was broadly, if unhappily, on board with supporting and joining the US military adventure in Iraq.These are precisely the people who now urbanely accept that it was all wrong. The change of heart didn’t happen naturally. It happened because of people like Gun, of whom the film is a sharp, pertinent reminder.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 October and Australia on 21 November."
A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon review – a sheepquel for all ages,"Aardman have upped the ante with this dotty Spielbergian sci-fi tale crammed full of sight gags, movie pastiches and charm",Cath Clarke,2019-10-18T13:00:54+0100,"Aardman’s Shaun the Sheep – a silent film star with the chops of Keaton and Chaplin – returns for another dottily daft big-screen family adventure. In his 2015 film, Shaun and his mates rescued their farmer from the big smoke of the city. With this sheepquel, Aardman have seriously upped the ante, delivering a Spielbergian sci-fi epic: an ovine spin on ET crammed with gags (spot the “HG Wheels” sign on a mechanic’s garage), movie pastiches, and all the usual something-for-all-ages charm.Shaun has just ordered in pizza for the flock when adorable lost alien Lu-la shows up at Mossy Bottom Farm, having crash-landed her spaceship in nearby woods. (For an Aardman figure, Lu-La is a bit of a letdown – too cutesy by half.) As Shaun steps up to help, the unfeeling, robot-like boss of the Ministry of Alien Detection shows up – a woman hellbent on creating a hostile environment for extra-terrestrials. (It’s a sign of the times that even Aardman’s brand of buttery-toast comedy is dragged into politics: one of the film’s directors has confirmed the villainous Red was inspired by Theresa May.) Meanwhile, the farmer puts Bitzer the jobsworth dog to work building a crappy UFO theme park, Farmageddon, in a back field for the UFO nuts who’ve descended on the village.As in the long-running Shaun the Sheep TV series, there is no dialogue, just plenty of expressive baas and bleating. In place of one-liners, the slapstick and sight gags come thick and fast – a joke involving a frozen pizza thrown into the air and being mistaken for a UFO is vintage Aardman. A little of the personality has been lost in adapting Shaun’s world for sci-fi (the Wallace and Gromit movie Curse of the Were-Rabbit pulled off horror with a little more finesse). It’s a minor quibble; Shaun is by no means past his prime.• A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon is released in the UK on 18 October, the US on 13 December and Australia on 9 January."
The Peanut Butter Falcon review – Shia LaBeouf brings soul to odd-couple adventure,"A child in care finds himself on the run with a criminal, with Dakota Johnson’s nurse on their trail, in an innocently charming adventure story",Peter Bradshaw,2019-10-18T11:00:52+0100,"There is a gentle sweetness to this goofy, big-hearted comedy written and directed by feature first-timers Tyler Nilson and Mike Schwartz: a film that doubles as a modest homage to Mark Twain.Zack Gottsagen, an actor with Down’s syndrome, plays Zak, a young man in a care facility who yearns to escape and realise his dream of becoming a wrestler. He obsessively watches a wrestling video presented by a mysterious and hammy wrestling pro called the Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church), who’s barking at the screen and demonstrating tricky moves such as the atomic throw.With the help of mischievous old-timer Carl (Bruce Dern), Zak actually gets away, and finds himself on the run with an angry, unhappy, mixed-up guy who is wanted by the police. This is Tyler: a sympathetic, relaxed performance from Shia LaBeouf.Tyler is the one person who never patronises Zak, and he also takes a shine to Eleanor (Dakota Johnson), the concerned nurse trying to track Zak down. Together, the three of them wind up on an adventure, some of which is on a raft – on a mission to find the Salt Water Redneck and make Zak’s dreams come true in the ring. Tyler and Eleanor share a confused notion that by helping Zak they can somehow help themselves.There’s a nice cameo from Wayne Dehart as “Blind” Jasper John, the backwoodsman who has an unofficial line in baptising passersby in the local creek.The Peanut Butter Falcon isn’t shy of pushing your buttons, but the overall effect has an innocent charm and frankness, and LaBeouf brings a winning combination of toughness and soul."
The Laundromat review – Steven Soderbergh gets caught in a spin,The Panama Papers story arrives on the big screen as a star-studded romp full of smarm and short of focus,Peter Bradshaw,2019-10-18T09:00:51+0100,"Here is a movie with right on its side. But that hasn’t stopped it being messy, unsatisfying and dramatically redundant: a laborious Ted-talking satire delivered with the same air of smirking self-satisfaction that I found unbearable in Adam McKay’s The Big Short. That, too, was about financial wrongdoing with wide ramifications, based on a smart nonfiction bestseller.This film is directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Scott Z Burns, inspired by the 2017 book Secrecy World: Inside the Panama Papers by the Pulitzer-winning journalist Jake Bernstein. It creates a fictional scenario spun off from the very real scandal revealed by the Panama Papers data dump – a world of unaccountable offshore companies that launder dodgy cash and allow the super-rich to avoid tax.Meryl Streep phones in her performance as Ellen, a retired woman whose husband has been killed in a freak accident, and who finds she is unable to sue the people guilty of negligence because their re-insurers are concealed behind a shell company in Nevis. So she resolves to track down the bad guys. The movie is narrated by a grinning pair of dirty rotten scoundrels: Ramón Fonseca (Antonio Banderas) and Jürgen Mossack (Gary Oldman), the real-life legal rogues who unwillingly made the headlines with their fabulously lucrative business manufacturing tens of thousands of iffy shell companies all over the world from their Panamanian base.The plot features many different imaginary victims and villains, never staying with any of them long enough for us to care, though one chapter – about a crooked African businessman played by Nonso Anozie – goes on for a bafflingly long time without revealing why his story deserves any more space than anyone else’s. Streep’s story does not provide a central dramatic thread but simply disappears into the film’s patchwork quilt of tales before triumphantly emerging with an odd, dramatically stylised imposture that is easily seen through. A disappointment.The Laundromat is released in the UK on 18 October."
Zombieland: Double Tap review – a fan service sequel for fans who barely exist,A belated sequel to the 2009 sleeper hit brings back the main cast but can’t quite conjure up enough humour or charm to justify its existence,Benjamin Lee,2019-10-16T14:48:47+0100,"At a relatively brief 99 minutes, Zombieland: Double Tap doesn’t provide one with anywhere near enough time to figure out exactly why Zombieland: Double Tap exists. The closest I could manage was sheer greed, but even that explanation would require a strongly held belief that a substantial fanbase cared about or even remembered the original. It was a decently reviewed sleeper success which provided a much-hankered-for eyeroll at the influx of zombie films flooding cinemas at the time – but it was that and little else. A smile of a movie that turned into more of a shrug over time.A decade wait later, the result of a tortuous development process, here it is, lumbering into cinemas thirsty for coins, missing the boat and all other available transport. It’s not entirely without merit, but it is utterly devoid of necessity, a release date filler that, despite the long gestation period, feels like a worthless quickie, 10 years’ worth of foreplay resulting in an underwhelming splurge. Since the first film, those involved have graduated to better things. Woody Harrelson scored two more Oscar nominations; Emma Stone won an Oscar and was nominated for another; Jesse Eisenberg secured himself a career as a playwright; screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick moved on to the Deadpool franchise; and director Ruben Fleischer landed Venom, the biggest hit of his career to date. Which makes the whole thing even more of a head-scratcher.Crafted with the sort of fan service one might expect from a sequel to a much-loved fan favourite, Zombieland: Double Tap doubles down on what the original provided for those apparently eagerly waiting for more. We’re reunited with the ragtag team from the first film as they come across an extravagant new home: the White House. For a while, there’s a fragile sense of contentment – for the men at least – but their attempts to force their female companions into traditional gender roles (the makeshift daughter and the loyal wife) force the women to flee the nest.What follows – what vaguely, if one squints, passes for a plot – includes a hippie commune, a pilgrimage to Graceland, a candle shop meet-cute and a lacklustre Luke Wilson cameo. Zombie groan.As dated as its slow-mo zombie-killing opening credits, at times Zombieland: Double Tap feels like it was made directly after the original yet carelessly forgotten about. It’s rushed and dusty, a film more belonging on Crackle than the big screen, more expensively budgeted than the first yet mostly creatively bankrupt. The film’s major addition is a dumb, one-note Valley Girl stereotype, played buoyantly by a game Zoey Deutch, who resembles a character from an early 00s sitcom, with every poorly written punchline landing the same – she’s an airhead, end of joke. The script’s potshots at hippies feel equally rusty: they love weed and hate guns. Cool.The returning actors replay the same beats with about as much effort and investment as one might expect, with Stone looking particularly bored, while Fleischer’s stylistic flourishes feel mostly regurgitated. The script’s interesting initial exploration of women eschewing traditional gender roles is soon replaced with a predictable string of women throwing themselves at undeserving men. It’s watchable in an undemanding way, thanks to a snappy pace, but there’s an ingenuity missing, a purpose, a spark that made the first film so much fun. A lot has changed since the first one came out, to the actors, to the genre, to the world, but Zombieland: Double Tap is hopelessly stuck in the past. It’s a corpse of a franchise that shows no sign of coming back to life.Zombieland: Double Tap is released in the UK and US on 18 October."
Singin' in the Rain review – simply splashing,"This sublime 1952 movie musical, in cinemas again, puts the artistry of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and co on full, joyful display",Peter Bradshaw,2019-10-18T15:00:56+0100,"You can charm the critics but have nothing to eat! That’s the shrewd warning from Donald O’Connor’s character Cosmo Brown in his legendary song Make ’Em Laugh, in the equally legendary 1952 musical Singin’ in the Rain, written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and now being rereleased. Forget about the hoity-toity critics and the clueless highbrows, Cosmo proclaims: the real duty – and real artistry – lies in entertaining people. (Jack Buchanan’s song That’s Entertainment in The Band Wagon, directed at Fred Astaire, has a similar moral: be it comedy or tragedy, if it works on stage or screen, then it is entertaining and therefore artistic.)To some extent, cinema’s crisis of self-doubt is part of what drives this incredible film. Kathy Selden, played by Debbie Reynolds, is the wannabe actor and stern ingénue who lectures Gene Kelly’s genially complacent silent movie star Don Lockwood about the superiority of the legitimate theatre over the movies when they meet-cute. Nobody really believes that – not even Kathy, who is making ends meet jumping out of a cake at Hollywood parties and going into a sublime song’n’dance routine to All I Do Is Dream of You. When the silent cinema is forced to accommodate sound, and Don and his co-star make their first faltering attempts to speak from the screen, for an awful moment their acting looks crass, childish and incompetent. Are the naysayers right? Are the movies just silly?With muscular frankness and grace, Kelly stars (and with Stanley Donen co-directs) playing the easy-going, smiley star in the 1920s routinely paired with a conceited female lead he can’t abide: Lina Lamont (a terrific and underappreciated comic performance by Jean Hagen). His best pal is musical director Cosmo, a stunning performance of almost extraterrestrial comic agility by O’Connor. Don falls hard for gutsy and talented Kathy at the moment when the silent cinema is rendered obsolete, and gets Kathy a job dubbing squeaky-voiced Lina. But they have an even bigger idea: why not put music into these newfangled talking pictures? And so the musical is born. They have created a new stylised convention (bursting into song with music coming from nowhere) to replace the old convention of silent movies, and this has saved the whole seventh art.The unstoppable joy of the musical numbers, especially with O’Connor, is what never fails to seduce – perhaps especially in Moses Supposes. A pompous schoolteacherly fellow tries to instruct Don how enunciate his vowels and consonants; Cosmo shows up, and soon they have disrupted the entire thing with an anarchic dance number. The prissy business of correct elocution couldn’t be less relevant. The songs themselves often float surreally free of the story, or subtextually provide the joins. In Good Morning (celebrating their all-night conversation in which the genre of movie musical has been invented), Kathy, Cosmo and Don prophetically pick up rain macs, anticipating the legendary number to come. Kelly’s song Singin’ in the Rain has the briefest possible dramatic introduction: a few lines in which Don wishes Kathy a gentlemanly good night at her door. Then we get the great number in the rain – something that has never looked entirely convincing in the movies, but looks almost real here. In common with the movie-within-a-movie motif, is the surreal Gotta Dance sequence that Don pictures for himself in the new version of the film they’re shooting. In it he gets a long romantic scene with a female lead we haven’t even seen before: Cyd Charisse. It is pure meta-musical heaven.Singin’ in the Rain emerged in the early 1950s, when the industry had achieved a mature distance from its silent origins, and it’s possible this film helped promote the idea that – with prominent exceptions from the world of comedy – silent cinema was crude and valueless. Now we are moving away from that idea. Michel Hazanavicius’s  2011 smash The Artist was partly inspired by Singin’ in the Rain, and partly by A Star Is Born – though Jean Dujardin (and James Mason) were more fallible and vulnerable creatures. Kelly’s Don Lockwood was always a winner, and is never really tested – and however absurd it sounds, I always feel a twinge at how Lina finally gets her comeuppance. Well, Kelly, Reynolds, O’Connor and Donen do something achieved only by geniuses: they make it look easy.• Singin’ in the Rain is in UK cinemas on 18 October."
Tell Me Who I Am review – amnesia documentary is like a psychological thriller,An amnesiac man and his twin brother come to terms with their troubled childhood in this involving but upsetting film ,Cath Clarke,2019-10-17T15:00:25+0100,"This desperately upsetting Netflix documentary, a portrait of a troubled family, is best watched knowing as little possible. Director Ed Perkins slickly pieces his story together like a psychological thriller – a little too slickly, perhaps, for such an emotionally painful tale.Following a motorbike accident in 1982, 18-year-old Alex Lewis woke up from a coma with almost total memory loss. The only person he recognised was his twin brother, Marcus. Once he had left hospital, Marcus retaught Alex everything – how to tie his shoelaces, what a toaster does, the name of his girlfriend. And he told him the story of their childhood growing up with a loving mum and dad in a country pile in the home counties, the family holidays in France, the good life. But it was all a lie.The film is split into three parts. The first is an interview with amnesiac Alex. Looking back, he sees that Marcus’s story didn’t tally with the life he experienced when he came out of hospital. Marcus warned him their dad was a bully: “Always be polite. Call him sir.” Their mum was an odd eccentric. The brothers were made to sleep in a shed in the garden; they weren’t allowed a key to the house. At 32, Alex learned the truth.In the second part, Perkins gives the perspective to Marcus – he still believes he did the right thing in protecting Alex from the horrors of his childhood memories.Now 54, these two scarred men sit across a table from each other in the film’s final section, their faces muted by pain and sadness. The film would be unbearable were it not for the fact that both have found some peace with happy families of their own. Perhaps their twinness, a feeling of never being alone, protected them. For the first time, Marcus tells Alex exactly what happened to them as boys. I am not sure we needed to hear the details, but Tell Me Who I Am is their film, so it’s their call.• Tell Me Who I Am is released in the UK on 18 October."
Mystify: Michael Hutchence review – a heavyhearted portrait mainly for the fans,INXS frontman’s genius is implied throughout Richard Lowenstein’s choppy documentary but never given the chance to speak for itself,Luke Buckmaster,2019-07-04T01:38:28+0100,"Richard Lowenstein’s long-gestating documentary Mystify: Michael Hutchence has finally arrived after a decade in the works. In a sense, the veteran indie auteur has been chipping away at the film even longer than that, since the early days of his career, having directed several music videos for INXS – the Australian rock band the renowned singer-songwriter fronted.Lowenstein also helmed the endearingly scuzzy 1986 sharehouse drama Dogs in Space. This bong water-soaked, couch-crashing classic features a rare leading performance from Hutchence himself, with whom the director was friends. Lowenstein has described Mystify as an apology for not being there for the late musician, who took his own life in a Sydney hotel room in November 1997.In this sense, then, it’s no surprise Lowenstein seems to struggle to determine the best narrative hooks with which to frame Hutchence’s story: a case, perhaps, of a film-maker being too close to his material. Mystify is a heavyhearted portrait of a highly talented and complex person, who soared to great heights and plummeted to dreadful lows. How much viewers will get out of it will depend (as is the case with most films about real-life musicians) partly on how much they admire Hutchence going in.Loads of home footage, clips from performances and a wide range of interviews with people close to the subject make the film a must-see for lovers of INXS. Sadly, it pales in comparison with the director’s other documentaries – including the captivating Autoluminescent: Rowland S Howard and the deeply engrossing Ecco Homo. The latter, which explores the life of another friend and collaborator of Hutchence, the elusive artist Peter Vanessa “Troy” Davies, was inventively framed as part detective story and part freaky eulogy, etched in the post-punk, drug-washed haze of Melbourne circa the 80s.Davies was not a superstar like Hutchence, so Lowenstein’s challenge involved explaining why his story matters and what this man’s life signified in a broader cultural context. Those elements are lacking in Mystify. From its introductory moments, depicting Hutchence performing Never Tear Us Apart in front of an adoring crowd in a smoky, packed-out venue, there is a sense of reverence and implied genius that runs throughout the film.Frustratingly, Lowenstein doesn’t let the musician’s talent speak for itself. The film includes snippets of many of his performances, but they are clipped and come and go quickly: a few moments on the stage here and there. I found myself regularly wishing that the director would slow down the pace and let these moments breathe, allowing the audience to savour Hutchence’s vitalising presence and charisma – and, of course, that bewitching voice.Martin Scorsese included near-complete renditions of several songs in his Bob Dylan documentary, Rolling Thunder Revue. The effect was striking, like a kind of editing room equaliser: allowing rhythm and energy to be momentarily driven by the artist himself, rather than part of the more pressure-packed, chopped-up style of a film like Mystify – a film cut six ways to Sunday.It finally hits its stride towards the end, when it obtains an interesting journalistic quality. There are some bold suggestions and talking points – including the possibility that Hutchence’s loss of smell (after sustaining a brain injury) increased his sense of a loss of self. Exploring the musician’s relationship with Paula Yates, among several other turbulent aspects of his life, the director makes a point that these types of narratives are never clear-cut; that a person unravelling, in so many areas and with such devastating consequences, entails complex considerations and rarely – if ever – is there a single moral or cut-and-dried perspective.Lowenstein also makes the bold decision to use audio from interviews with no accompanying images, dislocating what we see and what we hear. This approach has worked to striking effect in several films, including Senna and the electrifying Adam Goodes documentary The Final Quarter. But those films feel very different, more like comprehensively referenced visual essays than, a collection of deeply personal ruminations in a documentary that attempts to distil the essence of a person’s life and character.When people close to Hutchence forlornly discuss aspects of his life and personality, viewers want to see their faces; we want to fully register their emotions. Interviewees include Kylie Minogue, who reflects on her and Hutchence’s romantic years pursuing a hedonistic lifestyle. Charming home footage shows the two lovebirds on a yacht and then holidaying in Europe, but in this film sadness is never far away. Minogue reflects with melancholy on Hutchence as a broken man, sobbing uncontrollably on all fours. Small but powerful moments, like these, are the ones that stay with you."
Corpus Christi review – from parole to the priesthood,"This smart plot-twister about an ex-con who takes up the identity of a new priest sidesteps a soppy trajectory to land on a much bleaker, thoughtful note",Leslie Felperin,2019-10-17T07:00:45+0100,"Often moving but also disquieting and even intermittently funny, this drama unfurls a spiritual parable that is uniquely Polish but accessible to all.Bartosz Bielenia, an actor with burning blue eyes and an ability to be so still it’s as if he can freeze the frame by himself, stars as Daniel, a young ne’er do well from Warsaw who, for crimes only later revealed, is in juvenile detention.He’s first seen watching the door as some teens brutalise a boy in a metalwork class while the guard is out, but sheer luck opens another door for him. Drawn to religion but not allowed to join a seminary because of his criminal record, he travels to a rural town once he’s paroled to take up work in a sawmill. A little grey lie lets him take the identity of the young new priest, Tomasz, that the town is expecting, and soon Daniel is performing mass and hearing confessions while the older resident curate dries out in rehab for a while.Around this midpoint, as Daniel/Tomasz gets used to being looked after in plush new digs by bossy matron Lidia (Aleksandra Konieczna) and gets to know the townsfolk, the film risks feeling like an episode of Father Ted as directed by Robert Bresson.The plot takes an interesting turn when Daniel learns that a tragic road accident has traumatised the community, and he discovers an unexpected skill at pastoral care as he tries to help heal the damaged psyches of the bereaved – many of them barely younger than himself, including Lidia’s pretty teenage daughter, Eliza (Eliza Rycembel).All the aforementioned might lead you to expect some kind of soppy redemptive trajectory, but that’s not where this film goes in the end, landing instead on a much bleaker, thoughtful note. Piotr Sobociński’s blue-toned cinematography enhances the rapturous air and enhances a smartly written, unsettling work of realism."
Non-Fiction review – tale of literary passions loses the plot,"Olivier Assayas’s drama, set in the world of publishing, strains in vain to make zeitgeisty points about the future of books ",Peter Bradshaw,2019-10-16T13:00:17+0100,"Olivier Assayas is treading water with this amiable but self-indulgent and finally negligible movie (originally entitled Doubles Vies or Double Lives) about intrigue and adulterous goings-on in the publishing world of Paris.It’s a film that ostentatiously concerns itself with contemporary, zeitgeisty issues such as digital culture and the internet, and whether this is undermining the world of reading and books. But strip out the strained speechifying on that subject and it could have been made at any time in the last 40 years. There are some funny lines, and, despite the literary setting, Assayas can’t resist cinephile gags, particularly a bizarre juxtaposition of Star Wars: The Force Awakens with Michael Haneke’s searing drama The White Ribbon. But once we’ve reached an in-joke about the movie’s own female lead – Juliette Binoche – the film has started munching its own tail.Vincent Macaigne is Léonard, an author of middling literary fiction based on his own failed marriage and affairs. His sales are declining, and his urbane publisher Alain (Guillaume Canet) wants to drop him from his list; they have an excruciating lunch at which Alain can’t bring himself to say this out loud. But Léonard is having an affair with Alain’s wife, Selena (Binoche), whose loyal cheerleading on the home front may have been the only thing keeping Léonard’s career alive. Alain himself is having an affair with his head of digital policy, Laure (Christa Théret).Just as Léonard is periodically asked if he is writing “autofiction” and if this is a viable genre, so Assayas seems to be playing around with the idea of autofilm.

What You Gonna Do When the World’s on Fire? review – African American life in the south,Robert Minervini brings together four stories about black life in this subtle but strikingly elegiac documentary,Phil Hoad,2019-10-17T12:00:24+0100,"Black cinema has been galvanised at every level, from blockbuster to arthouse to documentary, by the social-justice drive of the last half-decade. What You Gonna Do When the World’s on Fire? is another worthy addition to that growing canon – even if it splits its focus too much, to the detriment of the greater political impact it might have had.Italian director Robert Minervini, whose documentaries have frequently focused on the American south, divides his attention between four separate strands about African American lives in the summer of 2017: Titus Turner and Ronaldo King, young brothers running free in the edgelands; Judy Hill, an inspirationally foul-mouthed former drug addict, about to lose her New Orleans bar to gentrification; Mardi Gras “Indian chief” Kevin Goodman, keeping tradition breathing through his costumery; and Mississippi’s New Black Panther party, taking to the streets to demand justice for a trio of suspicious killings they deem to be lynchings.In the film, shot with elegiac finality in black and white, Minervini makes subtle communitarian and intergenerational connections between the stories. “We’ve been set free, but we’re still being slaves,” Hill tells people at a local meeting. “When a woman breeds children, she breathes fear. When she was pregnant, she was scared – so they’re born to be scared.” The brothers’ mother warns them to be home by the time the streetlights come on; cutting loose in the meanwhile, Ronaldo, 14, assures nine-year-old Titus that he won’t get shot at that age. Their growing awareness of the limits on their freedom echoes the adults’ complaints about the white establishment: “We don’t get no justice. We get, ‘Just for us.’”But the Mississippi situation is so extreme that Minervini’s easy drift starts to feel slack. One of the dead trio, Jeremy Jerome Jackson, was found decapitated. When the New Black Panthers protest outside the court building, several are Tasered and trussed. Some of the remaining members are struggling not to cry, their cries of “black power” simply there to bolster their own morale. This is the reality of the Black Lives Matter movement, the institutional and psychological barriers they face; it feels as if it needs more sustained attention, not the decorative flourishes Minervini draws on from the Mardi Gras strand. Now is not the time for sideshows. "

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: final trailer for ninth film is released,Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher feature in film carrying the tag line: ‘The saga will end. The story lives forever’,Stephanie Convery,2019-10-22T04:35:26+0100,"Fans have waited a long, long time for the Star Wars finale, and it has taken almost as long for them to be treated to the final trailer for the ninth instalment of the saga.With the tag line “The saga will end. The story lives forever”, the trailer promises to close off the narrative that began with rural boy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finding himself caught up in an intergalactic battle in George Lucas’s original, groundbreaking film, A New Hope.On Monday night US time, though, the trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker launched, with tickets going on sale for the last film in the series that has been running since 1977.Since A New Hope, the saga has since spanned two original sequels, three prequels, a full “sequel trilogy” and two “anthology” films, or stand-alone films within more or less the same timeline.The Rise of Skywalker trailer suggests a dramatic ending, because it depicts sweeping shots of battles atop ships on vast raging oceans, characters leaping across canyons in tremendous jungles, teary-eyed close-ups, and of course, lightsabers.Written, directed and produced by JJ Abrams, The Rise of Skywalker stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Lupita Nyong’o, alongside original trilogy cast members Mark Hamill, Ian McDiarmid, and Anthony Daniels as the robot C-3PO.The filmmakers said in May that scenes filmed with original cast member Carrie Fisher, who died in 2016, would be repurposed for The Rise of Skywalker.The film itself will not hit cinemas until 20 December, but fans have been drip-fed a long run of teasers at least since shooting began last year."
Francis Ford Coppola: Scorsese was being kind – Marvel movies are despicable,"The Godfather director joins in criticism of superhero films, while Guardians of the Galaxy’s James Gunn hits back at out-of-touch geniuses",Catherine Shoard,2019-10-21T11:52:26+0100,"The director of The Godfather and Apocalypse Now has joined Martin Scorsese in dismissing the dominant series of superhero films.Speaking to journalists in Lyon following his acceptance of the Prix Lumière for his contribution to cinema, Francis Ford Coppola, 80, said: “When Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he’s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration.”Coppola continued: “I don’t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again. Martin was kind when he said it’s not cinema. He didn’t say it’s despicable, which I just say it is.”Scorsese’s initial comments, in which he said films made by Marvel Studios, the Disney offshoot responsible for the Avengers movies, were “not cinema”, prompted a considerable backlash from directors including James Gunn, Joss Whedon, Kevin Smith and Taika Waititi.The director of GoodFellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and forthcoming mafia epic The Irishman reiterated his feelings last weekend at the London film festival, saying superhero films were “invading” cinema, which increasingly resembled a “theme park”.During his David Lean lecture on 12 October, Scorsese said: “Theatres have become amusement parks. That is all fine and good, but don’t invade everything else in that sense. That is fine and good for those who enjoy that type of film and, by the way, knowing what goes into them now, I admire what they do. It’s not my kind of thing, it simply is not. It’s creating another kind of audience that thinks cinema is that.” Many of our grandfathers thought all gangster movies were the same, often calling them “despicable”. Some of our great grandfathers thought the same of westerns, and believed the films of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone were all exactly the same. I remember a great uncle to whom I was raving about Star Wars. He responded by saying, “I saw that when it was called 2001, and, boy, was it boring!” Superheroes are simply today’s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers. Some superhero films are awful, some are beautiful. Like westerns and gangster movies (and before that, just MOVIES), not everyone will be able to appreciate them, even some geniuses. And that’s okay. ❤️A post shared by  James Gunn (@jamesgunn) on Oct 20, 2019 at 11:51am PDTGunn also responded to Coppola’s attack on the genre for which he has become famous.

Quentin Tarantino won't censor Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for China – report,Sources tell Hollywood reporter Bruce Lee’s daughter raised concerns over the film’s portrayal of the martial arts star ,Victoria Bekiempis,2019-10-19T18:46:39+0100,"Quentin Tarantino will not edit Once Upon a Time in Hollywood to placate Chinese censors, the Hollywood Reporter said.Tarantino has maintained a firm “take it or leave it stance” after Chinese regulators put the brakes on a scheduled 25 October release, the publication reported, adding that Sony Pictures Entertainment was not given an explanation as to the delay. The studio declined to comment, the Reporter said.Some believe the Chinese decision stems from Tarantino’s depiction of the late martial arts star Bruce Lee, a hero to many in China.

The Rise of Skywalker trailer – five things we learned,"In the final Star Wars movie, Kylo Ren is devilish, Palpatine is spooky, C-3PO pegs out, Jannah leads the charge and Rey sparkles",Jordan Hoffman,2019-10-22T10:51:37+0100,"Back in my day, jocks and nerds didn’t get along much, but it seems such old distinctions are now gone. Making its debut at halftime during Monday Night Football, the final trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker delighted athletes and asthmatics alike. We are all united when it comes to Jedi, droids and Wookiees.The Rise of Skywalker is billed as the culmination of the sequel-trilogy, or non-ology, or whatever you call the main Star Wars storyline. There will be more from the galaxy far, far away (The Mandalorian is just around the corner on Disney’s streaming service) but for material directly connected with George Lucas’s 1977 original, this is it. Or at least until it’s Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the elder statespeople passing the lightsaber to the next generation. (Don’t think that won’t happen.)As the new trailer launched, there were many questions. Is Rey an everywoman, or is she to the cosmic manor born? Will Kylo Ren revert to the light side? Will Finn and Rose live happily ever after? Can Poe Dameron be any more dreamy?And how will Luke Skywalker fit in, now he is dead? How exactly will Emperor Palpatine, AKA Darth Sidious, fit in, since he’s been dead since 1983? How smooth will the repurposed footage of General Leia look, since Carrie Fisher died before production of this movie began? And for the hardcore, is that ship in the background really the Ghost from the animated series Star Wars Rebels? (All signs point to yes.)This is a JJ Abrams film, so zilch of substance was revealed in this latest promo. But here were the five moments where we made noises that most resembled millions of voices crying out in terror (in a good way).The third film in each Star Wars trilogy has, thus far, involved a reversal of what true nerds call alignment. In Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader became good. Yay! In Revenge of the Sith, Anakin Skywalker turned bad. Boo! Will this new one be the tiebreaker? We hope so. And we hope it involves Rey forgiving Kylo Ren his transgressions and the two of them having a big smooch somewhere with the wind blowing her robes and his wavy hair.But until that can happen, there’s going to be some fighting, and it looks like some of that will be on the high seas. Adam Driver looks diabolical emerging from the water and holding his red, cruciform lightsaber like some kind of upside-down trident.Palpatine is back in this new one. How how how? No one saw it coming, so we should have expected it.We’ve yet to see Ian McDiarmid in any of the promotional materials – is it really him, or his Force ghost? – but we’ve heard him laugh and now we’ve heard him say spooky things such as “Long have I waited!” (Never keep McDiarmid standing in a queue; he’s terrifying!) It’s unclear exactly what the Darth Formerly Known As Sidious has been waiting for, but we can guess as to the where: a crazy-looking stone throne that would make even Thanos wince!I thought we had got all the Star Death out of the way with The Last Jedi. Vice-Admiral Holdo sacrificed herself by hyperdriving the Raddus into a fleet of Star Destroyers and Luke Skywalker evaporated after his Force Projection. Then there was Carrie Fisher who actually died. Couldn’t our tear ducts maybe take a movie off?Well, no. I just didn’t think it would be C-3PO, the protocol droid who along with R2-D2 has been in every Star Wars movie thus far, to be the one to go. A solemn farewell moment in this trailer makes it seem as if that’s the case.When George Lucas (remember him?) was first dreaming up these stories (and giving them tongue-twister titles such as Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from The Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars) his influences were varied. Yes, he was reading Joseph Campbell. Yes, he was watching Akira Kurosawa. But he was always inspired by cheap, dopey film serials from the 1940s and earlier. To that end, this shot of our heroes on a fleet of interplanetary horses (they aren’t tauntauns!) really brings it all home. It’s fun to see new character Jannah (Naomi Ackie) leading the charge, and outstanding to see BB-8 zooming alongside them.Each trilogy is about one person’s journey. The prequels were about Anakin, the original trilogy was about Luke and the sequel trilogy is about Rey. The final shot of this trailer, with the digital sparkle added to her eyes (unless Abrams blinded her on set!), is a gorgeous image of a new icon. And the voice from elsewhere in the room (or maybe from beyond) echoes some memorable lines from the first film: “The Force will be with you,” says Luke. “Always,” adds Leia.Excuse me, someone must be chopping up space onions in here!"

Eli review – schlocky Netflix horror devolves into supernatural silliness,A boy questions the veracity of some nasty experimental treatment in a promisingly twisty tale that ultimately crashes and burns ,Benjamin Lee,2019-10-18T08:01:46+0100,"Offloaded to Netflix by Paramount, who reportedly couldn’t figure out how the heck to market it, supernatural horror flick Eli arrives with a number of question marks eerily circulating. In a hugely profitable time for the genre, how could a major studio not figure out how to make some theatrical profit from a low-budget horror film? What’s the big twist at the film’s sinister core? And most importantly, can it possibly be even half as bad as The Cloverfield Paradox?The disastrous threequel was the last film dumped by Paramount on the streaming platform and while some were initially surprised by the decision, anyone who eventually endured the wretched thing was in full support. While Eli isn’t quite as inexcusably incoherent, it’s still something of a misshapen mess and one that might have struggled to lure an audience on the big screen. On Netflix, it’s far better suited, living alongside the platform’s ever-populating library of mediocre genre offerings.Eli (Captain Fantastic and The Nightingale star Charlie Shotwell) suffers from an extreme auto-immune disorder that’s made the outside world an impossibility. But his parents (Kelly Reilly and Max Martini) may have found a solution. In a remote, and comically creepy, mansion, a doctor (Lili Taylor) is offering an expensive experimental treatment that she claims will cure him. Risking everything, the family heads to the middle of nowhere in the hope that Eli might be able to finally live a normal life. But Eli is convinced that something is wrong. Why is the treatment making him feel worse? Can he really trust the doctor? And why is he being plagued by pesky ghosts?Rather like the wonderful, little-seen New Zealand comedy horror Housebound, Eli is a haunted house film where the person being haunted is unable to leave. It’s a nifty way of ensuring that a character who should otherwise be heading for the hills is forced to endure and then investigate the source of the malevolence. But are the ghosts trying to harm or help Eli? For a while there’s some fun in trying to figure it all out with him and the film carefully leaves a number of possibilities dangling. It works better as a mystery than a horror with director Ciarán Foy strangely incapable of constructing a solid fright. The film is scattered with a number of familiar horror sequences, from a couple of nasty dreams to some extended jump scares, but none of them really land.It’s a mostly one-location film and, despite experience within the genre, Foy is never able to turn the house into enough of a character, it’s never as frightening as it should be, atmosphere evaporating fast. The details of the plot prove more involving than the film that surrounds it, the script chugging along with speed, leading us along with curiosity at just what the film’s big twist will be. When it comes, it’s a decent surprise but it’s confusingly, messily revealed and the film crumbles soon after, devolving into laughable silliness, almost deliberately so, as if Foy wasn’t sure how to sell the finale with a straight face. Performances are mostly bland although Taylor does have some fun weaponising the soft tone of her voice.Like The Cloverfield Paradox before it, Eli is a film more suited to the small screen, where audience members can multi-task, perhaps even search for something better to watch next.Eli is available on Netflix now"
Why Joker's depiction of mental illness is dangerously misinformed,"With films playing a key role in shaping attitudes to mental health, two doctors say Joaquin Phoenix’s troubled supervillain perpetuates damaging stereotypes",,2019-10-21T16:04:09+0100,"As junior doctors who work on acute inpatient psychiatric wards, serious mental illness is our daily reality. We have, therefore, watched the controversies around Todd Phillips’s Joker – in which Joaquin Phoenix plays a troubled loner who turns to violence – with professional interest.The film’s dominance in the debate about portrayals of mental illness in the movies comes at a curious time. Recently, we’ve witnessed great leaps of awareness about relatively common mental-health issues such as depression and anxiety, and with that awareness, increasing dismissal of the sort of unhelpful prejudices that used to surround them. These are now readily discussed without shame and often represented in the media with a well-informed grasp of the facts, thanks to effective information campaigns.However, severe mental health conditions, such as psychotic illnesses, remain shrouded in stigma and are consistently misrepresented and misunderstood. Portrayals of mental illness in film can perpetuate unfounded stereotypes and spread misinformation. One of the more toxic ideas that Joker subscribes to is the hackneyed association between serious mental illness and extreme violence. The notion that mental deterioration necessarily leads to violence against others – implied by the juxtaposition of Phoenix’s character Arthur stopping his medication with his increasingly frequent acts of violence – is not only misinformed but further amplifies stigma and fear.Studies show this association is exaggerated and people with severe mental illness are more vulnerable to violence from others than the general population. Interesting, then, that Joker’s earnest attempt to create an empathetic character with mental illness – who writes: “The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t” – contributes to the very prejudice that Arthur longs to evade.Arthur’s supposed loss of grip on reality is suggested by a peppering of nods to psychotic symptoms: delusional ideas of a grandiose nature (“I am an undiscovered comedic genius”) and hallucinations of his neighbour – which are confirmed by his eventual admission to a psychiatric institution. This restoration of order via Arkham Asylum affirms the overarching inference of the film: Arthur’s descent into violence and destruction is triggered by his mental deterioration. The result of this is to – disappointingly – remove Arthur’s agency and divert attention from a potentially more stimulating conversation about wealth inequality and its responsibility for societal collapse.We wouldn’t want to get bogged down in labels, but the psychopathology Arthur inhabits is foggy at best: his apparent lack of disordered thinking means the attempt to illustrate psychosis is half formed. He also displays traits of narcissism and depression. This diagnostic vagueness may create a more relatable character that reflects the pain of any psychiatric illness; but it gives the impression that many disorders have been squashed into a plot device. In the end, it undermines Phoenix’s hypnotic performance and Joker’s sincere attempts to explore the interaction between poverty, inequality and social isolation.Arthur’s chilling quirk – his bursts of incongruous and uncontrolled laughter – is no laughing matter either. Presumably, he suffers from the neurological condition pseudobulbar affect – also known as “emotional incontinence” – perhaps caused by his childhood head trauma. Joker may make an attempt to unpick the difference between the psychiatric and the neurological – between a mental illness and a medical disorder – but it runs the risk of conflating the two with a haunting, stigmatising and problematic image. Whether intentionally or not, Arthur comes across as a hysterically laughing supervillain, stereotypically “mad” to the untrained eye; a murderous clown laughing alone on a bus.Cinematic depictions of mental illness – most infamously, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest – have profound and lasting implications in the real world. It is widely acknowledged within psychiatry that Cuckoo’s Nest led to inappropriate levels of suspicion and misinformation regarding electro-convulsive therapy, and may have meant many people did not receive treatment that is proved and effective. All this due to a single film’s misinformed presentation.Films have the power to perpetuate stigma and fear, which is why the misrepresentation of severe mental illness in Joker should not be dismissed lightly."
Dolittle trailer – Robert Downey Jr talks his way into all sorts of trouble,It’s a weird but wonderful world as the rebooted animal lover bangs on in a bizarre Welsh accent to his marauding menagerie,Stuart Heritage,2019-10-15T14:30:14+0100,"Robert Downey Jr’s life comes in easily identifiable chunks. First, he had it all – the most talented actor of his generation. Then he lost it all spectacularly in a blaze of drugs and jail sentences. Then he regained everything a hundred times over, becoming the world’s richest and most beloved star in a string of films that made heavy use of his personality. And now comes the next stage, in which he does a bizarre Welsh accent at a polar bear in a hat. That’s right, the trailer for Dolittle is out.In Dolittle, Robert Downey Jr plays Doctor Dolittle, a man who can converse with animals. It’s based on Hugh Lofting’s book The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle, and not The Story of Doctor Dolittle. We know this because the trailer doesn’t contain any gratuitous racial epithets, or a scene in which Robert Downey Jr bleaches the face of an African man. So what is it about? Glad you asked. Let’s take a look.1. The trailer opens with a shot of a parrot soaring through the air as the obligatory slowed-down version of a popular song (in this instance, What a Wonderful World) plays in the background. The message is clear. This is a film of great majesty. To watch it will be to be rendered awestruck by the glory of nature.2. Then we dive inside. This is a great old house, clearly owned by a magnificent eccentric. Not only does he allow a monkey full run of the place, but he’s also constructed some sort of food delivery monorail. He must be kind, and gregarious, and deeply wonderful. I can’t wait to meet him.3. Ah, here he is. Doctor Dolittle himself. Not just that, but Doctor Dolittle played by the world’s biggest star unshackled from the world’s biggest role. Robert Downey Jr is here to show that he’s a endearingly gifted actor, and this is how he does it. He’s gazing soulfully at a hat. Just like he did in Chaplin. What a salve this must be to the three people who preferred Chaplin to Iron Man 3.4. But what of Doctor Dolittle’s animal friends? Here, as What a Wonderful World begins to surge towards its bombastic climax, we meet a funny parrot who says silly things. You’re right, Dolittle trailer, it is indeed a wonderful world.5. But the funny parrot is not alone. Doctor Dolittle’s friends also include an exuberant duck, an excitable gorilla, a regular dog, a dismay-filled monkey and what appears to be the lead singer of the early-90s alternative rock band Spin Doctors in polar bear form. I don’t know about you, but I’m especially looking forward to meeting the polar bear.6. There is also an octopus. Dolittle has chosen to address the octopus by sticking his head into a tank of water. What you can’t see in this scene are all the shots of the octopus trying to work out what accent Robert Downey Jr is doing. “Are you from Yorkshire?” he asks. “Or Irish? Seriously, throw me a bone here. You’d better not be pretending to be from south-east Asia, Downey, because I thought we were ditching all of the racist stuff from the Dolittle books.”7. Also, don’t get too attached to the gorilla, because he’s on a ship that gets bombed, so will almost certainly end up dead. OK, don’t shoot the messenger.8. Finally, there is a tiger who wants to eat Robert Downey Jr. He probably succeeds, too. It’s quite hard to talk down a hungry tiger. Being able to talk to animals isn’t going to help him a jot. The moral of Dolittle, then, seems to be: “Just because you can, it doesn’t mean you should.”"
Why so stupid: how Joker is too juvenile to be provocative,Controversy has swirled around the grimy origins tale but Todd Phillips’ DC drama isn’t anywhere as shocking as it seems to think it is,Charles Bramesco,2019-10-02T06:00:23+0100,"There’s been an air of tense caution surrounding the upcoming release of Todd Phillips’ new film Joker, an apprehension eerily recalling the anarchy in Gotham following the clown criminal’s terrorist threats in The Dark Knight. Maybe it’s due to false memories of the Aurora shooter dressing up as the Joker (a bit of apocrypha since disproven) before opening fire on a screening of the follow-up, The Dark Knight Rises, in 2012, or maybe it’s due to the subject matter of a man on the edge finally snapping and going on a spree. Most likely due to a combination of the two, large swaths of the public share in a faint unease that the nationwide premiere may provide occasion for an act of mass violence.The concern has been floated from the earliest rounds of press, when Joaquin Phoenix stormed out of an interview with the Telegraph after the reporter asked if the film “might perversely end up inspiring” fringe types to bring about “potentially tragic results”. The survivors of the tragedy in Colorado penned a joint letter to Warner Brothers urging the studio to consider the safety of their audiences, and the American military issued a warning to troops about possible emergencies. A sizable legion of loyalist trolls has formed to flood the Twitter mentions of any journalist speaking out against the still to-be-released film with bile. It is, as Phoenix’s Joker-to-be Arthur Fleck muses in the film’s opening minutes, getting crazier out there.This conversation has now given way to the adjacent and far more tiresome conversation-about-the-conversation, as critics and self-appointed cultural watchdogs weigh in on whether all the alarm has been misplaced or well-founded. And now my time has come to officially be part of the problem, if only to add my two cents that irrespective of opinion, we’ve all played right into Phillips’ hands.This is a prefab sort of controversy, its talking points hardwired directly into a text all too eager to provoke. My initial review from Joker’s gala premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival levied the charge of being too juvenile and shallow to successfully deliver on its attempts to shock. The effort’s still there, however; while not particularly effectively, Phillips does his darnedest to glorify the post-breakdown Fleck, a man who gains everything only once he has nothing left to lose. While it has been emphatically established that Joker is not a conventional superhero picture, cinematographer Lawrence Sher still drops in the classic slow-mo walk closely identified with the genre, as a facepainted Fleck basks in his own power with each stride. The film wants to leave the question of its judgment on Joker tantalizingly unresolved, allowing enough room for plausible deniability of any toxic influence even as it puts a bad example on a pedestal.But even if the work itself has been built on a bedrock of irresponsibility, that doesn’t imbue it with the control over human behavior we’ve all come to fear. Movies don’t cause people to commit mass shootings in the same way that video games or heavy metal music don’t suddenly make killers out of ordinary teens. These things may give unstable personalities a channel through which they can divert their pre-existing rage and resentment, but even in the worst case, the impulse to do harm has begun far before the opening credits roll.This is not to minimize the concerns of the Aurora letter, or anyone fearful of their safety in shared spaces, all of whom have been given plenty of cause for their worry by headlines over the past decade. But ascribing that concern to the influence of the film means embracing a narrative that the promotional team has peddled since the earliest days of production, in which the exploits of a madman are just too daringly twisted for mainstream audiences. This may be the most cynical aspect of a movie about cynicism – how Phillips made the early can’t-lose bet of framing his latest feature as a subversive, formidable challenge to our sensibilities, when engaging with the film at all means proving him right.In a recent interview with the Associated Press, Phillips expressed frustration with the scrutiny his film has received on all sides, saying, “The one that bugs me more is the toxic white male thing when you go, ‘Oh, I just saw John Wick 3.’ He’s a white male who kills 300 people and everybody’s laughing and hooting and hollering. Why does this movie get held to different standards? It honestly doesn’t make sense to me.” Setting aside the fact that John Wick is in fact not a white male, this soundbite packs three different rhetorical fallacies – false equivalency, misrepresentation of a premise, and garden-variety whataboutism – into approximately 15 seconds of audio.This is, no other word for it, Trump-speak. His clumsy circumlocution reflects a desire to wriggle out from answering for the consequences of one’s own choices, a basic inability to make a defense masquerading as a defense. Phillips wishes to enjoy the notoriety of a button-pusher without taking the heat, to make a movie about morality without discussion of morals, to be provocative without answering the question of what’s being provoked. He’d like to have it both ways, confronting his viewers with stark truths and then demurring all who-me once it’s time to reckon with their implications. In actuality, the film can’t manage either, too immature to jolt and too simplistic about its own rotten side to exonerate itself. It won’t single-handedly make the world a more violent place – just a slightly uglier, more unpleasant one.• This article was amended on 3 October 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Aurora shooting occurring in 2008 during a screening of The Dark Knight. In fact the year was 2012 and the film showing was The Dark Knight Rises."
Over-40 actors still fighting the ageism that stymied Judy Garland,Renée Zellweger’s Garland biopic is a powerful reminder of the attitudes that infect youth-obsessed Hollywood,,2019-09-30T13:27:41+0100,"In 1962, Judy Garland received an Oscar nomination for her role in Judgment at Nuremberg and regarded it as an auspicious restart for her career. She had been thrown into the deep end of Hollywood’s unforgiving waters as a child actor, and since her early success, every aspect of her life had been marred by desperate attempts to keep her head above water. Unsuccessful marriages to other struggling artists, an addiction to drugs that was spurred on by abusive producers and, above all, her constant anxiety to control her appearance – all these problems were symptoms of her toxic relationship with Hollywood. “Isn’t this pretty good for somebody Hollywood thought as too old, too fat and too undependable to offer a job?” she wrote. Judy, the new film starring Renée Zellweger, recounts the sad ending that she was heading for instead.Judy joins the list of Hollywood biopics that carry an air of atonement, in which the misfortunes of earlier generations of stars who were cast away from the industry – largely due to their age – are memorialised and sentimentalised. Films such as The Artist and Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool have an admirable goal: celebrating the lives of performers who were callously underappreciated toward the end of their careers. But it is becoming more and more difficult to take away a positive message when Hollywood itself draws attention to how much Hollywood hasn’t changed.The star of Judy is herself re-emerging from a hiatus: one that was caused by the same maladies afflicting old Hollywood that the movie depicts. Zellweger retreated from acting after she entered Hollywood’s dead zone for women aged 40 or over. She borrows from a familiar sense of disenchantment with the profession when she tries to give life to Garland’s emotional state at the end of her life. In interviews for the movie, Zellweger says she is ready for the roles that will embody her maturity. Whether the studios have the same plans remains to be seen.Some big-screen veterans still attract an enthusiastic audience. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy, which explored the lives of retired Brits living in an Indian hotel, exceeded expectations by grossing more than $130m worldwide. Book Club put the same trust in the box-office power of older American actors, including Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton and Candice Bergen. Both movies secured sequels and softened the industry’s attitude towards taking risks with older actors.But for every hard-earned movie project that serves the age demographic well by telling a complicated story about old age, Hollywood churns out two Schwarzenegger movies with tag lines like, “Retirement is for sissies”. There are obviously Hollywood pitch meetings reserved for the older male action stars of the 80s. Twelve of the 15 highest-grossing movies of that decade have been remade, and most of them are produced to mask the age of their stars. Rambo 5, Terminator 6, Die Hard 5, Indiana Jones 5 and now the second Top Gun, all ride the new American myth of super-agers.To pull this off, Hollywood encourages bizarre anti-ageing clinics even as it abandons the female stars of the 80s, pairing their former male co-stars with much younger on-screen love interests. And now the industry has added a new weapon to its digital arsenal: de-ageing technology. Advocates believe that VFX technology could help ameliorate the representation problem. But it’s more likely that de-ageing technology help Hollywood avoid the problem of finding roles for older stars by erasing signs of age as opposed to embracing them.In the past, small- to mid-budget projects have been the most welcoming to older stars. Many darlings of the screen who hit their peak in the 1940s, 50s and the 60s bid their adieu delivering memorable performances in this subgenre. Among them were Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda playing ageing parents in On Golden Pond, John Wayne as an out-of-time gunslinger in The Shootist, and Julie Christie as a woman struggling with memory loss in Away from Her. More recent examples – Robert Redford in The Old Man and the Gun and Clint Eastwood in The Mule – underwhelmed artistically and commercially. Perhaps Marlon Brando was the most accurate predictor of the future. Toward the end of his career, he had come to terms with Hollywood’s commodification of youth and vitality. He sought the help of early adopters of VFX technology to create an animated 3D version of his face, believing that the studios would, after his death, want to keep a young Brando alive on the screen. “Maybe this is the swan song for all of us,” he said, even though it’s not real and “inside a computer”. Today, Hollywood’s fascination with de-ageing technology seems to affirm Brando’s bleak premonition, as it continues to insist older actors surrender to its obsession with youth."
Joker makes great disability art by letting its hero bite back,The new Batman spin-off understands perfectly the frustration and helplessness caused by involuntary mental health conditions – but refuses to milk them for tragedy,,2019-09-27T15:26:15+0100,"I knew Joker was a film whose relationship to society today is a rich – and sometimes fraught – one. But until I saw it, I hadn’t realised just how pertinent a film it would be. Set in dystopian Gotham of the 1980s, it’s a world where the vulnerable of society, such as single mothers, the elderly and people with mental health issues are crammed into crumbling housing projects, while super-affluent bankers live it large. The villains in Joker are the filthy rich, such as the bullying, Trump-like Thomas Wayne who blames the poor for their own poverty as he campaigns to become mayor.This is first-person cinema told from the point of view of someone with mental health issues. The character of Arthur Fleck is an authentic and well-researched depiction of a man with borderline personality disorder. At times, it felt less like watching a superhero movie and more like a social drama depicting a real-life horror story of austerity.Played with corporeal commitment by Joaquin Phoenix, Arthur has a neurological condition called Pseudobulbar Affect, most straightforwardly explained as spontaneous and uncontrollable laughter at inappropriate moments. The scene where Arthur is confronted by a woman on a bus who becomes irritated by his laughter is a situation that will be all too familiar to anyone who has experienced firsthand the frustration, misunderstanding and sense of helplessness involuntary mental health conditions can cause. It’s not Arthur who has the problem, though – it’s an uncaring and misunderstanding society and that’s what this scene brilliantly conveys. Joker puts us in the shoes of the Other, a disabled man oppressed by the able-bodied.People with mental health issues are feared in society – derogatory terms such as psycho or nutter are part of everyday conversation. We live in fear of “the insane” and avoid them on the street or move away from them on the train. The truth is that the vast majority of people with mental-health issues are the real victims. Those with non-visible disabilities face everyday hostility, persecution and lack of care. In her recent book Crippled: Austerity and the Demonization of Disabled People, Frances Ryan writes that the new fit for work tests can be linked to 590 extra suicides in England.But Joker isn’t just the standard disability tragedy narrative that we’ve come to expect. It’s about someone with a disability biting back. Watching the hordes of Joker’s acolytes descend on Gotham in revenge for their degradation at the hands of the wealthy had the audience I watched it with cheering. Joker’s Network-style takedown of a talk show that seeks to ridicule him made me wonder what would have happened if the Block Telethon protest by disabled rights activists who stormed the live ITV Telethon broadcast in 1992 had gone further? At the time there was a sense of anarchy, mayhem and poking fun at the charity culture that oppresses the disabled. The actions of those disability rights activists contributed to the introduction of the disability discrimination act almost 25 years ago.Joker might just be a classic of disability cinema, a film that takes the experience of the outsider and makes us root for them. I can’t think of a more subversive mainstream film, especially not in the sanitised, spandex-clad, wholesome worlds of the superhero genre. Unlike Heath Ledger’s Joker, Arthur Fleck’s violence isn’t chaotic, it has angry purpose, and he unwittingly creates a vent for the dispossessed. I think the film will divide the disabled community and I am sure some people will take issue with the depiction of mental health. Maybe though, we’ve seen enough of disabled people depicted as pious martyrs, and it’s time the victims fought back. Not by shooting people, but with smart, anarchic direct action."
Is The Farewell the olive branch the US-China culture war needs?,A film depicting a young Chinese-American woman’s experience highlights differences between the two countries – but may also signal hope for the future ,Jingan Young,2019-09-23T16:25:49+0100,"Similar to the hype surrounding the release last year of Crazy Rich Asians, the first Hollywood romcom to feature an all-Asian cast, Lulu Wang’s The Farewell, made for a far more modest $3m, has also generated a great wave of goodwill since its premiere at Sundance in January. The Farewell is a welcome addition to a new canon that depicts the contemporary Asian-American experience. As a mixed-race woman who was not born or raised in her parents’ home country/culture, I found the depiction of the complex east-west family dynamics highly resonant, particularly around the themes of belonging and not belonging. I also shed quite a few tears in the process.The Farewell reaches cinemas as the US-China trade war continues to send shockwaves through the global economy; it is far more political than I could have imagined. Starring Crazy Rich Asians alum Awkwafina as Billi, a Chinese-American woman who discovers her grandmother, or nai nai in Mandarin, has terminal lung cancer and has only a few months left to live. However, her family have wrongly – in Billi’s opinion – withheld the truth from her grandmother: a common practice in China, as well as in Japan and Singapore. In an attempt to reconcile their so-called “emotional burden”, the family travel to Nai Nai’s home in Changchun, the capital of north-east Jilin province, to stage a fake wedding between her cousin and his Japanese girlfriend so that the entire extended family can bid Nai-Nai a final farewell.The setup may seem outlandish, but it is based on Wang’s own family history. “Based on an actual lie” reads an epigraph on screen at the start of the film.The family’s decision to tell a “good lie” is a metaphor for the collective delusion of living under the Chinese Communist party. Billi’s guilt at harbouring this secret is beautifully reflected in the plastic-facade setting of Changchun – the seedy hotels, outdated banqueting halls and concrete tower blocks built next to smoggy highways suggests this “performance” will eventually eat away at one’s soul.Hollywood has removed Taiwanese flags from Tom Cruise's jacket in the new Top Gun movieThe Farewell is a co-production with Chinese film companies, meaning it avoids the country’s strict foreign-film quota and will be eligible for distribution in China. Cinema has become a key battleground in the trade war between the US and China; as reported by Variety, Chinese film officials have begun to advise Chinese buyers against purchasing Hollywood titles. Recently, Hollywood has been seen to appease state censorship by removing the Taiwanese and Japanese flags from Tom Cruise’s jacket for the sequel of Top Gun (a film partly funded by Chinese corporate monolith TenCent, the company behind WeChat). Meanwhile, the support for Hong Kong police brutality expressed by naturalised American citizen Crystal Liu – star of Disney’s forthcoming Mulan – has prompted a #boycottmulan backlash.The big-budget Crazy Rich Asians, which was a tour through the lives of the rich in Singapore, bombed at the Chinese box office, and it has been suggested this was partly because the protagonist Rachel was seen as a “race traitor”. But The Farewell, which was shot primarily in Changchun – home to one of China’s largest film production bases and a magnet for international students – offers an ideal opportunity to discuss issues surrounding China’s generational divide, its slowing economy, the one-China policy, and its future as a superpower.However, to anyone who has lived the immigrant experience after their family were forced to flee during the Cultural Revolution, the “performance” of Chinese society – embodied by lying to the grandmother, and the scathing commentary on hypocritical traditions (such as paying for mourners to cry at funerals) – rings sadly true. Critics have noted the film’s importance in the depiction of what immigrants leave behind. But, in depicting the differences between western and Chinese family values, Wang has highlighted the ideological battle between China and the US. The Farewell might be the spark that Hollywood needs to reignite its dwindling relationship with China and, in turn, China’s with the rest of the world."
"With Mosul, the Russo brothers fall prey to white saviour syndrome","The new film from the Avengers: Endgame film-makers is set in Iraq and gives the main roles to Arab actors. But by failing to hire an Arab director, they have missed the opportunity to smash the established narrative",Hanna Flint,2019-09-20T15:27:05+0100,"When the Russo brothers announced that their first post-Avengers: Endgame endeavour would be an Arabic-language action thriller, I was intrigued. The directing duo have spent the last seven years helping to define the face of contemporary American heroism, so I wondered how they would tell a story where the heroes are an Arab SWAT team, the villains are Isis and the battleground is Iraq?Hollywood has made plenty of movies focused on the post-9/11 Middle East, where the stories are centred on white heroes and Arabs are relegated to supporting roles that, more often than not, perpetuate negative stereotypes; The Hurt Locker, American Sniper, Lone Survivor and 12 Strong are a few examples of white saviour narratives. But Mosul, they said, was going to be different. Based on a 2017 New Yorker article, The Desperate Battle to Destroy Isis, it tells the true story of a renegade Iraqi SWAT team who, in 2014, took on Daesh in a bid to take their city back.“The ‘white saviour’ is an egregious fallacy for someone from an Iraqi perspective because all white people have ever done is attack their country,” Joe Russo told me at Toronto international film festival, where the film had its North American premiere, “so I think it would be an affront to their sensibilities to send a white character in there to solve problems.”They have, however, sent in a white American writer-director to tell this story. Matthew Michael Carnahan makes his directorial debut, having written scripts for the likes of The Kingdom and State of Play, but using the hashtags such as #decolonizehollywood and #NoOrientalism Arab critics have question why the Russos, who have said they made a commitment to telling an “authentic” story, didn’t hire an Arab director. “Authenticity can’t be sprinkled on like glitter,” said one post. “People aren’t going to buy this white male made ‘Arabic Language’ movie and all its misrepresentation of real Arabs,” said another. Their response? Joe Russo says: “Be careful not to … exclude the people who want to support the community.”I do appreciate the Russos using their clout to bring an Arab story to Hollywood, using Middle Eastern and North African actors and crew members to tell it. The closest we’ve come to positive Arab representation in the mainstream is through the Aladdin remake, but that “giant piece of IP,” as Joe puts it, is still a piece of fiction, written and directed by white men, that continues some of the orientalist tropes from the original animation.To avoid making missteps, the Russos hired Son of Babylon director Mohamed al-Daradji as a cultural consultant who made sure, as he explained, “[The film] looked like it had been made in Iraq, shot in Mosul and spoken in the Iraqi dialect.” Mosul certainly ticks all those boxes, and Carnahan has delivered a well-crafted movie; but despite the impressive performances from Suhail Dabbach, Adam Bessa and the cast, there’s an emotional depth missing. I never got a real sense of who these men were underneath the gear, why deep-down they were continuing with this mission, or the anxiety they must feel about potentially losing further family members.Anthony Russo told me: “Matt Carnahan was a writer that we had greatly admired for a long time, we had a working experience with him with that really impressed us and we thought he might be perfect for this.” But I was left wondering what this movie would have been like if a female Arab film-maker had written and directed instead. Gurinder Chadha once said to me: “I’ve always maintained that women telling stories about men is very potent because we do it differently to men, we are able to get to different parts.”Over the years I’ve been so impressed with the work produced by Nadine Labaki (Capernaum), Haifaa al-Mansour (Wadjda) and more recently Waad al-Kateeb (For Sama), Hinde Boujemaa (Noura’s Dream) and Malene Labidi (Arab Blues), all of which have earned critical acclaim for the emotional intelligence each brought to their nuanced exploration of the Arab world. Even German-Palestinian director Lexi Alexander has proven herself in the action genre with cult Marvel movie Punisher: War Zone, and stints on TV shows Supergirl, S.W.A.T. and LA’s Finest. But it seemed the option of getting an Arab film-maker to helm it was not a big consideration.Hollywood is only just making room for stories from the Arab perspective, and thanks to people like the Russos, we’re seeing more Mena actors and crew members get opportunities they never had before. In Mosul, the Arab community is seeing themselves represented on screen in a positive way, as heroes, rather than terrorists or submissive secondary characters.I want people to see Mosul, I want it to get worldwide distribution and do well commercially for the sake of the actors and crew involved – but as much as the Russos and Carnahan say they are avoiding the “white saviour” trope in the film, they are still acting as such behind the scenes by not putting this story into the hands of an Arab film-maker. Joe Russo told me a film like this is “criminally overdue and tragic”, and he’s right; but so are the opportunities for Arab film-makers to make movies in Hollywood – let alone tell their own stories."
How Hustlers shows the importance of female solidarity,"In the acclaimed fact-based drama, the bond between women is shown with rare sensitivity and depth even as they engage in criminal acts ",,2019-09-19T06:00:24+0100,"The marketing campaign for Hustlers, a film that opened to an unexpectedly impressive $33m at the US box office last weekend, presents the film as a fun, woke, neon-soaked update of Coyote Ugly. But behind the pink-and-blue-hued ads showcasing the stars Jennifer Lopez and Cardi B, lies powerful commentary on the nature of female intimacy, a mass market shell hiding surprisingly incisive feminism.Based on a 2015 New York Magazine article by Jessica Pressler, the film follows a band of strippers as they drug unsuspecting Wall Street bankers post-recession while running up their credit cards, with Ramona (Lopez) and Destiny (Constance Wu) at the scheme’s helm. Sandwiched between a poppy soundtrack and J-Lo’s acrobatic poledancing are insights on the romance of friendship, capitalism in America and the potential and pitfalls of female solidarity.After seeing Ramona dance for the first time – a glittery display of agile ass-shaking that ends with her rolling around on the floor in a pile of money – bright-eyed and bushy-tailed newbie Destiny tiptoes outside to join her while she smokes a cigarette. Jacketless, Ramona draws Destiny into the warmth of her fur coat. She rests her chin on Destiny’s head. Destiny looks up at Ramona innocently. It’s a scene of startling intimacy and one can already feel the energy between the pair molding into something like love, an early sign of their ride-or-die bond. We’re accustomed to seeing films present sisterly loyalty soon ruptured by jealousy but instead, Hustlers shows something far less cliche.The film, written and directed by Lorene Scafaria (a rare female lens for a film about stripping), perfectly captures both the depth and fragility of girlfriends who feel more like family and there’s sincerity within the performances of Wu and Lopez. As the maternal lioness, Lopez exudes warmth while also maintaining her position as the project’s in-control mastermind. For her part, Wu embodies the clever protege gunning for independence, who sees in Ramona both strategy and support. We feel every swell of euphoric acceptance and sting of betrayal between the women. In the end, both are blinded and blindsided by their love for each other.Even as Destiny betrays Ramona, they still part lovingly. Destiny admits she’s accepted a plea deal from the police and for a moment, Ramona can’t contain her feelings. She tries to hold back tears, but her role as the fierce pack mom cracks all the same. When Destiny explains that she took the deal to protect her daughter Lily, Ramona nods her head and gives a tender look of understanding. “Motherhood is a mental illness,” she sighs, before burying Destiny in a hug, only to let her go abruptly and stalk away.Part of what bonds Destiny and Ramona is their shared understanding of what it takes to survive in America. Moving through life by the skin of their teeth, Destiny and Ramona’s Robin Hood plan to steal from the rich to give to the poor only highlights the ways in which the American dream fails women of color.In a subtle yet piercing way, Hustlers calls for an intersectional approach to female allyship. Pressler is played on-screen by a prim Julia Stiles, renamed as Jennifer rather than Jessica, and her scenes with Destiny highlight an ignorance over cultural and class differences which has arguably led to today’s sorry state of female solidarity. While being interviewed, Destiny questions Jennifer’s singular interest in the Wall Street druggings above all else. “Kind of hard not to be,” Stiles replies dismissively. Without missing a beat, Destiny flatly asks where Jennifer went to school (Brown) and what her parents did for a living (a journalist and a psychologist), highlighting the sweeping differences in opportunity between them. Jennifer’s power (and profit) depends on her ability to frame a decision that Destiny is still atoning for. In a recent Vanity Fair article, Samantha Barbash from whom J-Lo’s character Ramona takes her inspiration, claimed that she did not participate in the making of the movie because they did not offer her enough money. “I have bags that are worth more than what they wanted to pay me,” she claimed. This leaves one to wonder if Hustlers has lived up to its own call to action.Male violence also flickers under the film’s surface, the shadow of patriarchy always looming. The tension is most palpable in scenes where the dancers are alone in the champagne room with clients. Money buys sex but the women giving pleasure are completely dispensable to the men receiving it. “It’s OK if you don’t believe me,” Destiny tells Jennifer, “I’m used to people not believing me.” This poignant line highlights the improbability yet vital necessity of women supporting each other at a time when it’s needed more than ever. As the recently surfaced Kavanaugh sexual assault allegations and Chanel Miller’s new book make clear, if women don’t listen to each other, no one will. By the time Ramona’s plot springs into action, no one feels sorry for the trickling bank accounts of the Wall Street tycoons, the context of the 2008 recession allowing for a wider critique of capitalism. “This whole country’s a strip club,” Ramona clarifies, “You have people tossing the money and people doing the dance.”In a year in which gender inequality and the possibility of economic recession remain as worryingly relevant as they did 10 years ago, Hustlers provides a vital and melancholic look at power imbalance in America. It’s a film that points to the country’s own frustrating contradictions – the rising awareness of male toxicity yet the the minimal accountability for it, the feminist movement’s troubling lack of inclusivity – but its sincerity is ultimately most overwhelming. Women are urged to stick together rather than drift apart both in the strip club and in the world at large."
J-Lo for the win? Taking an early look at Oscars 2020 frontrunners,"The major fall festivals are now over, giving us a clearer idea of which stars might find themselves prepping an acceptance speech for February",Benjamin Lee,2019-09-16T07:00:47+0100,"After what’s been a mostly God-awful year at the movies, the fall festival season has felt more necessary than ever, a warm hug after eight months of being repeatedly slapped in the face.Shot-in-the-dark speculation over next year’s awards race has been replaced with far more informed predictions, a guessing game still, but one that’s already easier to play. By this time last year, we’d already seen six of the eight best picture nominees and so with Venice, Telluride and Toronto out of the way once again, we can sift through the hits and misses to figure out what films and performances will have enough power to motor their way through to February.Let’s start with Venice, a festival that’s become a reliable launching pad for the surer bets – in previous years Birdman, Gravity, The Shape of Water, Roma and La La Land all debuted – although this year’s crop offered up a more mixed bag than usual. The biggest story came from an unlikely place: a DC movie from The Hangover director Todd Phillips. Grimy origins tale Joker would have arrived with a question mark no matter where it landed but playing in competition at arguably the most prestigious film festival in the world, it was an even wilder curio, the highest profile slot a comic book movie has ever snagged. Reviews were mostly rapturous, especially for star Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, and it went on to win the festival’s biggest prize, the Golden Lion, one of only six American films to do so in the last 30 years. It continued to impress in Toronto although some pushback began and negative reviews started to flood in, criticising its superficial emptiness and potentially worrying effect on what’s set to be a massive audience. At this stage, I’d bet heavily on a nomination and even a win for Phoenix but the film might struggle to sustain itself with voters who might be repelled by its subject matter and (*whispers*) one-note vacuity.After winning last year’s Golden Lion with Roma, Netflix returned with their second Noah Baumbach project, the bittersweet divorce drama Marriage Story. It was met with universal acclaim (after both Venice and Toronto, it’s one of the rare films to sustain a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and while Baumbach’s films haven’t typically scored with the Academy (his one nomination was in 2006 for the screenplay of The Squid and the Whale), most agreed that this was his finest and most expansive film to date. Nominations for stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, both on career-best form, seem like sure things while Laura Dern’s eye-catching turn as a tenacious lawyer should also snag her a supporting actress nod, thanks largely to a powerful speech she gives on how society judges mothers. There’s a lot going for it (it’s also set in the entertainment industry which voters love) but it feels like the kind of film which might not seem splashy or important enough for the Academy to give its top prize to although I can see it scoring with a lot of critics circles.There were also polite reviews for James Gray’s long-gestating space epic Ad Astra and Steven Soderbergh’s financial satire The Laundromat but both were commonly seen as awards race non-starters while the less said about Kristin Stewart’s muddled Seberg, the better.Away to the mountains soon after for Telluride, a more boutiquey festival that over a long weekend tends to premiere a more starry, and more mainstream, bunch of contenders – previous festivals have welcomed Wild, The Imitation Game, Moonlight, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, 12 Years a Slave and Ladybird.This year, one of the safest conclusions is that Renee Zellweger will be making a flashy awards season comeback with her role as Judy Garland in Judy. The film received mixed notices, with many critiquing its by-the-numbers storytelling, but almost everyone was in agreement over Zellweger’s effective performance and the Academy loves an off-screen narrative, the former winner returning to the fold after years in the wilderness. There was another safe bet in the shape of Ford v Ferrari, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, which seems to be taking the slot of this year’s boringly solid “I guess so” contender, the kind of film no one really gets excited about but no one truly hates. The audience at the Toronto premiere responded with a great deal of enthusiasm, more so than some of the later reviews. Acting recognition depends on how Fox decides to campaign the two leads, one of whom will likely to be demoted to supporting, but you can expect it to take the eighth best picture slot before promptly being forgotten about by March.Critics admired the effects in sturdy Felicity Jones/Eddie Redmayne ballooning adventure The Aeronauts, while recognising its cliches, suggesting its awards chances might be slim while most found Edward Norton’s labour of love/vanity project Motherless Brooklyn to be a misfire. There was early buzz and early enthusiasm for Krisha director Trey Edward Shults’ bold and stylistic A24 drama Waves, with some comparing it to Moonlight, but by the time it showed at Toronto, reviews started to sour. It could still be an Independent Spirit Awards contender but anything bigger is unlikely. Most seemed to like The Two Popes, a film that also went on to be a big hit with audiences in Toronto, and Netflix’s papal drama, starring lead/supporting actor contenders Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins, could be a reliable awards mainstay this season while finally, Adam Sandler could see himself in the running for a best actor trophy for his barnstorming turn in the Safdie brothers’ exhausting drama Uncut Gems, but the film’s abrasiveness could turn some voters off.Just a week later and all eyes were focused on Toronto, a festival that boasts the most stars if not the most slam-dunks in terms of awards season – previous premieres include If Beale Street Could Talk, Still Alice, I, Tonya, Lion and The Martian. Last year saw Green Book start its shock crawl to winning best picture, giving the festival a much-needed bump, and this year saw a few similarly effective crowd-pleasers spark awards talk. The surprise name on everybody’s lips during the week was Jennifer Lopez, whose performance as a stripper stealing from her clientele in the raucously entertaining fact-based drama Hustlers was praised by almost every critic. It’s a sensational turn in a film that was also largely praised and had many, including myself, predicting a best supporting actress nomination. The Academy already loves her (she’s one of their most used picks to announce an award) and the film is shaping up to be one of the fall’s biggest sleeper hits, everything aligning for a dream campaign.Another sure bet from Toronto came from two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks and his deep-rooted transformation as much-loved kids TV star Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Avoiding the structure of a traditional biopic, the pic instead positions Rogers as a kindly figure in the life of a journalist interviewing him meaning that Hanks will likely be running as supporting actor which would, astonishingly, be his first nomination in 19 years as he was snubbed for Captain Phillips, Bridge of Spies and The Post. Expect the film to also get best picture recognition with screenings accompanied by pretty much non-stop sniffles. There was a similarly emotive reaction to fact-based legal drama Just Mercy which starred Michael B Jordan as lawyer Bryan Stevenson. The film was seen as boringly made by some but almost all appreciated its powerful narrative and while Jordan’s role might be a bit too muted for Academy attention, it’s likely that Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, playing a falsely imprisoned inmate, will grab a best supporting actor nomination. The film itself is also the kind of solid, tear-jerking, crowd-pleaser that could see it genuinely affecting voters, this year’s Green Book if you will, just without the whitewashing.One of the festival’s most enthusiastically received films was Rian Johnson’s devilishly entertaining whodunnit Knives Out, a star-studded Agatha Christie homage that had the most ebullient audience reaction I’ve seen for months. It’s probably not an awards contender although if voters react as well as Toronto critics did, then a screenplay nomination could happen. Another audience favourite was Takia Waititi’s second world war comedy Jojo Rabbit, which sees him playing Hitler as cast as a buffoonish imaginary friend. Critical response was mixed but its simple, twee storytelling could work with the Academy who might respond to Scarlett Johansson’s charming supporting performance. The film also received a major boost yesterday winning the festival’s people’s choice award, seen as a predictor of Oscar success. Voters might also warm to Eddie Murphy’s turn in biopic Dolemite is My Name and especially to his redemptive arc off-screen which could secure him a best actor nomination.Elsewhere the festival saw a lot of half-misses. Impassioned but formulaic Harriet Tubman biopic Harriet received muddled praise for star Cynthia Erivo but not the film itself, Noah Hawley’s wild astronaut drama Lucy in the Sky was seen as a stylish diversion but we won’t see Natalie Portman returning to the best actress category after some scornful reactions while the much-anticipated adaptation of The Goldfinch crash-landed with some of the festival’s harshest reviews.Both Telluride and Toronto also provided a major boost to Cannes favourite Parasite, Bong Joon-Ho’s savage satire that many claim could be South Korea’s first ever best foreign language film nominee and even find its way into the best picture race. Cannes also saw Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time in Hollywood launch its steady journey to the Oscars with the film likely to pick up a number of major nominations, maybe including a supporting actor win for Brad Pitt, while Pedro Almodóvar’s autobiographical drama Pain and Glory might push Antonio Banderas into the lead acting race. Sundance also saw deserved buzz for Grand Jury prize winner Clemency and star Alfre Woodard although it might be too small to register for voters while Awkwafina’s charming performance in The Farewell will be a critics circle favourite and possibly, with a strong campaign, creep into bigger awards consideration. Annette Bening’s non-gimmicky turn as Dianne Feinstein in The Report could also slide into the best supporting actress category although the film could be too dense and talky for some.The year is far from over though and there are a number of big bets we’ve yet to see. One of the biggest is unveiled in less than two weeks, Martin Scorsese’s Netflix saga The Irishman starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. It premieres at the New York film festival before a limited release pre-empts its streaming bow. There’s also plenty of buzz around Jay Roach’s Roger Ailes drama Bombshell which focuses on the women who brought him down. While the recent trailer seemed to suggest that Margot Robbie would be the lead, it’s reportedly Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly who dominates the film and could see her back in the running for the first time since 2005’s North Country. The star-packed cast also includes Nicole Kidman, John Lithgow, Kate McKinnon, Allison Janney, Malcolm McDowell and Rob Delaney making it a strong contender for best ensemble cast at next year’s SAG awards.Sam Mendes is also returning with his first non-007 film since 2009’s Away We Go and his first world war drama 1917 could be his Dunkirk with an ensemble of younger British actors as well as supporting turns for Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch. This year’s AFI festival will open with Bonnie and Clyde-esque drama Queen & Slim starring Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya and the trailer suggests at the very least some stunning visuals thanks to acclaimed music video director Melina Matsoukas. And finally, with a prime Christmas Day release, expect awards aplenty for Greta Gerwig’s Little Women adaptation with a cast that includes Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Timothee Chalamet and Florence Pugh, who rumours suggest could be the film’s ace.Adam Driver – best actor, Marriage StoryJennifer Lopez – best supporting actress, HustlersQuentin Tarantino – best director, Once Upon a Time in HollywoodTom Hanks – best supporting actor, A Beautiful Day in the NeighborhoodRenee Zellweger – best actress, JudyJamie Foxx – best supporting actor, Just MercyJoaquin Phoenix – best actor, JokerBrad Pitt – best supporting actor, Once Upon a Time in HollywoodBong Joon-Ho – best director, ParasiteLaura Dern – best supporting actress, Marriage Story"
"Send in the crowns: in trumping Venice competition, Joker begins grand slam","The victory for Todd Phillips’s revisionist comic book blockbuster is a credit to a festival in touch with crazed politics, contemporary paranoia – and superb cinema",Xan Brooks,2019-09-07T22:53:10+0100,"Todd Phillips’ Joker spins the tale of a pathetic loser who ends up a winner, the low-class upstart who upsets the applecart and explodes the establishment. Nobody – least of all Joaquin Phoenix’s snivelling party entertainer – believed he stood a snowball’s chance in hell. But his message hit home and the voters clamoured for change and we live in interesting times where the old rules don’t apply.As with the man, so with the film. Since its grand unveiling at the Venice film festival last weekend, Phillips’s revisionist comic-book blockbuster - charting the formative years of Batman’s nemesis - has had the critics worrying at it like a ham-bone tugged between a pack of dogs. It’s been hailed as a fiery socialist call-to-arms and damned as a cynical instruction manual for incel vigilantes. It’s been seen as left-wing; it’s been seen as right-wing. Its politics are so turbulent, so unrefined - and yes, arguably garbled - that they sprawl and crawl beyond traditional party boundaries. Much, it might be said, as real-world politics has a tendency to do these days.“Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?” asks Phoenix’s antihero near the start of the film. And this was a question that - with variations - was being posed again and again on social media as Lucrecia Martel’s Venice jury decided to hand the Golden Lion to Joker ahead of the numerous other, more favoured candidates. Most onlookers were fine with Martin Eden’s brooding Luca Marinelli winning the best actor prize and Gloria Mundi’s Ariane Ascaride being named best actress. And you could almost hear the collective sigh of satisfaction when the directing award went to Sweden’s Roy Andersson for his inimitable About Endlessness. In any other year, the decision to lavish the Silver Lion – effectively the event’s second prize – on the disgraced Roman Polanski for his historical thriller An Officer and a Spy would have provided the night’s biggest controversy. Except that the jury had a final twist in store.Is it the wrong choice: Europe’s oldest film festival falling over itself to honour a Hollywood studio blockbuster? Only insofar as Joker hardly needs the attention and there are other, smaller productions (off the top of my head: Pablo Larrain’s Ema and Haifa al-Mansour’s The Perfect Candidate) which would have benefited from a leg-up. But if the remit is to reward the competition’s most bold and ambitious production, then why not Joker? Phillips’s film is slippery, divisive and borderline irresponsible in its climactic call to arms. But it’s also exuberant, exciting and at times genuinely radical – the sort of movie that takes a gleeful delight in pushing the envelope; in taking three steps further than you imagine it will. I loved the film when I saw it and it’s been buzzing in my head ever since. Joker’s set-up was fabulous and its punchline was devastating. But tonight’s killing joke is what really brought the whole house down."
Why The Third Man is an essential primer for no-deal Brexit,"As the classic noir gets a 70th anniversary re-release, it’s hard to ignore the parallels between a shattered postwar Vienna teeming with spivs and the future the Brexiters have in mind",Danny Leigh,2019-09-05T11:57:55+0100,"What perfect timing for The Third Man to step back out of the shadows. Often hailed as the finest film Britain ever made, a 70th anniversary re-release will see it return to cinemas with the government much in the market for symbols of national grandeur. While Boris Johnson has named his favourite film as Dodgeball – for once, eerily believable – as the great British breakdown goes on it is easy to imagine him waving a tiny Union Jack at Carol Reed’s majestic noir.It is true, of course, that there could be no better moment for The Third Man to reappear – just not as a cosy patriotic treat. Rather, it is a cold premonition of no-deal Britain.In that, there is a certain poetry. We are where we are in no small part due to endless British war films convincing a generation born in the 1950s that they had lived through the Blitz and could only be happy back in it. But The Third Man is a postwar movie. American hack writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Vienna to meet, then mourn, his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), but the city he finds tells a bitter truth about life after wartime. “Smashed and dreary,” the screenwriter, Graham Greene, wrote in the novella drafted as a treatment.Barring the unexpected, we may still live to see the resemblance. The cosplayers will sputter that Austria was on the losing side in the second world war, ignoring that Britain can’t help but lose the re-enactment, given we’re the only ones fighting it. With Europe declining to drive us into the shelters, no deal provides the solution by dropping a bomb on ourselves.Reed and Greene show us the future that follows. “The classic period of the black market,” the voiceover calls it, an ugly scuttle of murky characters and fraught borders, an impoverished place carved up by predatory powers. The screen fills with parallels between then and our soon-to-be now. Official versions of Harry’s death hum with organised disinformation; his lover Anna is a refugee, terrified of being caught with the wrong papers; malign Russian influence lurks.But most of all, there are the vultures. To the crooks Greene found at work in the Viennese debris, the godsend of war was allowing them room to get rich. No Deal will be the same: a once-in-a-lifetime chance to tip a whole country into a handful of pockets. Disaster capitalism is just the modern name. There must be a catastrophe – because only that upheaval can allow the firesale of public assets and small businesses, the accompanying wave of deregulation, Britain remade as an offshore hidey-hole that asks no questions (and where those who do ask regret it).Enter – in that deathless flash of nightlight – Harry Lime. Because what is Lime if not a pioneer disaster capitalist, grasping the opportunities presented by chaos with a stash of tainted penicillin? Now, near the endgame, the point of the past three years is obvious – making possible the feral economy in which business minds such as Harry thrive, stripped of “red tape”, profit its own unarguable logic. “Free of income tax, old man,” he twinkles.It almost feels too on-the-nose that his racket takes place in the ultimate captive market – medicine. When the film was first released, the NHS was a year old. Now, it survives as the grand prize in a US trade deal Britons are assured we are first in line for, an army of Harrys poised to sell us an opioid epidemic and health insurance bankruptcies.With his loathing of American empire, Greene would be unsurprised to find Big Pharma circling. Yet at first, his villain sprang from closer to home. In Greene’s original novella, Lime and Martins were not Americans, but British subjects, old pals from private school. Harry’s crimes in Vienna are, we discover, those of a charismatic English scoundrel educated to rig the system.Indeed. It would be interesting to know what the current prime minister makes of Harry Lime – a habitual liar, his moral failures stuffed behind rogueish affability, an amply scaled betrayer of women, a nihilist and narcissist bulldozing through life with a bone-deep conviction that, as the novella puts it, “his happiness will make the world’s day”. Greene knew the type. He knew the poison in our golf clubs and members bars. The spivs and grotesques now running the country might have stepped whole from his pages, whipping up nationalism while discreetly betting against the pound and arranging second passports.High on the ferris wheel at the ghostly Prater amusement park, Harry prices up the tiny lives below. “Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving?” Now, the maths of no deal are only deranged if you value those dots above your investment fund. And we – car-factory workers, sheep farmers, research scientists, even film critics, all of us – wander below.The funny thing is that Britain’s greatest film was only ever part British anyway. Aside from the involvement of the Hollywood veteran David Selznick and the Anglo-Hungarian producer Alexander Korda, Greene learned of the real-life penicillin racket in Vienna from the Austrian journalist Peter Smolka. Our ruling ghoul squad would no doubt shriek that the continental influence explains the negativity. Others will see Smolka as a small but telling detail in pinning down how a 70-year-old film could map so closely on to our present debacle – an eyewitness to what happens once the rot sets in.How does it end? In 1949, American interests won the day: Greene was overruled by Selznick as to how to close the story. The mogul was proved right, refusing Greene’s original happy ending for a cynical parting note. For anyone who has never seen this cruelly brilliant film and wonders what it says about the road ahead, here is the spoiler warning. There is a funeral, a long solitary walk and then a fade to black.The Third Man screens at BFI Southbank 6-12 September and nationwide for one day only on 29 September, and is released on DVD and Blu-Ray later in the year."
"'Incel' violence is horrific, but Joker is complex, and doesn't take sides","Alarmist reactions to the ‘rightwing’ film – starring Joaquin Phoenix as a needy, dangerous wannabe star comic – overlook its subtler points",Christina Newland,2019-09-02T14:57:22+0100,"Todd Phillips’s Joker had its world premiere at the Venice film festival only on Saturday, so it’s impressive that nearly everyone on the internet has an opinion on it. Reviews from critics here have been largely positive, though have also already sparked discontented rumblings from that nebulous collection of industry folks and movie fans known as “film twitter”. One of the central points of contention around Phillips’s comic-book villain origin story is that it in some way panders to incel culture, or “involuntary celibates” – men who see themselves as losers and “beta males” who women don’t want to sleep with. Angry, misogynistic and feeling entitled to sex and attention, incels have been prone to real-world violence, as with the Isla Vista murders in 2014, when a killer targeted a sorority – shooting 11 people and killing six before killing himself.In Joker, Joaquin Phoenix’s unhinged Arthur Fleck is in every sense a loser – and perhaps in all but self-identification, an incel. He is friendless aside from his mother, works as a party clown, and his paralysing tendency to burst into peals of maniacal laughter unnerves everyone he meets. And when, like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (obsessed by Betsy), he becomes romantically intrigued by Sophie (Zazie Beetz), a pretty girl he barely knows, his fantasies go into overdrive.Yet romance and sex, or lack of these, is not a major factor in Joker’s move towards violence; he never expresses any particular malice toward Sophie. Rather, Arthur is driven by a (still very incel-esque) need to be seen and loved. In his case, it’s as a star comedian, but when he can’t achieve that goal, he finds more insidious routes to fame.The hand-wringing of cultural commentators is concerned that Joker might spark copycat violence or make the character a sort of folk hero for incels. It’s a possibility: Fleck has real wounded vulnerability, and while he seeks counselling and takes psych medications, social services cutbacks prevent him from accessing suitable care. Will some alienated young man identify with this? Will he, in the vein of Ronald Reagan’s would-be assassin John Hinckley, Jr (obsessed by Bickle’s assassination plot and Jodie Foster), see a movie about another alienated young man and become obsessed with taking action? Maybe. Does The Wolf of Wall Street encourage people to go out and sell bad penny stocks? Does Scarface glamorise cocaine? How different is this from blaming gun violence on video games?Joker is a smart, stylish, and troubling film: the man it depicts is a product of our current eraEssentially, what Phillips’s film asserts that we invite bloodshed and chaos if society ignores damaged people such as Fleck. That claim may be questionable, but what is true is that the film is good at what it does; it makes him disturbing and perversely thrilling to watch as he rises to the position of Gotham’s legendary arch-villain.However, despite suggestions that it is a reactionary call for incel vigilantism, Joker doesn’t especially cleave to one political perspective. With severe cuts to mental health services affecting Arthur’s stability, along with Phillips’s focus on the ominous effects of widespread gun ownership, it seems odd that it’s being hailed as wholly rightwing. Joker is a smart, stylish and troubling film: the man it depicts is a product of our era. But when people prepare themselves to hate a film based on its perceived political position, the culture of cinema suffers."
'Mozart would have made video game music': composer Eímear Noone on a winning art form,The Irish composer and conductor – who’s worked with film director Gus Van Sant and on World of Warcraft – talks passionately about making game music,Keith Stuart,2019-10-22T07:01:11+0100,"Eímear Noone got into composing and conducting video game music by accident. One day, while studying music at Trinity College Dublin, a fourth-year student came to the bar she was drinking in with members of the college chapel choir and offered them a few quid to help with the orchestration on a project of his.“I have a vivid memory of sitting on a studio floor somewhere in Dublin writing choral parts with my pals and then singing them,” she says. “Six months later, my brother calls me in a complete tizzy and says, ‘Did you work on Metal Gear Solid?’ I was like, ‘No!’ He says, ‘Well, I’m looking at your name on the screen credits right now.’ And sure enough, the session she had contributed to for beer money was the soundtrack to Hideo Kojima’s blockbuster adventure game. “Years later, I was at the Bird’s Nest in Beijing conducting this very piece of music,” she says. “It’s just a bizarre life.”Noone is now a successful composer for films and video games, having contributed scores for directors such as Gus Van Sant and Joe Dante, and for games such as World of Warcraft, Diablo III and Hearthstone. In November, she will present her second series of High Score, Classic FM’s programme dedicated to game music. Underappreciated outside of game fandom for years, the genre now has dedicated orchestras playing sold-out concert tours around the world. And Noone is a passionate advocate to explore and explain the unique elements of the form.There is, naturally, a foundational similarity between game and film scores: they are both composed to accompany and accentuate screened action. But while a film score needs to accompany a two-hour linear experience with specific cues and events, video game music must be present for many hours of play. Most open-word action adventures, such as Assassin’s Creed Origins, Witcher 3 and Final Fantasy XV, offer more than 100 hours of narrative, but many players will spend much longer exploring their worlds.Music has two roles in games: it accompanies the noninteractive cinematic sequences that set up the story and occur throughout a game (sort of like short animated movie sequences) and they provide background music while you play. “Cinematic are scored very similarly to a movie or an animated film,” says Noone. “The composer will be given an animatic, which could be anything from a fully rendered sequence to just stick figures on screen. But the edit is pretty close to what it’ll be in the end.“But when music needs to respond to changes the player makes in the world, we employ a kind of loop system. We use a recording method known as striping – we might record the strings separately, for example, but we’ll compose in a way that the strings on their own provide a functioning piece of music. Then, if our character triggers something in the world, perhaps a battle, we can land the wood winds or brass on top of that to increase the intensity. Each part must be self-contained yet work with others – you need to be able to kick in the brass, kick in the percussion, whenever its triggered by gameplay. It’s like a Rubik’s cube puzzle! This is the kind of thing Mozart would have enjoyed – he loved puzzles. Mozart would have loved making game music.”Noone also points out that video game scores help establish the reality of the world the player is about to explore: the instruments used, the style of music, the pace and tempo all work with the art and design to give the players clues about how the universe functions. “The composer has to put you in the headspace of the world, emotionally and intellectually,” she says. “Often these are fantasy worlds, but to ensure they make sense they must have their own rules – and the composer must abide by them. I had a fan contact me once who said ‘I was just listening to the score of World of Warcraft and there are electric guitars! There are no electric guitars in Azeroth!’ But these rules are important – they help make an authentic fantasy world.”For Noone, the most satisfying part is composing the themes that accompany the player throughout the interactive experience. “In-game music is where the composer gets the most freedom – it’s where we creates the big themes,. This is where a lot of the music we perform live with orchestras comes from; it’s the big identifiable themes that players associated with the game and with the characters.“Take the music of Koji Kondo – as soon as you hear the theme from Legend of Zelda, you’re right back in the game, you’re back in the time period in your life that you played it and you’re back with the people you played it with. It’s like hearing a great pop song playing over and over again on the radio – it encapsulates that time for you, it’s in bars, it’s in shops … and with video game music, you live with that soundtrack for the entire time you’re playing the game. It’s not two hours, it’s however long you spend in that game, which can be years.“Game soundtracks become the soundtracks to people’s childhoods, the soundtracks to their second childhoods and their children’s childhoods! More people are listening to orchestral music through video games than ever before in the history of recorded music.”Noone moves on to another difference between film and video game music: they follow different trends. “In film, there’s a stylistic trend at the moment away from the big theme,” she says. “Directors talk a lot about texture. But it seems that video game directors still embrace the big theme, and that’s good for composers because we want to write something more involving.”She is passionate and defensive about game music and its merits. I ask her if the medium, with its lush symphonic orchestration, is kind of old-fashioned – if you compare it to where modern instrumental music is going? I bring up Elgar and his use of big sweeping themes as an example of where game music seems to be and she smiles broadly. “Actually, this is a really good example because when Elgar was writing that music it would have been really uncool – it’s very emotional, it’s visual but at the time there was a lot of atonal music, things were changing, going into serialism even – and Elgar was writing these big lush emotional tunes – how dare he?!”So it’s quite radical for video game music to be overtly lush and emotional? “This is the music of the 21st century,” she says. “Look, we do have atonal music in video games – listen to Garry Schyman’s BioShock score, for instance. I just sat on a panel with Krzysztof Penderecki and his influence is all over horror games. It’s all about the context. There’s a gorgeous mobile game Contre Jour – it’s very visually different, and the piano score is reminiscent of the score to Amélie. I hear the influence of Glass or Reich in lots of what you might consider more traditional classically influenced scores – especially Steve Reich’s Proverb, the vocals on that. Ethereal vocals are definitely part of the video game music style.”For the next season of High Score, Noone has lined up some themed features dealing with specific elements of game music. One show is all about Japanese soundtracks, from the seminal work of Nobuo Uematsu and Yoko Shimomura, who operate in the western orchestral tradition, to J-pop-inspired Masato Nakamura, composer for Sonic the Hedgehog, who is part of the band, Dreams Come True. She also has a programme dedicated to nostalgia, looking back at the earliest works of composers such as Nintendo’s Koji Kondo, who started out on arcade games in the mid-1980s. Before the arrival of CD-Rom technology in the early 1990s, game soundtracks had to be programmed directly to sound chips, with only a very limited amount of memory available.Noone thinks this process was vital in forming the unique sound of game scores. “The reason some of these themes endure, especially Koji Kondo’s, is he had to sit down and painstakingly programme the themes in note by note – so every note mattered – he had to really seriously plan it. If you look at Beethoven’s manuscripts you’ll see him start with a complex theme and then cut that back and he ends up with the opening of the fifth symphony. Similarly, Koji had to refine and chisel down – and that’s why the themes from Mario and Zelda endure: they had to be simple but effective and meaningful.”Noone’s programmes then are going to be an interesting listen for game and music fans who want to understand why scores sound the way they do – and she can be amusingly honest about how game scores (just like film scores) have tropes and techniques that composers will rely on again and again. “If I’m going to be really simplistic, we all know instantly that when the chord of C major goes to F sharp major then back to C major, there’s a spaceship about to fly over head,” she laughs.“Flat five one or sharp four one is a spaceship flying over. That’s it. Every time.”• Eímear Noone presents the new series of High Score from 9 November at 9-10pm on Classic FM."
"Anthony Hopkins, the reluctant actor – archive, 1969","22 October 1969: As fame beckons, Hopkins is uneasy about becoming a star, saying ‘Acting is a third rate art. We are all over paid and over publicised. I hate actors but I love acting’",,2019-10-22T05:30:50+0100,"The Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins, once a stalwart member of the National Theatre, is the latest recruit to the ranks of film spy anti-heroes. He is shortly to emerge as Philip Calvert, Alistair MacLean’s new character, described variously as “the first under-water spy” and “a slightly ribald Secret Service agent.” The first film in this series which the publicity machine confidently predicts will “Out-Bond Bond” – called When Eight Bells Toll – is presently being filmed on the Island of Mull.Tony Hopkins is 31 and the future seems bright indeed, considering that he was playing a walk-on part at the Old Vic only four years ago. But, although he admits he would be a fool not to be delighted at such a starring role, something in him is balking from enjoying the prospect of fame. He confesses to being in a very strange frame of mind rather than in a state of euphoria. He is, in fact, going through an old transition stage and is finding it difficult to adjust to the fact that although he still feels like an ordinary person just doing his job. Others have already dubbed him a star and consequently expect him to behave like one. For a start, he doesn’t look like a star, unless as a boxer or a footballer, and not being able to be himself is unnerving him. Gloomily he tells of how he greeted an electrician on the film set the other day in a friendly fashion only to have the man turn on him and say “Don’t patronise me boy.”Sitting brooding in a Scottish hotel lounge, knees drawn up to his chin, Hopkins said glumly that he had never made so much money nor been so neurotic. “The thing that annoys me is that everybody takes acting so damn seriously. Whereas all I take seriously is the actual work in hand, which is what I am paid to do. Once an actor gets all intense about it, I think he’s had it. One needs to be able to stand outside oneself and have a good laugh about it. What I can’t come to terms with is that with me, acting is just a job, and I can’t see why it matters what colour pyjamas I wear or what I look for in a woman. I keep getting asked that kind of question and I despair because it is all so unimportant. What is important is not even my talent, but energy, production, and sheer hard work. Those are the things that go towards making a great actor.”Before he made his mark as Richard the Lionheart, in the film A Lion In Winter, Hopkins was very happy at the National Theatre. His admiration lies very much with the older school of actors, the ones who do not theorise a play out of existence. At the Old Vic he rose to roles like Andrey in The Three Sisters and was much feted for his rendering of Andrey, the country wench, in the all-male As You Like It.His great moment came when he stood in for Olivier in Dance of Death and got an overwhelming reception for his performances. He recalls “I suffered from chronic nausea for days and went through three sweat shirts in the first act, whereas Olivier would come off without a bead of sweat. It gave me a taste of my inadequacy and an even greater admiration for Olivier. It also gave me a taste of blood; I minded terribly when I stopped playing it. I had always wanted to play that kind of part so I wanted to show off and do it again and again.He was sad to leave the National which he did partly to make a film but partly because he was running the risk, in staying, of standing in line with many other excellent actors.“Tyrone Guthrie once said that any actor who has not played five of the great roles by 30 is only a working actor. I’m 31 and I haven’t really played any of them but I still want to be a BIG actor and do them. I would like to play Hamlet, of course, but I would also like to play Claudius again, under different circumstances.”Last time he played Claudius, to Nicol Williamson’s Hamlet in the Tony Richardson production he says it poisoned his mind – “Richardson and I did not see eye to eye. I nearly lost my mind when he said: ‘And what piece of genius is Mr Hopkins going to bring to rehearsal today?’ I hate all this ‘did Hamlet sleep with Ophelia?’ type of theatre. All that theorising by over-intellectual directors is dehydrating actors. All that playing cricket before rehearsal to get the correct reflexes – I think it stinks.”Tony Hopkins is a doer rather than a talker. A very workmanlike actor whose anger at the system smacks of the anger of last decade, yet it is rather refreshing. He protests a lot, but it isn’t an empty protest. Why, though, one wants to ask, is he an actor at all? “Acting is a third rate art. We are all over paid and over publicised. I hate actors but I love acting. I get ashamed with myself for doing it. I know I ought to be doing something else. If I was honest I’d say I like it because I’m vain, I’m comfortable, I like money and attention, but really I hate the whole set-up. I am taking the line of least resistance in doing films and it makes me feel like a con-man. When I think about how my parents slaved all their lives in a bakery for peanuts it just seems too easy. And that seems wrong somehow.”This is an edited version."
Ariel Levy on Demi Moore: 'She was sick of people trying to tell her who she should be',"From hosting a podcast about Jeffrey Epstein to ghostwriting for one of Hollywood’s most famous, the journalist reflects on life after her ‘trial by fire’",Brigid Delaney,2019-10-22T02:14:55+0100,"Ariel Levy wrote one of October’s top bestselling books in the US, but you may not know it. After all, her name is not on the cover.The American journalist has written some of the most compelling profiles in the last decade as a staff writer for the New Yorker, and she specialises in writing about interesting women. She has profiled Edith Windsor, the plaintiff who won a landmark case in the fight for gay marriage in the US; Diana Nyad, who, at the age of 64, was the first person in the world to swim from Cuba to Florida; and Julia Louis-Dreyfus of Veep and Seinfeld fame.“I have always been interested in the question of ‘what does it means to be a woman’?” says Levy. “The thing I’m always looking for is the counterintuitive.”Now she has teamed up with Hollywood superstar Demi Moore, ghostwriting her memoir, Inside Out. The book, released earlier this month, has surprised readers with its candid revelations about Moore’s career, relationships and her chaotic childhood.Levy recognises how incongruous this partnership seems. Speaking to the Guardian from the US ahead of her upcoming visit to Australia for the Broadside festival, she laughs when asked about her relationship with Moore. “If you had told me five years ago I would be good friends with Demi Moore, that she would be someone I could really properly talk to, I wouldn’t have believed you. The most surprising thing was that we could relate at all.”Levy’s involvement in the book began after Moore’s publisher read Levy’s own 2017 memoir, The Rules Do Not Apply, and thought the two shared some overlapping experiences – including the experience of miscarriage. “Her editor read my memoir and had a feeling that we would get each other, and we met and we did,” says Levy.I have become a better person – better at being alive – since I’ve had my arse kickedMoore was also grateful for the help of a professional writer, telling the Wall Street Journal: “I wanted it to be a good book, but I didn’t feel like my skill set lent itself to be able to do that.”The process involved many conversations with Moore at the actor’s homes in California and Idaho, and then turning the transcripts into a book written in her voice.“I spent a lot of time with [Moore], so I got a feel for how she communicates. The book does sound like her, not like me. I did that by using her words. A lot of what’s in there is direct quotes. It’s her language and it’s her story. I was a midwife.”The construction of the book is not dissimilar to Levy’s, beginning with a dramatic moment before rewinding and telling the story of how Moore got there.“It’s pretty raw,” says Levy. “She really went for it. She didn’t take anything out. I think she really wanted to communicate. She was sick of people trying to tell her who she should be.”After writing The Rules Do Not Apply and talking about her own life for months on end while on an international tour, Levy was keen to have a break from her own story. “I was sick of myself,” she says.Levy’s own memoir is a harrowing read. In it she describes how she lost her marriage, house and baby in quick succession, and how it felt, at mid-life, to not have the life you want. It could be described as a second coming-of-age memoir – about how the real work of adulthood begins with loss.“There are very few people that I’ve met who have not had a trial by fire,” says Levy. “I don’t know if it makes them a better person, but I have become a better person – better at being alive – since I’ve had my arse kicked.”Now, “everyone tells me about their miscarriages. It’s a privilege when people tell me about this really personal, animal, primal experience of being a woman. I like that people tell me about that stuff. It’s a deep way to connect.”Levy has also made her first foray into podcasting, hosting Broken: Jeffrey Epstein, a detailed exploration of the sex-trafficking scandal that has implicated so many rich and powerful people.“To me what’s interesting is the web of humanity involved – all these lives intersect. You had Trump, Clinton, Prince Andrew and then all these girls that work at McDonald’s and live at West Palm Beach, which is a really hard place. Girls from a certain type of background, girls who were poor, [Epstein] just walked on,” she says.Levy is skilled at seeing patterns of patriarchy and sexism that lie under the surface of everyday life. Her 2005 book, Female Chauvinist Pigs, explored how early 2000s raunch culture sold sexual objectification back to women as female empowerment, often resulting in women objectifying themselves.She believes that things have changed since then – but not for the better. “I think it’s a more dire time now.”Her own life, though, is finally back on a more even keel. She is married to the South African doctor she met in Mongolia, who treated her when she had a miscarriage while on assignment for the New Yorker. The pair live most of the year in New York state on Shelter Island and South Africa “for a couple of months of the year”, where Levy’s stepsons attend university.“This is a really nice time in my life right now.”• Ariel Levy will be a guest at Broadside festival, held in Melbourne on 9 and 10 November"

Paul Feig: 'Male humour always devolves into homophobia and name-calling',"The director adores working with women – but did the all-female Ghostbusters furore change that? Not a bit, he says ",Rebecca Nicholson,2019-10-18T08:00:47+0100,"Paul Feig has a tendency to make films that are difficult to talk about until you have seen them. The trailers for Spy, The Heat and A Simple Favour, for example, paint pictures quite different from the finished movies. Often, you leave the cinema feeling as if you have been pleasantly fooled.It’s certainly true with Last Christmas, which the director is sitting down to talk about in early September, and which appears, based on its teaser, to be a mushy festive romcom. Naturally, it doesn’t quite go where you would expect it to, which of course means we can’t really talk about the film we are here to talk about. “Exactly,” he says, smiling. He is wearing, as is his custom, an impossibly dapper three-piece suit, and he has a sweetly nervous cough/chuckle that ripples up as he speaks. “A lot of the movies I do just happen to have something like that in it. But I like people being surprised.”Last Christmas, very loosely inspired by the music of George Michael and Wham!, stars Emilia Clarke as a woman recovering from a life-threatening illness and whose day-to-day existence is a boozy, reckless mess. It turns out that Daenerys Targaryen is an excellent comic actor. “Isn’t it crazy?” Feig says. A huge Game of Thrones fan, he summoned her for a meeting. “I was expecting her to be very Daenerys, you know, proper: ‘How do you do?’ She comes in, and she’s just funny, goofy and effervescent. I equate her in this movie to when Meg Ryan was in When Harry Met Sally. The whole country just goes: we’re in love with you.”The film is also Feig’s love letter to London, where he has been living for the past year, even if it takes some geographical liberties: “They walk from the Embankment to Ally Pally [Alexandra Palace, which is several miles away]. Then they run out of Ally Pally on to the Strand! I have great guilt about that.” He loves London so much that he and his wife are making plans to move here. He got involved with the film when he went for a walk with Emma Thompson on Hampstead Heath to talk about directing Mindy Kaling’s Late Night, in which Thompson starred, but the timings didn’t work out. However, a friendship was born. “I was in the process of signing on to do a different film somewhere else, and into my inbox popped up this email from Emma, titled The Script What I Wrote, in good old Morecambe-and-Wise tradition.” He always gets nervous when friends send him scripts. “The best people in the world will send me a script sometimes and you’re just like: ‘I don’t know.’ But I read this and was completely out of my mind, and so impressed by it.”This is his second Christmas movie. The first, Unaccompanied Minors, came out in 2006, but was a flop. What did he learn from it? “Apparently nothing,” he laughs, “because I did another Christmas film.” The script, by Thompson and Bryony Kimmings, and the prospect of being in London in December tempted him back. “Like it or not, London, you do Christmas amazingly well.” Also, its seasonal setting means it is guaranteed to come out for Christmas, and the release won’t get bumped. “I’m just desperate for people to see my movies,” he says. Is he really worried they won’t? “We’ll see,” he shrugs. “Every new movie is a chance to fail.”Feig’s film career came off the back of a hugely successful one in television. He created the cult teen series Freaks and Geeks, produced by Judd Apatow, and he seems to have directed at least a few episodes of the greatest shows from the past two decades: Mad Men, 30 Rock, The Office, Parks and Recreation. But film was a slow starter. “I had done two unsuccessful movies, one being the first Christmas movie. That really stuck me in movie jail. It lost money for the studio.” Just before that one came out, he had been invited to the table read of a script that would become Bridesmaids. “I remember going: ‘Oh my God, this is what I want to do – a movie filled with all these funny women.’ Then it fell away for three years. I would call Judd occasionally, and be like: ‘Is that movie around?’ And he’d say: ‘I don’t think it’s gonna go.’”Feig found himself in a funk, which became apparent when he was directing an internet campaign for a department store. “It was a fun job, but one of the people I was directing was Donald Trump.” He laughs, awkwardly. “It was so unnerving, and he was unnerving. He was actually a fan of The Office, so he was like: ‘Hey, that’s the guy who did The Office.’ But he had such a weird energy about him. I remember being back at my hotel room and thinking: ‘I’m so far away from doing what I want to do.’” Then the phone rang. “I got a call from my agent going, hey, I think the wedding movie is gonna go.”Bridesmaids transformed his career. “But making it was terrifying. I always called it strike three, because if this one bombs, I’m dead.” He says there was additional pressure on it as a funny film written by and about women. “It shows how crazy and terrible the town can be, because really, they’re like, before we do other movies with women, let’s see how this one does. Would they ever say that when they’re making The Hangover? Like, all right, if this men-driven movie works, we can make more of these?”Feig has always related to women, and since Bridesmaids, all his films have had female leads. They’re usually about women as outsiders; not quite managing to fit in where they are supposed to. “I was an only child. I grew up next to a family of eight kids, six of whom were girls. I liked the humour of joking around with my female friends because male humour devolves, eventually, into homophobia, punching and name-calling. I’d rather just have goofy fun.” Later, when he was acting and directing, he was frustrated with what he was seeing on screen. “I had [female] friends who were actors and comedians, and they would show up in movies and I’d be, like: ‘Oh yay, they’re going to be funny. And, what, they’re not funny?’ I love School of Rock, but I remember thinking: ‘Sarah Silverman is one of the funniest people on the planet. Why is she just being this mean girlfriend who’s not funny?’”After Bridesmaids, he was sent scripts in a similar vein, but he has hopped around genres with joyful promiscuity: thriller, action, spy heist, buddy-cop movie. On the day we meet, it is announced that he will direct a classic monster movie called Dark Army, but there are more still that he wants to try. “Well, a musical, first and foremost. I want to do a big sci-fi epic. But not a pre-existing franchise.”In 2016, Feig found himself at the centre of an internet storm, when his all-female Ghostbusters reboot unwittingly poked the hornet’s nest of online misogynistic trolls. Is that why he wouldn’t go for anything that already exists? “A little bit, yeah,” he says, his nervous cough/laugh returning. “What is weird is when you come into something that brings a set of rules that are unbreakable because, as a storyteller, you’re, like, why can’t I break that? Can’t I have fun with that?” That’s why he did the reboot. “For better or worse. I mean, we’ll find out when Jason’s movie [Reitman, who is making a Ghostbusters sequel] comes out. If that goes through the roof, I’ll go: ‘Sure, I guess I made a mistake doing a reboot.’ But I will never apologise for it because I’m very proud of the movie.”He is writing Dark Army at the moment. “I’m sure there are going to be websites that get completely up in arms about it, but I’m at a point now where I don’t care. I used to care, and Ghostbusters was a really cathartic, terrible thing to go through, but it was cathartic.” He used to think everybody on the internet had to like him. Now, he cares a lot less. “You go: ‘It’s just the internet.’ I love all the amazing people I’ve connected with over the years on the internet, but then the ones that hate you, you’re like: ‘I can’t do anything about you.’”Feig is not one for sequels. There is, as yet, no Bridesmaids II, no The Heat II, no Spy II. In an age of TV classics being rebooted, I ask if he would ever consider bringing the much-loved Freaks and Geeks back. “I get asked all the time to do it. I’m very scared of sequels or continuations of things because they’re very easy to screw up. James Brown is my inspiration: he says hit it and quit it.”That said, he would like to make another Spy. Then he surprises me. “And I would actually make another Ghostbusters, if anybody ever wanted it, because I loved that world. I was like a kid in a candy store.” I tell him I would love to see it. “Well, some day,” he laughs. “Probably not. But thank you.”Last Christmas is released on 15 November"
'It was like lighting yourself on fire': how Shia LaBeouf's co-star changed his life,"When the troubled actor made a film with Zack Gottsagen, who has Down’s syndrome, his drunken arrest nearly wrecked the project. The pair talk about rehab, redemption – and wrestling",Danny Leigh,2019-10-18T06:00:59+0100,"Where do you start with Shia LaBeouf? The former child star and teenage action hero, latter-day performance artist and Hollywood outcast vapes as a tune plays on his phone. The song is Our House by 1970s supergroup Crosby, Stills and Nash. (“A very, very, very fine house.”) He dances. “What do you want to listen to?” he asks the other actor in the room, Zack Gottsagen. “Pick a song.” Gottsagen, who has Down’s syndrome, shrugs and looks across at me. “He’s from the Guardian,” LaBeouf says in a tone that might be called sceptical. He switches off the music. “All right,” he says. “Let’s talk our shit.”Ahead of this interview, I watch YouTube footage of LaBeouf’s 2017 arrest for public drunkenness in Savannah, Georgia. Physically, he looks much the same now, beard and T-shirt and worked-on upper arms. Then I watch The Peanut Butter Falcon, the film he was making at the time. It stars Gottsagen as a young man with Down’s syndrome who goes on the run from the retirement home he has been placed in by the state, joining a fugitive fisherman played by LaBeouf on an escape along the eastern seaboard. The result – charming, Mark Twain-ish – was the sleeper hit of the US summer. For Gottsagen, 34, the bustle of interviews and film festivals is something new. LaBeouf, 33, is less excited. “I’ve been on this rollercoaster several times,” he says. “So the only way for it to be fun is to do it with someone who has never been on it before.”Gottsagen has been acting in amateur plays since he was a child, inspired by Grease and Hairspray, with a striking gift as a performer. In the film, he and LaBeouf play off each other beautifully. “I always wanted to do acting to express my feelings and also to show people my abilities,” he says. He met writer-directors Tyler Nilson and Mike Schwartz at a California film-making camp for actors with and without disabilities. The three resolved to make a feature to showcase Gottsagen – a herculean task given their lack of industry connections.For a time, Nilson pitched the project while living in a tent in LA. When the idea did reach executives, the conversations ended when Nilson said that it would star an actual actor with Down’s. Finally, with a modest budget at last in place, the trio’s “proof-of-concept” video was sent to LaBeouf. It was April 2017, the actor en route to a performance art project – a month alone in a remote Lapland cabin, from where he watched the video over and over.There was, LaBeouf says, a sense of truth to Gottsagen on screen he was desperate to act opposite. “I knew I’d be playing bass to his lead.” Did the novelty of a supporting role come as a relief? He is shaking his head before I’ve finished the question. “Not novelty. Novelty’s a shit word. There’s no novelty to Base jumping. Right? There’s no novelty to skydiving. Novelty is safe. This didn’t feel safe.” There is a long moment of eye contact. “This felt like lighting yourself on fire.”I ask Gottsagen if he knew about his co-star before the film, and he nods and lists the hits of the chipper first act of the Shia LaBeouf story – the sitcom Even Stevens he starred in at 14, the Transformers movies, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Beyond that, LaBeouf himself is acutely aware, the references get darker. The paper bag reading “I Am Not Famous Anymore” worn over his head at the premiere of Lars von Trier’s Nymphomaniac. The plagiarism of graphic novelist Daniel Clowes with his film Howard Cantour.com. The many run-ins with the police. The general air of hot mess.My life had exploded again and I was in deep shame. This film saved meLa Beouf rarely deals with journalists any more. Before his last major interview, promoting the film McEnroe vs Borg in 2018 – naturally, he played John McEnroe – he spent weeks with his therapist preparing answers to potential questions. His publicist insisted that all the questions for this interview focus on The Peanut Butter Falcon. Among the subjects implied to be off limits is Honey Boy, another new movie that LaBeouf stars in and wrote, about his early life as a child actor. He plays his own father. There is talk of Oscars for script and performance.LaBeouf’s answers tend to come as monologues. He describes returning to the US after a lonely month in Lapland to meet Gottsagen for the first time, the pair driven by van to Georgia to start preparing for the shoot. LaBeouf, skittish and talkative, was disarmed by his co-star’s silence. Eventually, they held hands. “And I don’t know if you’ve looked at this motherfucker’s hands, but these are the most beautiful hands, and something about holding them calmed all my fear.” The story is sweet, vividly told, and if transcribed in full, would take up half this piece.Gottsagen’s memories of the drive are snappier. “I could tell Shia was a badass,” he says. But for him, the journey was still more profound, his film finally being made after a life of being told he could never be a professional actor. He wanted, he says, the industry to understand that disabled actors could be movie stars, too.Although he has lived independently for several years, his mother Shelley remains a major presence in his life. Before filming began, LaBeouf says, she and he had a frank conversation. “On paper, I’m a fuck-up.” He says this matter-of-factly. “I’m not Tom Hanks. Search my name on the internet and you’re going to find a list of scary things. So it was a risk for them.” He wanted, he says, to spend as much time as possible with Gottsagen, mimicking their characters’ relationship. “For Zack, that was going to be uncomfortable, because here’s this dude who doesn’t want to go away. I don’t want to go to another room. I want to be in his room. I couldn’t ask certain actors for that. Certain actors are too professional.”In the evenings during the shoot, the pair routinely hung out. They watched wrestling, much loved by Gottsagen, and scolded each other over their vices: Gottsagen ate too much ice-cream; LaBeouf drank too much gin. Alcohol has long been a problem.At 4am on 8 July 2017, a drunk LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, having initially approached a stranger for a cigarette. Evidence of how the situation escalated is widely available online, including bodycam footage from a black police officer who, the actor ranted at length, should not have been arresting “a white person who gives a fuck” in the age of Trump. LaBeouf was bailed later that morning, by which time word had reached the production, and everywhere else besides.LaBeouf talks about his return to set in the present tense. “I can’t look anyone in the eye. And I can’t come to terms with it. And no one’s talking to me and I’m talking to no one, and I know my life has exploded again. And I am in deep shame.”With the legal fallout still uncertain, Gottsagen sat on the floor opposite LaBeouf, to tell him he had jeopardised his one chance of starring in a film. Don’t blow this for me, he said. “I was mad,” Gottsagen says. “Angry. Frustrated.” Both men cried. “And I was worried about Shia doing the wrong things, being out in the middle of the night.”When the shoot restarted, Nilson and Schwartz had the actors film a scene onboard a boat in which LaBeouf’s character is overcome by guilt. As they waited for “action” to be called, without knowing the camera was already rolling, Gottsagen reached out and lay his hand on his co-star’s back. LaBeouf crumpled into him. “That is not method acting bullshit,” he says. “To be given permission to come into this man’s life and the infractions still come – right then, I’m broken. That’s documentary.”LaBeouf promised Gottsagen he would not drink for the rest of the shoot. Two years later, he is still sober. He later admitted the role in his case of white privilege (had he been arrested as a person of colour, other outcomes would have been likely). After filming came court-ordered rehab. There, a counsellor told him to write down the most significant events in his life story. Steeped in movies, he did so in script form, then sent that script to his friend, director Alma Har’el.The result became Honey Boy, titled after his father’s pet name for him. Jeffrey LaBeouf was a Vietnam veteran and former heroin addict who is resentfully on his son’s payroll, the pre-teen Shia a jobbing actor on low-rent TV shows. A poor kid breadwinning in the space where a childhood is meant to go, without the boundaries that other 12-year-olds have, it makes the perfect recipe for an adulthood spent clashing with authority. The film is incredible – like a cartoon character turned flesh-and-blood in front of you, then telling you their innermost secrets.By now, talking about it seems unavoidable. I ask LaBeouf which of his two new films feels more exposing. He answers without missing a beat. “This film is much more exposing than Honey Boy. Peanut Butter Falcon feels like real time. Like watching myself through a window. Honey Boy is a history. It hits hard, but it has novelty. It’s less dangerous. It’s much more something you put on a shelf.” Because he wrote it himself? Crafted it? “Yeah. It seems more naked, right? It’s not more naked. What it is, is a film about this clown mask everyone knows me for, that I’ve been wearing a very long time. To me, it’s not a revelation.People tell me to stay away from Shia. They don't understand the real him. I tell them I won't“Honey Boy explains my life up to this point,” he says. “This film saved my life. They’re different things.”The tricksy nature of actors – suckers for a killer line – is not lost on LaBeouf. He also seems tired of make-believe. His career in studio movies has been put into deep freeze by his reputation, but much about his old life seems to go unmourned. “I hadn’t been in love with it for a long time,” he says. There was, he says, a lot of “novelty brotherhood”. Two years after leaving Georgia, he and Gottsagen are still frequently in touch. Outside the interview, they discuss attending the wrestling spectacular WrestleMania. LaBeouf has lately directed his energies towards Slauson Rec, the free acting school he co-founded in downtown LA; Gottsagen has taught other disabled actors for many years. LaBeouf talks about his honesty like a talisman.“I look to him as an example. I know I come in defensive. I come in playing music. I say: ‘Here we go with the Guardian.’ I try to bring my world into the room. He doesn’t. You came in here and he was sitting quietly. He’s Paul Newman. So I look to him and I know I need to switch my life up.”The two now have their arms around each other. Gottsagen tells LaBeouf he loves him. “I love you, too,” LaBeouf says.He starts to speak again, but Gottsagen – having spent the past few minutes sitting being talked about – has his own monologue to deliver. “I have been changing Shia’s life,” he says. “That’s how I do things. And Shia has proved to himself he doesn’t have to act out. So I’m going to keep taking the chance of being close to him.” Every word is measured, deliberate. “A lot of people have come to me talking about Shia, and they always tell me: ‘Stay away from Shia.’ But I am not going to do that. My answer is: ‘No.’ Because people don’t understand the real Shia. And those people need to stop saying those things about Shia. And I don’t really care how people feel about that, because I can make my own decisions.”The Peanut Butter Falcon is released today. See review, page 10"
"'God, I was disgusting!' – Ali Wong on why women's bodies are the last taboo","The standup behind Baby Cobra found fame with her candid material on sex and pregnancy. Back with a memoir, she talks about her work ethic, the taboo of miscarriage – and performing in front of her in-laws",Emine Saner,2019-10-17T06:00:59+0100,"In her memoir, written as letters to her two young daughters, Ali Wong tells them she would be worried if they wanted to become standup comics like her. Wong, who slogged it out on the open-mic circuit, presents a grim account of life on the road: dying onstage, bad food, bad men. She did it for more than a decade before becoming a star seemingly overnight with her first Netflix special, performed while seven-and-a-half months pregnant. Did she ever consider giving up? “There were times when I thought to myself: ‘I really don’t know if I can do this for the rest of my life,’” she says on the phone from her home in LA. “You know, staying at those motels, getting paid that little amount of money. I’m certain I would not have endured. I couldn’t. Especially after having kids.”Luckily for Wong, she didn’t have to; instead, her career blew up. In 2016, Netflix launched her special, Baby Cobra, and she has since had a second, Hard Knock Wife. She has also co-written and starred in a romantic comedy film, Always Be My Maybe; had her two children; and published Dear Girls, the memoir written for them. Her tours sell out and her peers rave about her (Amy Schumer calls her “revolutionary”, Chris Rock championed her). “It’s been an unbelievable three years,” she says with some understatement.Offstage, she seems softer and more laid-back than her fierce and foul-mouthed standup persona. In the book, she recalls starting out: “I was very dirty back then. Even now, I’ll look back on those days and think: ‘God, you were disgusting.’” Which is very funny if you have seen any of Wong’s comedy, because you will know how filthy she is now. In Baby Cobra, there are gags about anal sex and vaginal secretions; in Hard Knock Wife, there are jokes about the things she would like to do to their nanny if he was 25, male and “not ugly”.When Wong first performed comedy, she was repeatedly told it was all too much. “All of these people in the industry kept on telling me: ‘You’re likable and you’re cute, or whatever, but the jokes are really dirty and you’d get booked a lot more, and you’d be a lot more appealing if they were clean,’” she says. “Maybe people were half-laughing, half-cringing at my jokes. But if you’re successful, people should be too busy laughing to cringe.” Her jokes may not have got cleaner, but they did get better.Even now, she says people (men) told her that her material on childbirth and breastfeeding, which made it into her second special, wasn’t interesting enough. “There was one guy who said: ‘It was so much better when you were talking about dating because people can’t relate to breastfeeding,’” she says. “But it’s all I wanted to talk about. That’s kind of the whole point for me with standup, that this is not a network TV sitcom where I have to appeal to everyone.” She pauses for a split second: “I ignored that advice.”Wong is not the first female comic to tell dirty jokes, or talk about sex, but what does feel unusual is her insistence on busting the idea that at the raw, biological level, women aren’t every bit as revolting as men. Why is it still so taboo for women to talk about bodily functions and all the fluids and secretions that ooze out of us? “I was raised to be very open about my body,” she says. Her father was a doctor, and she says her parents were always very straight with her about everything, from sex to the nonexistence of Santa Claus. She thinks for a moment about the question of taboo. “Maybe it’s because women feel they want to maintain some mystery that they’re not gross, to be more attractive or something. For me it’s all part of intimacy. That’s how I define intimacy – living closer and being more honest, closer to what your real desires are – and it’s exciting.”Still, people thank me for making them feel less embarrassed, less ashamed and less sad about having a miscarriageHer parents have been to her shows. Worse, so have her in-laws. (She is married to Justin Hakuta, who worked for a tech company but gave it up to support her career.) “That was nerve-racking. I was much less polished then and I think I talked about Japanese porn and how they blur out the genitals, and I did an imitation of a Japanese porn star screaming. That was pretty wild. But they were really supportive.”I wonder if she is unembarrassable (there are jokes about defecating at work and her promiscuity during her 20s). “No. For sure, no. I’ll give you an example.” She says that the other day, she and Randall Park, her friend and co-star in Always Be My Maybe, were guest judges on the TV show Top Chef. “I saw his face sort of scrunch up and I was like: ‘Oh my God, I’m so sorry, I think I accidentally farted.’ He moved his chair away from me and he was laughing hysterically, too. It smelled so bad and I was so embarrassed.” She laughs: “I’m definitely embarrassable.”When she had a miscarriage, which she talked about in her first Netflix show, one of her emotions was embarrassment. “I felt a lot of things. I felt sad, but then when I had to tell everybody the news it was something …” She pauses. “Embarrassment is when you wish you didn’t have to tell somebody something, and it wasn’t something I really wanted to share with everybody but I had to because I had bragged that I was pregnant.” There was a huge reaction to Wong talking about her miscarriage at the time. “It was very taboo for women to talk about miscarriage and it still kind of is. Still to this day, people walk up to me on the street, thanking me for making them feel less embarrassed, less ashamed and less sad about having a miscarriage.”Wong writes that “comedy requires taking risks”, although she says this is less about subject matter – nothing is off-limits as long as the joke is well-written – than about being unafraid of failure. “I guess that’s what I meant about taking risks: for every polished joke you see onstage, there are maybe 100 I tried out that failed. And people in the audience thinking I was a terrible comedian. I was always kind of OK with that.”As a child, Wong was funny but, the youngest of four, she was also a quiet observer. “I would say that I grew up listening, a lot. I have vivid memories of details, things people said and how exactly they said them.” She grew up in San Francisco, where her father, born to Chinese parents, was an anaesthetist, and her mother, born in Vietnam, was a social worker. What was it like to write about her family’s experience of being immigrants? “It was great because I think about it all the time,” she says. Her paternal grandfather came to the US from China as an eight-year-old, travelling alone by ship. “I see kids and how young they really are and I cannot imagine them coming on a boat by themselves, going to another country to work and be separated from their parents. It really humbles me and makes me grateful and it gave me a huge sense of …” She thinks for a second. “It’s part of my identity and gave me a very strong work ethic.”A few hours after she got married in San Francisco, Wong performed in her wedding dress at a club in the city; some nights early on in her career, while living in New York, she would perform up to nine sets at different clubs. She has only had four breaks from standup – her honeymoon, after the births of her two daughters, and when she was shooting the film. These days, once the children are in bed, she turns up unannounced and unpaid at comedy clubs up to five nights a week to try out new material. She describes it as a “calling. I just really like telling jokes”.I used to dress like a kid, to desexualise myself. I'd be terrified if my daughters wanted to be standupsShe writes that she has an “unusual amount of Asian pride”. That came from her parents, she says. “A lot of people talk about how they never saw themselves on screen but my parents actively made sure I saw myself on screen all the time. And we had friends who were artists and we would go to their gallery shows.” Now, she says, she makes an effort to see what other Asian American creators are up to – whether in TV, literature, art or fashion – and will introduce her children to it. “I think [if you] consume mainstream pop culture and don’t activate a search for any other niche outlets then you can fall into this feeling that you are inferior.”One male comic once told her that her career was only taking off because she was female and from an ethnic minority. “That they have that attitude towards me is an indicator of why they are lacking in success. If you think that is the winning combo for success then you’re in trouble.” Wasn’t it infuriating? “You know, it’s not. If it was someone that I respected it would really bum me out.”When Wong first started performing, she would wear her hair in two cute buns, and dress in “huge cargo pants”. “I used to dress like a kid, to desexualise myself,” she says. “I think that’s the main reason why I would be so terrified if my daughters wanted to be standup comics – it’s not because of them being onstage, it’s because of the road. You kind of have to go through that.” The comics she respects are the ones who came up through the circuit, rather than those who got famous on a sitcom or YouTube videos. “But the road is very scary. It always felt unsafe. Even now, when I perform at shows around town, I always ask somebody to walk me back to my car.”With the #MeToo movement, comedy has come under scrutiny and there have been allegations of sexual harassment made against several male comics. Has Wong ever experienced sexual harassment at work? She is hesitant for a while, trying to find the words. “I think I’m just not ready to share all that stuff yet, but of course there has been not-great stuff that’s happened. So … yeah. In terms of how things have changed, I guess nowadays the culture has changed, so that when people do some joke that you’ve heard before about women being ‘naggy’ or something, it just feels dated. A lot of material that would make fun of women that used to be maybe kind of funny doesn’t feel funny any more.”Wong runs jokes about her husband past him before they make it into her shows. “A hilarious joke that performs well in front of strangers but that my husband hates is not worth getting divorced over,” she says. “My marriage is much more valuable than a great joke.” Does he mind being talked about? “I get asked that all the time but male comics have been making fun of their wives for so long and I wonder if male comics get asked the same thing. This is what standup comics do: they talk about their life and if they have a partner, they talk about their partner. But I don’t feel like male comics are ever asked about what it’s like for their wife.” I think she is right, but a male comic probably would get asked, were he to make jokes, as Wong does, about the most intimate details of their sex life. “Right,” says Wong, with a laugh. “Yes, yes. That’s true.”While her hilarious and unrelenting filthiness is what got Wong noticed, her comedy is full of more nuanced commentary on what it is to be a woman: the double standards of mothering, the pressures of out-earning one’s husband, the reconciliation of bringing up two children under four and doing a job she loves. “I constantly feel like I’m failing at both working and being your mom,” she writes in Dear Girls. In Hard Knock Wife, she talks about the scandal of the US’s lack of paid maternity leave; is she interested in being more political? “I don’t know,” she says, then, as an aside: “As a British person, don’t you think it’s just so barbaric that we don’t give maternity leave?” Topical, political jokes, she says, have “never been my forte. I’m also a little bit intimidated because there are so many other comics who are so good at that.” She is well placed to skewer it in the current climate in the US, increasingly hostile to immigrants, but doesn’t seem sure if she wants to go there. Still, she points out, by doing what she loves and doing it well, “even me putting myself out there sometimes is political. You know what I mean? Some people can’t stand that.”Dear Girls is out today, published by Canongate, available for £13.19 from Guardian Bookshop.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Ken Loach – all his films ranked!,"From the groundbreaking dramas of the 60s, through the early-90s resurgence to the unexpected box office successes of recent years, we assess the director’s output",Andrew Pulver,2019-10-17T14:46:13+0100,"Ken Loach’s contribution to this short-film package of film-makers’ responses to 9/11 is a perfectly serviceable account of a different September 11: an activist’s letter to America about the coup against President Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973. At the time it seemed jarring, and in retrospect very much not what was needed; but it’s not the worst of the bunch – González Iñárritu gets nul points for incorporating footage of people jumping from the collapsing World Trade Center in a sound/image collage.A somewhat supercilious satire on the property-owning middle classes that Loach later admitted he was the wrong director for: a little bit Fassbinder, a little bit Gurney Slade. It played into Loach’s favourite theme – the little man against the system – but the director’s instincts are not best served by wackiness. A shame, as it throws away a great lead performance by Ken Jones, a regular Loach collaborator, and later immortalised as the prison snitch Ives in Porridge.Not an adaptation of the Robert Harris alternative-history novel, but a patchy account of an East German musician as unhappy under communism as he is in the west. This is Loach’s signature theme – systems and authority of any kind are open to abuse – but he is never at his best with non-English-speaking characters and this film (almost entirely in German) is not exactly a triumph.Another package film, with Loach directing the final third after chunks from Ermanno Olmi (The Tree of Wooden Clogs) and Abbas Kiarostami. It’s a clever idea – train tickets as a symbol for wider social permissions – and Loach’s bit is nice but slight, with a bunch of Celtic fans squabbling among themselves whether to help an Albanian migrant family.The earliest of Loach’s Wednesday Plays to survive shows his early style in full flow. A talky, digressive piece, this anti-death penalty broadside is infused with a jittery hyperactive energy as Loach sought to overcome the staid traditions of television drama. It’s a bit on the stagey side, with lots of cockney chat, but the final execution scene, when poor Tony Selby is strung up for killing a prison officer, still packs a hell of a punch.Loach may not be an obvious football man, but it’s a thread that runs through his work. This innovative mix of drama and documentary pleasingly focuses on a cult figure from Everton’s mid-60s cup-winning side: the Scottish midfielder Alex Young. Loach (as ever) is more interested in the fans and how football folds into their lives (more good work from Ken Jones), with real-life footage of Everton personnel (including Young) talking to camera about their lives. In truth, it doesn’t amount to all that much, but texturally it’s still pretty interesting.Loach really nailed his political colours to the mast with this script by the Trotskyist former docker Jim Allen, and in doing so proved that the intricacies of an industrial dispute could be material for compelling, if not exactly exhilarating, drama. Nevertheless, this was evidence that Loach had achieved what he had clearly been aiming at for some time: acting so planed down it was indistinguishable from reality.You can see the attraction of the Nicaraguan civil war: one of the great international causes of the 80s. The involvement of Robert Carlyle, fresh from Trainspotting, gave this film a shot in the arm, although the somewhat saucer-eyed approach to the Latin characters – particularly Carla herself, with whose exotic mystery Carlyle’s bus driver falls in love – doesn’t do the film many favours.An uncomplicated, comfort-zone paean to the Irish communist Jimmy Gralton, whose brand of free-thinking is too much for the local worthies in 1930s Ireland. There’s not much light and shade here: Gralton (Barry Ward) is your standard crinkle-eyed nice-guy, a sacrificial lamb to the republic’s new intolerance.Loach’s mature, unadorned style emerged with this account of a labour dispute in north-west England, a BBC Play for Today that is essentially a lightly fictionalised treatment of the 1970 Pilkington glass strike. It recreates the smoke-filled rooms and committee discussions, establishing that the unions and management are both conspiring to shore up a system that keeps the ordinary workers in their place. Compared to The Big Flame, which covers not dissimilar ground, this is a sober, unblinking treatment, eliminating the flourishes of his 60s work. Heavy-duty stuff.While there is something fundamentally naive in this film’s analysis of mental illness – merging RD Laing’s anti-organic thesis with his own politics, Loach aims to pin responsibility for its subject’s schizophrenia on “social conditions”, namely, Kate’s poor relationship with her mother – this is high-achieving formally. Formatted as a documentary, with a stream of “interviews” and voiceover, this is fiction disguised very convincingly as fact. Unusually, Loach slips into point-of-view as the final ECT scenes approach.This one is a bit of an outrider. Loach scored something of a coup by casting the Manchester United legend Eric Cantona as a sort of Play It Again, Sam-style dope-fuelled fantasy adviser to a harassed Mancunian postman. It’s got its strong points, but the required wackiness isn’t always there.Named after the road into Baghdad airport, Loach’s assault on the west’s murky activities in Iraq focuses on the outsourcing of fighting and the subsequent corporate cover-up. It is one of his more conventional-looking films, and takes on a big target – possibly too big for the scale of film Loach is able to mount.A remake/reworking of In Two Minds, framed as a more traditional dramatic narrative and with the central character’s troubled mindset more obviously triggered by the generation gap and the abortion she was made to have. Although this film follows a similar trajectory, finding environmental and social causes for her erratic behaviour, leading to seemingly brutal ECT treatment, Loach wisely retreats a little from the wider mental-illness thesis of the original.A lightweight entry in Loach’s Scottish cycle: a violent tearaway (played by Paul Brannigan) resolves to get out of the Glasgow gang life by stealing some valuable whisky. This actually has a happy ending (of sorts), but Loach doesn’t quite succeed in making a basically vicious central character likable.This film contains one of the few non-white lead characters in Loach’s work: Casim, son of Pakistani immigrants, who embarks on a forbidden relationship with Catholic school teacher Roisin. Loach’s target, as ever, is the system of control that prevents ordinary people from achieving freedom in their lives; this inter-ethnic romance does a decent job in exploring religion and immigrant culture, but it isn’t Loach’s natural habitat.A likable comedy from Loach’s early-90s resurgence, working from a Jim Allen script about an on-his-uppers chancer trying to scrape together enough money for a communion dress for his daughter. It’s not one of his most resonant films, but is basically good natured and an excellent example of the director’s unerring ability to get great performances from first-timers: the lead is Bruce Jones, who was a club-circuit comic at the time.Another great spot from Loach: Crissy Rock, another former club comic, is tremendous as self-destructive mum Maggie, who has lost four of her children to social services after a string of disastrous relationships. Loach, characteristically, is doing his utmost to extract sympathy for one of life’s casualties; there is little sympathy to spare for the council workers trying to deal with her.In its day, this adaptation of Nell Dunn’s stories for the Wednesday Play spot was notorious for its agonised abortion/miscarriage sequence; but there’s more to this than outrage. Like its predecessor Three Clear Sundays, this is a rangy, digressive portrait of street life; here it is about three young women working in a wash-house in Battersea and is a depiction of a marginalised, under-represented community that hums with life. The abortion itself is interestingly consequence-free; the three leads (who include Carol White in her first Loach role) are all great.One of Loach’s few attempts to make a putatively commercial “family film”: this is adapted from Leon Garfield’s book about a kid in the 18th century who falls in with an itinerant, hulking villain (the Black Jack of the title), rescues a girl who has been sent to the madhouse and works for a funfair. It is unusual, interesting material for a children’s film, even by 70s standards, but the flat, ultra-naturalistic acting style Loach employed works against the extravagant storyline: the whole thing could have been a bit more rollicking.Loach held his nose and went to the US to make this statement-film about exploitation of immigrant workers in Los Angeles. It stars Adrien Brody as a union organiser who (wouldn’t you know it?) falls in love with one of the women he is defending. Even so, Loach lands some telling sledgehammer blows, even if – outside his UK and Ireland comfort zone – much of his customary nuance is absent.In retrospect, this looks like an early emanation of the nostalgia-socialism that helped pave the way for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour leadership triumph two years later. A compendium of interviews of warhorse campaigners and archive-clip history about Clement Attlee’s landslide victory in 1945, this is just about the only Loach documentary expressly aimed at the cinema. Although its contemporary political purpose is rather over-evident, it is still a stirring vision of what used to be, and what many hoped could be again.A conspiracy thriller that marked Loach’s return to feature film-making after a difficult 1980s spent trying (and often failing) to get his TV projects broadcast. As with the later Route Irish, Loach goes for a relatively mainstream style to tell an incendiary political story: here it is about British military collusion in the murder of a human rights lawyer (clearly related to the real-life killing of Pat Finucane). It is a bit by-the-numbers stylewise, but it re-established Loach as a radical force.A feature-length drama made for ITV, adapted from a Barry Hines novel, and about as pared-down a piece as Loach is ever likely to make. Phil Askham is the eponymous estate worker, caught between competing loyalties and as out of place down the pub with the poacher-forgiving locals as with the capped-and-Barboured shooting gentry. There is no plot to speak of: just an incremental progression of incident (some, like rabbit hunting with ferrets, looks pretty gruesome for modern sensibilities), but it’s remarkable all the same: a working life in collision with muddy, bloody nature.Unusually, this full-length feature had its UK premiere on TV; perhaps reflecting the popular nature of its subject: rail privatisation. Loach has always admired “railwaymen” for their tight organisation and solidarity: he clearly enjoyed bringing out their camaraderie in an appealing film that had self-evident real-world parallels. Staffed with the customary lineup of club comics and singers turned actors, this is Loach in confident, mid-season form.The pick of Loach’s 1960s TV work, and not just for the galvanising effect it had on the then, and still, current concerns over homelessness. Carol White is tremendous as the mother who desperately tries to hang on to her children as her domestic situation becomes ever more precarious (husband injured at work, clashes with the in-laws, hard-hearted landlord). This is society as a slowly closing trap, with Loach accusatory towards the social workers and housing officers who are as cold as everyone else. The final scene, where Cathy’s children are taken off her in a railway station, is horrible in its raw intensity.In the late 90s and early 00s, Scotland provided a rich seam of material for Loach and this one – nominally a teen movie – is one of the finest. Starring Martin Compston (another first-timer who, unlike most of Loach’s discoveries, has gone on to enjoy a solid acting career), this is a rough, violent tale of a Greenock kid sucked, not entirely reluctantly, into the drug-dealing life. His naive dreams of escape soon evaporate: there is no going back.Kierston Wareing made a real splash in this excellent and well-observed drama (like The Navigators, a TV premiere in the UK but a cinema release in other countries). And also like that film, Loach finds a new seam of material in the outsourced working world, where job security and back-up have melted away. Wareing is a new version of the hemmed-in Loach figure: a recruitment agent ruthless to those below, a victim of those above, with none of the security net of old-style employment. Loach’s main target is the apparent freedom such conditions promise: the reality is very different.Loach was reportedly very disappointed by the box office failure of this Barry Hines adaptation, which motivated his return to TV in the ensuing decade. In retrospect, it is not hard to see why audiences avoided it: it is an incredibly gloomy black-and-white portrait of boredom and the Thatcherite recession. Looking at it now, it is an unexpectedly charming film: a study of a teenage relationship in adversity, staged with a total commitment to realism and awkwardness, and light years away from the John Hughes teen movies that would be coming down the pipe a few years later.A monster success – the Cannes Palme d’Or and record box office – that must have come as a pleasant surprise. All Loach’s characteristic ingredients are here: a fierce concentration on hot-button social issues (food banks and benefits assessment); preternaturally realistic performance; a standup comic (Dave Johns) doing his first bit of acting. Released in the year of the Brexit referendum, and surfing on the Momentum-inspired confidence of the anti-austerity left, the film unexpectedly hit a major nerve. If we are being absolutely honest, as a film it is solid if not spectacular (although the awful baked-beans scene is up there with Loach’s most harrowing). In terms of impact, though, it is something else.Loach didn’t exactly discover Peter Mullan, who had been bobbing about for years – and had even played one of the builders in Riff-Raff (see below) – but he gave him a tremendous showcase in what turned out to be the finest of Loach’s Scotland-set films. Mullan plays the classic Loachian male: struggling with demons, hoping to be redeemed by love but dragged down by misplaced loyalties. It’s Mullan’s charisma that puts this one over the top, both ferocious and tender as the film requires it.Loach’s new film, his first since Blake, shows that he can pull off top-notch work as he heads into his 80s. As a subject, the gig economy appears to have only intensified the director’s motivations and his principal character here, delivery driver Ricky (Kris Hitchen), exemplifies the new type of trapped victim: worker solidarity has been destroyed by zero-hours contracts, with devastating effects on Ricky’s working and family life. It also contains one of Loach’s most memorable bad-guy characters: self-proclaimed “nasty bastard” Maloney, the warehouse supervisor played by Ross Brewster.Loach suddenly expanded his horizons in the mid-90s with this tribute to the foreign fighters who got involved in the Spanish civil war – another cause eternally dear to the left’s heart. Ian Hart – who had just played John Lennon in Backbeat – turned in a fine performance as the Liverpudlian communist who travels out to join the struggle in the 1930s; like many a Loach protagonist before and since, supposed good guys (in this case, the Stalinist cadres of the International Brigades) are as bad as the official enemy. The script, by Jim Allen, posits the Trotskyist POUM militia as the real heroes. Rather brilliantly, Loach applied his ultra-realist style to the combat scenes, of house-to-house guerrilla warfare, with impressive results; they effectively balance out the longwinded scenes of political discussion.After making a splash with his TV work, Loach was picked up by Joseph Janni, the celebrated producer of British new wave films such as Billy Liar, Darling and Far from the Madding Crowd. This was Loach’s feature debut, and it imported all the strengths of his previous films: empathetic drama, brilliantly natural performances (including one from Terence Stamp, amazingly right at the height of his 60s stardom), and an audacious deployment of on-camera improvisation. This very much benefited from being more focused and less digressive than the TV plays, and its refusal to find neat narrative solutions pointed the way ahead for Loach’s film work.Loach’s first Palme d’Or went to this complex, large-scale film about the Irish state’s birthing pains, spanning both the war of independence against the British and the subsequent civil war that followed it. Like Land and Freedom, this suggested that authentic radical values were destroyed, cynically, by revolutionaries-in-name-only: Cillian Murphy, as a socialist doctor and IRA soldier, is the vessel through which this conflict is explored – first fighting alongside, and then against, his brother Teddy. It is a thoroughly absorbing film, and very much not the propaganda piece one might expect (although, inevitably, the British, fuelled by their imperial arrogance, don’t come out well).Loach has always liked to make films about camaraderie: the literal representation of the class solidarity so central to his political thinking, and something in desperately short supply in the era of outsourcing and privatisation. Riff-Raff is arguably his finest treatment of the theme: the group of builders working on (symbolism alert!) a former hospital being turned into luxury flats. The lead actor is Robert Carlyle, in a career-making performance as Stevie: Ricky Tomlinson (former real-world union activist and long-term resident of Brookside) was a revelation as the effervescent socialist and site leader. Loach also contrived one of his most moving romances, between Stevie and Emer McCourt’s Susan, undone by drugs and difficult circumstances. It is perhaps not Loach’s most hard-hitting film, but it is his most purely likable.It may have spent decades in school-treat screening hell, but Kes’s glories remain undimmed 50 years after it was first released. Adapted from Barry Hines’s novel about a kid who becomes obsessed with looking after a bird of prey, it has got an obvious point of entry for school-age children – it is the ultimate misfit story – so its popularity as a classroom time-filler is understandable.As a parable of how individuality is squashed and warped – not only by the heartless teachers, but by Billy Casper’s uncaring family – it is as heartrending as ever. Loach got one of his most miraculously brilliant performances in the central role from David “Dai” Bradley; the raft of others on hand include Brian Glover as the bullying sports teacher and Colin Welland as the friendlier English teacher.What sets the film apart, though, is that Kes is Loach’s most brilliant film cinematically: his and cinematographer Chris Menges’s interest in the Czech new wave found its expression in beautifully astute choices of shot and lighting, alternately amplifying the story’s wit, cruelty and desperation. It may seem churlish to pick Loach’s second feature as his best, but Kes has stood the test of time like no other, and will surely continue to do so."
Drugstore Cowboy at 30: is this the best film ever made about addiction?,"Gus Van Sant’s 1989 indie is filled with rich detail and insight into the life of a drug addict, brought to life by a career-defining Matt Dillon performance",Scott Tobias,2019-10-18T06:00:55+0100,"“Most people don’t know how they’re going to feel from one minute to the next. But a dope fiend has a pretty good idea. All you gotta do is look at the labels on the little bottles.”That’s Matt Dillon as Bob Hughes in Gus Van Sant’s Drugstore Cowboy, offering one last revelatory insight via voiceover narration toward the end of the film. Portraits of drug addiction tend to wallow in spiraling miseries, like a hurricane that gathers strength and grows more destructive as it reaches landfall. Movies and television have taught us that drugs are about compulsion, chasing a high that steadily diminishes, and the film acknowledges that, too, with Bob talking about how he and his crew “played a game you couldn’t win”. Yet Drugstore Cowboy ties that compulsion to organization and elaborate bits of drug logic and superstition, which suggests more structure to an addict’s behavior than the ordinary person’s. Staying high means planning for the next hit.When the film was released 30 years ago, it was mere months after sex, lies and videotape changed the landscape for independent film, bringing some sense of order to what was then a disparate patchwork of small-time distributors and modest urban arthouses. (Drugstore Cowboy was put out by Avenue Pictures.) Yet a movement was taking shape around certain soon-to-be-brand-name auteurs: John Sayles, Joel and Ethan Coen, Hal Hartley, Spike Lee, Jim Jarmusch and others, who were all in the early stages of their careers. For his part, Van Sant had won some attention for his self-financed debut feature, 1986’s Mala Noche, a $20,000 black-and-white production that showed a sensitivity to the hard lives and doomed romanticism of young adults living on the margins.Based on James Fogle’s memoir, Drugstore Cowboy could be a companion piece to Midnight Cowboy from 20 years earlier, in that both are about modern outlaws living hand-to-mouth in urban squalor, running short-term scams into long-term trouble. Only Van Sant’s film has a funny, offbeat, episodic quality that doesn’t negate the heartbreak and tragedy that’s peppered throughout it, but gives it dimension and surprising verve. As Bob and his crew of drug addicts – his wife Dianne (Kelly Lynch), his best friend and muscle Rick (James Le Gros), and Rick’s teenage girlfriend Nadine (Heather Graham) – knock off drugstores in Portland and other cities across the Pacific north-west, they often look like merry pirates, plundering all the pharmaceutical treasures they can get their hands on. Van Sant even stages a sequence that makes them look like the Beatles clowning around in A Hard Day’s Night.More than anything, Drugstore Cowboy is a film defined by its attention to lived-in detail: the anecdotes and harrowing capers from Fogle’s book, the specific habits and philosophies of its characters, the overcast vividness of its setting, which extends to the various apartments, motel rooms and flophouses that serve as temporary quarters to these transient junkies. The smash-and-grab robberies planned by Bob each have their distinctions, but his modus operandi is to have the others create a distraction while he raids the back counter for powerful opioids like Dilaudid to shoot up their arms. In one sequence, that involves Nadine faking an epileptic seizure in the front of the store while Bob dives toward the back; in another, Dianne and Rick stage a hilarious impromptu demolition derby near the hospital as Bob takes a crowbar to a locked cabinet inside.Keeping themselves high takes planning – when they leave Portland to go “crossroading”, Bob has small stashes waiting at different stops, and always has contingencies to avoid arrest – but Van Sant spends plenty of time hanging out with them and getting a feel for their quirks, habits and morphine dreams. Dillon plays the beautiful, romanticized rebel Van Sant would turn to again with Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix in My Own Private Idaho, but Bob’s focus on drugs is so myopic that he’s constantly turning schemes over in his head, and isn’t always aware of life around the fix. In one of the film’s best scenes, Bob tells the story of why they can’t have a dog – or even mention a dog – because they once had a cutie named Panda who inadvertently led the police to their home. He remembers the incident bitterly; Dianne, in a piercing moment, remembers that this dog she loved was put down afterwards.Drugstore Cowboy is a teeming repository of such low-key specifics: weird hexes like the “hat on the bed” and the reverse mirror, goofy anti-drug PSAs on TV (“the last time I dropped acid I decided to make a self-portrait. Groovy, isn’t it?”), Bob’s inability to even acknowledge Dianne as a sexual partner, the surreal image of the crew losing their motel room to a sheriffs’ convention, and William Burroughs turning up as a defrocked, death-haunted priest who Bob figures has shot a million bucks’ worth of drugs into his arm. The film reflects the contradiction of penniless users who live by the seat of their pants and have their days rigidly structured by addiction.The end of the road awaits these characters with absolute certainty – we know as much from the beginning, when Bob narrates the events that brought him to the back of an ambulance – but Van Sant takes the scenic route. There’s a point where tragedy strikes and shakes Bob from his addled stupor, but even that isn’t overemphasized as the big turning point that leads him back toward rehabilitation. The case for Drugstore Cowboy as the best film about drug addiction is made through many subtle pieces of evidence, each accumulating into a pointillist slice-of-life that feels absolutely true to these characters and to the mindsets and realities of others like them. At rehab, Bob confesses simply: “I’m a junkie. I like drugs. I like the whole lifestyle. But it just didn’t pay off.” He’s not alone."
Operation Dumbo Drop to Mr Boogedy: the 10 strangest Disney films,"As Disney+ prepares to launch, a bizarrely long Twitter thread has revealed the many odd back catalogue relics set to join the more high-profile titles ",Stuart Heritage,2019-10-15T08:00:10+0100,"When Disney first announced its all-conquering, Netflix-killing streaming service Disney+, everyone’s mind automatically raced to the big ticket items; the Star Wars, the Marvels, the Frozens, and – if you were in the right sort of mood – the Wizards of Waverly Places.However, this week Disney announced the rest of the Disney+ catalogue in the form of a bizarrely long Twitter thread. And while everything can’t be the calibre of Dumbo or Aladdin, the list did somewhat help to remind people that Disney has also made a great swath of crap. Especially confusing were its live-action films, a genre that many moviegoers have completely forgotten about. Best of all, a great deal of these live-action films had incredibly stupid names. How stupid? Glad you asked, here’s a ranking of the 10 most stupid.Technically an hour-long episode of Disney’s Wonderful World, Sultan and the Rock Star is so obscure that the only trace of it to be found on YouTube comes in the form of two women giddily trying to describe it. Nevertheless, Timothy Hutton from Ordinary People and the 1981 PSA Teenage Suicide: Don’t Try It! plays a burned-out rock star who befriends a tiger. It apparently does not end with the rock star being eaten, which is a disappointment.Important point: this has nothing to do with the film Dumbo. Instead it’s a Vietnam war comedy where Danny Glover and Ray Liotta do their best to stop a vengeful warlord from murdering an elephant by dropping it out of an airplane. No, really.Johnny Tsunami is a film about a carefree Hawaiian boy whose life is upended when his parents move to Vermont. But he eventually finds solace in the snowboard community, and enjoys several hijinks in the process. A film made in the good old days when it was OK to name a character after a natural disaster that routinely kills hundreds of people. Look out for the unmade sequel, Jonathan Bushfire.Oh Sammy! What a crazy seal you are. Look at you balancing a ball on your nose on command. Look at you standing under a shower! Look at you jumping off a diving board! Look at you literally being chased by some dogs! Watch this one quick, before someone makes a Blackfish-style documentary about the horrifying reality of using a trained seal in a film.Imagine the wacky adventures you’d endure if you inadvertently came to live in a haunted house. Oh, it’d be so zany! Toasters would fly around the room willy nilly, maybe a mummy would start breakdancing. And then you’d meet silly old Mr Boogedy who … Jesus christ, is that what Mr Boogedy looks like? God almighty, he’s terrifying. Did he die in an industrial accident? Is that why he looks like that? He looks like Emperor Palpatine with a fungal infection. No. This is far too scary for a knockabout family comedy.In which Sean Connery fights some leprechauns. To think, in 2019 you will be able to watch a film called Darby O’Gill and the Little People on your computer for free without being arrested for gross insensitivity. This must be what the future feels like.Less because it’s a film with a silly premise or bizarre title. More because the title font of Quints is so badly designed that you’ll think it says the C-word the first 25 times you look at it:Quints (2000) pic.twitter.com/vtbuFvVkIbYou’ll remember the story of The Ugly Duckling, about a swan who thought it was a duck. Well, here’s The Ugly Dachshund, a film about a dog that thinks it’s a different kind of dog! Variety called it a “thin, contrived, one-joke comedy”, but don’t let that stop you. Unless you’re not keen on the idea of dozens of people wildly overreacting to the sight of a relatively large dog, in which case please let it stop you.Again, Justin Morgan Had a Horse is so obscure that it’s only online in the form of those women discussing it. But relax, because it’s clear what Justin Morgan Had a Horse is about. It’s about Justin Morgan, who had a horse. But wait. “Had”. Why is this in the past tense? Why doesn’t Justin Morgan have the horse any more? Did it die? Did he kill it? Does Justin Morgan murder horses? Oh God, Justin Morgan is a monster. A monster!There’s nothing that can be done here, I’m afraid. The Biscuit Eater is the worst name ever given to a film, and that’s that. It’s a film about a boy who likes a dog, OK? So why not call it that? Why not call it The Dog Liker? Too vague? Then what about The Dog-Liking Boy? Still need more detail? What about The Dog-Liking Boy Who Had Hair and Wore Clothes? See? Much better."
Fight Club at 20: the prescience and power of David Fincher's drama,The 1999 adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk’s anarchist novel was misunderstood by some as an agent of chaos but it remains an eerily forward-facing film,Scott Tobias,2019-10-15T06:00:52+0100,"When David Fincher’s Fight Club was released 20 years ago, it was a crystal ball that was mistaken for a cultural crisis, much like Do the Right Thing had been a decade earlier and perhaps Joker is now. Film-makers who were trying to identify a violence nesting in the culture were accused of trying to incite it – or at least clumsily juggling lit sticks of dynamite. No less an authority than Roger Ebert opened his review of Fincher’s film by calling it “the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since Death Wish”, echoing widespread concern that impressionable men would lock into the empowering brutality of Tyler Durden and the army that gathers around him. Viewed from a certain angle, it looked like a recruitment film.What cannot be predicted, however, is how items like Fight Club will shift during flight. It becomes easier to appreciate the ambiguities of the film when it no longer feels like a clear and present danger. That doesn’t necessarily mean that Fincher’s point of view isn’t confusing or contradictory all these years later, but the culture tends to move quickly from threat to threat, and it’s helpful to have enough distance to see the world it’s depicting more clearly. Whatever you think about Fight Club in 2019, it’s probably not exactly what you thought about it in 1999, if only because so much of what it describes has manifested itself in the real world or been distorted beyond recognition.Let’s begin at the end, as the film does, when a series of detonations leads to the collapse of downtown office buildings. It wouldn’t even be two years later that a terrorist cell would bring down the World Trade Center towers, those symbols of American financial might, and the motives of al-Qaida and the film’s Project Mayhem are not that dissimilar. Both were attacking the soft center of America as they understood it, except in Fight Club, the idea was to raze the country to the ground and start over, because consumerism had anesthetized it and hollowed out its soul. The final image of two people holding hands as the Pixies’ Where is My Mind? blares on the soundtrack could be seen as nihilistic, but it’s secretly thrilling to imagine the possibilities of starting over after a hard reboot. (It also helps to know that the explosions are about taking down institutions, not people, more The Weather Underground than Osama bin Laden.)It all begins, as many terrible things do, with the pissy aggrievement of a young white male. Much like Ron Livingston in Office Space, another cult classic from the same year, Edward Norton’s unnamed narrator has gotten tired of the deadening routines that define his life. The difference is that cubicle culture alone isn’t what’s bothering Norton, but his realization that he’s a cog into a terrible corporate machine. His day job is to calculate the necessity of automobile recalls under a formula: “Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don’t do one.” Many of his later actions are explained by the emptiness of being defined by the things he buys – most famously, the Ikea catalog that accounts for the interior of his apartment – but his work matters, too. He knows firsthand that capitalism will let people die if it’s better for the bottom line.The Narrator’s need to feel something at all draws him first to terminal-disease support groups at the local Episcopal church and later to the anarchist philosophy of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who makes him feel the old-fashioned way – by punching him hard in the gut. The twist of Tyler’s true identity – fully earned, incidentally, by the many times Fincher hints at it – says a lot about the conversation the Narrator has with himself about what he thinks he needs and how it develops into a messianic vision that completely gets away from him. But those first punches are an expression of brute masculinity that hit him like a cold splash of water to the face. Men are simple creatures in that way.As the fight clubs metastasize around the country, Tyler’s pre-brawl speeches shift from stating the rules to spouting off about his generation being “the middle children of history”, without a world war or a Great Depression to give it purpose. (“Our Great War is a spiritual war,” he says. “Our Great Depression is our lives.”) The implication is that all that masculine energy needs an outlet, and since Generation X hasn’t been provided with one, it will have to find some other way to channel its inchoate rage. And it’s here where the film’s meaning can get a little slippery: how much of what Tyler is saying is to be understood as nonsense? And if it’s not nonsense, then how much does the film implicitly endorse?The fact that the fight clubs lead into Project Mayhem, a full-on terrorist organization, should lay the second question to rest. In his efforts to satisfy a personal need, the Narrator/Tyler has set off a brushfire that rages out of control, and he’s utterly powerless to keep it from consuming the world. Working from Chuck Palahniuk’s novel, Fincher and his screenwriter, Jim Uhls, only identify with their hero(es) up to the point when the narrator/Tyler still has some control over the situation. The film does recognize a phenomenon where men are waking in anger from a culture intended to numb or emasculate them, but it also sees in that the presence of sickening misogyny and the potential for fascism. And contrary to Ebert’s review, it panics right alongside the Narrator, who goes so far as to shoot himself in the head to stop it.What Fight Club missed in 1999 – and comes oh-so-close to getting – is how much the rage it identifies is connected to white supremacy. But the world it anticipated is now upon us, with a host of Tyler Durdens marshaling attacks on perceived enemies and twisting the meaning of “snowflake”, a term used in Palahniuk’s book and popularized in the movie (ie “You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake”), to taunt the vulnerable. What are the Proud Boys if not a roving gang of Project Mayhem thugs? Or the tiki-torch-bearers of Charlottesville. Fight Club saw it coming, with thrilling vividness and wit and technical panache. Just don’t shoot the messenger."
Every Angelina Jolie film performance – ranked!,Witness Jolie’s trajectory from 90s jobbing actor to fully fledged Hollywood star – with a few bumps along the way …,Andrew Pulver,2019-10-03T12:19:38+0100,"Semi-coherent thriller about a real-life murder from Jolie’s scrapping-for-any-bit-of-work period. She is hardly in it, but the post-fame DVD sleeve makes her look like the lead character.Jolie’s celebrated first screen appearance, alongside her dad, Jon Voight, in the Hal Ashby directed Vegas comedy. Jolie is a very sweet seven-year-old, but this is mainly of historical interest.Klutzy comedy about rival Italian-American catering dynasties, whose two kids fall in love, Romeo-and-Juliet style. Jolie’s charisma is evident, but the casts’ accents would get them arrested today.Jolie’s first big role, as a cyborg who falls in love with her trainer (“the perfect killing machine … peak condition, top of the line”), in a sequel to the cruddy Jean-Claude Van Damme straight-to-tape. Jolie shows action chops, but line readings are not yet her forte. She reportedly hated it, anyway.Jolie’s first go at the kind of nutso-sexy role that would become a staple for the first part of her career. Danny Aiello plays the sap who gets into trouble after giving her a ride back to her mother’s place.Jolie plays the mystery woman again in this indie thriller about an ex-doctor (David Duchovny) forced to work for gangsters. More hanging out of speeding cars, already by then a Jolie trope.Jolie still marking time and learning her trade in another indie thriller – she plays a woman out to kill an ex-con (Mekhi Phifer) whom she holds responsible for the death of her brother. Not great, but not awful.Jolie tried her hand at a standard-issue romcom – she plays a TV reporter with a week to live, who gets feelings for Ed Burns. Safe to say, sparks did not fly.One of those films you just have to put down to the old learning curve. Jolie plays a mysterious postal bride in 19th-century Cuba who turns Antonio Banderas inside out.Jolie dipped her toe in the big league with this Miramax-distributed multi-stranded ensemble romcom, with names including Gillian Anderson, Sean Connery and Jon Stewart dotting the cast list. Jolie cuts quite a dash in cropped hair and gold lamé trousers.As night follows day, Tomb Raider’s $270m box office brought forth this sequel, in which Lara is after an orb that can open Pandora’s box. Interesting fact: the BBC had a piece of both Tomb Raider films, which is why they are virtual fixtures on iPlayer.Jolie’s activist impulses were engaged after an eye-opening location shoot in Cambodia for Tomb Raider, and in 2001 she was appointed a UNHCR goodwill ambassador. This self-righteous thriller, in which she plays a clueless art-world type entranced by the hunky aid worker Clive Owen, was no doubt an attempt to channel her own conversion. But, presumably, Jolie was rattled by the flak it got, after it was accused of endangering real-world aid workers with a gun-smuggling plotline.Jolie plays the world’s most impeccably styled criminal profiler in a convoluted, but underwhelming, serial-killer movie: Ethan Hawke is the nasty, whose victims provide a new identity for him after every kill.One of Jolie’s more interesting early films, an adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates’ girl-gang novel. In boots and pixie cut, Jolie really looks the part: she plays another nutso-sexy character – Legs, a drifter who encourages a group of put-upon schoolkids to rebel. Rawer, perhaps, than the recent remake by Laurent Cantet, but an early signpost of Jolie’s potential, and a virtual rehearsal for Girl, Interrupted.Jolie didn’t have a huge amount to do in this amazing-looking steampunk sci-fi thriller, apart from looking purposeful in a military cap and eye patch. She is the commander of an aircraft carrier, helping fighter pilot Jude Law foil evil scientist Dr Totenkopf.DreamWorks’ attempt at a fishy animation was somewhat eclipsed by Pixar’s Finding Nemo, but had a spectacular cast: Will Smith, Robert De Niro and (of all people) Martin Scorsese as a mafioso shark. Jolie had the usual slinky/sexy role as an impressively maned fish called Lola, who drapes herself around our hero before being dumped for Renée Zellweger.Never one to neglect the action fanbase, Jolie kept her hand in with the mentor role in this bonkers Matrix-meets-Kingsman thriller starring James McAvoy. Codenamed Fox (duh), she teaches McAvoy how to shoot round corners and become a fully paid-up assassin for a weird cult.Jolie really marked her card with this time-capsule (but inevitably dated-looking) cyber-thriller, starring a panoply of best-forgotten mid-90s haircuts and primitive computer graphics. Alongside her future first husband Jonny Lee Miller, Jolie made what was the first of a series of attention-grabbing, film-stealing performances.A lengthy, solemn film about the early days of the CIA in the 1960s, directed by Robert De Niro and featuring lots of men in hats and raincoats. Jolie glows in characteristic style as the unhappy wife of dour agent Matt Damon; her opportunities for spying are strictly limited, and her role is there to show the domestic price men such as Damon’s character pay.Another mentor role for Jolie as one of the “furious five” ninja-warrior animals who train up Jack Black’s useless giant panda. The film is a lot of fun, but despite getting third billing – behind Black and Dustin Hoffman – Jolie’s tiger role is a bit on the thin side. Two sequels continued the pattern, although her roles are so small, they don’t really warrant separate entries here.In 2001 what the world wanted to see was Jolie racing around in her skimpies while handling enormous weapons – and they paid to see it, big time. As unwatchable as every video game movie yet produced, Tomb Raider at least had the novelty of Jolie trying out a ludicrous posh-English accent and – all joking aside – showed that Jolie could carry a movie single-handedly, however idiotic it was. It was the one that put her over the top.Presumably hoping for a bit of the old Brad Pitt-style on-screen chemistry, Jolie paired up with Johnny Depp for another go at the smouldering mismatch action-comedy thriller. Depp, not especially funny, is the hapless tourist scooped up by Jolie’s femme fatale as cover; Jolie, styled to the max, seems to mostly coast through things. Nobody’s finest moment.On the brink of stardom, Jolie appeared in this adaptation of Jeffery Deaver’s doorstop serial-killer thriller featuring a quadriplegic forensic analyst, Lincoln Rhyme, played by Denzel Washington. She is the fresh-faced rookie cop who follows Rhyme’s orders as they track down a vicious taxi-driving murderer, and pretty much nails it. This was a crucial step in proving she could handle a solid Hollywood moneymaker.Jolie’s second sexy-mythological mum role, in Robert Zemeckis’s adaptation of the epic poem. Zemeckis’s decision to go with motion-capture and CGI means this lives very much in the uncanny valley, but it allows him to get away with what the male teen fanbase was slavering for: a full-body nude shot of Jolie as she emerges from a lake of fire, albeit refracted through a glassy, liquid-metal texture.Jolie couldn’t have found a better role than that of Gia Carangi, the meteorically successful, but self-destructive, model who died in 1986. Jolie fitted the wild-child persona perfectly: this HBO film got her a Golden Globe and a ticket to the Hollywood elite.Jolie was, notoriously, only a year older than Colin Farrell when she was cast as his mother in the Oliver Stone classical-era epic, which turned out to be a riotous fusion of semi-history and sword-and-sandal fantasy. Encumbered with yet another odd accent, Jolie nevertheless turned up the dial to 11 with a tigerish performance of roaring, vengeful fury, mashed together with gruesome mother-son lasciviousness.This was Jolie’s first big action hit, in what in retrospect was a frighteningly influential blockbuster (where would the Fast and the Furious films be without it?) As the dreadlocked Sway, Jolie proved proficient as the supercool badass and the hot-to-trot arm candy. Hollywood was not quite ready to trust her with a film of her own, but it was only a matter of time.Jolie’s move into directing was designed to complement her activist work, with films about the Bosnian war, a second world war PoW and the Khmer Rouge. By the Sea, however, was very different: a highly personal relationship drama, consciously modelled on European new-wave cinema of Deray or Antonioni. Very much a vanity project, it was widely derided as a second Swept Away, but that is not really fair: it was never going to get the big bucks. Jolie said it was inspired by her mother, but Pitt’s presence as the other half of a troubled marriage gave this a through-the-keyhole air. Their own relationship disintegrated a year after its release.Jolie distilled all her self-destructive/manipulative/sexy roles into this career gamechanger: she blew away the film’s ostensible lead, Winona Ryder, and bagged an Oscar into the bargain. In retrospect, with the ostentatious tonal palette of khaki and beige, this does look like a pretty odd depiction of a psychiatric hospital, even though it is based on a memoir: it resembles a Gap ad shot at the Institute for Extreme Hotness. The supporting cast were all major figures in waiting, too: Elisabeth Moss, Brittany Murphy, Clea DuVall.One of those amazing films that even if you have no idea what is actually happening – it’s a thriller about air-traffic control – still manage to be incredibly exciting. By this time, Jolie’s extracurricular activities had become stories in themselves, and her relationship with co-star Billy Bob Thornton (soon to become husband No 2) was a subject of tabloid notoriety, not the least those vials of blood they were rumoured to have exchanged. Jolie’s role is another of her manipulative, free-spirit numbers, but taken somewhat to extremes: weepy/needy one minute, overpoweringly seductive the next. But the film itself is so great, it just seems to work.Even though she was given the nod by the film’s real-life subject, Mariane Pearl, Jolie took quite a bit of flak for playing the role of the Cuban-Dutch journalist whose husband, Daniel, was murdered in 2002 by a terror group in Pakistan. Darkening her skin tone was controversial enough in 2007; these days it would be considered close to blackface. However, in conjunction with the British docudrama specialist Michael Winterbottom, Jolie spearheaded a powerful, politically inflected drama, a more convincing use of her activist inclinations than the likes of Beyond Borders. Jolie also exercised acting muscles that she had rarely employed in the previous decade.Perhaps given a shot in the arm by A Mighty Heart, Jolie went full throttle for an Oscar in Clint Eastwood’s classy, grandiose true crime drama, based on the infamous Wineville chicken coop murders in the 1920s. Jolie plays Christine Collins, a woman whose son, Walter, was among the victims, but who was pressured into identifying another boy as her missing son. Jolie goes through the whole gamut of actorly emotions, from bafflement to rage to breakdown; she gives it her considerable all, but it didn’t quite get her over the line, beaten to the statuette by Kate Winslet for The Reader.This was an early example of muscle-flexing Hollywood gender-swap: originally a Tom Cruise vehicle, this was reworked after Jolie got involved, switching the sex of the lead character, but leaving in all the head-cracking derring-do that goes with the Mission-Impossible-y turf. Jolie pulls it off spectacularly: her proficiency in the action movie verities beyond reproach, while injecting enough emotion into the moodier passages to give the character some bite. Not sure why this hasn’t become a franchise; the boring title probably didn’t help.Disney cleverly exploited Jolie’s otherworldly qualities – ethereally satanic probably best describes them – in this revisionist fairytale, in which Jolie plays the wicked witch from Sleeping Beauty with a considerably more sympathetic backstory. The image of her with curling black horns and digitally enhanced cheekbones is one that will go with her for ever – the word “iconic” is overused, but this one merits it. The film itself isn’t quite kidult – more kiddy than adulty – but it’s still a feast for the eyes, and Jolie evinces real pain as the fairy who loses her wings.I prefer Jolie in her hard-as-nails incarnation rather than, say, her dewy-eyed do-gooder or manipulative bad-girl modes; and spy films tend to bring out her sense of humour as well as reining in her frequent habit of going over the top. Here she gets to do a bit of everything that makes her a great performer: terrific action scenes, screwball-level marital comedy, some really rather impressive emoting. It also helped, of course, that there was a real-life backstory to the relationship between her and her co-star, Brad Pitt: this, of course, was the film set where “Brangelina” was born. Oddly enough, this film stands as a comic companion piece to By the Sea: it’s also about a jaded marriage flailing around for reinvigoration. It says something, though, that while Mr & Mrs Smith is a lot of fun, no one could mistake it for a masterpiece: Jolie, without doubt a stone-cold superstar, tends to be better and/or bigger than the films she has been in. But she has plenty of time to put that right.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is released in the UK and US on 18 OctoberActors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine's best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Every Angelie Jolie film performance - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren's 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford's greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder's 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Maggie Smith's 20 best films – ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson's best films - ranked!Wes Anderson movies - ranked!The Coen brothers’ films - ranked!Stanley Kubrick's best films - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d'Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!The best Stephen King movies  - ranked!From Trolls to Transformers: toy films – ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!Aardman's 20 best films – ranked!James Bond on film – 007's best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock & Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan's toast to Russell Crowe’s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!All Abba's UK singles - ranked!The Beatles' singles – ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Every one of Madonna's 78 singles - ranked!Missy Elliott's solo singles – ranked!Prince's 50 greatest singles – ranked!Queen's 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift's singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis's 20 greatest albums – ranked!Lil Wayne's albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!Joni Mitchell's albums – ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen's albums - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder's albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin's best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Cher's 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs – ranked!Elton John's 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!PJ Harvey's 50 greatest songs – ranked!Giorgio Moroder's 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana's 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!The 30 best boyband members - ranked!The greatest Scottish indie bands - ranked!Quincy Jones's greatest ever moments - ranked!"
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid at 50: their charm lives on,The 1969 western paired Paul Newman and Robert Redford to magical effect and remains one of the most undeniably entertaining westerns to date,Scott Tobias,2019-09-23T07:00:24+0100,"“The horse is dead.”It’s the middle of a tense scene in the 1969 smash Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The town sheriff is attempting to round up a posse to track down Butch and Sundance, leaders of the Hole-In-The-Wall Gang, which has been robbing banks and trains with such impunity that they’ve become an embarrassment for lawman across the frontier. Unbeknown to everyone, these celebrity outlaws are watching the scene unfold from a perch across the street, where they’re blowing their loot on liquor and whores, but the sheriff’s recruitment efforts were doomed to run aground regardless. There just isn’t much appetite for going after an elusive and dangerous pair that seem to be generous in spreading their stolen loot around.There is, however, time for a brazen salesman to make a pitch: “The horse is dead,” he says. The future is bicycles.The sequence everyone remembers from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid follows shortly afterwards, when Paul Newman, as Butch, pedals Katherine Ross’s Etta Place around on the handlebars of a new bike, with the jaunty Oscar-winning song Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head playing in the background. It may not be accurate to call the film a “revisionist western” – a term reserved for less commercial visions like Monte Hellman’s The Shooting, Robert Altman’s McCabe & Mrs Miller, and Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch, released the same year – but even before our heroes meet a hail of bullets in the final freeze-frame, the end of an era is nigh. It’s no wonder Butch winds up chucking the bike into the woods later on.Butch Cassidy was a box-office sensation when it premiered 50 years ago, more than doubling Midnight Cowboy and Easy Rider, which grossed $44.8m and $41.7m, respectively, against its colossal $102.3m. For perspective, only six films since have doubled up the competition since – three of them Star Wars movies (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi); two of them Steven Spielberg movies (Jaws and ET); and the other Titanic. It’s important to understand the film as a commercial juggernaut, first and foremost, because it’s so plainly eager to turn a horse into a bicycle, reconfiguring the hidebound traditions of the western for a hipper, more self-aware audience.In a William Goldman script peppered with memorable lines, the first exchange sets the tone. Butch looks around a bank at closing time, chatting with the security guard as he perhaps sizes up his next job.“What happened to the old bank? It was beautiful.”“People kept robbing it.”“That’s a small price to pay for beauty.”Right away, Goldman establishes Butch as a charismatic mouthpiece for the quip-ready screenwriter, contrasting nicely with the Sundance Kid, Robert Redford’s taciturn sharpshooter. But he’s also created two heroes who break the western mold, neither justice-seeking white-hats nor grizzled, sneering black-hats, and not as traditionally masculine as either party. Butch is a man who appreciates beauty and art, but doesn’t have the stomach for violence; it’s not until late in the film that we (and the Kid) discover that he’s never shot a man before and he looks sickened to have to do it. He’s a pleasure-seeker above all else: robbing banks and trains are his way to make an easy living and enjoy whatever sinful freedoms his vocation affords him.Audiences in 1969 were all too happy to embrace the light, quippy irreverence of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after a turbulent summer, and Goldman, director George Roy Hill, and the two impossibly handsome stars made them feel cool for doing it. True Grit had performed well earlier in the year as a throwback to the genre’s past, giving John Wayne a proper victory lap, but Butch Cassidy was thoroughly modern, a star-making vehicle for Newman and Redford that reflected a need for the genre to turn the page and that feels as much of its time as it does authentic to Wyoming in the late 1890s. With Ross at the center of a love triangle between friends, the film attempted to bring Jules and Jim to the American mainstream, taking a lesson from the French new wave on how to revivify old Hollywood craft.It still works spectacularly well. There’s an alchemy up and down the production: Jack Lemmon, Steve McQueen, and Warren Beatty all passed on playing the Sundance Kid, and none seem capable of the quiet confidence that Redford possesses in the role, which parries so well with Newman that the two would run it back again with Hill a few years later in The Sting. The pop doodling of Burt Bacharach’s score is about as far from a traditional western score as possible, but it somehow meshes with the sepia sheen of Conrad Hall’s photography, which burnishes the legend of these two men while their story is still being told. And while Goldman’s screenplay dances on the edge of glib, it’s lively and sophisticated, with a strong theme about the capitalist forces that really tamed the Wild West.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is such a rollicking good time that it takes a while to notice it’s about the end of the line for its heroes, whose celebrity is already widespread when the film opens and ultimately hastens their demise. “Your times is over and you’re gonna die bloody,” warns a sheriff, prophetically, in an early scene, and the film is mostly about Butch and Sundance getting chased out of America by hired guns and dying at the hands of the Bolivian army. They’re mostly guilty of stealing from the wrong guy: EH Harriman, the railroad tycoon, spends more trying to catch them than they rob from his safes, but it’s an opportunity for a powerful man to send a message about who’s really in charge. Guys like Butch and Sundance can handle local lawmen and half-hearted posses, but they can’t fight progress. The EH Harrimans of the world will make certain of that."
Aardman's 20 best films – ranked!,"From early experiments in claymation TV to its forthcoming Shaun the Sheep big-screen sequel, we rate the animation studio’s output",Andrew Pulver,2019-09-19T13:10:31+0100,"After it was used for a perfume ad, Nina Simone’s jazz classic made it into the top 10 in the autumn of 1987. Inspired, no doubt, by the (non-Aardman) video for a successful re-release of Jackie Wilson’s Reet Petite earlier in the year, this music video became a second bite at claymation-meets-1950s. Peter Lord, who directed, went with a sultry singing cat and some artistic shots of piano keys.Aardman Animation secured a high-profile commission from Channel 4 at the end of the 80s: a five-part short film series called Lip Sync, mostly comprising animation of pre-recorded interview material. Next, directed by Barry Purves, deviates from the concept: its basic gag is that William Shakespeare himself is auditioning for an uninterested Peter Hall. On the stage, Shakespeare whizzes through references to every one of his plays; Hall couldn’t be less impressed. Clever.A more orthodox interpretation of the Lip Sync concept: a small-time offender talks bluntly about prison life and how he became a law-breaker. It may not have the comedy disjunction of the more famous Creature Comforts short, from the same series, but the direct, untricksy treatment remains melancholy and even haunting.Steve Box, who would go on to direct the unlovely Spice Girls Viva Forever video and co-direct Curse of the Were-Rabbit, made his directorial debut with this impressive 11-minute short that mixes Nick Park-ish ingredients to considerably creepier effect. A vaudeville-act dog trainer called Tiny loses his confidence after clashing with Arnold, a hulking silent-film actor; it all ends up a bit Phantom of the Opera. There’s something a little bit freaky about it.Lord was nominated for his first Oscar for this funny short, which showcases his more fingery, freeform style – compared to Park’s smoothly-polished modelling. A stream of jokes about the first created human, perched atop a tiny planet Earth, keeps this ticking along, with the real-flesh “hand of God” hammering points home. Not to get too meta, but there is some fun comment here on the god-like processes of claymation: Adam, after all, was fashioned out of clay in the first place. By the Lord. A coincidence? I think not.Aardman was founded by Lord and Dave Sproxton in 1972, and early jobs included the opening credits for The Great Egg Race and squeaking homunculus Morph on Take Hart. But it was its involvement in the amazingly successful promo for Peter Gabriel’s Sledgehammer single in 1986 that put it firmly on the map. Sledgehammer wasn’t strictly an Aardman production – it was directed by Stephen R Johnson (famous for Talking Heads’ Road to Nowhere) – but they did craft the still-spectacular animated sequences, which include painted clouds flitting across Gabriel’s face, Arcimboldo-esque singing vegetables and Park’s legendary dancing chickens. Even if it runs out of ideas a bit in the final third, it’s still a great watch.Lord stretched his narrative muscles with this rather lovely 11-minute short, which resulted in his second Oscar nomination. There is something of Monty Python in its medieval setting: twin princes, separated at birth, one growing up in the castle, the other in a hovel just outside. It’s the latter, of course, who has got the eponymous pig, the typically anthropomorphised critter beloved by Aardman, although perhaps not quite so instrumental to the narrative as Gromit. Lord’s deployment of a split screen, to parallel the brothers’ development, is inspired.Reports at the time suggested the production of this rodenty feature wasn’t the happiest experience for Aardman, as backers Dreamworks put the hammer down after disappointing box-office figures for their previous collaboration, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. It shows on screen and led directly to the companies ending their agreement. Even if Aardman seems incapable of making a bad film, such is its iron grip on quality control, the pressure to abandon claymation and move into computer-generated animation led to a charm deficit. The film has got all the Aardman ingredients – quirky characters, relentless gags, top-notch voice cast – but there’s something a tiny bit inauthentic about its vision of an underground London and, of course, the shiny, flaw-free visuals are a long way from the Aardman stock-in-trade.The jewel in the crown of the Lip Synch series, and endlessly recycled since. Only five minutes long, Park’s film manages to be both brilliantly simple and fantastically audacious at the same time; building on the idea of animating a vox pop interview (see Going Equipped, above) but switching in zoo animals to create a hilarious disjunction between voice and visuals. Not only did it nab the company’s first Oscar, but it also turned into Aardman’s financial safety net, via a string of popular TV ads in the 1990s and an ITV series in the 2000s.Aardman’s ability to attract the cream of British acting talent has been one of its strengths, but to get Eddie Redmayne hot off his Oscar win for The Theory of Everything was a major coup. He plays Dug, a bucktoothed cave-kid who spearheads a stone age tribe’s contest with a more sophisticated bronze age civilisation through the medium of football. Conceived, as usual, with Aardman’s amazing attention to detail, there’s something a little CBBC about the basic football-match idea in a World Cup year, a slightly anxious attempt to try to reach a mass audience. It’s still cute and funny, naturally.Adapted from Gideon Defoe’s Pirates! book, this is rather openly aimed at the primary school audience, with that title namechecking two key obsessions of the bookish kid. A great cast (including Hugh Grant, Imelda Staunton and David Tennant) give it their all; if anything, they are hampered a little by an over-complex plot that shoehorns in a Pirate of the Year contest, Charles Darwin and a murderous Queen Victoria. It sounds great on paper, but ends up a little frenetic on screen.Deriving from a throwaway gag in A Close Shave, Shaun the Sheep has become a safety blanket franchise for Aardman: after 150 episodes of the kid-friendly TV show, the second feature is just about to hit cinemas. I can report that it’s well up to scratch: a Spielbergian story of Shaun’s encounter with a blue-and-pink alien bunny who crash lands on a local pizza joint and ends up on Mossy Bottom farm. As charming and unpretentious as it gets.In retrospect, it seems quixotic that this opening salvo in the Wallace and Gromit series should have lost to Creature Comforts at the 1991 Oscars. Of course, thoughts of a national-treasure franchise were unlikely to be on anyone’s mind at the time, but this 25-minute tea-cosy space epic rendered in Plasticine was surely robbed, if only by Nick Park himself. All the series’ key elements are here: the script’s north of England mannerisms; the Jeeves-and-Wooster relationship of the central pair; the sheer fiendish delight in the Heath Robinson contraption Wallace comes up with; and the gentle knowingness of the film references. Compared with later efforts, it is perhaps not as drum-tight, story-wise (the wheeled cooker that wants to ski is still a headscratcher), but for a film school effort, it’s pretty sensational.Aardman had more success with its second stab at computer-animation: a fun Christmas movie directed by Sarah Smith and written by Peter Baynham. Like most Aardman films, this is notable for its terrific action sequences – kicking off with a legion of elf-ninjas slamming millions of presents across the planet on Christmas Eve. Although there are family resemblances, this is actually pretty different from your traditional Aardman film: less obviously idiosyncratic and a little more conventional in story terms, reflecting the non-Aardman pedigree of the key talent. But it is impeccably put together and goes down a treat.Park was fully into his stride with this third in the Wallace and Gromit series and it got him yet another Oscar as well as a prime Christmas slot on the BBC. Adopting a similar genre backstop as The Wrong Trousers – a robot dog plots to steal sheep – this non-stop cavalcade of whimsy introduces the concept of Wallace’s love life and a superb chase scene with Gromit’s detachable sidecar. As ever, the attention to detail and sense of atmosphere is fantastic.I have bit of a soft spot for this as I saw this being made; the patina of tea-time cheeriness masks a painstaking labour of love for everyone who worked on it. Perhaps not the massive hit Aardman has always been searching for, but it is an undeniably successful foray into cross-platform franchising. If that sounds mercenary, it doesn’t come out in the film: it’s the most basically good-natured of Aardman’s films, with only gentle sparring between the enterprising Shaun and officious dog Bitzer.More romance for Wallace in what would turn out to be Peter Sallis’s last time in the role; Wallace’s yearning for former model Piella Bakewell achieves an implausibly tragic dimension after Piella is unmasked as a serial killer, shortly before ending up as crocodile food. Conceived on near-identical lines to A Close Shave, this is faultlessly realised, with a magnificent example of the by-now traditional high-speed chase as Wallace takes off after Piella’s runaway bike. At the other end of the scale, Park shoehorns in a reference to James Cameron’s Aliens.Clearly, it is hard to choose between the Wallace and Gromit shorts, especially as Park hit such a high standard so early and maintained it so well. But The Wrong Trousers gets the nod because it crystallised so much of what Aardman brought to the table: the jokey/sinister crime story; the homely details; and the astonishing application of real-world physics. The train chase scene has been rightly acclaimed – as exciting to watch as anything in Raiders of the Lost Ark – while Feathers McGraw, the penguin with the glove on his head, is an inscrutably memorable villain. Just as good 26 years on.A W&G feature was no doubt inevitable, and after years of planning it finally emerged in 2005, in between the third and fourth shorts. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it was clearly the motto: a genre-movie superstructure (Hammer horror); a lovelorn Wallace; ridiculously complicated home inventions; and thrillingly inventive chases. The directors, Nick Park and Steve Box, imported major guest-acting talent, in the shape of Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes – and it’s possible that Aardman unlocked Fiennes’s comedy gene, more recently seen in The Grand Budapest Hotel and A Bigger Splash. Were-Rabbit does all that the short films do, only on a bigger canvas; the payoff for the audience is proportionately larger.I will admit that I was bit of a sceptic when Aardman announced it would move into feature films after it had signed its deal with Dreamworks. Could this comfy-cardigan cottage industry outfit with a few TV shorts behind it really do it on the big stage? But Aardman’s first full-length film, masterminded by Park and Lord, remains a treat that even the ensuing disgrace of Mel Gibson can’t ruin. Like all Aardman films, this has a simple premise – The Great Escape with chickens – but such is the animators’ ability to humanise the birds’ plight that it turns into an improbably emotional epic. It is also arguably Julia Sawalha’s finest hour – she voices Ginger, the feisty hen who practically forces her dozy fellow chickens to save themselves – while Gibson does a fine job of Rocky, the rooster who becomes the great hope of saving everyone from the dreaded pie machine. The film proved that Aardman could hold its own with Hollywood’s great animation traditions, as a beautifully judged balance was struck between the two. Chicken Run was a massive hit, too, giving Aardman some elbow room; but it didn’t last long. In retrospect, Chicken Run actually looks a little miraculous: how on earth did Aardman pull it off?Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine's best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Every Angelie Jolie film performance - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren's 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford's greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder's 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Maggie Smith's 20 best films – ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson's best films - ranked!Wes Anderson movies - ranked!The Coen brothers’ films - ranked!Stanley Kubrick's best films - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d'Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!The best Stephen King movies  - ranked!From Trolls to Transformers: toy films – ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!Aardman's 20 best films – ranked!James Bond on film – 007's best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock & Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan's toast to Russell Crowe’s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!All Abba's UK singles - ranked!The Beatles' singles – ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Every one of Madonna's 78 singles - ranked!Missy Elliott's solo singles – ranked!Prince's 50 greatest singles – ranked!Queen's 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift's singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis's 20 greatest albums – ranked!Lil Wayne's albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!Joni Mitchell's albums – ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen's albums - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder's albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin's best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Cher's 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs – ranked!Elton John's 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!PJ Harvey's 50 greatest songs – ranked!Giorgio Moroder's 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana's 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!The 30 best boyband members - ranked!The greatest Scottish indie bands - ranked!Quincy Jones's greatest ever moments - ranked!"
Official Secrets review – Keira Knightley excels in Iraq war whistleblower drama,Knightley stars as the GCHQ translator who leaked a classified memo to the Observer exposing the US plot to spy on the UN shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq ,Mark Kermode,2019-10-20T08:00:50+0100,"“Just because you’re the prime minister doesn’t mean you get to make up your own facts.” So says Keira Knightley’s whistleblower in Gavin Hood’s “based on true events” drama, an on-the-nose revisiting of the run-up to the Iraq war that draws clear parallels with the “alternative facts” rhetoric of modern politics. While US and UK intelligence agencies conspire to engineer a justification for invasion, GCHQ translator Katharine Gun (whose real-life bravery deserves celebration) follows her conscience and alerts the media to their dirty-tricks campaign, throwing her quiet life into turmoil, putting her work, marriage and freedom at risk.It’s 2003, and Gun (played with no-nonsense conviction by Knightley) receives a US National Security Agency group email effectively asking her to spy on UN security council members to fix a forthcoming resolution vote for war. She’s outraged, both by the proposal per se and because she believes Blair’s claims of Saddam Hussein’s al-Qaeda links and WMDs aren’t backed up by the evidence. Despite ominous warnings about being “in breach of the Official Secrets Act – some might call that treason”, Gun leaks the email, which finds its way to the offices of the Observer. Here, journos and editors have stand-up showdowns about supporting or opposing the war, while a cast of extras add Greek choric background accompaniment. Declarative statements abound (“If you get it wrong, it’ll sink you; it’ll sink the paper!”) but eventually this “fucking good story” hits the front page, and Gun’s life implodes.After the drone strikes and hi-tech bugs of Hood’s previous nail-biter Eye in the Sky, Official Secrets unfolds in an altogether fustier world of floppy drives and photocopiers, all whirring away to the strains of a soundtrack that works hard to accentuate the air of tension and suspense. It’s a gloomy environment: cinematographer Florian Hoffmeister shrouds the action in a cloak of darkness. Whether we’re in the sinister warrens of GCHQ or the supposedly more comfortable confines of a cafe or a bedroom, Hoffmeister and Hood trap their characters in dim pools of light, shadows crowding the edges of the frame.By contrast, there’s a pantomine element to some of the performances, most notably Rhys Ifans’s comically chaotic rendering of investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy, mutteringly referred to as a “nutter”, and played accordingly. As Observer editor (and Blairite flag-waver) Roger Alton, the baldified Conleth Hill comes on like a cross between Ed Asner’s Lou Grant and the Fat Controller from Thomas the Tank Engine, all huff and bluster as he mishears “Sunni and Shia” as “Sonny and Cher”, storming around in a sweary, sweaty stew. Meanwhile Matt Smith is heroically handsome and endearingly deflating as reporter Martin Bright, wryly noting that an underground carpark rendezvous with Yvonne (“Fucking”) Ridley is “a little bit Deep Throat, don’t you think?” – an invocation of All the President’s Men that does this film few favours.Amid the clutter of broad-strokes thumbnails and celebrity cameos (Tamsin Greig as former Foreign Office deputy legal adviser Elizabeth Wilmshurst; Kenneth Cranham as a scowly Judge Hyam), Knightley’s nuanced portrayal of the uncertain, self-doubting Gun comes as something of a relief. She’s particularly good at conveying Gun’s horror when realising that her actions may have endangered her husband Yasar (Adam Bakri), a Kurdish Turk whose legal status proves vulnerable. A distanced close-up on Knightley’s face as Ralph Fiennes’s lawyer Ben Emmerson lays bare the Kafka-esque ramifications of her plight is masterfully understated.Adapted by Hood’s co-writers Gregory and Sara Bernstein from Marcia and Thomas Mitchell’s book The Spy Who Tried to Stop a War, Official Secrets inevitably takes some dramatic liberties with its truths. In a recent Guardian feature, for example, former foreign desk assistant Nicole Mowbray recalled how this paper’s readers’ editor had phoned her to explain politely “with deft understatement and a total lack of drama” that a typing snafu she’d made had caused “something of an international incident”. On screen, Mowbray is bawled out by Alton in front of the whole office; a minor invention, perhaps, but one that reminds us that most dramatised depictions of “true events” can be found guilty of “sexing up” their sources – even those inspired by stories in which the devil really is in the detail.Of course, amid the cacophony of barefaced lying that Trump and Johnson have made the norm in this “post-truth” era, Blair’s bland massaging of facts (smugly reassuring David Frost that “war is not inevitable”) can seem almost quaint, however catastrophic the consequences. Whatever its flaws, Official Secrets reminds us just how seriously the state took its pursuit of Gun, who had nothing to gain and everything to lose by raising the alarm, revealing the teeth behind the smarmy smiles."
Streaming: Meryl Streep kicks off a season of starry Netflix offerings,"Get comfy on the couch with a new Soderbergh and a bravura turn from Eddie Murphy, the first of the streaming giant’s big autumn films",Guy Lodge,2019-10-19T08:00:18+0100,"Autumn is upon us, and with it the long, often tedious publicity trail to the Oscars. The late-summer film festivals, from Venice through to London, have had their say, while nomination lists for some of the season’s earliest precursor prizes are being compiled. For Netflix, this now means the rollout of their shiniest awards hopefuls on a near-weekly basis: Martin Scorsese’s mob epic The Irishman and Mati Diop’s Cannes sensation Atlantics are among the streaming service’s November attractions.This month, however, they’re kicking off with two of their lighter prestige offerings. Fresh from the Venice fest, Steven Soderbergh’s The Laundromat has been available to stream since Friday, while blaxploitation biopic Dolemite Is My Name, which prompted murmurs of Oscar buzz at Toronto for its star, Eddie Murphy, goes up on the platform on Friday. I have a hard time imagining either film scooping huge amounts of golden hardware in the next few months, but as springy, couch-based entertainment, both have a lot to offer.Back in February, I wrote about how Soderbergh’s spiky, iPhone-shot sports-business drama High Flying Bird announced him as pretty much the ideal Netflix auteur, given his long-standing resistance to big-screen tradition and his embrace of newer, scrappier film-making technologies. The Laundromat is a bigger production than that one, and a more old-school one too, with its unfussy film-making serving to flatter showy star turns from Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman. That makes it less interesting and less dynamic than Soderbergh’s Netflix debut, albeit easier to watch with a drink on a Friday night.There’s a modicum of substance here, as the film essentially works as a breezy introduction to the 2016 Panama Papers scandal, filtering that complex tangle of offshore financial chaos through the smaller story of Ellen Martin (Streep), a dithery, bucket-hatted pensioner pulling away at a seemingly minor insurance-fraud case – a thread that turns out to unravel the entire bobbly jumper.Streep, who can score Oscar nominations merely for breathing within earshot of a camera, is on broad, sprightly form. She’s not especially tested here, but she makes The Laundromat a romp, and gives it a softer, sweeter heart than otherwise comparable economic crisis films such as The Big Short. Back around the time of Erin Brockovich, Soderbergh gave procedurals like this righteous cinematic welly; here, he has practically accepted that he’s making a TV movie. It feels more at home in my living room than it did in a grand Venice screening hall.Dolemite Is My Name is similarly sparky without being especially ambitious, ticking off as it does a shopping list of showbiz biopic conventions in the story of Rudy Ray Moore. A failing African American comedian, Moore reversed his fortunes in the 1970s by adopting the persona of the obscene, motormouthed street pimp Dolemite, becoming an icon of blaxploitation cinema in the process – a clear inspiration to Eddie Murphy, who plays him with plainly adoring dedication, deftly channelling Moore’s ribald comic energy through his own wild screen presence.Murphy never got talked up for awards when he was doing his own thing in comedy; it’s only when he’s pouring his spirit into a different kind of black performer, as in his Oscar-nominated turn as a self-destructive soul singer in Dreamgirls, that he suddenly gets that kind of respect. Which is to say that, electric as he often is in Dolemite Is My Name – a funny, fluorescently styled exercise that dotes generously on its star at some cost to its own cinematic inventiveness – it’d be nice to see a film, half as carefully and devotedly made as this one, that just lets Eddie Murphy be Eddie Murphy. Can his own Netflix biopic be far off?Support the Girls(Bulldog Films, 15)A wonderfully weathered performance by Regina Hall anchors Andrew Bujalski’s observant, warmly communal comedy about the put-upon female staff of a Hooters-style “breastaurant”.Transit(Curzon Artificial Eye, 15)German auteur Christian Petzold takes a bold conceptual risk with this modern-dress adaptation of Anna Seghers’s 1944 Holocaust novel, powerfully transposing its concerns of identity and impermanence to the current refugee crisis.Toy Story 4(Disney, U)If you thought Toy Story 3 brought the story to a neat and meaningful close, rendering any further sequels superfluous, you’d be right. This is bright and cheery enough, and made a billion dollars worldwide, but that’s the reason it exists."
Succession season two finale – battle of the backstabbers: discuss with spoilers,The breakout second season of the most darkly compelling drama on TV brought a juicy combination of betrayal and revenge,Adrian Horton,2019-10-16T07:00:12+0100,"If Succession wasn’t the breakout HBO hit in 2018, then it’s achieved hit status in its second season, one of the best sophomore outings in recent TV memory. After nine episodes that brought us such landmark moments as the Con-heads, Cherry Jones at Tern Haven, literal bed-shitting, the Kendall rap, Greg v Tom’s water bottles, Shiv’s point of no return, and the Kermit the Frog dancing to the Succession theme meme, the finale promised, as Logan said in the penultimate episode’s final scene, a “blood sacrifice”.The gang was all there for the extra-long episode, This Is Not For Tears, with Logan Roy presiding over his (yacht) war room of loyalists – his children included – in the final countdown to the shareholder meeting that will determine Waystar Royco’s ownership. RIP to Shiv and Tom’s potential threesome, Greg’s not-favorite Rosé and Connor’s iPad – “you need to be a killer,” Logan told Kendall before (potentially) severing their relationship for good, and this finale was always going to see a few casualties. In a high-water mark for an already impressive season, here are merely some of the more brain-breaking points. Sails out, nails out, bro.Succession has always been careful to keep its distance from its .001% characters; you’re not so much rooting for them in the world as rooting for them to fuck over each other. The second season in particular has highlighted the great insularity wealth provides the Roys and their ilk. Several of the episodes have been contained to remote, inaccessible, lush locations – a Hungarian hunting lodge, an Aspen-esque ideas festival, private jets, the peak of WASPness that is Tern Haven, the yacht – and hinted at the small army of assistant, PR folk, and housekeepers who buffer their every interaction with the world. Case in point: the season finale’s jarring image of Logan Roy at a highway-side coffee stop somewhere in Europe, avoiding an inconvenient automatic door while Facetiming a major shareholder (apparently no amount of billions can insulate you from the unflattering below-chin Facetime angle).The shareholder tentatively floats the mood of his representatives: that Logan take the hit for the cruise scandal and step down. The likelihood that this would ever happen, despite Logan seeming to consider it in public, was always close to zero; throughout the season, any move toward answering the question of his succession has only entrenched Logan deeper into his increasingly maniacal reign. But the cruise scandal was toxic enough – mysterious deaths, sexual harassment, “no real person involved” – that even Logan’s power grip isn’t immune. He’s also not immune to “how was your call reception?” pop-ups on his cell phone, notable in how striking it is to watch Logan have even a small brush with daily inconvenience.After a teasing glance at Cousin Greg’s bumbling congressional testimony on the buried cruise mismanagement, Succession moved to the Mediterranean, where the Roys tower over lowly fishing boats in their huge yacht. (The setting is ironic – a cruise break from the cruise-line scandal – but also evocative of the several real-life media mogul yacht dramas, such as Rupert Murdoch’s fall on his son’s yacht in Australia.) Logan was, again, not going to go out from the company quietly, and the public demanded at least one head roll for the cruise fiasco. The Waystar Royco yacht cruise may abound in breezy linens and sunhats, but the mood was, as Tom said, “death sentence vibes”. Someone was going down, if not the company itself, a possibility heightened by the arrival of annoyed, and hostage-situation-chastened, Roman. On the up from two brutal slaps this season – Logan calling him a moron, Logan literally knocking out his tooth – Roman rebounds with the uncharacteristically sober (and probably correct) assessment that the central Asian money is bullshit. Without the option to go private, the options for the company are *Shiv throat-slice motion, Tom tumbles off waterslide*.The finale seems to mark a maturation of sorts for Roman – we see him offering rare honest advice to Logan, sincerely, if awkwardly; defending Gerri in the breakfast summit; expressing genuine concern for Kendall when he seems defeated by Logan’s blood sacrifice. By episode’s end, Logan names Roman permanent COO, solo. But given Kendall’s last-second twist, does Roman’s upward arc bend toward his father, his brother, or somewhere new?All is not well on the island of Shiv and Tom, after a season in which Shiv’s ruthless attempt to ascend Waystar Royco has been largely despite, not alongside, her husband. Their partnership has always seemed odd and for Shiv, somewhat inexplicable in its uselessness for exploitation; one of the show’s few flaws is that it has yet, in this viewer’s opinion, at least, to convey why Shiv even went out with Tom in the first place, let alone remained so loyal to a husband whose tone-deaf kiss-assery elicits her eye rolls at least once an episode. I mean, Shiv asked/demanded an open marriage on their wedding night – a “gobble the odd side dick” arrangement Tom finally confronts in the finale, after backing out of their planned threesome with a yacht waitress. Their relationship seems to disintegrate further after Shiv doesn’t hesitate to question tossing Tom to the cruise-ship wolves in the family summit, and Tom delivers the devastating line: “I wonder if the sad I’d be without you is more than the sad I am with you.” (Not to be overshadowed by another Tom food powerplay – last season’s finale saw him forcing Shiv’s lover, Nate, to pour wine back into the bottle; this year, he eats a drumstick off Logan’s plate.)Will Shiv and Tom’s relationship survive? Will the third season offer new insight into the origins of their relationship? Shiv, seemingly humbled by the prospect of a breakup, ultimately asks Logan for Tom’s protection. But with Cousin Greg now a cruise scandal turncoat, how vulnerable is Tom?Someone was always going to take the fall for the cruise scandal – get “shitcanned”, in Roman-ese – and the blood sacrifice provided an opportunity for what Succession does best: contained scenes of characters spitballing off each other over expensive meals, using backhanded compliments and polite burns to fuck each other over. The breakfast table scene in which the Logan acolytes, including all his children, build up each other’s company loyalty to throw them under the bus is among the seasons’s best, up there with the dinner summit with the Pierces at Tern Haven. Besides which loyalties survived the fire (it looks like Roman and Gerri are fine; Gerri and Shiv, less so) the meeting brings up some important questions: what viral moments came out of “Sprinkle” Greg’s testimony? Does the public know about Shiv’s witness intimidation? Will Connor quit his campaign? (And also, what did the New York Times say about Willa’s play? Does the end of Connor’s candidacy mean the end of the perpetually embarrassed Willa?) Was tearing each other apart Logan’s intent in the first place?The loser of the shitcan battle was, of course, Kendall, who goes from defeated and self-effacing company skull to whistleblower on his own father by episode’s end. It’s fitting that the night’s big twist belonged to Kendall, once the heir apparent, after last season finale’s shocker: Kendall’s drug-fuelled, Chappaquiddick-esque car crash that killed a British waiter. Kendall has spent most of the season haunted, a wounded dog with an emotional crater so deep it drew even the concern of his sympathy-void siblings and former friend Stewy. After a season of dutifully serving his father’s whims (RIP Vaulter), what turned Kendall to that crucial, Karolina panic-inducing “BUT” in the final press conference? Was it Naomi Pierce’s cutting observation that Logan “loves the broken you”? Logan admitting he never thought Kendall had the killer instinct for the top job? Secret documents on the jet from Greg? Had he planned it all along? That and Logan’s half-smile at Kendall’s treachery are up for debate – the show-runner, Jesse Armstrong, told The Hollywood Reporter that “different interpretations are valid”. Whatever the case, Kendall’s betrayal leaves the show with fertile ground for season three: retreading the son v father battle from the first season, but with new stakes, heightened ammunition, and loyalties potentially up for grabs."
We should feel sorry for Jared Leto. His Joker never had a chance,The actor’s Suicide Squad character had been sidelined long before Todd Phillips’s film starring Joaquin Phoenix as Batman’s arch enemy was greenlit,Ben Child,2019-10-22T13:21:45+0100,"Would it really be surprising that Jared Leto had tried to stop Todd Phillips’s Joker from being made? This is what a piece in the Hollywood Reporter suggests, though the claim is said to have been denied by a representative for Leto and by Warner Bros.It might seem ridiculous to fans that a film that has taken more than $700m (£541m) at the global box office and (at least initially) wowed critics could have been swatted from the schedules at the whim of an actor who barely appeared as the clown prince of Gotham in 2016’s Suicide Squad. And yet that would be to forget the circumstances in which Leto found himself cast as Batman’s nemesis five years ago, and was subsequently thrown to the slavering hounds by Warner Bros.In 2014, when the studio announced that Leto was to star as the Joker, the actor-turned-musician had just won his first Oscar, for playing a transgender drug addict in Jean-Marc Vallée’s Dallas Buyers Club. Before this, he had hardly acted for five years, preferring to focus on his suddenly successful rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars. By all accounts, Leto was choosing roles very carefully during this period, so it came as a shock (and coup for Warner Bros) when he was announced as the world’s most infamous supervillain.By all accounts, Leto threw himself into the role with method mania, reportedly sending a letter and video to fellow stars apologising for not joining them for early rehearsals, accompanying his missive with a live rat for Margot Robbie (his on-screen paramour, Harley Quinn), some bullets for Will Smith (Deadshot) and a dead pig for the entire cast. Warner suits, aware of the potency such a blend of recent Oscar-winner and iconic role would bring to the table, must have been head over heels at the publicity.With all this fuss, fans expected Leto’s Joker to emerge as the leader of the Suicide Squad, a gang of colourful Dirty Dozen-style supervillain miscreants put together by questionable authorities (Viola Davies’s Amanda Waller) to take down an even worse threat: Cara Delevingne’s acting. We will never know quite what the original plan was, but when David Ayer’s film finally emerged, Leto was reduced to a bit-part player. A bit of torture here and there, some hanging around with Harley in nightclubs, and then completely absent from the movie’s main narrative.The Oscar winner could perhaps have been forgiven for thinking that this would never have happened in the 70s. Imagine if Robert De Niro had gained 60 pounds for Raging Bull, only to be told that his scenes had been excised. Then imagine the shock when Warner green-lit a Joker origins movie starring Joaquin Phoenix as a completely different version of the supervillain. This was precisely the kind of movie Leto probably thought he was going to be making at some point when he signed on to play the part. The dream opportunity to get under the character’s powder-caked skin.Leto had every chance to assume he'd be playing the Joker in further movies – otherwise why cast him in the first place?This kind of thing would never have happened at Marvel, either. The last time a star was cast in a big role at the Disney-owned studio, then kicked to the kerb, was 2010, when it was announced that Ed Norton, the somewhat sickly green giant in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk, would not reprise the role in The Avengers (unless one counts Terrence Howard’s replacement by Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes in 2010’s Iron Man 2, reportedly over pay). Leto had every chance to assume he would be playing the Joker in further movies over the next decade – otherwise why cast him in the first place?Thanks to Warner’s chaotic approach to comic-book world building, that never happened. The Hollywood Reporter now suggests Leto-Joker is done as a going concern, something that ought to have been pretty obvious as soon as James Gunn’s Suicide Squad 2 and Cathy Yan’s Birds of Prey were announced without the actor’s involvement. In any case, neither movie had an obvious place for the cackling villain, so it would not be a surprise to learn that Leto turned them down – perhaps fearing a repeat of earlier experiences.Phillips’s Joker is the movie Leto really needed to showcase his talents and begin developing a multi-movie character arc, but Phoenix was handed the role instead. The whole thing smacks of terrible planning. Like the unfortunate Arthur Fleck himself in Phillips’s film, it seems Leto never really had a chance."
Why the best film of the 21st century is There Will Be Blood,"Paul Thomas Anderson’s tragic parable of society’s addiction to oil, fuelled by a zealous Daniel Day-Lewis, is a burning indictment of male aggression and an apocalyptic warning",Peter Bradshaw,2019-09-13T06:00:42+0100,"The title is a prophecy, a warning, or a vengeful supernatural pronouncement. Paul Thomas Anderson’s strange masterpiece, freely adapted by him from Upton Sinclair’s 1927 novel Oil!, is a tragic parable of man’s dependence on this commodity: formerly the lubricant of commercial triumph and technological innovation, and now the dwindling lifeblood of our material prosperity, the unacknowledged driving force of our military conflicts, and even the cause of a coming ecological catastrophe. That dark title threatens a calamity now visible on the horizon: destruction of the Earth itself. And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie’s leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview.Daniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early 20th century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure and serves only to amplify the loneliness, paranoia and resentment that were there from the very beginning. Day-Lewis seems to have unlocked this character’s mystery by seizing on a voice: a robust, cantankerous Scots-Irish accent that he has modified from John Huston (a borrowing that itself may have a subtextual reminder of Huston directing The Treasure of the Sierra Madre). As a poor man, Plainview is seen hacking fanatically away in a silver mine, to the accompaniment of an eerie, atonal score by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood: he accidentally discovers oil, like the apes at the beginning of Kubrick’s 2001 discovering their opposable thumbs.The movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than when it was released in 2007. Since then, Day-Lewis has given more emollient and sympathetic performances: as Abraham Lincoln for Spielberg in 2012, and as the fictional English couturier Reynolds Woodcock for Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread in 2017. Compared with either, Plainview is uncompromising and uningratiating, and it is a grandiloquent performance that could be expected of no one else. Perhaps not Olivier in his screen heyday would have tried something so melodramatically strange – and yes, the weird “milkshake” monologue at the end now feels a bit exposed. No one other than Day-Lewis could have carried it off. The film is also intensely, disconcertingly male, a story of male toxicity without any real female dimension.As a rich man, Plainview is marooned in a huge, dark mausoleum of a house, boasting with black-comic savagery that he will suck up every competitor’s oil like a milkshake. This scene, along with one showing Plainview theatrically driving a stake through a claim map in front of investors, is perhaps there to make us think of Welles’s Charles Kane, the entrepreneur as performative capitalist, bully and showoff. Like Kane, Plainview is a man whose distinction resides in not having something extra but something missing, a gap where his heart should be, a spiritual imbalance generating neurotic, self-destructive energy.From 2016, there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: TrumpIt could also be that Anderson was inspired by Nicolas Roeg’s underrated movie Eureka from 1983, based on a true story, with Gene Hackman as the super-rich Arctic prospector Jack McCann, who was eventually to face loneliness and a grisly death.There Will Be Blood may itself have been an influence on The Social Network, directed by David Fincher, in which Jesse Eisenberg’s Mark Zuckerberg is driven by resentment and rage to create the social media world that now rules our lives. But from 2016, there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump, the eccentric property billionaire and spoilt baby whose cranky tweets are as crazy as Plainview’s deranged “milkshake” pronouncement.What a spectacle Anderson and Day-Lewis create: a portrait of male belligerence and fear, a Tutankhamun of misery, walled up in his own sarcophagus of wealth and prestige.• This article was amended on 13 September 2019. The original mis-named Mark Zuckerberg as Mark Zuckerman. This has been corrected. "
'An account of how insane we once were' – Paul Thomas Anderson on There Will Be Blood,The director explains why he won’t quibble with his film being named best of the century – but what makes it really great is Daniel Day-Lewis,Catherine Shoard,2019-09-13T06:00:22+0100,"Do you think it’s the best film of the century so far?Who am I to argue? I’ll take it. It’s bragging rights for sure and I don’t take it lightly. But, of course, I could rattle off a long list of great films from this century … that isn’t hard to do.Is there a competition in you to care about such things?I suppose if it was second-best film of the century my first question would have been, “What’s No 1?” It’s very possible by the end of this year it could slip off the list entirely.Is it the same film you would make today? Do you rewatch it? I haven’t seen it in a number of years, but last I saw it I was very proud and satisfied. It was the first time I’d seen it where I had forgotten exactly what was going to happen next – and that was a wonderful experience. Having made something, it’s very hard to get back to that sense of discovery. Everything really seems to fit together about it – the performances, the music, the landscape and the story, all the strands within the larger film, especially the theme of father and son – all work in unison. It’s also very robust, which I like. I know, as I think we all do, that what makes it really great is Daniel Day-Lewis.Which moment or line makes you laugh most?Everything Daniel does makes me giggle with pleasure and joy. His inventiveness, his devilishness, the joy he has in making such a maniacal portrait of a man unhinged. He has a great chemistry with Paul Dano.Do you place more faith in capitalism or religion?Well … I’m kind of equal opportunity confused and rooting for the best sides of both.Do you get sick of the milkshake memes?Nah. Too much is never enough. Do you think the film feels like a yet more urgent prophecy today? Of bleeding the Earth dry, of allowing greed to triumph over human relations?Unfortunately, this story doesn’t seem to be going out of style any time soon. It would be nice to see it as science fiction one day. Or an account of how truly insane we all once were.Donald Trump recently declined to quote any Bible verse he likes. Are there any the film refers to you think may speak to him specifically? Might The Art of the Deal make for an alternative title to There Will Be Blood?I like all the quotes in the Bible, Old and New Testament, and y’know, it’s very private, I’m not gonna get into it … [WEARY FACE EMOJI] I can’t quote the Bible from off the top of my head, I have to go rummage around like everyone else. Or, as Plainview says: “I like all religions. I like them all. I don’t belong to one church in particular.”"

AP Read the reviewAndrea Arnold tossed out the costume drama rulebook with her raw, passionate retelling of Emily Brontë’s novel. I’d argue the case for Wuthering Heights as one of the most criminally underrated movies of recent years – though it’s been influential, blazing a trail for stripped-back period movies such as Lady Macbeth. Arnold was an early adopter of inclusive casting, too, giving the role of Heathcliff to black actor James Howson.

AP Read the reviewA knockout blow for the lazy, patronising stereotype that Germans don’t have a sense of humour, Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann is one of the funniest films to hit (arthouse) cinemas in years. It’s the story of a workaholic management consultant (Sandra Hüller) whose embarrassing dad turns up unannounced for the weekend wearing joke-shop false teeth. A genuine one-off, the film is partly a satire on Europe, globalisation and workplace misogyny, as well as being a prickly sweet father-daughter movie.

It’s based on the autobiography of crooked stockbroker Jordan Belfort, convicted in 1999 for fraud and money-laundering. But why focus on regret, when there are hookers, drugs and fast cars? Leonardo DiCaprio is outrageously entertaining as Belfort. CC Read the reviewThe film whose Palme d’Or win heralded the arrival of a new wave of Romanian cinema.

Their leader is show-offy Stephen Meek (Bruce Greenwood), but Reichardt’s focus, as is customary for her, is on the women – a trio played by Michelle Williams, Zoe Kazan and Shirley Henderson. CC Read the reviewHere’s a police procedural with a difference by the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan – the whodunnit and why playing second fiddle to long stretches of silence. It’s set in rural Turkey where officials are spending the night driving a murder suspect around looking for a body. What they find, however, is mostly existential despair. Not exactly easy viewing, but it’s a masterpiece of slow cinema. CC Read the reviewLars von Trier’s Brechtian parable about coercive capitalism remains arguably the Danish provocateur’s masterpiece. Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany both excel in this study of a woman on the run from gangsters who is offered shelter in a small town in return for undertaking chores. Von Trier’s use of stylised, floor-painted sets is the inspired final touch. AP Read the reviewThe film begins with a couple in front of a judge asking for a divorce. She wants to leave Iran and take their daughter. He cannot go; his elderly father is sick. Everyone behaves badly in Asghar Farhadi’s desperately painful family drama. Farhadi’s superpower is empathy, making the audience see all points of view. He lays depth charges in seemingly inconsequential moments with emotionally thrilling consequences. CC Read the reviewBritish director Andrew Haigh’s quietly devastating drama is a deeply moving portrait of marriage with the shiver of a ghost story. Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay play a Norfolk couple planning their 45th wedding anniversary. A week before the party, a letter lands on their doormat like a hand grenade with news of his early lost love. Rampling is sensational. CC Read the reviewThe Dardenne brothers’ second Palme d’Or was bestowed on this stark portrait of underclass desperation, filmed in their characteristic hyper-naturalist manner. Jérémie Renier plays a petty criminal who sells his newborn baby in the adoption black market, but his devastated girlfriend’s response forces a kind of redemption. AP Read the reviewProbably most Wes Anderson-y of Wes Anderson’s films and certainly his finest, with a to-die-for cast and the best fur coat in the history of cinema. Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller are the Tenenbaum siblings, all former child prodigies. The brilliance has faded. Who’s to blame? Enter paterfamilias Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), a man who consoles his grieving grandsons with: “I’m sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.” CC Read the reviewIf we are living through a golden age of space movies, here’s where it started, Alfonso Cuarón’s spectacular thriller, shot with unbearable tension and Discovery Channel realism. Sandra Bullock is the rookie astronaut with George Clooney by her side, a living, breathing Buzz Lightyear. When a storm of debris hits the pair, a terrifying fight for survival ensues. Astoundingly good. CC Read the reviewCharlie Kaufman’s existential breakdown with stop-motion puppets is a miniature masterpiece of concept and execution. David Thewlis voices the depressed motivational speaker to whom everyone sounds the same – except for Jennifer Jason Leigh’s scarred sales agent. “What is it to be human?” asks Michael Stone (Thewlis). “To ache?” Few films try to answer: this Fabergé egg of a film does. CS Read the reviewThe hardest-drinking movie on our list - with some stiff competition - Andrey Zvyagintsev’s anti-Putin polemic is brilliant, ballsy and completely sozzled. Our hero fisherman is forced from his home so that the corrupt local mayor can build his own palace on the site. A priest speaks of “reawakening the soul of the Russian people” as their spirits lie crushed at his feet. Corruption is so endemic, these people have even lost God. This is the most almighty achievement. CS Read the reviewBruce Dern discards his marbles on a windmill-tilting road trip with loving but frustrated son Will Forte. Alexander Payne’s black-and-white ode to small-town America is his best this century (Sideways has not aged like a fine wine). It also features June Squibb being completely filthy. CS Read the reviewTerrence Malick’s return to cinema six years after The New World has been vaguely tainted by the slew of woozy filmic xeroxes that have followed, but his first comeback – in which Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain stand in for his parents in 1950s Texas – is a choking knockout. CS Read the reviewJust nudging Gene Hackman’s Tenenbaum clan down the list, Wes Anderson’s glorious 1930s confection is a delight with a hard nugget of politics at its core. Ralph Fiennes’s central turn as charming concierge M Gustave, all beneficent sex and abashed camp, remains the man’s finest hour. CS Read the reviewEdward Yang’s final film is a delicate domestic miracle: the story of one family seen through the perspectives of the father, the son and the daughter. A wedding begins proceedings, a funeral ends them. The stuff in the middle is the everyday, dissected with rare beauty and gravity.

AP Read the reviewHayao Miyazaki’s wondrous animation, the greatest success of a spectacular run from Japan’s Studio Ghibli. A gentle, mysterious fable about a 10-year-old girl whose family stumble upon a haunted bathhouse. After her parents are turned into pigs, she works to lift the curse, encountering a variety of spirit-world beings along the way. AP Read the reviewMichael Haneke won his first Palme d’Or with this chilling, steel-hard parable set in Germany just before the first world war. The inhabitants of a small village are dogged by mysterious, violent incidents that serve mostly to exacerbate the dysfunctional social codes they all live by – and elliptically suggests the moral climate that evolved into Nazism. AP Read the reviewDespite lingering controversy over its adoption by Netflix in its war with the film industry, Roma still stands as an absolutely major work. Mexican auteur Alfonso Cuarón returned to the Mexico City of his childhood, telling the story of a middle-class family and their nanny-cum-maid in swooning, lyrical black and white. Part memoir, part elegaic fiction, Cuaron hit the heights with this. AP Read the reviewSteven Spielberg’s portrait of the great US president looked at the time like a history lesson come to life: graced by a monumental, Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, it detailed the arm-twisting and chicanery behind the passing of his slave-freeing constitutional amendment. These days, it looks like a fantasy: a president with principles: who’d have thought? AP Read the reviewThe Coen brothers don’t really do personal, but this is as close as they’ve got (so far). Set in their home town of Minneapolis in the late 60s, A Serious Man stars Michael Stuhlbarg as an academic whose life is roiled by continuing uncertainty and self-doubt – triggering repeat visits to his rabbis, a marriage breakdown and extended interactions with his oddball brother. AP Read the reviewThe Young Pope director Paolo Sorrentino crafted this swooningly beautiful love letter to Rome – “la grande bellezza” – in its decadent, jaded glory. Toni Servillo, Sorrentino’s regular onscreen foil, plays journalist Jep Gambardella, a bon viveur beginning to sense the dying of his personal light, and hunting out meaning and substance in the world around him. AP Read the reviewAn extraordinary documentary about the wave of barbaric killings that swept Indonesia in the mid-60s. Orchestrated by director Joshua Oppenheimer, this film revisits the perpetrators of some horrific events and asks them – with little need for encouragement – to re-enact them. The result is almost unwatchable: the murderers’ glee at performing, and the remorse they may or may not experience as a result. AP Read the reviewJapanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda won the Palme d’Or for this exquisitely turned drama that – like much of Kore-eda’s previous output – explores what it is to be a family in entirely non-conventional circumstances. A shoplifting gang take in a young girl who seems abandoned; how they hang together – or not – is the film’s key theme. AP Read the reviewOne of Isabelle Huppert’s finest performances, and that’s saying something. Director Claire Denis drew on her own upbringing in colonial west Africa to give this study of a hard-as-nails plantation owner a pungent whiff of authenticity. Huppert is Maria, obsessed with getting in the coffee harvest as a violent civil conflict moves ever closer. Saddled with an untrustworthy husband and an erratic son, it’s all she can do to survive. AP Read the reviewFrom director Todd Haynes, this is pastiche at its most brilliantly acute. Haynes takes the bold, vivid melodrama beloved of Douglas Sirk, and reconfigures it to fully reveal the social faultlines of race, sex and class that were considerably more latent in the original. A beautifully crafted act of ancestor worship. AP Read the reviewBrutally visceral fable that plunges the viewer headlong into the all-encompassing horror of a Nazi extermination camp. Shot in remorseless, unforgiving close-up by first time Hungarian director László Nemes, the story of a Jewish prison-camp worker whose job it is to help clear the gas chamber of corpses is cinema at its absolute rawest. AP Read the reviewA magisterial achievement from David Lynch, despite the difficulties he had getting it off the ground. Originally conceived as the pilot of a new TV series, this expertly fuses Lynch’s softcore pulp obsessions with his trademark creepy surrealism. Naomi Watts was the big discovery here: she plays a wannabe actor who midway seems to switch personalities with another, more jaded one. AP Read the reviewThe most audacious slaughter of sacred cows seen on celluloid, Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s marionette action-musical is a gleeful hail of precision-aimed bullets. It’s totally fearless: pops are taken at Hollywood, Broadway, evil dictators, gung-ho superpowers, the intelligence service, bleeding heart liberals, actors – especially actors – before signing off with a devastating, if obscene, defence of US interventionism. Politically, it’s scattergun; satirically, it’s spot-on. Mostly, though, it’s just ferociously funny, even if most of the humour does, finally, come from the sight of the 2ft puppets tottering around, getting drunk, having wild sex, attempting to walk through doorways and wrestling panthers played by kittens. CS Read the reviewAn official working for the Spanish crown descends into madness while waiting for a transfer out of his backwater post in 18th-century Paraguay in Lucrecia Martel’s fevered historical drama. Like a disorienting dream, it’s a film of fragments, moments that worm their way into your memory – a slave limping with flayed feet, a llama barging into frame during an uncomfortable meeting. Daniel Giménez Cacho is petty, wretched Zama, clinging to his white man’s sense of importance (and his ill-fitting periwig), a symptom of colonial rot. Martel has been called “the Malick of Latin American cinema” but this feels closer to Herzog. A strange masterpiece. CC Read the reviewThe triumph of Barry Jenkins’s coming-of-age tale over La La Land for the best picture Oscar was extraordinary in all sorts of ways, of which Faye Dunaway’s envelope mixup was maybe the least remarkable. It was the first film with an all-black cast as well as with an LGBTQ theme to scoop the prize – and it must also rank as one of the most visually and tonally ambitious: told in three parts, with three different leads, each showing the stages of repression and internalised loathing in the young life of a Miami man. It’s simply revelatory: innovative, wildly affecting, utterly beautiful. CS Read the reviewAfter a string of brilliant, industry-transforming scripts, Charlie Kaufman made his directorial debut with this complex, convoluted drama, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as theatre director Caden Cotard, who is swamped by personal crises as he works on his dream project: building an ever-expanding replica of the city streets and buildings inside a giant warehouse, and populating it with lookalikes; the blurred boundary between performance and reality is mirrored in Cotard’s own breakdown, with the title giving the big clue – this is all symbolic. AP Read the reviewHaving made his name as one of the pioneers of ordeal arthouse with unflinching chronicles of trauma and cruelty, Austrian auteur Michael Haneke achieved a unlikely popular success with this film that connected with France’s deep well of unease about events of the relatively recent past. Daniel Auteuil plays a successful TV host whose contentment is disturbed by the arrival of mysterious surveillance tapes. This seems to be connected with a young Algerian boy whose parents were apparently killed in the infamous 1961 Paris massacre. Haneke ratchets up the tension with an unerring sense of dread and dismay. AP Read the reviewHas there ever been a more beautiful couple in the history of cinema than Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung in Wong Kar-Wai’s smouldering love story In the Mood for Love? Not that they’re a couple, technically. It’s 1962. Chow (Tony Leung) and Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in next door to each other in a cramped Hong Kong block of flats. His wife is having an affair – with her husband. The cheated-on pair become friends, but vow not to behave badly. Like Brief Encounter, the film aches with the understanding that impossible love makes for a more romantic movie. It’s gorgeously detailed, drenched in sensuality – a scene in which the two squeeze past each other in a narrow alleyway by night has a humid sexiness. CC Read the reviewJonathan Glazer’s first film in nearly a decade (and still his most recent) turned out to be an uncategorisable masterwork. Scarlett Johansson plays an alien in human form, trawling the streets of Glasgow for unsuspecting males to “take home” – in fact, using them as a food source. From its unnerving alien-POV sequences, to the empathetic scene with actor Adam Pearson (who has neurofibromatosis), to the sheer coldness of the predatory logic of its central figure, Under the Skin achieves a mood and texture unlike anything else before or since. AP Read the reviewTwelve years in the shooting, Richard Linklater’s story of a child’s life between six and 18 is a vindication of artistic ambition in an age of cinematic snacking. Its downside is to ruin almost every single other film for you – at least all those in which the actors are conspicuously aged up or down. In watching the bonafide progress of Ellar Coltrane – as well as Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as his parents – Boyhood provides its audience with an intimacy and an investment like no other. This is cinema as gentle revolution. CS Read the reviewSteve McQueen’s real-life story of Solomon Northup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery in 19th-century Louisiana, exudes all of the dignity, impatience and artistic fidelity of its director. It is perfectly cast and paced, endlessly surprising, uncompromising and compassionate: a story purely and powefully told, yet full of the extraordinary visual grace notes. It never descends into cliche or even self-pity; it remains a film for adults, uninterested in anything but the truth. To read Northup’s 1853 memoir is to be astonished by the film’s fidelity. CS Read the reviewPaul Thomas Anderson’s strange masterpiece, freely adapted by him from Upton Sinclair’s 1927 novel Oil!, has a dark title that threatens a calamity now visible on the horizon: destruction of the Earth itself. And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie’s leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early 20th century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure.The movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than it did in 2007 when it first came out. But from 2016, there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump, the eccentric property billionaire and spoilt baby whose cranky tweets are as crazy as Plainview’s deranged “milkshake” pronouncement. What a spectacle Anderson and Day-Lewis create: a portrait of male belligerence and fear, a Tutankhamun of misery, walled up in his own sarcophagus of wealth and prestige.

The directors’ cut: film-makers choose the best movies of the century so far,"From Mike Leigh to Richard Linklater, Joanna Hogg and Michael Winterbottom, here are some of the century’s greatest films, chosen by some of the directors whose own films feature in our top 100",,2019-09-13T06:00:13+0100,"Silent Light (2007)The purest cinema. Thinking of it gives me the same feeling I had when the credits rolled on my first viewing of it over a decade ago. (I wonder how many other films on this list were in competition at the 2007 Cannes? What an astounding year for cinema.)Uzak (2002)It is a gentle and profoundly compassionate film, one of the best about loneliness ever made. I think about it all the time.Secret Sunshine (2007)Lee Chang-dong’s deep insight into human nature is reflected in the film.Margaret (2011)An epic story about a New York teenager facing a complex moral dilemma in the shadow of 9/11. It’s told in a multi-faceted way that refuses to simplify or obey an overarching story, which only enhances the emotional veracity. I believe we respond to films subjectively - how, when and what mood we’re in when we watch a film - has to be taken into account when we pass judgement on a film. I saw Margaret projected in perfect conditions with an open mind and heart one night in 2011 at The Rex Berkhamsted - and was completely carried away by it. All too soon watching a film like Margaret in a beautiful cinema will be an experience of the past. We must do what we can to keep cinemas alive.The Death of Mr Lazarescu (2005)Exemplary low-budget masterpiece about a sick old guy being carted from hospital to hospital in the middle of the night. Honest. Direct. Real. Moving. Comic. Tragic.The Tree of Life (2011)For its vast ambition and meditative grace. It somehow manages to be both an intimate memory film while taking on the notion of all of existence. And I love the way it confounds and challenges perception itself.Talk to Her (2002)The best of anything is impossible to identify, but the movie that keeps coming to my mind is Pedro Almodovar’s Talk To Her. How does he move so freely through this story? How does he attach these strange and loving characters to each other, to the music and the dance performances, to Sleeping Beauty, silent film, loneliness, innocence, fetishism, and the colour red?Familia Sumergida (A Family Submerged) (2018)Because it reveals eternal life in family conversations.Café Lumière (2003)A film that happens without you knowing.I just can’t bring myself to name one film over all others. Can I spread the love and offer these:Code Unknown (2000) Dogtooth (2009) Happy as Lazzaro (2018)Import/Export (2007)Nobody Knows (2004)I’m so sorry – I have little practice at naming favourites.Meek’s Cutoff (2010)I saw Meek’s Cutoff in Paris when I was writing my first feature film, in 2011. Traditional cinema projection was already dying, but this film was screened in 35mm, and it was beautiful and hypnotic. I remember the profound impression this film made on me, with its maze-like experience, the humanistic point of view, the small scale against the huge western backdrop, the unanswered questions about humanity, savagery and civilisation. For me, this film is what cinema can achieve, even after the age of the “Masters” (but certainly influenced by it) - take the viewer on a journey that they can be a part of.Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)We love everything George Miller has ever done and Fury Road will be his crowning achievement until, maybe, his next film comes out.I have a real problem. There is no one film I liked most. I loved equally:La Cienaga (2001)The Death of Mr Lazarescu (2005)You, the Living (2007)Silent Light (2007)Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (2011)The Embrace of the Serpent (2016)They all took me to places I’d never been to before, each one of them in its own, original way.A Hidden Life (2019)Watching A Hidden Life was a transformative experience for me. A call to arms.The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)The finest comedy intermingled with the contemporary drama of humanity as it seeks a meaning and strength in its own existence, but ends up becoming a prisoner of the same, trapped in itself. And apart from that it’s as fine a lesson in style and imagination that any director could wish for.Theo Who Lived (2016)I think choosing lists of the top 10 this or the best 10 that is a bit of a pointless task. I don’t even really have favourite films. There are loads of films that I like. If you asked me right now which film I would like to see again from the last 20 years it might be The Beat That My Heart Skipped by Jacques Audiard, or City of God by Fernando Mereilles. But if the point of a list is to encourage people to watch a film they haven’t seen then I’d pick Theo Who Lived (2016) – not for the film itself, but for the amazing story it tells."
From Charlie Chaplin to Jojo Rabbit: an unlikely history of Nazi comedies,The release of Taika Waititi’s ‘anti-hate satire’ recasts Hitler as a buffoonish imaginary friend and it’s not the first time film-makers have wanted us to laugh at the fuhrer,Charles Bramesco,2019-10-16T06:00:10+0100,"“In time of war, it’s typical, sometimes even useful, to demonize your enemy … Caricatures and jokes, not always in the best of taste, rise to the forefront because it’s our way of relieving aggression.” Those words come from film historian Leonard Maltin, as he gives a bit of cultural context in a recorded introduction to the 1943 Disney short Der Fuehrer’s Face. In the nine-minute cartoon, Donald Duck awakens in Nazi Germany as a good little member of the Third Reich, sieg-heiling in feverish devotion to a sparingly depicted Adolf Hitler. His daily routine goes from austere to nightmarish – from eating a wooden-bread-and-sliced-single-bean sandwich to running himself ragged at a hallucinatory munitions factory – until the “real” Donald wakes up in the US of A, full of tearful gratitude to be a free American.To a modern audience, the nazified perversion of a character we know and love may scan as shocking, but Disney’s blithe attitude toward anti-fascist satire fits into a longstanding tradition in the pop culture of the States. The Looney Tunes offered a rejoinder to Disney’s short with Daffy the Commando, in which Daffy Duck assumes the role of an Allied soldier and bashes Hitler’s head in with a mallet. Jump forward to the present, and Taika Waititi’s new film Jojo Rabbit is the latest to apply wry levity to second world war-era Germany, following a meek member of the Deutsches Jungvolk and casting the director as the kid’s mental projection of Hitler. Half imaginary friend and half devil on the shoulder, Waititi’s performance offers an altogether undignified take on the genocidal maniac as a broadside against his beliefs.Waititi is far from the first to do so, however, and far from the best to have done it. His film ultimately assumes a stolid about-face, attempting to seriously reckon with the gravity of widespread loss and the horrors of war. But taking the hot air out of Hitler with pure, militarized goofiness has proven even more affecting, and as quintessentially American as apple pie. Ever since The Three Stooges shot the spoof You Nazty Spy! over four days in late 1939, it’s been open season on the failed artist and architect of genocide. Making a real-life supervillain into someone to be sniggered at instead of feared or scorned helps along the process of national healing that follows the relief of aggression Maltin mentioned. Even before the wounds have healed, it feels good just to laugh.Charlie Chaplin famously declared in his autobiography that if he had had a fuller notion of the inhumanity playing out in the concentration camps, he’d have never made 1940’s The Great Dictator. He claimed that he “could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis” had he been aware, effectively recanting the humanistic comedy that featured him in dual roles as a Jewish barber in the ghetto and effete military commander “Adenoid Hynkel”. All due respect to one of the greatest cinematic talents to have ever lived, but his sensitivity has been misapplied. The sequences that he worried might trivialize the suffering of those caught up in the Holocaust – the most memorable being a dainty ballet between Adenoid (a word meaning a mass of tissue blocking air passage between the back of the nose and the throat) and a glowing oversized globe he bounces around like a trained seal – only get their laughs at the expense of those in power. There’s nothing wrong with jokes about tragedy, so long as they have got the right butt.Chaplin’s film concludes by dropping the bit and delivering an earnest monologue about the tantamount importance of goodness and decency. The man was always a sentimentalist at heart, and while that doesn’t necessarily weaken his film, its successors would advance this strain of satire by going all in on irony. Mel Brooks’ The Producers imagined the fictitious musical Springtime for Hitler, a work so supremely offensive that it would surely disgust Broadway and provide the flop the protagonists’ get-rich-quick scheme requires. Of course, the gag turns out to be on them; audiences had just started to warm up to the idea of weaponized bad taste and they’d stumbled into a hit.The rest of the 60s, the 70s, and the 80s extrapolated this idea and put it into practice on low-rent B-pictures termed “Nazisploitation”. Many angled for sexiness over all else – though there’s still plenty to chuckle at in the likes of Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS – and plenty of others took more purposefully comic aim at the absurdity of the de-platformed Nazis. One such trashy delight would be They Saved Hitler’s Brain, a crackerjack 1968 adventure concerning a plot to defrost Hitler’s cryogenically frozen head, which has been hidden deep in the jungles of South America. It’s one of those so-bad-it’s-good movies in on the game, able to poke fun at the harebrained Aryan experimenters from a couple decades’ worth of safe remove. Films closer to our modern moment would evince a nostalgia for this anything-goes era, such as the 2012 release Iron Sky, which envisioned a colony of techno-Nazis establishing a base on the moon.These films make Hitler out to be a punching bag by playing up his well-known qualities of insecurity, impotent rage, and ineffectuality, though that’s hardly a foolproof strategy. (Take Saturday Night Live’s recurring character Gay Hitler, his sketches predicated on the noxious idea that nothing could be more humiliating than being a homosexual man.) Even so, there’s a catharsis to the act of dissing one of the most evil men to have ever lived, a feeling articulated in characteristically blunt fashion by Jojo Rabbit with a defiant “Fuck off, Hitler!” Others have chosen to go the more indirect route, subjecting him to indignities in the hopes of tarnishing his memory. In either case, silliness has been the modus operandi, a pox on a historical figure desperate to be respected – a matter complicated by the Trump of it all.Reality has grown so ridiculous as to render that once-lethal antic spirit redundant, leaving deadpan the new recourse. (No political cartoon depicting Donald Trump as a screaming orange infant reflects as poorly on him as his actual conduct.) The most effective Hitler satire in recent memory would have to be Look Who’s Back, a mockumentary giving sober consideration to how today’s society would receive a revived Hitler. He’s not bumbling or foolish in this instance, just a fish-out-of-water getting used to the surf unsettlingly quickly. The film plays his second coming straight, pairing the risen Hitler with a film-maker convinced the guy’s a committed actor, and the rest of the world meets him halfway. The final shots make the disquieting connection between today’s nationalist movements and Hitler’s legacy, ending with his chilling words: “I can work with this.” The magic works here in reverse, finding the plausibility in an implausible scenario instead of teasing the fanciful out from the real; Waititi and Chaplin’s idealism has been replaced with a deep cynicism. With the real-world stakes presently too high for comfort, the only laughs to be had are the bitter ones.Jojo Rabbit is out in the US on 18 October and in the UK on 3 January"
How Robert Pattinson became an unlikely arthouse superstar,Twilight’s high school heartthrob has became an indie mainstay but will his newfound niche survive after he takes on the role of Batman?,Guy Lodge,2019-10-14T15:46:23+0100,"Robert Pattinson has given better performances in better films than The Rover, yet it’s a brief scene from David Michod’s outback dystopian thriller that I always think of when it comes to defining his strange, frangible screen persona. Shortly after this otherwise stern, dour sci-fi deals one of film history’s least expected needle drops in the bouncy form of Keri Hilson’s Pretty Girl Rock, we cut to the daft but oddly affecting sight of Pattinson, playing a gauzy-eyed simpleton at the mercy of the wilderness, sitting in a darkened car and singing softly along to the song’s cocky, skittering R&B beat: “All eyes on me when I walk in / No question that this girl’s a ten / Don’t hate me ‘cause I’m beautiful / Don’t hate me ’cause I’m beautiful.”In an otherwise strenuously masculine film, this small moment of unabashed camp is delicious, winking as it does at the young, predominantly female fanbase that followed Pattinson from the Twilight films into artier, more eccentric realms. But it also acknowledges his unusual, anti-macho star image: Pattinson is beautiful, in a willowy, alabaster, slightly aloof way that Hollywood doesn’t tend to seek in leading men, though it couldn’t have been more perfect for the goth androgyny of vampire romantic Edward Cullen.The original millennial softboy before the next generation took up that phrase in earnest, Pattinson’s dreamboat allure was defined by a degree of embedded femininity, a vulnerable beauty – and indeed, pace Hilson, some did hate him for it. In certain male-led quarters of the internet, hating Twilight and its fangirl following was a fixation for several years: the common line on Pattinson became that he was a wan, ineffectual pretty-boy who couldn’t act. The coarsest version of this teasing, of course, was confined to sweaty incel-net forums, yet it trickled into film criticism too – egged on, at the zenith of Cullenmania, by non-Twilight script choices that played unabashedly to his besotted fans. Water for Elephants, Bel Ami and Remember Me were hardly great films, yet critics laid into their lush, feminine romanticism with unseemly glee.This is an old Hollywood chorus, of course: female-targeted genres, and those who trade in them, routinely come in for more scorn than rugged action exercises or male-led auteur pieces. Sure enough, it was only when Pattinson started playing the latter game that he started getting some respect: in 2012, when he scowled and suited up for David Cronenberg’s terse, chilly adaptation of Don DeLillo’s Cosmopolis, the “R-Pattz can act!” headlines duly followed. This wasn’t a revelation to those who had noticed his subtly self-mocking, script-defying intensity in the Twilight, or even his game matinee-idol flexing in Water for Elephants; the context was just a little more acceptable.Rather like his Twilight co-star and ex-girlfriend Kristen Stewart – herself the brunt of insistent, tedious “can’t act” criticism as punishment for the franchise – Pattinson thus took the arthouse route to elevating his reputation, picking ever more challenging roles in ever more idiosyncratic auteur projects: from the aforementioned The Rover to James Gray’s The Lost City of Z, from Brady Corbet’s The Childhood of a Leader to the Safdie Brothers’ Good Time. His leading role as a frenzied, worn-to-the-bone lighthouse keeper’s apprentice in Robert Eggers’ marvellous maritime nightmare The Lighthouse is a perfect example. His beauty, still present, is hollowed out and exhausted in harsh monochrome, pockmarked and saddled with scraggly sailor’s moustache: Whether beating up seagulls or raging through ugly exchanges of deep-stewed 19th-century seadog vernacular, it’s a role that, on the face of it, seems all but tailored for someone trying to shed a teen-idol stigma.Yet look closer at these roles and performances, and Pattinson’s elegant reshaping of his own stardom looks a little less plainly reactive, and more like a subversion: the softness is still there, just in harder surroundings. In the caffeinated, tarmac-pounding New York heist thriller Good Time, he’s cast seemingly against type as a crude, scuzzy, coked-up fuckup, though as his character’s rickety criminal plans fall apart from the get-go, his gaping, unloved vulnerability is as glaring as his peroxided hair. In Claire Denis’s ingenious sensual space odyssey High Life, he’s an introverted, celibate criminal turned tenderly doting father, though only through being summarily raped by Juliette Binoche’s controlling astrophysicist; joining victimhood and paternal protectiveness in one fraught swoop, it’s a character arc unlike that of any male protagonist in the movies.Even in The Lighthouse, Pattinson’s gnarled, calloused performance is principally characterised by helpless, flailing defeat. He’s cultivated a rich, riveting line in outwardly hardened men a little too beautiful, a little too fragile, for the harsher worlds in which they find themselves – upending expectations of what a leading man can do, or more pointedly can’t do, on screen. And now the multiplex comes calling again: seven years after the Twilight saga concluded and liberated its young stars from studio franchise handcuffs, he’s signed up for the umpteenth reboot of The Batman, with a leading role in Christopher Nolan’s latest action whirligig Tenet to come before then.Pattinson’s arthouse dabblings have potentially prepared him well to play Bruce Wayne, the superhero with a more human, angsty backstory than the rest of them, even if many of those to play him over years – Christian Bale’s clenched, ungiving Dark Knight included – have been loth to dwell on his weaknesses. Could Pattinson be the softboy Batman we haven’t yet seen, or a flawed manchild to match Joaquin Phoenix’s revised Joker? Fanboys certainly fear so: it felt like the clock had been turned back to the early 2010s when the casting news was announced, and basement-dwelling geeks seized on Twitter to protest that the erstwhile Edward Cullen (still) “can’t act”, and that he isn’t macho or invulnerable enough to play their beloved caped crusader. On the latter charge, Pattinson has amply cleared himself; on the former, the trolls might be more right than they know.The Lighthouse is out in the US on 18 October and in the UK on 31 January"
Keira Knightley has bagsied Coleen Rooney – who else should be cast in the Wag Wars movie?,"The public fallout was a slow-burn psychodrama of deceit and betrayal, ideal for the big screen – as Knightley has confirmed. So who should tackle Danielle Lloyd?",Stuart Heritage,2019-10-11T12:34:06+0100,"Go home Kramer vs Kramer. Bog off Frost/Nixon. You want drama? You want glamour? You want the sheer white-knuckle thrill of watching one woman block her Instagram followers one by one? Then there’s only one thing for it? The Coleen Rooney/Rebekah Vardy Wag Wars film.And it will. Sure, no script exists yet, and no director is attached. But in a press junket for her new film yesterday, Keira Knightley has thrown her hat into the ring for the role of Coleen Rooney.OK, that’s a slight exaggeration. What actually happened was that, in attempting to keep up with the 500mph enthusiasm of a Heat reporter’s recollection of the story, Knightley appeared to agree with the suggestion that she should play Coleen Rooney in a film. That is already enough..@NetflixUK please get a script over to Keira Knightley immediately to play @ColeenRoo#RooneyvVardy #WagathaChristie #ColeenRooney pic.twitter.com/Is3xlGbPCWKeira Knightley would be a perfect Coleen Rooney. Look me in the eye and tell me that you wouldn’t pay to see one of our finest actors, burnished in the pedigree of a million period pieces, slathered in Ronseal with a nylon wig Velcroed to her head. Tell me you wouldn’t watch an epic psychodrama where she plays a woman trapped in a vast McMansion with only her four children for company, watching her self-esteem erode as her husband plays away, before finally discovering her talent as a private investigator. Of course you would. I’d watch Keira Knightley in anything, but I promise that I would watch the absolute crap out of her in this.The idea of Wag Wars film immediately sounds like a low-rent, trashy, Footballers’ Wives-type production. But Knightley’s commitment changes everything. Now this is a prestige picture, and it deserves the highest calibre of acting talent. Here’s how I suggest casting the rest of the film.Coleen’s arch enemy. Older than Rooney but newer to the wag game, Vardy undergoes a downfall that is nothing less than operatic. We need an actor with the range to flit between victim and antagonist at a moment’s notice, who can lash out with theatrical abandon at everyone and everything as the walls cave in around her. We need someone whose beauty is cut through with a thick streak of psychic darkness. In short, we need Rachel Weisz.Low and grunting, Wayne Rooney should have been Coleen’s rock throughout this scandal. But his refusal to even so much as like her tweet demonstrates a man who is surly and aloof, an old-fashioned man’s man. We need an actor who can at once epitomise the latent anger that goes into posting a tweet such as “I’ll put u asleep within 10 seconds u little girl. Don’t say stuff and not follow up on it. I’ll be waiting” and the stupidity to then send that tweet to himself. As such, I recommend Benedict Cumberbatch.Cut Jamie Vardy open and you’ll find the phrase “Chat shit get banged” written through him like a stick of Brighton rock. A wiry athlete who seems to be a nanosecond away from headbutting someone to death, Vardy will need to be played by an actor who can inhabit both a roiling hostility and a naive marital devotion that will soon be tested to its limit. Jamie Vardy should be played by Eddie Redmayne.Just as the tremors from Rooney’s tweet were starting to die down, who should pop up uninvited but Danielle Lloyd, a seasoned establishment wag. Danielle Lloyd is a key role here, for she will come to represent the swell of ill feeling for Rebekah Vardy in the wag community. She is this film’s Greek chorus, passing violently disdainful comment from afar. She also has an OnlyFans page. She should therefore be played by Tilda Swinton.The end of this film will come when Victoria Beckham, grande dame of wags, decides enough is enough. She gathers together Rooney and Vardy and haughtily reminds them that wags symbolise something greater than themselves. She tells them of their higher moral purpose. Through sheer power of personality, she brokers an uneasy truce ready to be shattered in the sequel. There is no better Victoria Beckham than Joan Collins."
Temple of Dumb: sequels to Boris Johnson's 'hilariously awful' film pitch,"The prime minister’s Indiana Jones-style film idea may have been even less successful than his parliamentary votes, but the follow-ups could hit big",Stuart Heritage,2019-10-08T17:40:29+0100,"Of course Boris Johnson is a frustrated scriptwriter. It makes so much sense. Last week, Emily Sheffield – journalist and sister-in-law of David Cameron – unearthed a “hilariously awful” film pitch, apparently penned by Johnson, entitled Mission to Assyria.In the script, described by Johnson as “a glorious wish-fulfilment dream movie, a mixture of Golan-Globus and Raiders of the Lost Ark”, a brave archaeologist and possible Johnson stand-in named named Marmaduke Montmorency Burton attempts to rescue a Syrian city from the clutches of Islamic State. Enemies are beheaded, helicopters go “dugga, dugga, dugga, thwok, thwok, thwok” and, at the end, a “horrible cologne-drenched jihadi with an air of mincing menace” is murdered with the phrase “Aaargh. Splatteroo”. It sounds a bit like what Inglourious Basterds would have been like if the only film Quentin Tarantino had ever seen was Rambo III.Johnson has confirmed that the pitch was his, and that it was never made because the “very distinguished director” he sent it to – thought to be Tom Hooper – failed to respond.Now, in the grand scheme of things, writing a bad film isn’t even close to being the worst thing that Boris Johnson has done in the past four years. But wouldn’t you prefer to live in the timeline where this film actually got made? The one where Johnson jetted out to Hollywood, missed the referendum campaign, didn’t become prime minister and isn’t currently driving the country into a tree to distract people from that pole-dancing techpreneur?Of course you would. And so would I, which is why I have written some Marmaduke Montmorency Burton wish-fulfilment sequel pitches. Tom Hooper, please put down that mad cat rubbish and call me.Marmaduke Montmorency Burton sits in his office, kissing a blonde and stewing at yet another injustice dished out by the 11 mincing lefties of the Supreme Court. “Enough is enough,” he thinks, strapping a bandolier to his chest and writing NO SURRENDER across his forehead in goat blood, “I’m going to serve hard justice MMB-style!”But just then Lady Hale bursts through the wall, sitting astride a 40-foot robot spider. “Nobody can defeat my supreme authority!” she screams exactly like a witch, pinning Marmaduke to the wall with a giant spider leg and laughing. But Marmaduke isn’t done, not by a long shot. He grits his teeth and growls: “By … the … will … of … the … PEOPLE” and fireballs start shooting out of his eyes. PYEOW, PYEOW, PYEOW!One of them hits Lady Hale in the skull and it explodes and, as bits of brain and hair come fluttering down from the sky, three pretty women start kissing Marmaduke on the lips. “Time for an undisclosed trade visit to Tel Aviv, if you know what I mean,” he quips, winking at the camera.Joanna Lumley sits on the fully completed London Garden Bridge in a bikini, feeding peeled grapes to Marmaduke Montmorency Burton, who deserves them. Suddenly he sits bolt upright. Is that the smell of a torpedo?It is! Evil mayor Sadiq Khan has launched an underwater attack on the bridge, because the idea of spending money on nice things goes against his lefty ideology. Marmaduke has no time to waste! He rips off his shirt, kisses Lumley with tongues and plunges head-first into the Thames with the agility of an 18-year-old diving professional. BOSH! He punches one torpedo into the sky. KLONK! He headbutts another, and it crashes into a worse but more functional bridge, destroying it (good). He grabs a third and hurls at it Khan, exploding him.Marmaduke looks back at the Garden Bridge. “Thank you, sexy hero,” cry the three dozen busloads of Chinese tourists who’d stumbled onto the bridge by mistake. Marmaduke picks three of them to impregnate, winking at the camera.Marmaduke Montmorency Burton is the smartest, handsomest, cleverest man in all of history, but even he is stumped by the labyrinthine complexity of history’s most baffling invention: Google Hangouts. “So I just, um, hold my laptop to my ear like a phone? Is that how it works?” he asks his advisers, as any normal person would in that situation. But just then Marmaduke is distracted by the unmistakable sound of dozens of men tripping over their own dicks.“What could be the source of that?” Marmaduke asks, before he is greeted by the blinding sight of the most beautiful woman he has ever met: a blond American with a raspy voice. “My name is Jennifer Arcuri,” says the woman. “Everyone wants to have sex with me, but I only want to teach you how Google Hangouts work.” “That’s awfully kind and very professional,” replies Marmaduke. “Please tell me how they work.”“You know FaceTime?” Arcuri asks. “Yes,” replies Marmaduke. “It’s basically the same,” says Arcuri. Marmaduke is so pleased that he escorts Arcuri around the world in a completely above-board way. Nobody winks at anything. The end."
Emanuel: a poignant documentary on the Charleston church massacre,"Produced by Stephen Curry and Viola Davis, the film allows the family members of those killed in the 2015 shooting to speak about love, loss and faith",Adrian Horton,2019-10-09T08:00:42+0100,"Emanuel, a documentary on the aftermath of the Charleston church massacre, begins not at the scene of the tragedy on 17 June 2015, but with the larger reaction to it – Daily Show host Jon Stewart at a loss for words, President Obama presiding over another press briefing for a mass shooting. But the film then jumps ahead in time, to Nadine Collier’s kitchen in Charleston, South Carolina, as she whips steamed yams into sweet potato pie for her church, Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal. Four years earlier, Collier’s mother, Ethel Lance, was killed when a white supremacist gunman opened fire after Bible study, killing nine black parishioners. The crime was an act of racial hatred so brutal, a violation of a sacred place so inhumane, that it shocked a nation already growing inured to the crushing pattern of mass shootings.The headlines regenerated days later, when several family members of the victims, including Collier, tearfully forgave the shooter at his bond hearing – a narrative of forgiveness controversially seized upon by the press as a feel-better cover for looking critically at the deep roots of racism in Charleston and beyond. (At the time, the Confederate flag still flew above the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia. Three weeks after the shooting, the then governor, Nikki Haley, ordered it removed and placed in a nearby Confederate museum).The film Emanuel, produced by the basketball superstar Stephen Curry and Oscar-winning actor Viola Davis, takes the news blare of the tragedy and the intense outside focus on forgiveness into account, then zooms in closely to look at church, community and family: the victims’ relationships to the church, and how they loved. Why the families forgave, or did not, and still have not. The film features at least one representative for each victim, as well as numerous voices speaking to the history and culture of Charleston – journalists, local newscasters, activists, historians and religious community members.It’s also an unabashedly Christian film, told from the perspective of a director, film-making team and cast deeply invested in their church and the Christian precept of forgiveness. But director Brian Ivie maintains that it holds lessons for a wider audience. “The hope of the film is that it would show who these people are and what they believe, but it will also show how much work we have to do. And I think those things can coexist,” he told the Guardian.Ivie is perhaps not the most obvious choice to direct a documentary on the shooting at Emanuel. A white man from California, he was on his honeymoon when he received news of the tragedy. “To be honest, I never wanted to make a movie about this,” he said. “I felt like it was the most inappropriate thing to do,” given the media crush to cover the immediate aftermath. His unease was compounded by the intense focus on forgiveness, which “started to Christianize the situation in a way that I know hurt a lot of people and forced a lot of people into an expedited healing process that wasn’t necessarily healthy”.“For me, as a white American, it certainly didn’t feel like it was my place to go document the story, even to grieve – what role would I serve in that?” Ivie avoided the story for a year, but changed tune when he flew to Charleston to film the first annual memorial service as a gift to AME Emanuel. His producing partner, Dimas Salaberrios, an African American pastor from New York City, connected him with several victims’ family members, which began discussions of a potential film.People were “rightfully” skeptical at the beginning, said Ivie, but he credited two promises in earning their trust. First, that they would not profit in any way from the film. Second, that they would honor the faith of their loved ones. “Knowing that I shared their faith,” said Ivie, “I think that made them feel comfortable – that I was going to honor the legacy of faith of their families, which was very important to them.”Ivie, wary of the flattening effect of media coverage of increasingly routine mass shootings, said he worked for the filming process to be collaborative, not extractive. “The first question every documentarian has to ask themselves is: should I make this? Not can I make this,” he said. Those questions formed “a process we went through with the families: do you want this to exist? Is this something that honors you and your loved ones, or not?”Emanuel also includes many local experts – journalists, local newscasters, historians, a Black Lives Matter activist – to address the city’s thicket of racism both past and present. The racial context of the tragedy, beyond the hate crime itself – Charleston’s history as America’s pre-eminent slave port, the terrorism of lynching in the south, the solace provided by black churches, particularly Emanuel – was crucial to the film. “I wanted it to feel like we were not only humanizing people but also giving them a voice to talk about the pain and injustice and marginalization and disenfranchisement and evil that has been done to African Americans for centuries,” said Ivie. “I felt like that was the only way that the film deserved to exist.”While the film explicitly discusses racism, Emanuel refrains from specifically addressing gun control. Ivie said he personally supports gun reform and the organization Everytown for Gun Safety, but backed away from politics in the film in deference to the families. “Ultimately, it felt like we were moving away from what the film needed to be for [the families], so that’s why it wasn’t the focal point,” he said.One of the film’s most moving moments, however, comes again through the presence of Barack Obama, who delivered the eulogy to one of the victims, the Rev Clementa Pinckney. At one point in his speech, the then president pauses, seemingly at a loss of what to do next, how to adequately express this level of pain, or faint possibility of hope. Then he begins to sing Amazing Grace, soon joined by the pastors behind him, then the whole room.The decision to devote significant time to Obama’s speech has received “a lot of flak”, Ivie said. “I mean, the Christian community is very divided.” But it’s part of the story on the ground, “and I felt like that was a moment that brought the nation together in the right way”.The final moments of the film, though, belong to the families, each paying tribute to their loved ones lost four years ago at church: Clementa C Pinckney, Cynthia Marie Graham Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lance, Depayne Middleton-Doctor, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel L Simmons, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton and Myra Thompson. Their memories were integral to Davis and Curry’s support of the project, said Ivie. “That was their heart, to make sure the world didn’t forget about these people and why they died – and also why they lived.”Emanuel is out now in the US with a UK date yet to be announced"
Parasite: how Bong Joon-ho returned home to make his masterpiece,"The director’s wildly acclaimed, Oscar-buzzed thriller marks a fascinating high point in a career that’s recovered from a Hollywood struggle",Guy Lodge,2019-10-09T06:00:44+0100,"There’s no place like home. It’s a cliche that sounds pretty cruel applied to Parasite, Bong Joon-ho’s brilliant, insidious twist on the home-invasion thriller, in which a frostily modernist luxury house serves as several different things to different people – a status symbol, a shelter, a prison – but doesn’t offer homely comforts to anyone, exactly. Yet it’s true, in a funny way, for Bong himself. A globally minded film-maker with big-dreaming genre nous, he has spent the last few years making a bid for mainstream Hollywood clout, only to finally make an international phenomenon from his own doorstep.Bong’s last two films, 2013’s Snowpiercer and 2017’s Okja, were his first to be made in English: they weren’t exactly misfires, either critically or commercially, yet both clearly had designs on being bigger deals than they were. Adapted from a comic book, with brawny Marvel man Chris Evans in the lead, Snowpiercer was a delirious dystopian adventure that merged Bong’s auteurist eccentricity with bolshy blockbuster aspirations: it raked in over $82m outside the US, double its production budget (at $40m, then a record for a Korean production).In the States, however, its bullet-train momentum was halted by the ignoble figure of Harvey Weinstein, as Bong joined the long line of directors to fight “Harvey Scissorhands” over the film’s final edit. The director refused to follow Weinstein’s proposed cuts and additions; the impasse delayed the film’s American release for a year, prompting “Free Snowpiercer” protests from impatient fans. Finally, the uncut film was granted a release, albeit a limited one on the Weinsteins’ lower-profile Radius-TWC label. It took just $4.5m: the film may not have been conventional popcorn fare, but it clearly had set its sights higher than that. (Meanwhile, it never even made it to UK cinemas.)Undaunted, Bong flirted with Hollywood again in Okja, a daffy fantasy romp that meshed a South Korean setting and sensibility with an international eco-warrior conscience and lashings of multiplex-friendly spectacle. Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton were on hand too, acting with the level of subtlety you’d expect of a Jon Ronson-scripted film about a mall-trashing, genetically modified superpig escaping the slaughterhouse with the loving help of an adorable tyke: Babe on highly aggressive steroids, if you will. Bong had more sympathetic Tinseltown partners than Weinstein this time: Netflix and Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment boarded the project early, stumping up a $50m production budget (breaking Snowpiercer’s aforementioned record).It premiered at Cannes, in the last year that the tradition-bound French festival permitted Netflix’s film in its competition, and was well enough received: scattered boos were directed at the streaming service rather than the film itself. But by the time it popped up on the Netflix platform a month later, it felt a bit of a non-event. Critical enthusiasm was muted relative to Bong’s earlier, wilder, more homegrown genre rides like Mother and The Host, and it quietly sank into Netflix’s unquantifiable morass of content – it’s doubtless been seen by many, but it never felt like anyone was really talking about it.Parasite, on the other hand, has been inspiring itchy international conversation since its premiere at Cannes, where it wowed critics and Alejandro González Iñárritu’s jury, who unanimously handed it the Palme d’Or. Many a Palme d’Or winner goes quiet outside the rarefied film-festival atmosphere; Parasite, with its inky comedy driven by seething social fury, has found its public. With multiple global territories (including the US, UK and Japan) yet to weigh in, it has already grossed $91m worldwide; eager chatter about it is lighting up social media. (If you don’t believe me, search the #BongHive hashtag on Twitter to see the film’s Generation Z cult in action.) Its hip US distributor Neon will be planning a lively Oscar campaign, targeting not just the foreign-language category, but a best picture nomination too. That would surely seal its status as the biggest Korean crossover phenomenon in film history: the BTS of cinema, effectively.That’s a pretty remarkable trajectory for a film that, in addition to its chilly, bleak outlook and grisly violence, is entirely uncompromised in its sheer Korean-ness: no English dialogue or Hollywood stars here, while the film is so vivid in its cultural specifics that jjapaguri – a kind of local instant noodle dish – serves as a key plot point. Yet Parasite’s delicious indigenous details hardly obscure its more universal agenda: it’s a film that taps into a kind of anti-capitalist rage against rigid structures of class and privilege that are being felt everywhere from Korea to America to Brexit Britain. Bong’s rollercoaster storytelling skills are a factor too, of course, but it turns out the way to engage a global audience, in this case, was not to play Hollywood’s own game: it’s the political resonance of Parasite, not any stylistic familiarity, that is striking a chord across continents.Bong isn’t the only world-cinema auteur of late, meanwhile, to find that you can go home again. His compatriot Park Chan-wook befuddled audiences with his bewitchingly bonkers American debut Stoker; an indifferent commercial reception sent him back to home turf, where he made The Handmaiden and landed a global arthouse sensation. (He’s since surprised us again, heading over to the BBC to direct the very chic Le Carré miniseries The Little Drummer Girl; so far, this back-and-forth travelling has cramped his style.)Haifaa Al-Mansour, the first Saudi woman to direct a feature with the arthouse charmer Wadjda, bombed when she headed abroad to make the literary biopic Mary Shelley; she headed back to Saudi Arabia to direct the crowd-pleasing feminist parable The Perfect Candidate, which was warmly received at Venice and Toronto last month, and has been entered by her home country as its Oscar submission.These are different journeys, of course, from that of Alfonso Cuarón, who capitalised on his vast Hollywood success to head home for his most personal project to date – though the lavish acclaim and awards heaped upon his Netflix-backed Mexican memory piece Roma nonetheless made it a career milestone. Its good fortune, like Parasite’s, proves that Hollywood is no longer necessarily the final destination for a successful directorial career: sometimes it’s just the Emerald City, en route to a happy homecoming.Parasite is out in the US on 11 October and in the UK on 7 February"
"Less Shaft, more House Party: Hollywood revisits 90s black film boom","With help from Issa Rae and LeBron James, the industry is remaking a slew of classics, including Set It Off and New Jack City",André Wheeler,2019-10-06T06:00:07+0100,"Hollywood’s remake trend knows no limits. After delivering a steady stream of profitable, white-centric remakes, studios are turning their attention to popular black-centric films from the past.Film studios are remaking a slew of small-budget 90s movies including Set It Off, New Jack City and House Party that delivered respectable box office returns and became black pop culture mainstays. The remakes come after campaigns for increased diversity in Hollywood, including #OscarsSoWhite and the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at University of Southern California.The gritty female heist movie Set It Off and the Harlem-set neo-noir New Jack City helped propel the acting careers of black stars including Wesley Snipes, Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah. House Party, meanwhile, featured a young, still relatively unknown Martin Lawrence (who went on to star in big-budget films such as Bad Boys and Big Momma’s House).There’s definitely a hole in the marketplace and Hollywood has recognized it“There were a lot of risks being taken back then,” said Danielle Scruggs, who runs Black Women Directors, a digital catalog of films made by black women. “The films weren’t as didactic as they are today. Like House Party: here’s two teens who just want to throw the best party of the year. It’s this slice-of-life film. There’s no one looking at the camera and saying: ‘Black Lives Matter!’”The forthcoming remake have black Hollywood’s brightest names attached. Issa Rae, star of the HBO sitcom Insecure, will reportedly produce Set It Off. The basketball star LeBron James will produce House Party through his new film and TV studio SpringHill Entertainment and the Black-ish creator, Kenya Barris, was hired in 2015 to pen a film version of the 70s sitcom Good Times. “A classic is something new that feels familiar,” said the music video director Calmatic, who is helming the House Party remake. “I think that’s the formula a lot of these new projects are working with. Creating a new energy around a familiar entity.”Calmatic’s childhood VHS collection, which included The Nutty Professor and Sister Act 2, highlights the importance of mainstream black films. “I haven’t even seen ‘classics’ like ET or Back to the Future,” the director of Lil Nas X’s music video Old Town Road said. “But what I do know are the two or three VHS tapes we had at my house. I watched Sister Act 2 a million times.”Hollywood is hoping to re-create some of this magic.A boom of black films gradually declined during the late 90s and early 2000s. Black directors’ projects were often spaced out years apart (John Singleton, the esteemed late director of Boyz In the Hood, once had a six-year hiatus) and studios invested little in their marketing. Eventually, the releases of black-centric films became special occasions.“There hasn’t been a lot of these smaller-budget films – outside of what [the black writer and director] Tyler Perry has been doing – marketed to African American audiences recently,” says Jeffrey Bock, a box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations. “There’s definitely a hole in the marketplace and Hollywood has recognized it.”Warner Bros learned how not to repackage a popular black franchise this summer with its ill-received Shaft reboot. Starring Samuel L Jackson as Shaft, the film was seen as being too different from its critically lauded predecessors and failed to capture an audience. “It was a pretty big flop for Warner Bros,” Bock says. “But the failure of that movie is not going to stop other reboots from being made. Studios have learned it’s better to take something that’s not so beloved and can be improved upon. That’s when a reboot is successful.”Bocks predicts a film like House Party has the potential to kick off a series of copycat films targeted for black audiences. “If it hits – there will be a trend,” he says. “Because that’s how Hollywood works. It’s a cyclical industry. Stomp the Yard [released in 2007] is a great example of that. Dancing and stomping movies were a big trend for a long time.”There is the valid concern a heavy focus on remakes and reboots will devalue the original ideas of black screenwriters and directors. Would a major studio pass up on an experimental script like Jordan Peele’s racial horror satire Get Out in favor of something tried and tested?“I don’t really want to see reboots,” said Scruggs, followed by a groan. “There’s enough original ideas out there that haven’t been done before. I want to see those stories told, instead of looking at the past.”But the reboots trend is here, for black and white audiences now. As Bock said: “Anything nostalgic right now is gold.”"
"Terminator: Dark Fate review – Arnie's back, and it's never going to stop",James Cameron co-produces the latest in the humans v machines odyssey – featuring a fierce Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg Grandpa Walton,Peter Bradshaw,2019-10-23T00:00:16+0100,"So in Terminator’s beginning is his end and in his time-travel action franchise is the ending that brings him back round to another beginning: basically replaying the famous elements from T1 and T2 with some new actors, new twists, newish attitudes to sexual politics, famous lines slightly changed (“Come with me or you’ll be dead in 30 seconds”) and with Arnie himself good-humouredly assuming a wise old-timer attitude, like a cyborg Grandpa Walton.The Terminator franchise has come clanking robotically into view once again with its sixth film – it absolutely will not stop – not merely repeating itself but somehow repeating the repetitions. Terminator: Dark Fate is co-produced by its original creator, James Cameron, who has also co-written the story. It’s that type of late-period action movie we have seen with Sly Stallone’s Rocky and Rambo properties: a kind of endstopped reboot, which gives the series a new lick of paint, younger cast members, a sprinkling of up-to-the-minute social touches, while also conveying a solemn finality, as if graciously acknowledging its own classic status – though certainly keeping the door open for more films.So much has happened since Cameron’s sci-fi action classic from 1984 made a mainstream icon and star of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The 1991 sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day – although in my view lacking the steely clarity and force of the original – was dynamically filmed and a huge smash. Then we had a tiresome run of rusty turkeys on a laborious back-to-the-future theme: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Salvation (2009) – without Arnie – and the irritatingly spelt Terminator Genisys (2015). In the course of all this, Schwarzenegger found time for a brief tenure as governor of California and Christian Bale, playing freedom fighter John Connor in Terminator Salvation, became notorious for an on-set rage-filled meltdown, tape-recorded and uploaded to the web.But now we are in Mexico, close to the Texas border, almost three decades on from the second Terminator, where smart young auto worker Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) finds herself being menaced by a terrifying humanoid-robotic figure who descends naked to Earth in a crackle of lightning in the time-honoured manner: Gabriel Luna has the stern but featureless T2-ish role of the Terminator-Who-Disappointingly-Isn’t-Arnie. But then another figure comes down to Earth stark naked and is apparently on Dani’s side: this is Grace (Mackenzie Davis): a female equivalent of the gallant Kyle Reese from the first film. Then the legendary figure of Sarah Connor herself, played by Linda Hamilton, appears with some heavy weaponry, also intent on saving young Dani, and she is not the only one who is to be on her side. It won’t be long before the great Austrian-American appears, the Terminator ancestor, now living incognito like someone in a witness protection programme, and pretending to be a curtain-fitter called Carl. It’s a pretty droll appearance for the great man.So you don’t need an MA in terminatorology studies to figure out that this Dani is someone destined to be of enormous importance to the humans’ resistance uprising against their future oppression by the Skynet tyranny. But wait. Wasn’t that supposed to have been forestalled by Sarah Connor’s heroic efforts? Erm, yeah, but then there was a new oppression from some machines called Legion. Oh.Basically, Arnold is called upon to reprise a character I always thought was fundamentally wrong: the nice Terminator, the Terminator on the side of the angels, although Hamilton’s Sarah Connor has some fierce dialogue scenes with him, unconvinced that he can be anything other than evil. It’s good to see Hamilton getting a robust role, although, sadly, she has to concede badass superiority to Davis. This sixth Terminator surely has to be the last. Yet the very nature of the Terminator story means that going round and round in existential circles comes with the territory."
A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon review – an out-of-this-world delight,Aardman send Shaun and co into orbit in another dizzyingly inventive film for everyone,Wendy Ide,2019-10-20T11:55:53+0100,"Dizzyingly inventive and playfully visual, the sequel to the 2015 Shaun the Sheep feature film expands the scope of the original with a new story that extends way beyond the hedges of Mossy Bottom Farm and out of this world. Even if it were not packed with delightful sight gags (like the original film, there is no dialogue here, although it boasts plenty of grunts and one world-shaking burp), the cine-literate mischief seeded throughout Farmageddon would guarantee an appeal way beyond the junior audience.The plot, which centres on a visit from an adorable alien who looks like an excitable blue tentacled puppy, contains obvious nods to ET. The sheep come to the rescue in a story that references, through sight gags and musical motifs, everything from Doctor Who to 2001: A Space Odyssey to The X-Files. It’s an absolute joy."
Why Joaquin Phoenix's Joker must be kept isolated from the rest of the Batman films,"WARNING: This article contains spoilersAs good as Joker is, do comic book fans really want its nihilistic malaise infecting the DC cinematic universe? Aren’t superhero films supposed to be fun?",Ben Child,2019-10-09T13:17:46+0100,"For the modern Hollywood producer with one eye on a money-spinning sequel – or even a full-blooded cinematic universe – some movies create more problems than they solve. Warner Bros’s Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice provided the superhero smackdown every comic book fan thought they wanted to see, but it ruined the Dark Knight for the big screen for the best part of a decade (outside of those zippy and imaginative Lego Batman flicks). Star Wars: The Phantom Menace gave us Anakin Skywalker before he turned to the dark side, but George Lucas’s decision to show us the future Darth Vader as a child ended up infantilising the prequel and its followups. Alien Resurrection brought Sigourney Weaver’s Ellen Ripley back from the dead as a clone of herself, but … well, you know the rest.Todd Phillips’ Joker has the same problem. A few weeks ago in this column, I speculated that Warner Bros are likely to want to unite Joaquin Phoenix’s clown prince of Gotham with Robert Pattinson’s caped crusader in a putative sequel to the forthcoming The Batman. But having now seen Joker, it’s much more difficult to imagine anybody wanting it to be the spark that ignites a new cinematic universe of darker Gotham stories.Phillips’s movie is essential viewing for anyone with more than a passing affection for the 1970s and early 80s films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro – King of Comedy and Taxi Driver in particular – to which it pays fulsome tribute with its vision of a troubled, semi-psychotic working-class white male left to fend for himself by society, with disastrous results. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Arthur Fleck is one of startling, nihilistic majesty – a jewel found shining among dead things. And yet this is not a film to fire up the fanboys and girls with excitement about future episodes – despite Phoenix’s stated desire to return to the role. For it takes the Joker, and the uncaring Gotham that spawned him, to such jagged, curdled depths of inhumanity that it’s difficult to imagine even Batman being able to pierce the doom-laden malaise.Where earlier incarnations of the Joker – Jack Nicholson’s leering pantomime villain; Heath Ledger’s sketchy schemer – had a sense of spiky and operatic joie de vivre, there is nothing about Fleck’s descent into madness likely to have the average viewer leave the cinema with a spring in their step. He murders his own mum, kills his friends and stalks his pretty neighbour like the worst kind of incel freak. This is a tale of desperation and decay; of a cruel, cruel world that creates an even crueller man. Perhaps the Joker we see right at the end of the movie, when he has become a hero to hordes of Gotham’s discarded young men, has the potential to become the kind of larger-than-life villain that everybody loves to hate. But it is hard to imagine anyone ever warming to Phoenix’s tortured, pencil-thin iteration. The natural response here is a blend of pity and revulsion.Perhaps Joker could provide a sort of Casino Royale-style reset for the Batman universe, wiping out every last trace of over-the-top silliness, so Matt Reeves’ The Batman (due in 2021) can start out with a fresh slate. Phillips’s film certainly sets up a future confrontation between Batman and the Joker – the former has an axe to grind because Fleck’s actions inadvertently led to the murder of his parents, while the latter resents Bruce Wayne for getting the gilded upbringing he believes he was cruelly denied.And yet this would likely be a version of the caped crusader’s home city even more malevolent and stripped of fantasy stylings than Christopher Nolan’s much-loved Dark Knight trilogy. At some stage we will have to ask ourselves what the point of these comic book movies is, if all the fun stuff has been flushed into the Gotham sewers.Despite its box-office success, Phillips’ movie may only ever have been intended as a tantalising one-shot, a “what-if” entry in the style of the controversial comic book from which it draws so much inspiration, Alan Moore’s The Killing Joke. Intriguingly, though, that graphic novel ultimately ended up feeding into wider DC Comics continuity. At the end of the movie, it is hinted that Fleck has escaped incarceration in Arkham Asylum to wreak havoc on the streets of Gotham. I wonder if this version of the Joker, as marvellous as Phoenix’s performance is, really ought to have been kept locked up in a padded cell, so we never have to see him on the big screen again."
Boys Don't Cry at 20: in praise of the divisive transgender drama,"In 1999, Hilary Swank won plaudits for playing Brandon Teena, a murdered trans man, but in the years since, a backlash has been brewing",Guy Lodge,2019-10-22T07:00:55+0100,"By the usual logic of such things, Hilary Swank was not supposed to win the 1999 best actress Oscar. She was 25 years old and relatively unknown, best recognised from undistinguished roles in The Next Karate Kid and Beverly Hills 90210. She was up against the never-awarded Hollywood royal Annette Bening, who had a juicy, grandly entertaining role in the Academy’s favourite film of the year, American Beauty – which just happened to win every other major category it was up for that night. Swank’s film, Boys Don’t Cry, was only up for two acting prizes, and even those nominations counted as hard-fought victories for a tough $2m indie on the subject of transgender hate crime, that had to make judicious edits to avoid a commercially crippling NC-17 rating.Bening had won the cliquier Screen Actors Guild award, often a harbinger of Oscar victory. Yet when Swank prevailed in what had been a tight months-long race, confidently taking the stage to accept her statuette from a happily baffled Roberto Benigni, no one was especially surprised. Because sometimes, amid the politics and strategy of awards campaign season, a certain level of performance cannot be denied – and Swank’s astonishing, bone-deep portrayal of Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old Nebraskan trans man gang-raped and murdered in 1993 by several male acquaintances when his transgender identity was revealed, was such an achievement.Swank’s performance entailed, of course, the kind of all-in physical commitment that tends to wow Oscar voters – though it was a transformation dependent on inside-out understanding of the character rather than prosthetics. With cropped hair and a slouchy denim-and-plaid wardrobe emphasising the androgynous beauty in her tough features, she controlled the calculated, rangy swagger in her body language to tilt Teena’s masculine-feminine presence in either direction from scene to scene; her voice was similarly deepened and elasticised, its studiously maintained huskiness occasionally betrayed by spontaneous quivers and leaps when Teena’s true emotions surged.Swank may not have been fully convincing as a man, but that was the point. Her Teena was inexperienced in the role himself, feeling his way through it as restless hormones rattled within him; he desperately wanted his gender to transcend performance, and Swank’s own acting was attuned to the difficulties of the transition. Audiences had rarely seen a performance along these lines, at a time when gender identity crisis was mostly presented in cinema in flatter dress-up terms, as opposed to a more interior study of a soul at war with a body. The Academy certainly hadn’t: awarding a supporting actress Oscar to Linda Hunt, adept but essentially stunt-cast in the role of a cisgender male Chinese photographer in The Year of Living Dangerously was as adventurous as they had previously been in the gender-confusion department. (The yellowface nature of the role, meanwhile, didn’t exactly make it a progressive milestone.)The mainstream media conversation around transgender representation was, to say the least, a lot less evolved in 1999 than it was in 2019 – so much less so, in fact, that Swank using male pronouns to pay tribute to Teena in her acceptance speech actually sparked a flurry of public debate. (Teena’s mother JoAnn was unimpressed, insisting her child “pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her”.) Reports circulated of uncomfortable laughter and jeering at the film’s love scenes: the Chicago critic Nick Davis recalls that even Teena’s final rape and murder met with mirth at his youth-populated campus screening. Pierce’s film was uncompromising in its presentation of transgender identity as difficult, untidy, as internally confusing to the person inside the body as those outside of it. Swank’s performance was haunting in its self-alienation, and occasionally euphoric in its palpable sense of discovery – the actor’s, one sensed, as much as the character’s.You need only compare Boys Don’t Cry to a more recent Oscar winner, Tom Hooper’s vapidly prettified The Danish Girl – in which Eddie Redmayne’s preening transgender artist Lili Elbe appears to find her identity through the simple thrill of rolling on a pair of stockings – to see how relatively unusual the complex, conflicted empathy of Kimberly Pierce’s film still is in mainstream LGBTQ cinema.The Danish Girl came in for a lot of stick from transgender activists, many of whom protested the casting of a cis male actor in the role of a trans woman. Boys Don’t Cry was accused of exploitation in its day too, and has retrospectively received increased criticism over Swank’s casting: indeed, given the sensitivity and conscientiousness of Pierce’s perspective, it seems unlikely that the film would be equivalently cast today. The grievance is understandable: Swank managed to persuasively slip into a tortured skin and slip out of it again, winning a best actress Oscar that, by its very category title, fully affirmed her feminine identity and launched her career as an A-list leading lady who would win another Oscar (this time playing a cis woman, albeit in the butch realm of female boxing) five years later. The prizes for Boys Don’t Cry may have honored Brandon Teena’s legacy, but the happy ending was Swank’s, not his.Yet it would be a mistake to politely sideline Boys Don’t Cry as another miscalculated, progressive-for-its-time casualty of cancel culture. Pierce’s film was hard enough to get made as it was, while the director has explained how she considered various actors across the gender spectrum before settling on Swank’s soulful, anxious imperfection in the part. Boys Don’t Cry was, for many viewers, an introductory text in the understanding of transgender identity; its deep, protective but unsentimental love for Brandon Teena helps it remain one today, however differently it might be made now. “We have come a long way,” Swank said at the outset of her Oscar acceptance speech, striking a note of proud defiance that didn’t immediately endear her to the Hollywood crowd that prefers gushing, weepy gratitude from its starlets. She was right, of course, however much further we’ve come since."
Making Waves: behind a fascinating documentary about movie sound,Professor and director Midge Costin talks about her ear-opening new film that aims to remind audiences just how much work goes into cinematic sound,Charles Bramesco,2019-10-23T07:00:40+0100,"Midge Costin has had it with people forgetting the difference between sound editing and sound mixing every time the Oscars roll around. Once and for all: “Sound mixing brings all the elements together, all the various recorded tracks, and synthesizes them into one soundscape. Editing covers voice, music, effects, ADR – how do they sound?” So, that should be the end of that.Of course, the professor and audio-biz legend had more on her mind than settling cocktail party disputes when she set out to create her new documentary Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound. Her career’s emphasis on education gave her the idea to condense a semester’s worth of introductory material into one compact package, breaking down the essentials of her craft for an audience of laypeople. She introduces and defines key terms – foley work, automated dialogue replacement, mono v stereo v surround sound – in order to render visible labor that generally goes unseen and unnoticed when done well.“I went to film school, and I hated sound,” Costin tells the Guardian by phone. “It scared me, I had panic attacks doing it, so I wanted to be a picture editor when I graduated. I was doing my thesis, and a friend called me up to tell me that none of their union guys would touch 16mm sound. I fell into it by mistake, because I needed the money. I took the sound job, and then went, ‘Oh, crap. I’m responsible for tone and mood.’ I had a conversion, once I realized that sound wasn’t just technical. It adds so much to the story.”She took to the job like a fish in water, quickly establishing herself as a formidable talent in her field and a reliable resource for big-league productions. She later grew disillusioned with the action-adventure gigs offered to her (she mentions getting jaded after working on a Michael Bay film – The Rock, judging from her IMDb page – before adding, “Maybe I shouldn’t use any names?”) and decided to go into academia. It was at USC that she first made plans with colleague-turned-producer Bobette Buster to assemble a documentary adapting her lectures for a single bite-sized package. They floated some plans in the early 2000s, but had to wait a decade and change for the protections on fair use law to beef up so that they could excerpt major movie clips without paying an arm and a leg.The courts have since ruled that sampling footage will be acceptable so long as it’s done in the spirit of public edification, and just like that, Costin was off. Between the connections she’d made in the industry and favors called in from fellow sound people, she put together an all-star lineup of commentators. From her former student Ryan Coogler to Steven Spielberg, who named her the Kay Rose chair at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, the deep bench of experts dissect scenes classic and contemporary to illustrate the great quantities of work that go into creating and fine-tuning a soundscape. Spielberg, for example, goes into the subtly expressionistic quality of the shellshocking beach invasion that opens Saving Private Ryan.Just about everyone takes good audio work for granted, from the casual viewer to the budget-balancers at the studios. “They say sound is 50% of the story, but on the films I was doing, the post-production sound budget would be 1% to 1.5% of the total,” Costin recalls. “The average moviegoer thinks that when you turn on the camera, it starts also recording sound. They don’t even get that they’re recorded separately and synced. How much work going into sound, when done correctly, isn’t even perceptible.”She organized the many different roles in the audio side of the film world within a “circle of talent” likening the conjunction of voice, sound effects and music to the cooperating sections of an orchestra. Each role requires precision, patience and perseverance. Smashing watermelons to approximate the noise of splintering femurs is all fun and games, but some tasks can be more tedious.“When you think about doing footsteps, you’ve got to do them for everyone. Everybody has their own unique footsteps,” Costin says. “So many American films go abroad, and when you take out the production track, you lose everything. If someone’s tapping their fingers while talking, you’ll lose the tapping when they dump the dialogue for redubbing. The rerecording is extensive. They even have what’s called a ‘cloth track’, where they just rub various fabrics to get the sound of people shifting in their chair or getting up … Sometimes, the most important sound can be a creak or a breath.”Her film concludes with an eye toward the future, focusing on technology as the driving force for sound’s advancement in the theater and the home. Unlike the film purists that continue to keep mechanical methods alive, the audio set has fully embraced the computerized era. “Some people will say it just sounds better with analog equipment,” Costin concedes. “But the variety of things you can do, what you can see on the digital readouts, it gives you so many more options. Aside from the difference, which is hard to hear for a lot of people, we’re all pretty happy to be on digital.”On the consumer end, she’s of two minds. She’s gladly watched equipment affordable to the average family grow more sophisticated, but that’s come with its own issues. “The problem sometimes comes down to how people have their home systems set up. Theaters get carefully calibrated, but listening at home leaves a lot of room for error. I’d love for people to see movies in theaters.”However the tools of its creation or display may change, Costin knows that her life’s passion will be secure. Cinema needs sound to be its fullest, most exhilarating self, and sound needs artists to bring it to life. “As we watch things on smaller screens, sound gets even more important. The smaller someone’s face gets, the more reliant we are on audio cues for emotion and tone of a scene.” With a laugh, she adds, “You all need us!”Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound is released in the US on 25 October and in the UK on 1 November"
Eli review – schlocky Netflix horror devolves into supernatural silliness,A boy questions the veracity of some nasty experimental treatment in a promisingly twisty tale that ultimately crashes and burns ,Benjamin Lee,2019-10-18T08:01:46+0100,"Offloaded to Netflix by Paramount, who reportedly couldn’t figure out how the heck to market it, supernatural horror flick Eli arrives with a number of question marks eerily circulating. In a hugely profitable time for the genre, how could a major studio not figure out how to make some theatrical profit from a low-budget horror film? What’s the big twist at the film’s sinister core? And most importantly, can it possibly be even half as bad as The Cloverfield Paradox?The disastrous threequel was the last film dumped by Paramount on the streaming platform and while some were initially surprised by the decision, anyone who eventually endured the wretched thing was in full support. While Eli isn’t quite as inexcusably incoherent, it’s still something of a misshapen mess and one that might have struggled to lure an audience on the big screen. On Netflix, it’s far better suited, living alongside the platform’s ever-populating library of mediocre genre offerings.Eli (Captain Fantastic and The Nightingale star Charlie Shotwell) suffers from an extreme auto-immune disorder that’s made the outside world an impossibility. But his parents (Kelly Reilly and Max Martini) may have found a solution. In a remote, and comically creepy, mansion, a doctor (Lili Taylor) is offering an expensive experimental treatment that she claims will cure him. Risking everything, the family heads to the middle of nowhere in the hope that Eli might be able to finally live a normal life. But Eli is convinced that something is wrong. Why is the treatment making him feel worse? Can he really trust the doctor? And why is he being plagued by pesky ghosts?Rather like the wonderful, little-seen New Zealand comedy horror Housebound, Eli is a haunted house film where the person being haunted is unable to leave. It’s a nifty way of ensuring that a character who should otherwise be heading for the hills is forced to endure and then investigate the source of the malevolence. But are the ghosts trying to harm or help Eli? For a while there’s some fun in trying to figure it all out with him and the film carefully leaves a number of possibilities dangling. It works better as a mystery than a horror with director Ciarán Foy strangely incapable of constructing a solid fright. The film is scattered with a number of familiar horror sequences, from a couple of nasty dreams to some extended jump scares, but none of them really land.It’s a mostly one-location film and, despite experience within the genre, Foy is never able to turn the house into enough of a character, it’s never as frightening as it should be, atmosphere evaporating fast. The details of the plot prove more involving than the film that surrounds it, the script chugging along with speed, leading us along with curiosity at just what the film’s big twist will be. When it comes, it’s a decent surprise but it’s confusingly, messily revealed and the film crumbles soon after, devolving into laughable silliness, almost deliberately so, as if Foy wasn’t sure how to sell the finale with a straight face. Performances are mostly bland although Taylor does have some fun weaponising the soft tone of her voice.Like The Cloverfield Paradox before it, Eli is a film more suited to the small screen, where audience members can multi-task, perhaps even search for something better to watch next.Eli is available on Netflix now"
Non-Fiction review – tale of literary passions loses the plot,"Olivier Assayas’s drama, set in the world of publishing, strains in vain to make zeitgeisty points about the future of books ",Peter Bradshaw,2019-10-16T13:00:17+0100,"Olivier Assayas is treading water with this amiable but self-indulgent and finally negligible movie (originally entitled Doubles Vies or Double Lives) about intrigue and adulterous goings-on in the publishing world of Paris.It’s a film that ostentatiously concerns itself with contemporary, zeitgeisty issues such as digital culture and the internet, and whether this is undermining the world of reading and books. But strip out the strained speechifying on that subject and it could have been made at any time in the last 40 years. There are some funny lines, and, despite the literary setting, Assayas can’t resist cinephile gags, particularly a bizarre juxtaposition of Star Wars: The Force Awakens with Michael Haneke’s searing drama The White Ribbon. But once we’ve reached an in-joke about the movie’s own female lead – Juliette Binoche – the film has started munching its own tail.Vincent Macaigne is Léonard, an author of middling literary fiction based on his own failed marriage and affairs. His sales are declining, and his urbane publisher Alain (Guillaume Canet) wants to drop him from his list; they have an excruciating lunch at which Alain can’t bring himself to say this out loud. But Léonard is having an affair with Alain’s wife, Selena (Binoche), whose loyal cheerleading on the home front may have been the only thing keeping Léonard’s career alive. Alain himself is having an affair with his head of digital policy, Laure (Christa Théret).Just as Léonard is periodically asked if he is writing “autofiction” and if this is a viable genre, so Assayas seems to be playing around with the idea of autofilm. There is one interesting line: brooding on online abuse rising as literacy falls, Léonard remarks about trolls: “The less they read, the more wary they are of writing.” Very true.• Non-Fiction is released in the UK on 18 October."
"Terminator: Dark Fate review – Arnie's back, and it's never going to stop",James Cameron co-produces the latest in the humans v machines odyssey – featuring a fierce Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg Grandpa Walton,Peter Bradshaw,2019-10-23T00:00:16+0100,"So in Terminator’s beginning is his end and in his time-travel action franchise is the ending that brings him back round to another beginning: basically replaying the famous elements from T1 and T2 with some new actors, new twists, newish attitudes to sexual politics, famous lines slightly changed (“Come with me or you’ll be dead in 30 seconds”) and with Arnie himself good-humouredly assuming a wise old-timer attitude, like a cyborg Grandpa Walton.The Terminator franchise has come clanking robotically into view once again with its sixth film – it absolutely will not stop – not merely repeating itself but somehow repeating the repetitions. Terminator: Dark Fate is co-produced by its original creator, James Cameron, who has also co-written the story. It’s that type of late-period action movie we have seen with Sly Stallone’s Rocky and Rambo properties: a kind of endstopped reboot, which gives the series a new lick of paint, younger cast members, a sprinkling of up-to-the-minute social touches, while also conveying a solemn finality, as if graciously acknowledging its own classic status – though certainly keeping the door open for more films.So much has happened since Cameron’s sci-fi action classic from 1984 made a mainstream icon and star of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The 1991 sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day – although in my view lacking the steely clarity and force of the original – was dynamically filmed and a huge smash. Then we had a tiresome run of rusty turkeys on a laborious back-to-the-future theme: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Salvation (2009) – without Arnie – and the irritatingly spelt Terminator Genisys (2015). In the course of all this, Schwarzenegger found time for a brief tenure as governor of California and Christian Bale, playing freedom fighter John Connor in Terminator Salvation, became notorious for an on-set rage-filled meltdown, tape-recorded and uploaded to the web.But now we are in Mexico, close to the Texas border, almost three decades on from the second Terminator, where smart young auto worker Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) finds herself being menaced by a terrifying humanoid-robotic figure who descends naked to Earth in a crackle of lightning in the time-honoured manner: Gabriel Luna has the stern but featureless T2-ish role of the Terminator-Who-Disappointingly-Isn’t-Arnie. But then another figure comes down to Earth stark naked and is apparently on Dani’s side: this is Grace (Mackenzie Davis): a female equivalent of the gallant Kyle Reese from the first film. Then the legendary figure of Sarah Connor herself, played by Linda Hamilton, appears with some heavy weaponry, also intent on saving young Dani, and she is not the only one who is to be on her side. It won’t be long before the great Austrian-American appears, the Terminator ancestor, now living incognito like someone in a witness protection programme, and pretending to be a curtain-fitter called Carl. It’s a pretty droll appearance for the great man.So you don’t need an MA in terminatorology studies to figure out that this Dani is someone destined to be of enormous importance to the humans’ resistance uprising against their future oppression by the Skynet tyranny. But wait. Wasn’t that supposed to have been forestalled by Sarah Connor’s heroic efforts? Erm, yeah, but then there was a new oppression from some machines called Legion. Oh.Basically, Arnold is called upon to reprise a character I always thought was fundamentally wrong: the nice Terminator, the Terminator on the side of the angels, although Hamilton’s Sarah Connor has some fierce dialogue scenes with him, unconvinced that he can be anything other than evil. It’s good to see Hamilton getting a robust role, although, sadly, she has to concede badass superiority to Davis. This sixth Terminator surely has to be the last. Yet the very nature of the Terminator story means that going round and round in existential circles comes with the territory."
Jennifer Aniston’s daily schedule: a 16-hour fast – and celery juice as a treat,"The star’s wellbeing secrets include fasting, meditation and five workouts a week. But when does she have fun?",,2019-10-22T13:05:38+0100,"Name: Jennifer Aniston.Age: 50.Appearance: Almost the same.Almost the same as what? Almost the same as how she looked 20 years ago, when she was starring in the hit series Friends, according to MailOnline.Amazing. What is the secret of her youthful appearance? Not eating.That doesn’t sound ideal at all. Well, more specifically, she’s adopted an “intermittent fasting” regime, more commonly known as the 16:8 diet.Is it like the 5:2 diet, except you starve for 16 days and then binge for 8 days? No, in this case the numbers represent hours. “I noticed a big difference in going without solid food for 16 hours,” Aniston told the Radio Times.Sixteen hours without food? By the time you’re allowed to eat, it would be past your bedtime! Fortunately, your sleeping hours are counted as part of the fasting period. You just have to delay breakfast until 10am.I could probably just stay in bed until then, as long as I were allowed to eat what I liked afterwards. You eat anything, but you must stop by 5 or 6pm, when the fasting begins anew.And does it actually keep you young? Who knows. Some people believe it is supposed to keep you slim, improve blood sugar control, boost brain function and increase life expectancy.You know what’s guaranteed to make you feel old? Eating dinner at 5pm. Most intermittent fasters prefer the more convenient 12 to 8 eating window, but 10 to 6 is considered optimal.Optimally joyless, do you mean? Obviously Aniston isn’t completely rigid about the whole thing. She has a “cheat” day once a week where she treats herself outside fasting hours.And what does she have? Celery juice.She treats herself to a celery juice? What an example to us all. Indeed she is.I was being sarcastic. She is certainly an example to Reese Witherspoon, her co-star in the new series The Morning Show. “Jen knows so much about health and fitness that I always defer to her,” she told the Radio Times. “She’s great at wellbeing advice.”Is there more to her wellbeing regime? In addition to fasting, Jen does meditation, followed by five workouts per week. Witherspoon, the swot, manages six.I don’t understand how these people find time in their schedule to get drunk. They don’t need to get drunk; they get high on being a better person than you.Do say: “Fasting, meditation, exercise: what a great way to use up the hours between now and death.”Don’t say: “Focus, Jen. It’s nearly 6pm, and this box of doughnuts isn’t going to eat itself.”"
We should feel sorry for Jared Leto. His Joker never had a chance,The actor’s Suicide Squad character had been sidelined long before Todd Phillips’s film starring Joaquin Phoenix as Batman’s arch enemy was greenlit,Ben Child,2019-10-22T13:21:45+0100,"Would it really be surprising that Jared Leto had tried to stop Todd Phillips’s Joker from being made? This is what a piece in the Hollywood Reporter suggests, though the claim is said to have been denied by a representative for Leto and by Warner Bros.It might seem ridiculous to fans that a film that has taken more than $700m (£541m) at the global box office and (at least initially) wowed critics could have been swatted from the schedules at the whim of an actor who barely appeared as the clown prince of Gotham in 2016’s Suicide Squad. And yet that would be to forget the circumstances in which Leto found himself cast as Batman’s nemesis five years ago, and was subsequently thrown to the slavering hounds by Warner Bros.In 2014, when the studio announced that Leto was to star as the Joker, the actor-turned-musician had just won his first Oscar, for playing a transgender drug addict in Jean-Marc Vallée’s Dallas Buyers Club. Before this, he had hardly acted for five years, preferring to focus on his suddenly successful rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars. By all accounts, Leto was choosing roles very carefully during this period, so it came as a shock (and coup for Warner Bros) when he was announced as the world’s most infamous supervillain.By all accounts, Leto threw himself into the role with method mania, reportedly sending a letter and video to fellow stars apologising for not joining them for early rehearsals, accompanying his missive with a live rat for Margot Robbie (his on-screen paramour, Harley Quinn), some bullets for Will Smith (Deadshot) and a dead pig for the entire cast. Warner suits, aware of the potency such a blend of recent Oscar-winner and iconic role would bring to the table, must have been head over heels at the publicity.With all this fuss, fans expected Leto’s Joker to emerge as the leader of the Suicide Squad, a gang of colourful Dirty Dozen-style supervillain miscreants put together by questionable authorities (Viola Davies’s Amanda Waller) to take down an even worse threat: Cara Delevingne’s acting. We will never know quite what the original plan was, but when David Ayer’s film finally emerged, Leto was reduced to a bit-part player. A bit of torture here and there, some hanging around with Harley in nightclubs, and then completely absent from the movie’s main narrative.The Oscar winner could perhaps have been forgiven for thinking that this would never have happened in the 70s. Imagine if Robert De Niro had gained 60 pounds for Raging Bull, only to be told that his scenes had been excised. Then imagine the shock when Warner green-lit a Joker origins movie starring Joaquin Phoenix as a completely different version of the supervillain. This was precisely the kind of movie Leto probably thought he was going to be making at some point when he signed on to play the part. The dream opportunity to get under the character’s powder-caked skin.Leto had every chance to assume he'd be playing the Joker in further movies – otherwise why cast him in the first place?This kind of thing would never have happened at Marvel, either. The last time a star was cast in a big role at the Disney-owned studio, then kicked to the kerb, was 2010, when it was announced that Ed Norton, the somewhat sickly green giant in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk, would not reprise the role in The Avengers (unless one counts Terrence Howard’s replacement by Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes in 2010’s Iron Man 2, reportedly over pay). Leto had every chance to assume he would be playing the Joker in further movies over the next decade – otherwise why cast him in the first place?Thanks to Warner’s chaotic approach to comic-book world building, that never happened. The Hollywood Reporter now suggests Leto-Joker is done as a going concern, something that ought to have been pretty obvious as soon as James Gunn’s Suicide Squad 2 and Cathy Yan’s Birds of Prey were announced without the actor’s involvement. In any case, neither movie had an obvious place for the cackling villain, so it would not be a surprise to learn that Leto turned them down – perhaps fearing a repeat of earlier experiences.Phillips’s Joker is the movie Leto really needed to showcase his talents and begin developing a multi-movie character arc, but Phoenix was handed the role instead. The whole thing smacks of terrible planning. Like the unfortunate Arthur Fleck himself in Phillips’s film, it seems Leto never really had a chance."
Life in the 'hairy underground': the lost history of Soviet hippies,"It was a subculture shaped by communism, inspired by the west – and watched by the KGB. Now, a new documentary charts the movement’s charismatic leaders, conflicts and future",Luke Harding,2019-10-23T06:00:45+0100,"In 1968, Aksel Lampmann was a teenager growing up in Soviet Estonia. That summer, he went to an international camp, where he met students from Czechoslovakia and began listening to the Beatles. He didn’t understand the lyrics (“No one spoke English back then”), but loved the sound. “We had no clue what they were singing about. What a strange vibration!”He learned guitar and grew his hair. By 1969, Lampmann had become a full-blown Soviet hippy. The iron curtain made a road trip to the US impossible, so he hitchhiked from his home in the Baltics to Crimea. “Our lives were more colourful, more alive,” he says. “Other people didn’t have the same encounters or emotions.”Lampmann is one of the stars of Soviet Hippies, a film by the Estonian writer and director Terje Toomistu about a lost period in Soviet history. The documentary explores a subculture that was inspired by the west yet distinctly homegrown – existing in a society shaped by communism and watched over by the KGB.“In the west, nobody was arrested simply for having long hair or wearing strange clothes,” Toomistu explains. The USSR, by contrast, wanted complete control of its citizens’ lives: how people worked, dressed, or even danced. Anyone who rejected the Homo sovieticus model could be in “big trouble”, including having their hair forcibly cut.The Soviet hippy movement emerged in Moscow and Leningrad around 1966 and 1967, in the early years of Leonid Brezhnev’s rule. The first red hippies were the sons or daughters of the privileged Soviet nomenklatura – well-behaved kids from elite families. They had access to music from the capitalist world and to jeans. By the early 70s, the movement had grown sufficiently big and unruly to alarm the authorities – though it probably only ever numbered a few thousand, Toomistu says. The secret police began tailing the long-haired to school. In June 1971, the hippies were given permission to demonstrate against the Vietnam war outside the US embassy in Moscow.This was a trap. The KGB rounded up and arrested demonstrators, with the goal of wiping out hippy culture. Some demonstrators were sent to psychiatric facilities and injected with insulin; others dispatched to the army and camps near the Chinese border. The film re-creates this grim clampdown and uses surveillance photos found in KGB archives in Lithuania.According to Lampmann, harassment by the police and KGB was common. “One of my close friends ended up in prison,” he says. Hippies were persecuted under criminal rather than political law. They could find themselves sharing a cell with gangsters and murderers. To avoid arrest, Lampmann always kept his documents in perfect order.By the late 70s, the hippies had developed a counterculture, with Russian slang and a music scene. There was what Toomistu calls “analogue Facebook” – notebooks listing names and numbers of contacts across the USSR, used by travellers seeking somewhere to crash for the night. This network is gloriously animated in the film, which features psychedelic drawings and cartoons.The underground subculture connected people from different social backgrounds, the writer Vladimir Wiedemann says. It included hippies, dissidents, mystics, religious activists and human-rights campaigners. Some embraced spiritualism, others yoga and veganism. All rejected the Soviet regime and thus played a role in its eventual demise.Wiedemann was exposed to rock’n’roll culture via Finnish TV and Radio Luxembourg, which he could pick up from his home in Estonia. “The iron curtain wasn’t that strong,” he says. Now based in London, Wiedemann wrote a book on hippies, Forbidden Union, which is currently running as a play, How Estonian Hippies Brought Down the Soviet Union!, on the Moscow stage...The film features interviews with Wiedemann and other survivors from the “hairy underground”, as Toomistu puts it. Most are men, still espousing hippy ideas and with beards and hair still flowing but grey. There are fewer Soviet female hippies, Toomistu says; many left the scene to have children. The movement’s charismatic leaders are largely dead, often from drink and drugs.These were widely available under Marxism. Forbidden from travelling physically beyond the eastern bloc, Soviet hippies instead became “psychonauts”, Toomistu says. They consumed weed from central Asia and the Caucasus, opium and poppy tea. Some drank Sopals, a Soviet cleaning detergent containing ether.Toomistu grew up in post-Soviet Estonia. She was interested in the hippy scene as a teenager, and was a fan of Jim Morrison. She spent half a year in Russia as a student, and wrote a thesis about memory culture. The idea for the film came together after her own road trip in South America, she says. She is currently completing an anthropology PhD. There is little archive material on communist-era hippies, whom the Soviet press ignored, Toomistu says, erasing them from history. She retrieved a box of video footage of festivals and gatherings from a hippy who had to leave Russia in a hurry. In 2017, several of her subjects went to a hippy reunion held every year at Moscow’s Tsaritsyno Park, to mark the 1971 demo busted by the KGB.The reunion is poignant. Russia’s war in Ukraine and its 2014 annexation of Crimea divided opinion. Some hippies support Vladimir Putin and his idea of a great spiritual Russia. Others take a more traditional pacifist view that all war is bad. The film ends with Putin’s police breaking up the party. It is a metaphor for state-hippy relations, now and then.Soviet Hippies is being screened by Dash Café at Rich Mix, London, on 23 October."
The Rise of Skywalker trailer – five things we learned,"In the final Star Wars movie, Kylo Ren is devilish, Palpatine is spooky, C-3PO pegs out, Jannah leads the charge and Rey sparkles",Jordan Hoffman,2019-10-22T10:51:37+0100,"Back in my day, jocks and nerds didn’t get along much, but it seems such old distinctions are now gone. Making its debut at halftime during Monday Night Football, the final trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker delighted athletes and asthmatics alike. We are all united when it comes to Jedi, droids and Wookiees.The Rise of Skywalker is billed as the culmination of the sequel-trilogy, or non-ology, or whatever you call the main Star Wars storyline. There will be more from the galaxy far, far away (The Mandalorian is just around the corner on Disney’s streaming service) but for material directly connected with George Lucas’s 1977 original, this is it. Or at least until it’s Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the elder statespeople passing the lightsaber to the next generation. (Don’t think that won’t happen.)As the new trailer launched, there were many questions. Is Rey an everywoman, or is she to the cosmic manor born? Will Kylo Ren revert to the light side? Will Finn and Rose live happily ever after? Can Poe Dameron be any more dreamy?And how will Luke Skywalker fit in, now he is dead? How exactly will Emperor Palpatine, AKA Darth Sidious, fit in, since he’s been dead since 1983? How smooth will the repurposed footage of General Leia look, since Carrie Fisher died before production of this movie began? And for the hardcore, is that ship in the background really the Ghost from the animated series Star Wars Rebels? (All signs point to yes.)This is a JJ Abrams film, so zilch of substance was revealed in this latest promo. But here were the five moments where we made noises that most resembled millions of voices crying out in terror (in a good way).The third film in each Star Wars trilogy has, thus far, involved a reversal of what true nerds call alignment. In Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader became good. Yay! In Revenge of the Sith, Anakin Skywalker turned bad. Boo! Will this new one be the tiebreaker? We hope so. And we hope it involves Rey forgiving Kylo Ren his transgressions and the two of them having a big smooch somewhere with the wind blowing her robes and his wavy hair.But until that can happen, there’s going to be some fighting, and it looks like some of that will be on the high seas. Adam Driver looks diabolical emerging from the water and holding his red, cruciform lightsaber like some kind of upside-down trident.Palpatine is back in this new one. How how how? No one saw it coming, so we should have expected it.We’ve yet to see Ian McDiarmid in any of the promotional materials – is it really him, or his Force ghost? – but we’ve heard him laugh and now we’ve heard him say spooky things such as “Long have I waited!” (Never keep McDiarmid standing in a queue; he’s terrifying!) It’s unclear exactly what the Darth Formerly Known As Sidious has been waiting for, but we can guess as to the where: a crazy-looking stone throne that would make even Thanos wince!I thought we had got all the Star Death out of the way with The Last Jedi. Vice-Admiral Holdo sacrificed herself by hyperdriving the Raddus into a fleet of Star Destroyers and Luke Skywalker evaporated after his Force Projection. Then there was Carrie Fisher who actually died. Couldn’t our tear ducts maybe take a movie off?Well, no. I just didn’t think it would be C-3PO, the protocol droid who along with R2-D2 has been in every Star Wars movie thus far, to be the one to go. A solemn farewell moment in this trailer makes it seem as if that’s the case.When George Lucas (remember him?) was first dreaming up these stories (and giving them tongue-twister titles such as Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from The Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars) his influences were varied. Yes, he was reading Joseph Campbell. Yes, he was watching Akira Kurosawa. But he was always inspired by cheap, dopey film serials from the 1940s and earlier. To that end, this shot of our heroes on a fleet of interplanetary horses (they aren’t tauntauns!) really brings it all home. It’s fun to see new character Jannah (Naomi Ackie) leading the charge, and outstanding to see BB-8 zooming alongside them.Each trilogy is about one person’s journey. The prequels were about Anakin, the original trilogy was about Luke and the sequel trilogy is about Rey. The final shot of this trailer, with the digital sparkle added to her eyes (unless Abrams blinded her on set!), is a gorgeous image of a new icon. And the voice from elsewhere in the room (or maybe from beyond) echoes some memorable lines from the first film: “The Force will be with you,” says Luke. “Always,” adds Leia.Excuse me, someone must be chopping up space onions in here!"
Why Joker's depiction of mental illness is dangerously misinformed,"With films playing a key role in shaping attitudes to mental health, two doctors say Joaquin Phoenix’s troubled supervillain perpetuates damaging stereotypes",,2019-10-21T16:04:09+0100,"As junior doctors who work on acute inpatient psychiatric wards, serious mental illness is our daily reality. We have, therefore, watched the controversies around Todd Phillips’s Joker – in which Joaquin Phoenix plays a troubled loner who turns to violence – with professional interest.The film’s dominance in the debate about portrayals of mental illness in the movies comes at a curious time. Recently, we’ve witnessed great leaps of awareness about relatively common mental-health issues such as depression and anxiety, and with that awareness, increasing dismissal of the sort of unhelpful prejudices that used to surround them. These are now readily discussed without shame and often represented in the media with a well-informed grasp of the facts, thanks to effective information campaigns.However, severe mental health conditions, such as psychotic illnesses, remain shrouded in stigma and are consistently misrepresented and misunderstood. Portrayals of mental illness in film can perpetuate unfounded stereotypes and spread misinformation. One of the more toxic ideas that Joker subscribes to is the hackneyed association between serious mental illness and extreme violence. The notion that mental deterioration necessarily leads to violence against others – implied by the juxtaposition of Phoenix’s character Arthur stopping his medication with his increasingly frequent acts of violence – is not only misinformed but further amplifies stigma and fear.Studies show this association is exaggerated and people with severe mental illness are more vulnerable to violence from others than the general population. Interesting, then, that Joker’s earnest attempt to create an empathetic character with mental illness – who writes: “The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t” – contributes to the very prejudice that Arthur longs to evade.Arthur’s supposed loss of grip on reality is suggested by a peppering of nods to psychotic symptoms: delusional ideas of a grandiose nature (“I am an undiscovered comedic genius”) and hallucinations of his neighbour – which are confirmed by his eventual admission to a psychiatric institution. This restoration of order via Arkham Asylum affirms the overarching inference of the film: Arthur’s descent into violence and destruction is triggered by his mental deterioration. The result of this is to – disappointingly – remove Arthur’s agency and divert attention from a potentially more stimulating conversation about wealth inequality and its responsibility for societal collapse.We wouldn’t want to get bogged down in labels, but the psychopathology Arthur inhabits is foggy at best: his apparent lack of disordered thinking means the attempt to illustrate psychosis is half formed. He also displays traits of narcissism and depression. This diagnostic vagueness may create a more relatable character that reflects the pain of any psychiatric illness; but it gives the impression that many disorders have been squashed into a plot device. In the end, it undermines Phoenix’s hypnotic performance and Joker’s sincere attempts to explore the interaction between poverty, inequality and social isolation.Arthur’s chilling quirk – his bursts of incongruous and uncontrolled laughter – is no laughing matter either. Presumably, he suffers from the neurological condition pseudobulbar affect – also known as “emotional incontinence” – perhaps caused by his childhood head trauma. Joker may make an attempt to unpick the difference between the psychiatric and the neurological – between a mental illness and a medical disorder – but it runs the risk of conflating the two with a haunting, stigmatising and problematic image. Whether intentionally or not, Arthur comes across as a hysterically laughing supervillain, stereotypically “mad” to the untrained eye; a murderous clown laughing alone on a bus.Cinematic depictions of mental illness – most infamously, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest – have profound and lasting implications in the real world. It is widely acknowledged within psychiatry that Cuckoo’s Nest led to inappropriate levels of suspicion and misinformation regarding electro-convulsive therapy, and may have meant many people did not receive treatment that is proved and effective. All this due to a single film’s misinformed presentation.Films have the power to perpetuate stigma and fear, which is why the misrepresentation of severe mental illness in Joker should not be dismissed lightly."
Superhero films are 'cynical exercise' to make profits for corporations – Ken Loach,"Director joins Martin Scorsese and Frances Ford Coppola in censuring industry, calling superhero movies commodities ‘like hamburgers’",Andrew Pulver,2019-10-22T11:16:35+0100,"Ken Loach has joined the chorus of auteur directors criticising superhero movies, saying they have “nothing to do with the art of cinema”.Loach spoke to Sky while promoting his new film, Sorry We Missed You, an account of the breadline existence of a gig-economy delivery driver in Newcastle.Loach said of superhero films: “I find them boring. They’re made as commodities … like hamburgers … It’s about making a commodity which will make profit for a big corporation – they’re a cynical exercise. They’re a market exercise and it has nothing to do with the art of cinema.”Loach, who has won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for The Wind That Shakes the Barley and I, Daniel Blake, echoes the sentiments of American directors Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola in criticising blockbuster superhero films. Scorsese called superhero cinema “theme park” films, while Coppola described Marvel as despicable. Directors such as James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Joss Whedon (The Avengers) have defended the genre, with Gunn writing on social media: “Superheroes are simply today’s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers.”"
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: final trailer for ninth film is released,Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher feature in film carrying the tag line: ‘The saga will end. The story lives forever’,Stephanie Convery,2019-10-22T04:35:26+0100,"Fans have waited a long, long time for the Star Wars finale, and it has taken almost as long for them to be treated to the final trailer for the ninth instalment of the saga.With the tag line “The saga will end. The story lives forever”, the trailer promises to close off the narrative that began with rural boy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finding himself caught up in an intergalactic battle in George Lucas’s original, groundbreaking film, A New Hope.On Monday night US time, though, the trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker launched, with tickets going on sale for the last film in the series that has been running since 1977.Since A New Hope, the saga has since spanned two original sequels, three prequels, a full “sequel trilogy” and two “anthology” films, or stand-alone films within more or less the same timeline.The Rise of Skywalker trailer suggests a dramatic ending, because it depicts sweeping shots of battles atop ships on vast raging oceans, characters leaping across canyons in tremendous jungles, teary-eyed close-ups, and of course, lightsabers.Written, directed and produced by JJ Abrams, The Rise of Skywalker stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Lupita Nyong’o, alongside original trilogy cast members Mark Hamill, Ian McDiarmid, and Anthony Daniels as the robot C-3PO.The filmmakers said in May that scenes filmed with original cast member Carrie Fisher, who died in 2016, would be repurposed for The Rise of Skywalker.The film itself will not hit cinemas until 20 December, but fans have been drip-fed a long run of teasers at least since shooting began last year."
Boys Don't Cry at 20: in praise of the divisive transgender drama,"In 1999, Hilary Swank won plaudits for playing Brandon Teena, a murdered trans man, but in the years since, a backlash has been brewing",Guy Lodge,2019-10-22T07:00:55+0100,"By the usual logic of such things, Hilary Swank was not supposed to win the 1999 best actress Oscar. She was 25 years old and relatively unknown, best recognised from undistinguished roles in The Next Karate Kid and Beverly Hills 90210. She was up against the never-awarded Hollywood royal Annette Bening, who had a juicy, grandly entertaining role in the Academy’s favourite film of the year, American Beauty – which just happened to win every other major category it was up for that night. Swank’s film, Boys Don’t Cry, was only up for two acting prizes, and even those nominations counted as hard-fought victories for a tough $2m indie on the subject of transgender hate crime, that had to make judicious edits to avoid a commercially crippling NC-17 rating.Bening had won the cliquier Screen Actors Guild award, often a harbinger of Oscar victory. Yet when Swank prevailed in what had been a tight months-long race, confidently taking the stage to accept her statuette from a happily baffled Roberto Benigni, no one was especially surprised. Because sometimes, amid the politics and strategy of awards campaign season, a certain level of performance cannot be denied – and Swank’s astonishing, bone-deep portrayal of Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old Nebraskan trans man gang-raped and murdered in 1993 by several male acquaintances when his transgender identity was revealed, was such an achievement.Swank’s performance entailed, of course, the kind of all-in physical commitment that tends to wow Oscar voters – though it was a transformation dependent on inside-out understanding of the character rather than prosthetics. With cropped hair and a slouchy denim-and-plaid wardrobe emphasising the androgynous beauty in her tough features, she controlled the calculated, rangy swagger in her body language to tilt Teena’s masculine-feminine presence in either direction from scene to scene; her voice was similarly deepened and elasticised, its studiously maintained huskiness occasionally betrayed by spontaneous quivers and leaps when Teena’s true emotions surged.Swank may not have been fully convincing as a man, but that was the point. Her Teena was inexperienced in the role himself, feeling his way through it as restless hormones rattled within him; he desperately wanted his gender to transcend performance, and Swank’s own acting was attuned to the difficulties of the transition. Audiences had rarely seen a performance along these lines, at a time when gender identity crisis was mostly presented in cinema in flatter dress-up terms, as opposed to a more interior study of a soul at war with a body. The Academy certainly hadn’t: awarding a supporting actress Oscar to Linda Hunt, adept but essentially stunt-cast in the role of a cisgender male Chinese photographer in The Year of Living Dangerously was as adventurous as they had previously been in the gender-confusion department. (The yellowface nature of the role, meanwhile, didn’t exactly make it a progressive milestone.)The mainstream media conversation around transgender representation was, to say the least, a lot less evolved in 1999 than it was in 2019 – so much less so, in fact, that Swank using male pronouns to pay tribute to Teena in her acceptance speech actually sparked a flurry of public debate. (Teena’s mother JoAnn was unimpressed, insisting her child “pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her”.) Reports circulated of uncomfortable laughter and jeering at the film’s love scenes: the Chicago critic Nick Davis recalls that even Teena’s final rape and murder met with mirth at his youth-populated campus screening. Pierce’s film was uncompromising in its presentation of transgender identity as difficult, untidy, as internally confusing to the person inside the body as those outside of it. Swank’s performance was haunting in its self-alienation, and occasionally euphoric in its palpable sense of discovery – the actor’s, one sensed, as much as the character’s.You need only compare Boys Don’t Cry to a more recent Oscar winner, Tom Hooper’s vapidly prettified The Danish Girl – in which Eddie Redmayne’s preening transgender artist Lili Elbe appears to find her identity through the simple thrill of rolling on a pair of stockings – to see how relatively unusual the complex, conflicted empathy of Kimberly Pierce’s film still is in mainstream LGBTQ cinema.The Danish Girl came in for a lot of stick from transgender activists, many of whom protested the casting of a cis male actor in the role of a trans woman. Boys Don’t Cry was accused of exploitation in its day too, and has retrospectively received increased criticism over Swank’s casting: indeed, given the sensitivity and conscientiousness of Pierce’s perspective, it seems unlikely that the film would be equivalently cast today. The grievance is understandable: Swank managed to persuasively slip into a tortured skin and slip out of it again, winning a best actress Oscar that, by its very category title, fully affirmed her feminine identity and launched her career as an A-list leading lady who would win another Oscar (this time playing a cis woman, albeit in the butch realm of female boxing) five years later. The prizes for Boys Don’t Cry may have honored Brandon Teena’s legacy, but the happy ending was Swank’s, not his.Yet it would be a mistake to politely sideline Boys Don’t Cry as another miscalculated, progressive-for-its-time casualty of cancel culture. Pierce’s film was hard enough to get made as it was, while the director has explained how she considered various actors across the gender spectrum before settling on Swank’s soulful, anxious imperfection in the part. Boys Don’t Cry was, for many viewers, an introductory text in the understanding of transgender identity; its deep, protective but unsentimental love for Brandon Teena helps it remain one today, however differently it might be made now. “We have come a long way,” Swank said at the outset of her Oscar acceptance speech, striking a note of proud defiance that didn’t immediately endear her to the Hollywood crowd that prefers gushing, weepy gratitude from its starlets. She was right, of course, however much further we’ve come since."
Francis Ford Coppola: Scorsese was being kind – Marvel movies are despicable,"The Godfather director joins in criticism of superhero films, while Guardians of the Galaxy’s James Gunn hits back at out-of-touch geniuses",Catherine Shoard,2019-10-21T11:52:26+0100,"The director of The Godfather and Apocalypse Now has joined Martin Scorsese in dismissing the dominant series of superhero films.Speaking to journalists in Lyon following his acceptance of the Prix Lumière for his contribution to cinema, Francis Ford Coppola, 80, said: “When Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he’s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration.”Coppola continued: “I don’t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again. Martin was kind when he said it’s not cinema. He didn’t say it’s despicable, which I just say it is.”Scorsese’s initial comments, in which he said films made by Marvel Studios, the Disney offshoot responsible for the Avengers movies, were “not cinema”, prompted a considerable backlash from directors including James Gunn, Joss Whedon, Kevin Smith and Taika Waititi.The director of GoodFellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and forthcoming mafia epic The Irishman reiterated his feelings last weekend at the London film festival, saying superhero films were “invading” cinema, which increasingly resembled a “theme park”.During his David Lean lecture on 12 October, Scorsese said: “Theatres have become amusement parks. That is all fine and good, but don’t invade everything else in that sense. That is fine and good for those who enjoy that type of film and, by the way, knowing what goes into them now, I admire what they do. It’s not my kind of thing, it simply is not. It’s creating another kind of audience that thinks cinema is that.” Many of our grandfathers thought all gangster movies were the same, often calling them “despicable”. Some of our great grandfathers thought the same of westerns, and believed the films of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone were all exactly the same. I remember a great uncle to whom I was raving about Star Wars. He responded by saying, “I saw that when it was called 2001, and, boy, was it boring!” Superheroes are simply today’s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers. Some superhero films are awful, some are beautiful. Like westerns and gangster movies (and before that, just MOVIES), not everyone will be able to appreciate them, even some geniuses. And that’s okay. ❤️A post shared by  James Gunn (@jamesgunn) on Oct 20, 2019 at 11:51am PDTGunn also responded to Coppola’s attack on the genre for which he has become famous. Writing on Instagram, the director of Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel tacitly accused both Scorsese and Coppola of being out of touch and insufficiently open-minded. “Not everyone will be able to appreciate [superhero films],” he wrote, “even some geniuses.”"
Jenny Slate: 'I find myself dressing like characters from The Wind in the Willows',The actor and standup on changing her outfit twice a day and why she loves brushing her hair out like Diane von Furstenberg,Leah Harper,2019-10-22T11:32:10+0100,"This picture was taken in downtown Soho, New York, and I’m wearing a large, striped, mohair sweater and booties, both from Acne, with Jesse Kamm jeans and a vintage silk blouse. I love this outfit because it has elements of style that make me feel mature and the pieces are by really imaginative designers. I don’t have a problem with spending money on more expensive items as long as I am buying them to feel good and provided they will last me quite a while.I’m a petite person and I love wearing oversized items in an effort to be both comfortable and chic. Sometimes I change my outfit a couple of times a day depending on how I feel or how I want to feel. There was quite a while when I dressed monochromatically; my personality is very colourful and I felt there were many different tones happening at once. I tend to be a pretty frenetic thinker – I scale emotional heights and dip to emotional lows many times a day just as part of being a live human person – so it felt very good to dress in one colour. It meant that at least one thing about me was very simple and straightforward and complete. I stopped dressing monochromatically almost a year ago when I realised that I wanted to be what I am, and not always try to control it. Occasionally, however, I still feel the need to dress in just one colour, and now I know that move is available to me.I am a fan of miniskirts, silk patterned dresses and things that might be seen as more traditionally femme. But I really like wearing outfits where I feel I am separated from qualifications that are put on gender. I love vintage Katharine Hepburn, as well as Hepburn later in her life and what she wears in the movie On Golden Pond. I’m from Massachusetts, and love a tweed and a nubby wool. Right now I find myself trying to dress like characters in The Wind in the Willows – I really like those natural tones. There have been times when my fashion inspiration was Carmen Miranda or Fiona Apple, but at the moment I am drawn towards more earthy colours. I’m also really into brushing my hair out like Diane von Furstenberg – that is so luscious."
Uniqlo accused of mocking wartime sexual slavery victims,Japanese clothing company pulls advertisement from South Korean TV after outcry,Justin McCurry,2019-10-21T09:09:04+0100,"The Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo has pulled an ad from South Korean TV after it was accused of mocking victims of wartime sexual slavery.The company said it had stopped airing the 15-second ad after critics pointed out that the Korean-language subtitles appeared to question the testimony of women who said they were forced to work in Japanese military brothels across Asia before and during the second world war.The decision comes after months of diplomatic wrangling between Tokyo and Seoul over the countries’ bitter wartime legacy. The dispute began after a South Korean supreme court ruling last year ordering Japanese companies to compensate Koreans forced to work in Japanese mines and factories when the Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony. But Japan insists that all compensation claims were settled by a postwar peace treaty.The decision triggered a trade spat that has since spread to the tourism sector, and even preparations for next summer’s Tokyo Olympics.In the ad, the 97-year-old model Iris Apfel is asked by the 13-year-old designer Kheris Rogers how she dressed when she was her age. Apfel replies: “I can’t remember that far back.” But the version with Korean subtitles gave Apfel’s reply as: “Oh my God, how can I remember what happened more than 80 years ago?”The Korea Herald said some viewers interpreted the time reference as an attempt to ridicule former sex slaves and forced labourers, whose recollections of abuses have been questioned by rightwing politicians and academics in Japan.In response, Uniqlo pulled the ad in South Korea and from its YouTube account days after it first appeared, but said it had not intended to cause offence.“The advertisement in question is a part of a global advertisement series to mark the 25th anniversary of fleece and it has no links to any political or religious agendas, belief or organisations, but we decided to stop airing the ad as we take it seriously that many people felt uncomfortable,” Uniqlo said.It said the Korean-language subtitles had been worded that way to highlight the age gap between Apfel and Rogers.Some historians say the Japanese imperial army coerced or tricked as many as 200,000 women and girls – most of them from Korea – to serve in frontline brothels.Uniqlo, which has 186 stores in South Korea, was already among several high-profile targets of a South Korean boycott of Japanese goods."

I was sort of an only child.We had a lovely family, but we weren’t very worldly. We travelled in England: Dorset in the summer, weekends in Derbyshire. I came home once and said, “Dad, I really like Jacques Anquetil,” the famous French cyclist, and my father said, “What are those words?”I’ve never been a reader. We never really had books in the house. And I’m dyslexic, so I’m not good at concentrating. It would have been nicer to have had a better education. I left school at 15, and I was really not very good at school. I can’t even remember going to school.Do I feel old? I went to buy a croissant recently and they wouldn’t take money from me. Only plastic. That made me feel 194 years old.Anybody who says they don’t mind getting older is telling porky pies. Of course you mind. Your body deteriorates. You ache and ache. You’re nearer the dreaded day. Luckily I’ve still got the legs of a teenager.I’m a happy person. I’m very optimistic. Every day is a new beginning. I don’t get depressed. I get disappointed by behaviour, mainly with all the madness going on in the world. Politics. Dictatorships.We’re divided at the moment. So much of that is because populist leaders say things people want to hear. “I’m going to open 400 schools and they’ll all be free!” Obviously that’s not true. But so many people believe them. I’ve been with my wife Pauline since I was 21. We’ve been together since 1967. What’s the secret? Give and take. Learning to listen. Learning to be interested and interesting. Fun. A good sense of humour. No big egos. Just normalness, really.I’m well known in certain circles, but I don’t think I’m famous. I’m not impressed by fame or money. To put it another way: what’s the thing I’m most pleased with about the business? Continuity – always being relevant.Pauline’s the cook and she’s a great cook. I mean, I can rustle things up – toast, beans on toast. But really I’m head of washing up and cleaning the surfaces.Next year is the 50th anniversary of Paul Smith.

On the trail of garage sale bargains: 'I see this as a political act. It’s taking our power back',Feelings of ‘stuffocation’ and a yearning for connection are feeding the share economy … along with the hunt for a perfect Halloween costume,Clare Press,2019-10-22T04:00:49+0100,"Lindy Baker describes herself as “on a mission to minimise but determined not to throw things away”. She is enjoying the sunshine outside her Darlinghurst terrace on day two of her sale. Her front fence doubles duty as a clothes rack and a table displays bric-a-brac, kitchenalia and costume jewellery.Her motivations are political as well as practical. Baker is an Italian translator and artist who used to be a coordinator for the Sydney Democracy Network. “We need to find new ways of accessing and entering the share economy, because our current consumerist culture is weighing too heavily on the environment,” she says.“I’m interested in how society can cut down on waste across the board, avoiding plastic packaging, recycling more. City of Sydney now picks up e-waste, so I’ve booked that in, and I’ve finally found a home for a massive pile of sewing fabric I’ve been hoarding.“It’s a work in progress, a mindset. Even though a lot of my stuff was secondhand in the first place, I still have too much. A garage sale is one of a few different solutions.”At the weekend more than 18,000 Australian households registered garage sales as part of the Garage Sale Trail. Some were driven by more than just the urge to purge and earn a bit of cash – they speak of environmental motivations, promoting the share economy and rebelling against the constant pressure to consume.“We have to find ways to cycle clothes, furniture, objects, anything useful, through multiple owners,” Baker says.She clearly has an eye for design, but she’s not much of an entrepreneur if these prices are anything to go by. A terracotta plate costs a buck. “It’s not about the money,” she says, pausing to sell a vintage silk scarf with hand-rolled edges and a striped straw hat for $14. “The unwritten rule we have on this street [is] that if there’s something decent in your house that you don’t want any more, you put it out the front for anyone to take.”A yard sale is more social. “I do think there’s a community-building aspect,” Baker says. “I just met a woman who lives two doors down. She’s been here 15 years and I’ve been here five but we hadn’t spoken. She wanted to buy a cup – I gave it to her.”The day before Baker sold a hammer to another woman from the neighbourhood she hadn’t met previously. “She came back again today and bought a rug. We were chatting so long I invited her round for drinks. The unexpected joy of this has been the fun conversations. But isn’t that what people everywhere have always loved about shopping?”It’s an experience you wouldn’t have in a mall, she notes. “I do see this as a political act. It’s taking our power back.”A young woman in denim cutoffs and an embroidered white linen blouse stops to look at a set of five 1970s kitchen canisters illustrated with vegetables – $5 for the lot. She’s Lizzy Logan, a Legal Aid lawyer. What is it about the canisters? “I have stuff like this,” she says. “They would match well with my decor. My personal style and home reflect each other.”“A friend salvaged them from a council clean-up,” Baker says. “You’d be amazed what people chuck out. Actually, they match your top.”Logan bought the blouse for $15 at another garage sale on Saturday – “from these two older women, a travel writer and a food writer. They were selling books and clothes they’d picked up on their travels.” Logan has been thrifting since she was a teenager in Brisbane.“I like the individuality of the pieces. I have quite a conservative, traditional career and thrifting is a creative outlet for me. But there’s also this other side of it – I feel strongly that we should use what’s already in existence.”The best thing she ever found? “Classic Ferragamo court shoes from an op shop in Brisbane for about $20. Honestly, you can thrift anything.”Nearby, 15 sellers have set up in Darlinghurst public school. One man smiles valiantly above a stash of DVDs – it looks as though Netflix has destroyed his market – but it’s mostly kids’ toys and approachable fashion here. Mostly.Alex Riggs is selling some high-ticket items. She could probably get a better return on one of a growing number of high-end luxury resale sites, or the consignment store up the road. She agrees, but this was something they wanted to do as a family.The DVD guy is her brother; her 13-year-old nephew has a stall too. “We all went to the climate strike together,” Riggs says. “It’s the younger generation who are leading this movement, they’re asking questions about environmental impact and ethics. It doesn’t just wash over these kids – they really take it on board.”Her mother, Freida Riggs, is also here, selling clothes and accessories. “Fashion is about self-expression, not about status,” the retired academic says. “Who cares if you bought something new or not? What I care about is the shapes, colours, the stories behind clothes, and I don’t want to dress like a granny.”She sells a necklace for $15 to Cassy Cochrane, a drama teacher.“It’s nice to see it go to someone who appreciates it, and to meet that person,” Freida says. “I do send clothes to charity, but you never know who gets them, do you?”Cochrane is a vintage clothes collector. “I love clothes swaps,” she says. “I started doing them I was a student in New Zealand. We’d throw the tarp down on our back lawn in Wellington, everyone would bring their loot, it became a party. I still have them now that I’m 50. It’s awesome, what happens when you take money out of the equation.”Thirteen-year-old Olivia Solomon says she and her friends swap their clothes and haunt op shops. ““This T-shirt I’ve got on cost $2 and it’s not mine anyway,” she says. “I can’t afford to buy fast fashion, but I wouldn’t really want to anyway.”Olivia is looking for something to wear to a Halloween party and decides on a thrifted black velvet shift dress for $5. “Halloween is so gross with everyone buying plastic outfits from costume shops, and they’re not even that cheap. Some of them are $35.“Why this dress? It fits me. I love the velvet, and I can wear it again. I’ll do my makeup white. I’m going as a goth.”The frock’s previous owner is Jess Taylor, a marine biologist: “I bought it for a few dollars in an op shop, thinking maybe I could fit it, but it’s actually a child’s size. I got it home and realised that’s never going to happen.”Did she ever consider throwing it away? “What? No way. That’s wasteful. I’m all about conservation and looking after our natural world. I couldn’t throw something out if it had possible value for someone else. With clothes, it’s also about workmanship – someone had to sew that dress.“Everything I’m wearing is secondhand, actually, except for my shoes. Consumer choices matter. Our choices feed the market, what we want becomes what’s available, so if we change what we want then the market will change. Although ultimately I think government regulation is the thing that will really save us.”"
Palazzo of dreams,Living above Leonardo’s Milanese vineyard is a constant source of inspiration for fashion designer Massimo Alba,Scarlett Conlon,2019-10-19T16:00:28+0100,"Not many people can say that they share an address with Leonardo da Vinci, but Massimo Alba can. The fashion designer’s Milan apartment is part of the Casa degli Atellani, an elegant palazzo and one of the city’s most celebrated museums. It is also home to the vineyard gifted to da Vinci by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Maria Sforza, in 1498.“Every time I come home, I feel privileged to be living in this terrific place, surrounded by good energy,” says Alba as he leads the way through the museum to the garden where the Renaissance artist tended to his vines.Alba’s home, which he shares with his wife Marilena and their 14-year-old son, Nicolò, is situated on the first floor, but our tour starts in the sun-dappled gardens. Alba is keen to highlight the harmonious juxtaposition between past and present that inspires not only his work but his apartment, too. The 59-year old designer and his family moved here shortly after their home on the island of Ischia was destroyed by the 2017 earthquake. They had already sold their other two properties in and around Milan to raise capital to set up his eponymous label, so when the Casa degli Atellani’s current owners, the Portaluppi family, suggested Alba rented one of the storied dwellings, the family saw it as an opportunity to start their next chapter.“You don’t really own things [in life], only emotions,” reflects Alba, explaining that no longer being a proprietor – much like running his independent brand – makes him feel, “in a funny way, free”.The apartment is peppered with mementos from the past. When you step into the apartment you’re met with a treasure “from a lifetime ago”: an exquisite Tibetan chest that sits beneath a high ceiling. Beyond is an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living area with a retro floor-to-ceiling shelving system that acts as a room divider.Taking centre stage, the shelving unit is covered in dog-eared paperbacks piled high, unframed canvases, souvenirs, family photographs, hand-written notes, candlesticks, paperweights and small vintage lamps picked up at markets and auctions. It acts as a captivating storyboard of lives spent and shared.So, too, the artwork that covers the walls. Black and white photography and abstract oil paintings by Lillian Bassman, Kenro Izu, Evelyn Hofer and François Berthoud sit on floating shelves along one wall that stretches the length of the apartment. Meanwhile, giant scenes by French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier and the Sicilian photographer Ferdinando Scianna stand side by side on the floor next to a small sculpted chair by Tom Dixon.On the opposite wall, giant windows frame the view of the Santa Maria delle Grazie church across the road where da Vinci, commissioned by Sforza, painted The Last Supper in 1498, where it still hangs to this day.“In a certain way, our home is a melting pot, everything is slightly different, from a different place in time,” says Alba. As with the collections that he and Marilena design to be seasonless, comfortable and worn with everything else in your wardrobe, his home is a holistic extension of that. “We never look at each item; we look at the way items work with other items. We don’t want to change every season – we want to follow our inner voice and instinct.”Many of the pieces have sentimental value. Midcentury chairs by Danish and Italian designers including Hans Wegner and Gio Ponti are decorated with cushions Alba had embroidered by his friend, the artist Roberto Reale. They read: “Happiness is not in another place but in this place, not in another hour, but in this hour,” and “Hello there.” A lampshade also features needlework by Reale that reads: “M’illumino d’immenso.” It translates as: “I flood myself with the light of the immense,” and is a quote from the late Italian modernist poet Giuseppe Ungaretti, whose poetry Alba’s son was recently studying at school.Tibetan rugs, which overlap each other across the floor, have been hand-painted by Alba – himself a keen artist whose line of painted handkerchiefs has become a signature of his brand. Beds are draped in blankets he designed with the Scottish cashmere company Begg & Co. The kitchen, where I’m told generous servings of pasta and wine are served up for regular dinner-party guests, is decorated with classic Sicilian head vases, vintage mismatched glassware and family relics passed down from parents.“Personally, I like it when things from different times become friends and live together – something from the 50s, something from the 30s,” explains Alba. “I really feel it’s home. I feel close to everything I like.”Warm and inviting, it’s a home that is lived in, not looked at; the kind of space that speaks style and whispers “well-travelled” with a curiosity in every corner and a cup of coffee on the table.It’s kept feeling cosy by the walls and ceilings which are the same shade of matt grey throughout. They were done this way, says Alba, so that the rooms not only “become circular” and create intimacy but also complement the view of Santa Maria delle Grazie. It brings the outside in – as do the pots of Monstera deliciosa, along with unidentified succulents and vases of wild eucalyptus.One of the most memorable pieces from Alba’s home is a glass sculpture of a salmon by the glass artist Hugh Findletar, which Alba says he was drawn to “because salmon swim against the tide”. In creating this very personal space inside this world-famous landmark, Alba and his family have created a Renaissance of their own."
The label of fable: tales from Aesop skincare,"Offbeat, indie brand Aesop’s first book is the story of a man on a mission…",,2019-10-20T10:00:53+0100,"Many of the stories in cult skincare brand Aesop’s new book have an element of charm that suggests they’ve taken more inspiration from the famous Greek storyteller than just his name. There’s the tale of emptying bagfuls of fallen leaves over the floors of select Aesop stores in autumn, to herald the change in seasons, or the description of the entrance to the Nakameguro store in Tokyo, hand-washed each morning with hot water and eucalyptus oil for the sensorial pleasure of passersby. It’s all true – beautiful photographs by Yutaka Yamamoto, printed full-bleed across the thick, matte pages of the book, prove it – yet these actions seem almost implausibly painstaking and poetic for a company that boasts more than 230 stores and 90 department store counters, as well as employing around 2,300 staff globally. But that’s what makes Aesop so intriguing: somehow this brand with the offbeat, indie mindset has managed to maintain an under-the-radar feel despite being on pretty much everyone’s radar.Aesop began in 1987 when founder Dennis Paphitis opened his Melbourne hair salon, Emeis, and started blending essential oils into hair products. Trial samples were developed for customers, demand grew and then, in 1989, owing to the phonetic similarity of “Emeis” to a rather more established beauty brand, the nascent company was rechristened Aesop – to gently mock cosmetics brands’ often outlandish claims. Several years ago, Paphitis sold Aesop to Brazilian company Natura Cosmeticos, but he maintains an advisory role.Having started with four products, Aesop’s range now comprises almost 100, with one Parsley Seed Anti-Oxidant Serum sold every nine minutes, and a handwash and hand balm duo a staple in hipster restaurant toilets. Formulations combine both natural and laboratory-made ingredients and are renowned for their lingering herbal scents, with many focusing on elevating banal daily routines into something sensuous. A hand sanitiser smells of cedar, rosemary and mandarin; a toothpaste tastes of anise and spearmint. When I ask Paphitis about prices – the Hand Balm is, in its coveted 500ml size, £70 – he is unperturbed. “Critics are at liberty to use other products, there is no justification required,” he says. “We make exceptional products with great care and attention.”Aesop certainly marches to the beat of its own drum when it comes to product development, too. While beauty companies generally launch things on a monthly, sometimes weekly, basis, Aesop launches them simply when they are ready. The brand was also ahead of the curve with packaging, skipping “useless, wasteful” outer cartons at a time when cellophane-wrapped boxes were standard. The newly green-aware beauty industry is only making the switch now.The brand’s typographic labels – they use black Helvetica and Optima Medium fonts on amber bottles – have become something of a design phenomenon. “The packaging was never intended to resonate in the way that it has,” he says. “Our aesthetic signature evolved as a simple, utilitarian response to communicating clearly, with minimal visual distractions.”Incidental it may be, but the packaging is part of the reason for Aesop’s cult status, embellishing its reputation as an arbiter of good taste. I’ve known people to refill their empty Aesop hand wash bottles with cheaper soap once it runs out. While many brands tweak their packaging regularly to keep customers on their toes, there has been a minimal shift over Aesop’s three decades, and the utilitarian aesthetic looks as good today as it did then. Naturally, this has made it a prime target for copycats.“If what we’ve created has shifted the dial a little in inspiring others to think harder, tone it down, say more with less, that’s probably a good thing,” Paphitis offers. “There is, however, a line that distinguishes inspiration and deceptive plagiarism. I’ve lost count of how many brands have ripped off our approach to typography. The world has some extraordinary graphic artists and art directors; why not challenge and supersede what we’ve done, rather than poorly replicate it?”It would be easy to mock the rigour and earnestness with which Aesop goes about everything it does, or dismiss it as control-freakery, but then this is a company that had a net sales revenue of £214m in 2018, despite having never advertised. Perhaps modern brands could learn something from its exacting, fastidious approach.At the heart of Aesop, though, it’s Paphitis’s taste that sets the tone, with his aesthetic code, love of literature and knack for the irreverent still the brand’s cornerstones. A quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is printed on page one of the book. “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and open sea.” And hand cream, of course.Aesop is published by Rizzoli on 22 October at £57 (aesop.com)"
'There is ingenuity in Africa': the architect who builds with trash,"In the shadow of South Africa’s car industry, making use of discarded parts is a way of life – so Port Elizabeth’s Kevin Kimwelle makes a virtue of it",,2019-10-22T10:14:35+0100,"“You’re lucky you arrived on a Monday,” says architect Kevin Kimwelle as we drive through the twisting back streets of Port Elizabeth. “The municipality collects rubbish on a Monday … but later in the week, it’ll be a terrible mess.”In South Africa waste collection is just one of the services that government struggles to deliver. A little under half of the country (41% of households) is without basic waste collection services, let alone recycling: as a nation, only 10% of waste is recycled, while 90% ends up in landfills.But as trash piles up on Port Elizabeth’s pavements, a formal and informal economy has sprung up in response. And Kimwelle has seen an opportunity.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope. Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town's spectacular beaches and trendy cafes.Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the ""other Soweto"", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.Nick Van MeadThe Kenya-born architect and social entrepreneur collects recycled and dscarded materials from informal recyclers and local businesses, and uses it to construct his buildings, which so far include a school, recycling depots, rainwater tanks and even solar panels.“When you drive through Africa, you see that people make do with what they have. There is ingenuity there,” Kimwelle says.The glass bottle walls create an illuminated, rather magical atmosphere inside the Silindokuhle creche. Photographs: Franziska Ritter/Gorka BiurrunHis most high-profile project so far is the Silindokuhle creche in Joe Slovo township, north of the city. With the help of the community, Kimwelle designed and built a structure made entirely of recycled materials – including 2,500 wine bottles. The glass bottle walls create an illuminated, rather magical atmosphere inside the building, which was nominated at Cape Town’s Design Indaba as one of 2017’s most beautiful objects in South Africa. Kimwelle sourced most of the bottles from restaurants in the affluent suburbs of Port Elizabeth, connecting the most privileged members of the city with the most marginalised.“I re-engineered materials that are already here,” he says, “adding value to the structure, fostering local skills and taking the green agenda to the township.”Kevin Kimwelle’s work makes use of recycled and discarded materials from industry. Photographs: Samora Chapman The biggest urban centre in the Eastern Cape province and the focal point of the Nelson Mandela Bay area, population 1.3 million, Port Elizabeth is the home of South Africa’s car industry and other forms of manufacturing and processing.“There are great opportunities for reclaiming materials here, because of all the big industry that drives the city,” says Kimwelle. “I build out of wood pallets that are used to transport goods in most industries, scrap from the motor industry yards and glass bottles from my recycling partners.”Even now, however, long after independence and the transformation of South Africa into a democracy, economic and racial divisions still shape the city.I became interested in grassroots community mobilisation and an alternative approach to design The majority of the black population live in townships – informal settlements established during apartheid. These are overcrowded, with poor access to amenities and services. Most homes are built out of corrugated iron and wooden pallets.Here, making use of recycled and discarded materials from industry is a way of life.Kimwelle, who was born and raised in Nairobi, first came to Port Elizabeth in 2004 to study architecture at Nelson Mandela University after reading about the newly liberated country in a schoolbook.“I entered a stupid dare to travel from here back to my home in Kenya using only public transport, and I experienced a major mind shift,” he says.“It forced me to see the continent and its people. To think about the African experience, what it means to be a black African. It spoke to me. Countries like Malawi and Zambia are so poor. The experience forced me to ask myself – what am I doing for my people?”After graduating, Kimwelle began work as a commercial architect, but exploring people-centred design for social good. “I became interested in grassroots community mobilisation and an alternative approach to design … I wanted to pursue a way of working that had a higher social and economic impact.”Khusta Moko with his partner, Patricia. Photograph: Samora ChapmanEvidence of his awakening can be found a short drive away, where the affluent suburbs of Mill Park, with mansions perched on manicured lawns, give way to Walmer township, with rutted roads, haphazard shacks, and dogs, chickens and children wandering freely. Here, 76-year-old Khululekile “Khusta” Moko, an informal recycler , lives in a tiny shack with his partner, Patricia, and his beloved dogs, Lucy and Lion. Moko survives by scouring the city for recyclable materials: plastic, paper, cardboard and aluminium. He collects them in a small, rickety homemade cart and delivers them every Friday to a recycling depot called the Re-Trade Project.Moko survives by scouring the city for recyclable materials. Photographs: Samora ChapmanThe project works on a bartering system: recyclers are given food, clothing and household products in exchange for the materials they bring in. Not only did Kimwelle design and build the Re-Trade depot out of recycled materials but when he found out Moko’s cart had been knocked over by a truck, he designed a superior replacement, using an old frame, reclaimed wood and secondhand parts donated by Isuzu Motors South Africa. It has a trailer and battery-powered lights “so that he can be seen and respected on the road,” Kimwelle says. “It’s going to improve his efficiency and return his dignity.”During a visit to Moko’s home, Kimwelle says: “The idea is to find simplified local solutions that any community can adopt and apply.” Everything here is built out of reclaimed materials, including the aeroplane sculptures in Moko’s garden.“Recycling puts food on my table,” Moko says. “And this bike is going to change my life. I will be able to travel the roads easily, instead of bearing the whole load on my trailer.”Kimwelle is fine-tuning the design and hopes to distribute them to recyclers all over the city.Kimwelle designed a new cart for Moko after hearing that the original vehicle had been knocked over by a truck. Photograph: Samora ChapmanFuture projects include the Penguins Play and Learn Centre in Walmer township, to be built using eco-bricks (two-litre bottles packed with plastic waste until they become solid building blocks), as well as a maker’s space in the heart of the city built from shipping container parts and reclaimed wood, with the assistance of 11 students from Lawrence Technology University in Detroit and the International Design Clinic. It will be Kimwelle’s headquarters.“From here we can do welding, woodwork, recycling, 3D printing and waste bike repairs,” he says.The city remains socially and spatially segregated because of apartheid planning, but Kimwelle says he is striving to reimagine spaces and make the best of available resources, with the aim of helping to build a more conscious and unified city.“I see recycling as an opportunity to build bridges – through the green agenda I am trying to restructure society,” he says. “Something as simple as recycling depots brings people together for a common cause that is non-political, non-religious and non-racial.”Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

The gentrification of Soweto hides the scars of its cruel apartheid history,"A quarter of Johannesburg’s population live in this modern and sophisticated township that is also blighted by poverty, drug addiction and crime",,2019-10-22T07:00:58+0100,"My mother tells me the house where I was born in the Chiawelo section of Soweto in 1973 didn’t have windows, doors or a paved floor when they moved in. My father earned very little as a cleaner at the post office and had no money to fix it.So my mother and her friends would go to a nearby farm to steal cow dung to make the floor. One day she got bitten by the farmer’s dog. That scar of poverty is still engraved on her hand like an ugly tattoo.To someone like me born at the height of South African apartheid, the vast Soweto area of Johannesburg – created by the white government in the 1930s to keep blacks away from white suburbs – symbolises the politics of poverty and segregation, the struggle for democracy and the spiritual emptiness of my country at that time.But the Soweto the South African government tries to sell to the rest of the world – typified by the gentrification of Vilakazi Street, where I grew up after we moved from Chiawelo – tries too hard to hide the scars of its cruel apartheid history.This new Soweto is a place where the designer-clad patrons of the area’s many bars arrive in fancy cars and drink Moet & Chandon champagne while chatting on their smartphones. It is fast catching up with Cape Town’s Long Street, Durban’s Florida Road or Johannesburg’s own Braamfontein or Maboneng as the preferred buzz location for tourists and locals with money.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope. Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town's spectacular beaches and trendy cafes.Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the ""other Soweto"", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.Nick Van MeadBefore the fall of apartheid in 1994 no one seemed to care that this corner of Johannesburg was the only street in the world where two Nobel prize winners once lived – former president Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. (Pan Africanist Congress president “Uncle” Zeph Mothopeng and ANC stalwart Tata Walter Sisulu lived nearby.)Today Mandela’s old house is a national museum and the stretch of concrete outside is filled with overpriced vendor stalls. Most of the Airbnbs and restaurants selling expensive beer were residential homes in the 1990s.The locals are self-employed as car guards, tourist guides, dancers and singers for tourists, and they seem to have that spirit of ubuntu, the African philosophy of compassion, humanity, goodness and kindness. This Soweto is safe and under constant police patrol. It is a Soweto without borders or xenophobia, and where you are just as likely to hear Mandarin as Shona, or French as KiSwahili. You are unlikely to see children with underfed bellies or drug addicts here. But Vilakazi Street’s forced and fake identity as an ideal “rainbow nation” (to quote Tutu and Mandela) doesn’t feel like the rest of the township.The other Soweto is revealed when you climb the 49 steps of Oppenheimer Tower to get a panoramic view of the whole district – separated from downtown by a string of old gold mine dumps that young people often mistake for mountains. It is home to 1.3 million people, a quarter of the city of Johannesburg.This other Soweto is modern and sophisticated in places, but also blighted by poverty, unemployment, drug addiction and crime. Poverty can be seen in the dirty rusted roofs of the Kliptown squatter camp to the south-east and the Jabulani hostel below, built as dormitory accommodation for migrant black workers in the 1950s. Down the street you might see police chasing a stolen car, or a crowd that has gathered around a victim of mob justice. Addicts of the notorious cheap drug nyaope – a cocktail of low-grade heroin, cannabis and sometimes anti-retroviral drugs or rat poison – are everywhere: in parks, at the traffic lights, outside shops.Growing up in the 1970s and 80s, the exclusively black township of Soweto was a communal place fighting a common enemy – apartheid. The enemy was white, and came to the township in police vans and Casspir armoured vehicles.Under apartheid’s divide-and-rule policy, black people forcibly moved to Soweto were made to live according to their Zulu, Pedi, Shangani, Swati, Venda, Xhosa, Tswana, Sotho and Ndebele ethnic group. If you belonged to a Shangani ethnic group, for instance, you could only live in Chiawelo, Pimville Zone 5 or Meadowlands Zone 10. If you belonged to Sotho or Tswana, your section would be Mapetla or Phiri. If you were Zulu, you were designated to live in Dube, Zola, Endeni or Dobsonville. This apartheid design made sure people hated one another and perpetuated ethnic stereotypes, making it difficult for the township to rise and fight together. The 49 Oppenheimer steps represent the 49 sections. Venturing into the section of another ethnic group as a child could be dangerous. There were only three swimming pools for a population of more than a million. Our nearest was in Senaoane, a designated Zulu area. I can still remember every detail of an incident in the late 80s when some bullies from a different section stole our clothes while were swimming and we had to walk home wearing only our underwear. I can see it now just as clearly as if it were on a reel of cinema film.Still, I miss the place I lived in 25 years ago. On Sunday mornings I would be woken by the Methodist church choir singing hymns opposite Orlando West high school. I used to walk along the street every morning to buy cheap fat cakes, liver spread, polony slices and salty snoek fish. In this highly politically-minded place a stranger might greet me according to their political affiliations: “tower” for the Black Consciousness Movement and Azapo, “comrade” for the ANC, and “MoAfrica” for the PAC.I would cross Khumalo Street to buy bread for breakfast from the shop there, before it was transformed into the swanky Kwa Lichaba restaurant and bar.That was then. So radical is the change that looking at my neighbourhood today, you’re bound to believe that all the negative associations are totally misplaced. In areas like Vilakazi Street, the name Soweto no longer conjures up images of squatter camps, dusty roads, black smoke, crime, poverty, apartheid and ugliness.New sections with bigger houses and yards – such as Protea Glen, Snake Park and Bram Fischer – have been added to the growing township. People have extended or changed the uniform four-roomed shapes of the apartheid houses to accommodate more family members. All the streets of Soweto are paved and there is electricity for every house, even for the squatter camps in some sections. You no longer have to be Zulu to live in Zola, or Xhosa to live in Emdeni. House price growth in Soweto regularly outstrips the rest of Johannesburg.This new Soweto feels like a city in its own right and commands a level of respect. Before 1994 there wasn’t a single shopping mall here, but there are now more than 30. We have a reliable bus rapid transit system, Uber and minibus taxis, and trains operating every day.The state of the art Soweto Theatre is our cultural heartbeat, hosting drama, music and dance productions, as well as festivals, conferences and community gatherings. The two disused cooling towers that used to be part of a coal-fired power station are today one of the most distinctive symbols of Soweto, with a popular shisa nyama restaurant at the base. You can bungee jump from the top.Visitors can get a better look at the township now than ever before. You can sleep at the Soweto Hotel or several B&Bs in the neighbourhood, or go on bicycle tours run by locals. There are walks along the Soweto heritage trail, as well as quad biking, tuk-tuk trips and street soccer sessions. Apartheid Soweto didn’t have a formal brewery, and home brews such as umqombothi were illegal, but today we have the Ubuntu Kraal Brewery, home of Soweto Gold, Orlando Stout and 76 Jameson, released to mark the 1976 Soweto students’ uprising.All these things tickle my pride as a Soweto resident but gentrified Vilakazi Street doesn’t come close to communicating the complete, complex experience of the township. To me, Soweto is like a beautifully written novel with a great plot sitting on your bookshelf, waiting to be read and enjoyed. I feel like people who only go to Vilakazi Street and think they’ve explored the place are like those who only read the blurb of a book and think they have enjoyed the whole story.Niq Mhlongo has lived his whole life in Soweto.

'Only we can change things': life in the gang-ridden other side of Cape Town,"After almost a thousand murders in the first six months of this year on the Cape Flats, national authorities sent in the army, and armoured convoys have patrolled the rutted streets of the worst neighbourhoods",Jason Burke,2019-10-21T06:00:30+0100,"Marcelliano Reitz, lean and toothless, rolls up his sleeve. The sun is setting behind the world-famous silhouette of Table Mountain. A plane on its way to Cape Town’s international airport flies low overhead. Children play on a rusting climbing frame, jumping on an abandoned mattress.Reitz has only just returned to his home in the poor and violent neighbourhood of Bonteheuwel after five years in jail for a firearms offence. He is a member of the Americans, one of the area’s biggest and most violent criminal gangs. On his wrist is the tattoo that marks him out as also being a member of one of South Africa’s major prison gangs. Yards away, police search a line of teenagers turned to a wall.You can be a tourist in the centre of Cape Town and be totally safe. But 10km away people are shooting at police“This is our territory,” says Reitz, 34. “Life is tough here but we have no problem with the police. They keep it stable. That is better for everyone.”The police deployment in Bonteheuwel is part of a new effort by local authorities to stem soaring rates of violent crime on the Cape Flats, a vast sprawl inland of Cape Town that feels a world away from the beaches, restaurants and tourist sites on the other side of the mountain.Few doubt the scale of the problem.Bonteheuwel in the Cape Flats“It’s been a bad year – but a really bad five years,” says Simone Haysom, author of a book on gang violence in Cape Town. “Until now, the government seems to have been willing to let the Cape Flats burn.”After almost 1,000 murders in the first six months of this year alone on the Cape Flats, national authorities sent in the army, and armoured convoys have patrolled the rutted streets of the area’s worst neighbourhoods of the Cape Flats since July. The deployment was extended by South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in September.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope. Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town's spectacular beaches and trendy cafes.Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the ""other Soweto"", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.Nick Van MeadThe police patrolling in Bonteheuwel are from one of two freshly constituted units of Cape Town’s Metro force that are dispatched to some of the worst areas.“The community is tired of the gangs, and criminals think twice if they see us in the area,” says the inspector who leads the team.Through the evening and night, he and his dozen officers, all recruited locally, will stop and search a score of teenagers, raid a shattered, destitute house used solely by local drug addicts and search for firearms in squalid huts. Walls in the neighbourhood are marked with graffiti showing which gang is in control of each block.Bonteheuwel was constructed in the 1960s by the repressive, racist apartheid regime that ruled South Africa until 1994. Apartheid planners purged Cape Town of black and mixed-race communities, dumping them in townships built without amenities or transport links on the sandy Cape Flats. Gangs developed rapidly from the mid-1990s onwards, recruiting among unemployed youth.Street scenes in NyangaAs violent crime has risen across South Africa since 2011, so too has gang violence on the Cape Flats.“There are more criminal networks in South Africa now, more foreign networks and more criminal businesses,” says Haysom.Statistics released in September show a total of 21,022 murder cases in South Africa reported between 1 April 2018 and 31 March this year, a 3.4% increase from the previous reporting period, leaving the country with one of the highest murder rates in the world. The worst police precinct in the country, Nyanga, is close to Bonteheuwel.There has been a large reduction in gang violence in BonteheuwelCape Town is run by South Africa’s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, further complicating the fight against gang violence. DA officials accuse the African National Congress, in power at national level for 25 years, of starving the province of police resources.Albert Fritz, provincial minister for community safety, says violence on the Cape Flats has been very localised.“It is really a tale of two cities,” he says. “You can be a tourist in the centre of Cape Town [and] you will be totally safe. You will not know that … 10km [6.2 miles] away there are people shooting at police.”So far, the new deployment to Bonteheuwel has been a success. There were 44 killings in the first half of the year but there has been only one between June and mid-September; a hit on a gang leader. Police patrol in Manenberg and BonteheuwelBut a similar effort in Delft, a much bigger neighbourhood that lacks the strong community involvement that has taken place in Bonteheuwel, has had less impact, and there is little sign that the army deployment has improved the situation. By some measures, murders have increased.“We must not give up … I am optimistic,” says Fritz. “The gangs … will always be there, but we can reduce their impact and power.”One of the most notorious neighbourhoods is Manenberg, a crowded series of low-rise apartment blocks and battered two-room homes where a series of gangs – the Americans, Hard Livings, Fancy Boys, Dixie Boys and others – fight to control a lucrative trade in cannabis, crystal meth and sedatives.Officers from Cape Town’s specialist anti-gang unit describe an anarchic free-for-all, with young criminals in their teens providing “cannon fodder” for wealthy criminals who live in big houses in sought-after suburbs well away from Manenberg’s rubbish-strewn streets.Bonteheuwel in the Cape Flats“The gangs build support among local residents by providing protection, handouts sometimes and keeping order,” says one officer. “That’s a problem for us. Everyone should be equal before the law, whoever they are.”Investigations into major gang leaders are often stymied by corruption and fear.Roegshanda Pascoe, an activist from Manenberg who witnessed a gang murder and agreed to testify against six men arrested for the killing, has faced attacks on her home and family. She has lived in a series of secret locations since the trial began, but has refused an official witness protection scheme that would have forced her to leave the region.“I feel very hopeless,” says Pascoe, 44. “I will never be able to go home … But it’s not just about people in Manenberg, or in Cape Town … it’s about the whole nation.”On the eastern fringe of the Flats, where the spectacular wineries and resorts that draw wealthy tourists from all over the world are clearly visible, is Mfuleni, an expanse of makeshift housing that is poor even by local standards.Ayanda Tunce: ‘I am very worried about my kids and their future’Ayanda Tunce, known as 2SLY, grew up in Mfuleni. He spent 10 years as a gangster and five years in prison.Tunce, 34, once wanted to be a doctor. As a teenager he was running errands for gang leaders and got a criminal record. At 22, he robbed a local drug dealer of two handguns and set up his own gang, selling drugs and maiming rivals. Now a father of three, he lives in a two-room shack with no sanitation and says he has rejected crime.“It is worse today,” he says. “Every weekend round here, we hear someone is dead, shot, raped, stabbed. There is too much heroin and tik [crystal meth]. I am very worried about my kids and their future. I am not asking the president. He’s got his own problems.

Why are South African cities still so segregated 25 years after apartheid?,"After 1994, the architecture of apartheid – the separation of rich and poor, black and white – was to be eradicated with creative and determined urban planning. It has not quite happened",Justice Malala,2019-10-21T06:00:31+0100,"It doesn’t take long after I drive out of the sleek OR Tambo international airport for the penny to drop. Again. Johannesburg is the bastard child of the worst aspects of capitalist greed and 20th-century racism. Nearly 150 years after its formation, this sprawling metropolis is still scarred by the sins of its genesis.Even with the explosive rise of the black middle class, the presence of blacks in formerly white suburbs remains lowJohannesburg – like Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and other cities in South Africa – is visibly and traumatically segregated. These remain cities divided.The rich of Johannesburg still live in the sumptuous northern suburbs, where the food at some restaurants is Michelin-star quality and house prices are eye-watering. These areas remain largely white, although that is changing at a glacial pace. The workers are in Soweto and Alexandra and other poor, crime-plagued black enclaves. It has always been this way with Johannesburg, and it remains pretty much as divided 25 years after apartheid collapsed and 29 years after Nelson Mandela walked out of prison. This economic powerhouse is Africa’s city of dreams – and nightmares. Its population of nearly 10 million are drawn from all corners of South Africa and increasingly from Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Malawi and Bangladesh. The city remains a magnet for those hoping for a better life.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope. Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town's spectacular beaches and trendy cafes.Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the ""other Soweto"", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.Nick Van MeadIt is unique as the only major city in the world not built by the seaside or on the banks of a major river. This is because it is the child of gold, not trade. Just a patchwork of farms when gold was discovered in 1884, it swiftly transformed into a chaotic, violent concatenation of settlements that attracted white adventurers, gold diggers (literal and figurative), sex workers, settlers, criminals, shysters, black labourers and elites from around the globe – all looking to make a fortune.It mutated into a frontier town and grew in a colonial fashion – blacks and whites remained largely separate, with the white mine-owners building mansions that sprawled into rich northern suburbs while black people were pushed to the south into townships.Apartheid formalised the loose colonial arrangement in the 1940s, creating a black labour reserve named Soweto (from South Western Townships) and banishing black people from the city while forcing them to carry a dompas (permit) at all times to show cause to be there. For 46 years from the formal introduction of apartheid in 1948 until its demise in 1994, this was the architecture of apartheid Johannesburg. Separate and unequal; black and white; rich and poor.Then 1994 happened. Mandela and his party, the ANC, were installed in office. Hopes for a new South Africa and a new Johannesburg – integrated, non-racial and free of the divisions of the past – were high. Spatial apartheid would be done away with thanks to creative and determined urban planning.It has not quite happened. In my neighbourhood of Parkview, a tree-lined middle-class suburb in the jacaranda tree shadow of the “Randlords’” mansions in Westcliff, mine remains one of woefully few black families. Even with the explosive rise of the black middle class in the mid-2000s, the presence of black people in formerly white suburbs across Johannesburg remains low.There is a reason for this glacial pace of change. Johannesburg is a microcosm of South Africa. The World Bank said in May 2018 that South Africa remains the most economically unequal country in the world. Poverty levels are highest among black people. Whites make up the majority of the elite or top 5% of the population. Hence the stubbornness of spatial segregation.After the collapse of apartheid, Mandela and his new team vowed to provide housing, water, electricity and other amenities to the previously disadvantaged. They didn’t expect to get such a huge influx of new residents into the cities. Since 1994, millions of people have set up shacks on the peripheries of townships and cities across the country.The response has been to rush to these unplanned new peripheral areas – some built on dangerous river banks – and build formal, though tiny, houses. The result is massive new low-cost housing units on the peripheries of cities and very little or no deliberate urban planning that leads to integrated housing solutions. The rich stay in the rich suburbs while the poor join other poor people on the periphery.It doesn’t mean that there is no change. In 2016 the government statistician published a series of maps that illustrate Johannesburg is the most integrated city out of its six major metros. Encouraging as that picture is, it is also problematic. The Johannesburg central business district has a high percentage of black African residents – but the past 20 years have been characterised by “white flight” into the northern suburbs. Johannesburg’s townships, like Soweto, remain largely disconnected from business districts and formerly white suburbs, despite initiatives such as bus rapid transit to make it easier for Soweto residents to get to work in formerly white areas.Even more hopeful is the decision this February by the city of Johannesburg to adopt a first-of-its-kind inclusionary housing policy that compels private developers to make 30% of the homes in all future residential developments affordable, regardless of where they are built. Implemented properly, it could be a game-changer for the city.Many of my favourite parts of Johannesburg have been facilitated by the Johannesburg Development Agency, together with a handful of savvy and brave private developers. The Newtown Cultural Precinct in the CBD is a fine example, incorporating commercial developments and sleek affordable housing.Johannesburg's new policy to make 30% of homes in future developments affordable could be a game-changer for the cityPossibly the trendiest part of the old Joburg CBD is Maboneng, a collection of 55 buildings bought and restored by the JDA in partnership with entrepreneur Jonathan Liebmann. The company Liebmann founded collapsed earlier this year, with units being auctioned off at way below estimated market value to bargain-hunters. But it is still a hive of restaurants, hotels, residential flats and a major artistic hub, with international artist William Kentridge as a tenant. However there are others springing up all over town.Yet Johannesburg’s fortunes are intricately intertwined with South Africa’s – and the country has gone through a turbulent 10 years under the leadership of ousted former president Jacob Zuma. Now led by former trade unionist and businessman Cyril Ramaphosa, the country is battling to deal with the corruption that thrived under Zuma. Ramaphosa says all the right things, as he did in London this week, but internal ANC politics stop him from introducing vigorous economic reforms to kickstart the economy in a country where unemployment is now just under 30% and government finances are deteriorating rapidly.Young people are restless and are becoming increasingly disillusioned with politics. The number of South Africans under 20 who registered to participate in May’s general election was the lowest since at least 1999, data from the Independent Electoral Commission showed. Among citizens aged 18 to 29 – the biggest segment of the voting population – registrations are at their lowest in at least a decade. The frustration of youth is palpable. Every morning traffic reports warn of protests by young people blocking major roads with burning tyres and rocks to demand services and jobs. It is a ticking timebomb.Yet there is a sense in South Africa that things can be turned around. That would give our cities a shot at becoming more inclusive, more liveable and more human.• Justice Malala is an award-winning journalist, television host, political commentator and newspaper columnist.

Waving not drowning: the street children finding refuge in Durban's surf scene,Surfers Not Street Children is transforming the lives of homeless children and vulnerable youths. Ilvy Njiokiktjien’s 12-year project Born Free: Mandela’s Generation of Hope documents the lives of the first generation born after apartheid,,2019-10-21T06:00:23+0100,"“I wanted to get that fresh air,” says 21-year-old Nonjabulo Ndzanibe, explaining why she ran away from her unhappy childhood home to the coastal city of Durban. “I just needed space for myself.”Having grown up with a distant father – who spent part of her youth in prison – and a mother whom she didn’t feel loved by, it seemed like a welcome escape when a friend invited her to come and stay in Durban. In reality it would be a long time before she would eventually find refuge through surfing.Ndzanibe did not know that her friend’s sister – with whom they were staying – was working as a prostitute, and that she expected Ndzanibe and her friend to start bringing in money as well. “If we didn’t come back with money, she would slap us.”Nonjabulo Ndzanibe sits on the pavement.Nonjabulo after a surf session.Nonjabulo Ndzanibe on her way to the water.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially.

Sometimes she made a bit of money helping the police clean up car crash sites. Other times, when she didn’t have a boyfriend to provide for her, she would sleep with random men in order to afford a bed in a night shelter.“That was hard, because sometimes I wouldn’t even like that person, but I needed the money. To get what you want, you have to sleep with someone, they say. You can’t get anything if you keep your legs closed.”Ndzanibe irons her clothing in the Surf House, a place where homeless children in Durban are being helped.One day, as she was walking along the beach, someone introduced her to a surfing club for homeless children, Surfers Not Street Children. They offered her support and a place to stay.Originally founded as Durban Street Team by activist and surfer Tom Hewitt in 1998, the organisation was able to track down an aunt of Ndzanibe who was more than willing to have her niece live with her in a loving environment and to get her back into school.A surf training session organised by Surfers Not Street Children.Surfers Not Street Children says: “Many children have come through our programmes and gone on to transform their lives … through a multifaceted approach that fuses surfing and mentorship alongside psychosocial care.“Our ultimate goal is to empower [children] to leave the streets behind for good and become independent. Surfers Not Street Children’s staff is made up of trained professionals and trained former street children, giving it a unique integrity amount the children it serves.”Ndzanibe washes her board down after surfing.Years after 22-year-old William Zondi ran away from home, his father recognised him on television, and learned where he could find him: on Durban’s beach, where he was surfing every day.“Everyone in the water came out, and told me: ‘Go to your dad’. But I said: ‘Guys, this is not my dad. He never showed me love.’” Zondi refused to go back home with him. “When I see him, there is no happiness for me. Only my mum used to love me.”William Zondi catches a left-hander.His mother died when he was seven years old. Zondi was so unhappy living with his dad and new stepmother that he boarded a train, not knowing where he was going. “I saw beautiful lights in Durban, and decided to get off there.” It was the start of a rough life on the streets.Being introduced to surfing by Hewitt gave him something positive to focus on. “[When] I jump in the water, everything I was thinking goes out. I feel free,” Zondi says. But his life was by no means perfect.Zondi in the homeless shelter where he lives in Durban.One of the squatter areas of Durban, where street kids sleep.Children and young boys in one of the squatter areas.The scars on his back and the 9mm pistol he owns tell his story. “I have to have a gun to protect myself,” he says. Sleeping on the streets made him easy prey. “You wake up in the morning and you have no shoes left. The bigger guys take your money, your clothes, everything.”Once he got his first surfboard, he would sleep on top of it. “On the streets, they used to steal our boards.” When he got stabbed in an attack, he would rush to the ocean instead of to the hospital. “The salt water burns, but then it closes very quickly.”South Beach was once reserved for white people under South Africa’s apartheid system. Zondi and his friends didn’t get a warm welcome there at first, and kept their distance from the white surfers. “But then they saw me doing big sprays. That’s when they knew blacks really liked this, and they called us over.”It was surfing that made him stop sniffing glue, wanting to become stronger so he could handle bigger waves. “And that’s how I became fit, became who I wanted to be,” he says, proudly pointing at his shoulders, muscular from hours of paddling.But lacking other income, he and his friends still resort to crime to afford food and a place at the shelter. “We just walk and see who are the ones with the big phones. We hold him by his neck until he sleeps, then we take whatever we want and run away.” The police leave them alone in return for some payment. He feels bad about it but he doubts he can ever go back to school and find a job because he has doesn’t have any papers.He would love to learn how to read and write, even if it’s just to fill out the forms at surfing competitions. “Then I could write my own name.”Zondi carries his surfboards to the ocean.• Ilvy Njiokiktjien’s 12-year project and book Born Free: Mandela’s Generation of Hope documents the lives of people born in South Africa around 1994, the first generation born after apartheid.Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

The future of burial: inside Jerusalem's hi-tech underground necropolis,"With a dire shortage of land for graves, the holy city is reviving an ancient custom of underground burial – with lift access, LED lighting and golf buggies",Oliver Holmes,2019-10-18T06:01:11+0100,"Cool air from deep inside the mountain lightly wafts through cavernous arched tunnels. Along the walls of the subterranean passages, rows of human-sized chambers have been dug into the rock. It is unmistakably a catacomb.Yet this mass tomb is not a relic of the Roman empire. It was made with huge electric diggers, and the walls are lined with concrete. People will enter by lift, and those with limited mobility will be able to use a golf buggy to traverse the necropolis.Facing a dire shortage of land, the city of Jerusalem is preparing at the end of this month to revive an ancient custom of underground burial. A four-year project has dug out a mile of labyrinthine tunnels into a hillside on the outskirts of the holy city to accommodate 23,000 bodies.“What you are seeing here is the first underground cemetery of the new era,” said Adi Alphandary, head of business development at Rolzur, the Israeli construction company leading the project.The firm specialises in digging tunnels, typically for trains or roads. Its client for this project, however, has more spiritual demands.The Kehillat Yerushalayim burial society, the biggest group overseeing Jewish burials in Jerusalem, has financed the project, which cost upwards of £45m. It has strict rules, including a ban on cremation and also that the deceased be physically connected to the earth, allowing their bodies to return to the ground.For that, Rolzur kept the number of graves down to those that can line the walls and floor that touch the earth. Where it has used concrete to fortify the chambers, it left holes in the sides to make sure there is always a direct link to the dolomite bedrock.Walking around the underground “streets” in a hard hat and high-visibility vest, Alphandary says there is another unusual design challenge for this project: “How do you make it look like a serene place?”Soft LED lighting lines the austere passages, some of which are 15 metres high and can accommodate nine levels of burial niches along each side. The only colourful flourish comes from the amber glow of giant stained-glass lights that dangle at intersections between the underground avenues, the work of German artist Yvelle Gabriel.The 30 October inauguration will open just the first third of the complex, with 8,000 graves ready to be filled, while the rest of the tunnels will continue to be dug. Funerals are expected to begin in November. Workers on cranes with spotlights were rushing this week to install two-metre-diameter ventilation pipes that will pump air in and out of the caverns.In Jerusalem, and across Israel, full-to-capacity graveyards have already closed their gates to new burials. Non-Jews are buried in separate cemeteries.Moving the dead underground is an idea Rolzur wants to take worldwide, as growing cities have sprawled out to engulf cemeteries that were previously on the outskirts. The space later becomes unusable, as many graves lie unvisited.“You get these huge metropolitans with lifeless islands in between them,” said Alphandary. “We see this dilemma all over the world.”The Jerusalem catacombs are directly beneath the city’s biggest Jewish cemetery, Givat Shaul, which is quickly running out of space. It has nearly 250,000 graves and has had to build multi-storey burial structures that look like car parks.In contrast, the catacombs take up no existing land. “Our plan is 50 metres below existing graveyard,” said Alphandary. “We are, in a way, creating new grounds for burial.”The current project has taken up just 5% of the available space in the mountain, and that is just at one level.“Let’s think a bit further,” he said. “Let’s say a hundred years from now all these graves will be filled. All we have to do is go another 50 metres below and we are potentially ready for another 20 times what we’ve done here.“Don’t waste the upper area for things you can do underground.”Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"
Faded grandeur: the industrial glories of neglected south Leeds – a cartoon,"The illustrated city: Writer and artist Francesca Roe pays tribute to a district caught between industrial splendour, post-industrial wasteland and urban blandness",,2019-10-18T11:00:21+0100,"It must have been something of a culture shock for my great-great-grandad when he left Grosmont, a small village in the North York Moors, for industrial south Leeds. He had worked on North Yorkshire’s railways before moving to Hunslet, known as the “workshop of Leeds” on account of its iron foundries and steelworks. Like neighbouring Holbeck, the centre of Leeds’ textile industry, workers lived in red-brick terraced houses close to their places of employment.By the 1890s Hunslet’s steel works was Britain’s largest producer of railway tracks, sprawling over a 25-acre site. By 1911, one in every five men worked in Leeds’ heavy industries, which were predominantly concentrated south of the River Aire.South Leeds’ reliance on iron, steel and textiles meant it was hit hard by industrial decline. By the 1960s the area’s traditional industries had largely collapsed and workers’ terraces were demolished in slum clearances. Stourton, a working-class suburb bordering Holbeck, was transformed in the space of a few years from residential suburb to post-industrial wasteland. The city council, keen to rebrand Leeds as a thoroughly modern city, welcomed the construction of the M621 motorway through Holbeck and Hunslet, and attempted to style Leeds as the “Motorway City of the Seventies”.Fifty years later, the effects of post-industrial decline and poor urban planning are increasingly difficult to ignore. South Leeds’ grandiose industrial architecture is decaying; far from singing the motorway’s praises, the council now recognises that the M621 “disrupts the community, cutting it off from the rest of Leeds”. In 2018 the council launched an ambitious plan to redevelop Leeds’ “South Bank”, hoping to redevelop industrial wasteland to double the size of the city centre. Architectural plans show the “South Bank” sprinkled with high-rise office buildings, and residents might question whether the benefits will be spread evenly between businesses and the local population. Nonetheless, attention is at last being focused on the future of south Leeds and its unique heritage.A walk through south Leeds reveals a district caught between industrial grandeur, post-industrial wasteland and urban blandness. The starting point is Leeds station, where the 1960s edifice and the 1930s art-deco concourse sit directly above the Dark Arches, a series of vaults spanning the River Aire that serve as the station’s foundation. A metal walkway passes through the Dark Arches and over the Aire, where passers-by can stop andwatch the churning water receding into darkness. Around 18m bricks were used to construct the arches during the 1860s – the largest such project in the world at that time.Through the Dark Arches lies the Leeds-Liverpool canal and the gentrified tip of Holbeck: “Holbeck Urban Village”, a tight knot of former red-brick flax mills and steam engine works. The Round Foundry dates back to 1795 and was once home to steam engine manufacturers; today the complex is home to offices, a brewery and Yorkshire’s official tourist board. The gentrification of this small part of Holbeck has done little to ease poverty in south Leeds as a whole, but it has preserved a part of the district’s history that was previously at risk.The buildings in the Urban Village are significant, but the most impressive relics of south Leeds’ industrial heritage lie just around the corner. Tower Works on Globe Road was constructed in the 1860s by the industrialist Thomas Harding to produce needles for south Leeds’ textile manufacturers. A lover of Italian architecture, Harding took the unusual decision to embellish his factory with red-brick replicas of famous towers in Verona, Florence and San Gimignano. Derelict for several decades, Tower Works is currently being converted into luxury flats.Perhaps the most impressive relic of south Leeds’ industrial past lies a five minute walk from Tower Works. Pass Marshall Mills, an imposing six-storey edifice that dwarfs the smaller industrial buildings around it, and you might be surprised to find an Egyptian temple executed in millstone grit. This is Temple Works, modelled on the Temple of Horus at Edfu on the west bank of the Nile, and a prime example of northern industrialists’ use of architecture to flaunt their cultural capital.Temple Works opened in 1840 and boasted the largest single-span room in the world, as well as a grass-covered roof where sheep could graze, sometimes falling on to the street below. The mill was sold in the 1880s, and by 2008 it was on the verge of collapse. After several stalled attempts at redevelopment, Temple Works has been purchased by a local developer, CEG. Work has started on the restoration, with CEG stating: “We want to reconnect the communities that were cut off by the M621 and feel the city centre is not for them. It needs to be an inclusive use that everyone is proud of.”Beyond Temple Works the gentrification ends abruptly. South of the regenerated buildings lies a patchwork landscape of old railway viaducts, industrial wasteland and decaying historic buildings such as Low Hall Mills, constructed in 1874 and now derelict. The area is peppered with listed buildings; the red terracotta and Burmantofts tiling of Holbeck public library, now offices; the United Methodist Free Chapel constructed in 1880, now home to a carpet warehouse. Yet much of the landscape is a blur of roundabouts and light industrial units.This part of Holbeck has seen its fair share of controversy: in 2014 the area was profiled in the press as the UK’s first “legal” red light district, a reference to Leeds city council’s introduction of a “managed zone” where sex workers and punters could work free of police interference within agreed hours and geographic limits. Although efforts to improve safety for sex workers are commendable, Holbeck’s ginnels and viaducts are far from a sanctuary. In 2016 a young woman named Daria Pionko was murdered by a punter in the managed zone, a reminder of the dangers that women working in Holbeck still face.In neighbouring Hunslet, the remnants of south Leeds’ industrial past are harder to spot. Clues remain, however: among the most impressive examples of Hunslet’s industrial past are Leeds city college’s conversion of a former printworks factory into a campus, resplendent in terracotta, and the former Hunslet Engine Company headquarters on Jack Lane, where an exposed section of rail track still cuts through the road (the Hunslet Engine Company is still manufacturing locomotive engines in south Leeds to this day).Just over the border in Middleton lies the oldest continuously operating railway in the world, Middleton Railway, opened in 1758 to serve south Leeds’ coal mines. There are other reasons to be optimistic: Victoria Mills, derelict since the 1970s and once among the Victorian Society’s top 10 at-risk buildings, is being redeveloped as flats. It is not clear how many will be affordable, but at the very least part of Hunslet’s industrial history has been salvaged.South Leeds was once the heart of industrial Leeds, but suffered a steep decline in the late 20th century. There are reasons to question how far the redevelopment of buildings like Victoria Mills will address stubborn poverty in the area, and there remains a perceived boundary between Holbeck proper and the Urban Village. Nonetheless, after decades of neglect, there are signs that south Leeds and its remarkable history is finally being recognised.Francesca Roe is a writer, printmaker and illustrator from Leeds.

Gyula Remes died on parliament's doorstep. Was the outcry of MPs just for show?,The homeless death of Gyula Remes 1975-2018: The demise of the ‘gentle giant’ on the streets of Westminster is a chilling illustration of the hostile environment’s impact on EU citizens,Simon Hattenstone,2019-10-15T06:00:41+0100,"When Gyula Remes died on 19 December 2018, across the road from the Houses of Parliament, there was an outcry. Remes, aged 43, was Hungarian and homeless. He had been sleeping in a passage in Westminster tube station that led into Parliament square. It was the second homeless death in the same underpass in 10 months. The Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: “There is something rotten in Westminster when MPs walk past dying homeless people on the way into work.”Later that day, Remes’ death was discussed in the House of Commons. The Liberal Democrat MP and former health minister Norman Lamb said: “It is grotesque and obscene that we have a homelessness crisis visible just outside the building.” The next day James Brokenshire, then secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, told parliament: “Every death of someone sleeping rough on our streets is one too many. Each is a tragedy, each a life cut short. We have a moral duty to act.” Brokenshire said the government was already acting, with an investment of £1.2bn to reduce and prevent homelessness, and its commitment to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and end it by 2027.A sum of £5,000 was raised in just two days, in memory of Remes, by an unnamed MP’s staff. Bouquets were bought and impromptu wreaths laid outside Westminster tube. One wreath, cordoned off by a folded black bin liner, featured five bouquets in disposable cups alongside a burning memorial candle. Between the flowers stood a regiment of Stella Artois cans – Remes’ favourite brand of lager. The death of Gyula (pronounced Jeweller) really did feel like a pivotal point.726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures. Over the next few months, G2 and Guardian Cities will look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain’s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life – what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by.There was widespread horror that people were dying on the streets of one of the wealthiest boroughs of one of the wealthiest cities in the world. But perhaps there shouldn’t have been. Last November, the homelessness charity Shelter revealed that 320,000 people in Britain were homeless – a 4% year-on-year rise. In 2017, Westminster had more rough sleepers than any borough in the country – 217. The day after Remes died, data was published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing that almost 600 homeless people had died in England and Wales in 2017 – a 24% increase over five years.Remes’ friend Gabor Kasza talked to the Guardian on the day he died. He said Remes had been given a cigarette by somebody he didn’t know. He inhaled it, convulsed, turned blue and lost consciousness. Kasza was convinced it was the synthetic cannabinoid spice, smoked unwittingly, that had killed Remes.Kasza and Remes made an unlikely couple. They were different in so many ways. Kasza in his early 20s with perfect English; Remes looking older than his 43 years and struggling to make himself understood with his broken English. Kasza had a girlfriend; Remes was alone. Kasza came to Britain as a nine-year-old with his mother, went to school in London and lived in Tottenham. Remes came in his early 30s, looking for work. Kasza did not drink or take drugs; Remes loved his booze. What they had in common was that they were both from Pécs, the fifth largest city in Hungary, and were homeless.They met at a day centre for homeless people, the Connection, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, in September 2018. Over four months, until Remes’ death last December, they became inseparable. They looked out for each other, shared food and money, went to the Connection together, returned to their spot by Westminster in the afternoon, and talked up their hopes. Kasza says Remes had simple ambitions. “He wanted a good job, a good house and a big family.” He ended up with none of those.Six months after Remes’ death, Kasza has moved to Birmingham, where he thought it would be easier to find work. It hasn’t been. He is still jobless and homeless, trying to scrape together enough money to get a roof over his head. And he is still missing his friend. He doesn’t know all the details of Remes’ life – he says homeless people often keep their past, or parts of it, to themselves. But he tells us what he does know.Kasza believes Remes initially worked as a kitchen porter in London in the mid-00s, but after losing his job he found himself sleeping rough. Remes loved to travel and cook, although there was little opportunity for him to do either on the streets of London. A few years ago, Kasza says, Remes gave up on London and travelled through Europe looking for work. Sometimes he found work, sometimes he didn’t. He was away for about five years, and then suddenly reappeared in Westminster towards the end of last year.Gyula would never beg. It was work or nothing else. He loved working, but it is hard to find a job if you don’t have accommodationRemes had just returned to the country, was jobless and did not meet the eligibility criteria for benefits, so he found himself back on the streets. In 2014, the then prime minister David Cameron clamped down on what he called “benefits tourists”. As well as having to wait for three months before claiming benefits (which had always been the case), people from the European Economic Area (EEA) looking for work were now only entitled to claim jobseeker’s allowance for a maximum of six months, and then only if they could prove they were actively looking for a job and had realistic prospects of finding one.Kasza has been homeless, off and on, for the past four years. There have been times when he has been working for the minimum wage and still not been able to afford accommodation. Last year, he lost his job in a warehouse and found himself back on the streets. He and Remes soon became brothers in arms. “He was a very good friend. He’d always help you out if you were in trouble. He’d give you food or money if he had any. He was funny. He made a lot of jokes. He made people happy.”Life on the streets was monotonous, Kasza says. In the morning they would go to the Connection, which adjoins the famous St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, where they could shower and have breakfast. In the afternoon, they would return to their spot by the tube. Sometimes they would go to soup kitchens; other times, they would go job hunting. At night, Kasza would sleep above ground close to Westminster tube station, while Remes would sleep in the underpass a few yards away from a woman called Sarah and her girlfriend. Just before settling down every evening, Kasza would walk down to the tunnel or Remes would come up the stairs to make sure they were safe, and they would wish each other goodnight.The main thing that kept Remes going was his desire to find a job. He was a proud man, and, unlike Kasza, refused to ask strangers for money. “He would never beg,” says Kasza. “It was work or nothing. He loved working, but it is also hard to find a job if you don’t have any accommodation.” A classic catch-22 – no work, no home; no home, no work.Kasza says he preferred to work, but often there was none, and anyway he could make more money begging – occasionally as much as £100 a day, and usually £200-£300 a week. That was one of the attractions of Westminster – wealthy people or happy-go-lucky tourists passing by. They may be unlikely to stop and shoot the breeze, but they did sometimes drop a fiver in his cup. Kasza would save whatever he could, and put it in the bank. He hoped to save enough money to move into private rented accommodation.Occasionally, politicians gave him money. “Ed Miliband spoke to me and gave me his email when he was leader of the Labour party. He gave me £5 and asked me why I was homeless. I said: ‘I’ve been here in the UK a long time – they should give me a house.’ He said he would try to help me.” Did he see him again? “No, that was the last time I saw him.” Miliband was one of the few who did stop. “Most of them don’t know whether we are dead or alive.”Remes hated the discomfort and indignity of being homeless. “It’s not very nice,” Kasza says. “You sleep on the floor, and it’s dirty. You get drunk people coming out of clubs or going in, making noise. Gyula was a bit scared being on the street. He always wanted to get off. That’s why he was so determined to get a job.”Kasza says Remes loved to drink if he could afford it – cheap cider or Stella. How much? “Maybe four cans of Stella. Maybe he’d get drunk every second or third night. He was a happy drunk.” Kasza says that, although he never saw Remes out of control, his friend did want to stop drinking. “He would tell me that he was only drinking because life is emotional, and because he wanted a job and felt alone. I would try to persuade him not to drink. One time he stopped for a couple of weeks and then started again.”Kasza says they got little support from outreach workers. He claims they are not often seen, and, when they are, rarely offer practical support. “They just say there is no room in the shelters or you cannot stay in them because you do not qualify for benefits.”Another problem is that trust appears to have broken down between homeless people and outreach workers. Today, big homelessness charities bid for contracts from local government. Those that win them are often thought to be beholden to their paymasters. In 2016, the Home Office decided that people sleeping rough in Britain were abusing EEA free-movement rights, and could be removed. In March 2017, it was revealed that big homelessness charities, including St Mungo’s, had been passing information about rough sleepers to the Home Office, leading to their removal from the UK – 127 non-UK-national rough sleepers were deported in a two-month pilot operation in Westminster. But in December 2017, the high court ruled that the Home Office policy to deport rough sleepers from countries in the EEA, known as Operation Adoze, was unlawful.Not surprisingly, by that point homeless people from the EEA, such as Remes and Kasza, had become suspicious of outreach workers. “I have a few friends who were sleeping rough somewhere near us in Westminster, and they got taken away for sleeping there and held in a detention centre,” Kasza says.Gyula Remes died on a cold December night. Earlier in the evening, he had complained that life was too tough, and he couldn’t continue in this way. But, as the drink flowed, he began to relax. It was only a week until Christmas, and the atmosphere among the Westminster rough-sleeping community was festive. “A lot of people from my country were sleeping down there. Everybody was drinking and happy,” Kasza says.He thinks it was about 10pm that he went upstairs to his spot by Caffè Nero. Just before settling down for the night, at around 11pm, he went back down to the underpass to say good night and make sure everybody was OK. Remes was blue in the face, lying on his stomach and choking. His friends said he had been fine until he smoked a bit of a cigarette he had been handed by a young homeless man, and began to convulse. There is no way Remes would have touched it if he had known it had been laced with spice, Kasza says – he didn’t even smoke regular cannabis. “It was definitely spice. We were so sad, shocked, panicking. One of the other guys called the ambulance. We heard the next day he had died. Everybody was crying.”‘He made people happy,’ says Gabor Kasza of his friend Gyula. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianFive months on, how has Remes’ death affected Kasza? “It has made me more sad about people not counting and people not caring. We thought things might change after Gyula’s death, people would start caring, but nothing has changed.” His move to Birmingham has not worked out. He thinks it is even harder for him because there are so few homeless charities in Birmingham to help him.It all seems so far away from his childhood when he sailed through his GCSEs, did a diploma in animal care and dreamed of becoming a farmer. Five years ago, his mother moved to Amsterdam to live with her partner, and he has struggled with housing ever since. Kasza is not the first in his family to experience homelessness. His father has been homeless in Hungary for much of the past 15 years, even though he works as a builder. This is one of the reasons he would not go back to Hungary. Despite everything, he believes he has better prospects here. More to the point, having spent most of his life here he regards Britain as home – even if it has often felt like an unwelcoming one.Kasza is remarkably sanguine about the way life has turned out for him. He says he is thankful for his health, his girlfriend and the fact that he still has a future to look forward to. Somehow, he has retained his appetite for life, despite all he has seen. He remains convinced that the next stroke of luck is just round the corner.In Westminster, Labour MP David Lammy is multitasking – heading towards a meeting while explaining why he reacted so passionately after Remes’ death. He says it was a moment of revelation. “I couldn’t believe how quickly the political class had become indifferent to this suffering. We have people sleeping on Westminster station outside one of the Commons entrances, and 650 MPs have stepped over those people on their way into work. It’s a travesty. In relation to our welfare state, our safety net, our morality really, because in the sixth richest economy in the world it simply should not be the case that so many people are without housing. I tweeted because I felt a sense of despair and loathing for a system that I’m part of.”What worries Lammy is that we have accepted homelessness as the norm. “What we’re seeing now in Britain is a whole community of people who have no stake in society.” Every day on his way to and from work, he passes Stroud Green bridge (next to Finsbury Park tube station in North London), which has become one of London’s contemporary cardboard cities. How does that make him feel? “I feel shame. I feel very upset that my young children, not yet teenagers, are becoming immune to them; immune to people who are sleeping under the bridge.” Does he think anything has changed for the better since Remes’ death? “No! Things have got worse.” Actually, he says, one thing has changed. ”They’ve put up a barrier at Westminster tube to stop homeless people sleeping in the tunnel.” His voice rises in disbelief.Commuters walk pass Dawn Hodgson the memorial she and others created for Gyula. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty imagesWestminster is dysfunctional, says Norman Lamb – so many homeless people on the one hand, so many unoccupied buildings on the other. From his office in Portcullis House, next to the Houses of Parliament, he points out a nearby high-rise approved by Boris Johnson during his tenure as mayor. “It’s largely owned by oligarchs, but it’s very rarely occupied … I have argued for a punitive tax on any dwelling in London that is left empty. I can’t understand why nobody has ever done it. It’s the obvious thing that would end the problem or raise substantial amounts of money that you could use to house people.”Lamb also voices his disgust at the barrier that has been erected in Westminster tunnel. “There’s no doubt a security justification, but the fact is it’s closed off an area where people could get shelter overnight.”Last week the New Statesman revealed that two months after Remes’ death the chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, Rose Hudson-Wilkin, complained to parliamentary authorities about the “ongoing stench” and “unsanitary state” created by rough sleepers in the underpass.It is a hot May day, and Southwark coroner’s court is empty except for the two of us, a journalist from a news agency and a handful of staff behind a glass window. The inquest cannot begin at 1pm as scheduled because assistant coroner Philip Barlow is not here yet. It starts at 1.26pm, and is over by 1.52pm – Gyula Remes’ life is done and dusted in 26 minutes. Statements are provided by the head of outreach at St Mungo’s, Kathleen Sims, and Jeremy Bernhaut for the Connection. Neither Sims nor Bernhaut are here in person. It all seems so desultory – a far cry from that December day when Remes died and politicians, campaigners and the media voiced their outrage that a rough sleeper could die on the streets outside parliament.Barlow tells the court that Remes has no family in Britain, but he believes there is a brother in Canada. There are few concrete facts about Remes’ life. Barlow talks about Remes’ desperation to work – in the short-term as a kitchen porter, with a long-term goal of getting a forklift licence. We also hear that drink sometimes got in the way of the prospect of employment. On 8 October, he was told by a potential employer that he smelled of alcohol, and a week later his caseworker at the Connection also told him he smelled strongly of booze, and should address that before his next job interview. But things were looking up for Remes: he was doing part-time kitchen work and had just been offered a full-time job.We learn that St Mungo’s and the Connection first had contact with him on the streets in 2006, and worked with him on and off for seven years until he left to live – and work – in Malta, France and Hungary. After five years abroad, he returned to Britain in September 2018 and was spotted back on the streets by St Mungo’s in October 2018.Remes was offered 12 weeks’ accommodation at the Missionaries of Charity in south London, a hostel run by Catholic nuns with a strict no-alcohol/drugs policy. At the time, it was believed that he was working irregular hours as a street cleaner. On 26 October, he was thrown out after returning home late three nights in a row.Sims’ statement reveals that St Mungo’s street outreach services team saw him sleeping rough on 30 October in the tunnel at Westminster tube station, but he had refused to give them his details. Barlow says Remes was rejected twice for emergency accommodation at the Connection in October and on 11 December, a week before he died. He was told the hostel was full, but that, even if it had not been, he would not have been allowed in. “He did not meet the criteria for accessing it because he had not started work,” Barlow says. “Also, because his working hours were due to be irregular, he did not meet the criteria.”This is where the story of Gyula Remes becomes Kafkaesque. The notion that somebody can only meet the criteria for an emergency shelter if they are working seems absurd. Yet this appears to be the case, because working and paying tax is the only way he would have been eligible for benefits. Not only that, he would have to have been working regular hours to qualify for a place. In fact, according to Kasza, he had already started working full-time and had received his first payment the week he died.The more we examine the last months of Remes’ life, the more he looks like a victim of the government’s hostile environment policy. Here was a man who refused to give his name to the very charity that was supposed to support him (a charity that had been found to be helping the Home Office deport EEA nationals); a man not allowed to claim job seeker’s allowance despite being desperate to find work; a man refused shelter in the December cold because it was believed that he did not yet have a job.The toxicology report presented at the inquest stated there was no sign of spice or morphine found in Remes’ body, but that he had 369mg of alcohol in 100ml of urine – more than three times the drink-drive limit, according to the coroner. The emergency medical consultant at St Thomas’ hospital said Remes had “mild hypothermia” that was “unlikely to have any clinical significance on a patient’s presentation”. Barlow ruled that the cause of death was cardio-respiratory arrest and acute alcohol toxicity. “My short-form conclusion is that the death is alcohol related,” he said. “But it is impossible to think of the evidence in this case without considering the particular sadness that Mr Remes was hoping to find work and suffered his cardiac arrest in the centre of London near Westminster station shortly before Christmas.”After giving the cause of death, Barlow said: “It’s no doubt a measure of the pressure the various charities and organisations are under that he didn’t always meet the criteria for accommodation.” The statement, delivered quietly, but with heartfelt conviction, felt like a rebuke. But it was unclear who was being rebuked.Just after Remes died, the Connection issued a statement. “We are very sad and sorry to hear about the death of Gyula Remes, and would like to extend our condolences to his family and friends. We worked closely with Gyula and will remember him as a funny, charming and amiable man – he always had a smile on his face and was well liked by everyone who worked with him. Just before his death, he told us he was working part-time as a kitchen porter, and working towards getting into full-time employment. We were also helping him to get into a night shelter while he secured a full-time job.” What the statement didn’t say is that the Connection refused him a place at its own night centre the week before he died.The Connection is one of the country’s best-known homelessness charities. For more than 90 years, BBC Radio has supported St Martin’s work with homeless and vulnerably housed people. Over the past two Christmas appeals, Radio 4 listeners raised more than £5m to help three homeless charities, including the Connection, provide shelter, food and advice. We ask the Connection if any of the staff would like to share their memories of Remes. The press office replies that staff members “are not keen on being interviewed face to face”, but that the chief executive, Pam Orchard, is happy to meet us.A memorial marks the place where Gyula Remes used to sleep. Photograph: Tom Nicholson/LNP/REX/ShutterstockOn the ground floor at the Connection, homeless people are using computers in a large glass-fronted room. They come to the Connection to shower, have breakfast, reconnect with their home city or country, and find work. We take the lift to the second floor and Orchard’s office. She has worked in the homelessness sector for 15 years, and has been at the Connection for the past two.She reads out a list of anonymised tributes to Remes from a printed sheet of paper. One staff member remembers that, in 2008, he would always attend the Connection with a close friend, and that they were something of a double act. Orchard says that although she never personally knew Remes, her staff were fond of him. “Gyula was good-natured. He was quite a big guy. Somebody describes him as a gentle giant. He never used his size to intimidate people.” She fast-forwards a decade to 2018 when he returned to London and the Connection. “By now, he was drinking a lot more. He’d be visibly under the influence in a way he hadn’t been in his previous engagements. He said he was drinking because he had time on his hands.” Orchard looks up from her notes. “Often people drink because their mental health isn’t great, and they are self-medicating.”We ask her what criteria Remes failed to meet for a place in the emergency shelter just before he died. The atmosphere becomes frosty. Orchard asks us to turn our recorder off. We decline to do so, saying this should be a matter of public record. She says the issue of criteria is complex, not one that can be captured in a soundbite or headline.“We do our absolute best with limited resources,” she says. “If something goes wrong, which it inevitably does, because lots of our clients are extremely vulnerable and have got complex needs, there is a temptation to look for someone to blame and to look at what someone’s engagement in the service has been, and then find reasons to pick holes in what they did in order to demonstrate that if only they could or should have done something it would have been different. So you can look at our night shelter criteria as much as you like, and go: ‘If you’d done such and such, that wouldn’t have happened.’ But it feels a bit like you’re shooting the messenger.”We ask whether anybody from the Connection attended Remes’ funeral, and whether it held its own service. She says she is unsure, but mentions Marcos Amaral Gourgel, a Portuguese former model who died homeless in Westminster ten months before Remes, and who had also been supported by the Connection. After his death, it was revealed that he had been convicted of child sexual abuse in Portugal, and Orchard says the tabloids were critical of the support the Connection had given him. “So we get blamed for not doing enough, and we get blamed for doing too much. You just can’t win, can you? So we’ll just do what we can as well as we can.”A few days later, the Connection’s press office sends through the criteria for accessing the night centre: people have to be over 18, have been rough sleeping in Westminster, referred from an approved referral agency (the local authority, police, the NHS or other homeless charities), and they have to be “positively engaging with an agreed action plan that is a realistic and sustainable route off the streets”. The statement continues: “The fact Gyula had no access to welfare meant the best and most sustainable way we could support him was to help him access sufficient employment to pay rent in the private rented sector.”The statement further explains that, although its most recent work with Remes focused on helping him find work, “unfortunately, this had not translated into a realistic and sustainable route off the streets and so we were unable to accommodate him in our night shelter”. We are left baffled. After all, the assistant coroner said at the inquest that Remes had recently been offered a full-time job, and the condolences issued by the Connection after Remes died stated: “Just before his death he told us he was working part-time as a kitchen porter, and working towards getting into full-time employment.”It is eight months since Gyula Remes died. In Birmingham, Gabor Kasza says he does not know where his friend is buried or his ashes scattered. Nobody seems to know. We tell him about the inquest verdict, that Remes died of a heart attack and acute alcohol poisoning. He says he cannot believe it. He is still convinced spice did for Remes, and that he had had only about four cans of lager that night. He asks why he wasn’t called to give evidence – after all, he knew Remes well and was trying to resuscitate him as he was dying.Kasza says he has some good news. “I’ve got a job in a cafe. I’ve been working a few weeks now, almost a month. It’s a big cafe. I’m enjoying it. And I’m renting a room with my girlfriend.” Things are looking up, he says.On 6 July 2019, the Observer’s home affairs editor, Mark Townsend, reported that the Home Office had “rolled out a remarkably similar scheme” to Operation Adoze, despite the fact that the original scheme was ruled unlawful in December 2017. The story revealed that the Home Office had drawn up a programme called the Rough Sleeping Support Service (RSSS), using homelessness charities to acquire and pass on sensitive personal data that could result in the deportation of non-UK-national rough sleepers.My message to MPs? Help us. Get us off the streets. Do somethingEmails showed that St Mungo’s attended meetings with the Home Office in which discussions were held about allowing outreach workers to enter a homeless person’s data into the RSSS without their consent, which would breach European privacy laws. The Home Office said the RSSS was set up “to help resolve the immigration status of non-UK nationals sleeping rough, either granting lawful status or providing documentation. This enables individuals to access support or assists them in leaving the UK where appropriate.” St Mungo’s tells us: “We do not share any information about our clients with the Home Office without the client’s full and informed consent. In the case of the Rough Sleeping Support Service, our position has always been that people cannot be referred to the service unless they have first received advice and have also given their consent.”It is early October and the JustGiving fund set up by anonymous parliamentary staff in memory of Remes is still online. Underneath a photograph of the Houses of Parliament at sunset, it says: “In memory of Gyula Remes, the homeless man who died outside parliament.” A badge at the top reveals 485 people have contributed and it has raised £11,145 – the target had been just £1,000. But this seems to be the fund that time forgot. It is open for donations, although nobody has contributed for eight months. As with so much of Remes’ life, indignity is piled upon indignity. Alongside a memorial candle, in smaller type, it says: “In memory of Gyula Remef.”As for homeless death statistics, they continue to rise relentlessly. On 1 October 2019, the ONS estimated that 726 homeless people died in 2018 in England and Wales, a 22% year on year increase. Westminster council recorded 17 deaths – the highest number among London’s local authorities. Alarmingly, deaths as a result of drug use have more than doubled in the six years the ONS has been recording the data.Outside Westminster tube on a warm day, a woman with cropped hair and a toothy smile is sitting in her sleeping bag. We show her a photograph of Remes, and ask if she recognises it. She blinks, then answers. “Who’s that? That’s Julius, innit,” she says. “Of course I recognise him. My girlfriend and I used to sleep near him in the tunnel – just a few yards away.” Sarah Anderson is a 38-year-old Londoner. Like many women living on the streets, she ended up there after escaping an abusive relationship. She says a male former partner stabbed her and claims she lost her right to benefits because she was told she had made herself intentionally homeless.Anderson holds up the picture of Remes and smiles. “He was lovely – so loving. Every time he walked in, he’d say: ‘You all right, babe? How are you?’ in his fandangled way, trying to speak our language, bless him. He’d always ask how we were, and if we’d eaten.” We tell her that Kasza is in Birmingham, and has a job. Her face lights up. “I know Gabor. How is he?” She says how pleased she is for him and mentions his girlfriend by name.Anderson talks about the memorial she and her friends made for Remes. “We made it with a black bag all the way round where he used to sleep. We got candles; we even got the politicians involved. They were coming past offering us money. We said: ‘Don’t offer us money, go and buy flowers. And they actually went and bought some.’” Do the MPs still speak to her? “No. They used to before it all happened.” Has she got a message for them? “Help us. Get us off the streets. Do something.”After Remes’ death, she says the outreach team came round and gave Anderson and her then partner, Dawn, rail tickets to Newcastle, where Dawn comes from. “We ended up spending Christmas there last year.” Why does she think they bought them the tickets? “More than likely to clear the streets around here. I’m not being funny – there was a hell of a lot of publicity the day he died.”Like Norman Lamb, Anderson talks about all the unoccupied buildings around her, and how they could be turned into giant luxury hostels. She will be sleeping on the street tonight and for the foreseeable future. She says she could probably get emergency shelter, but her mental health isn’t good, and she doesn’t want to be in a dorm surrounded by addicts, temptation and noise. Has anything changed since Remes died? “Yes,” she says. “They have stopped us going into the underpass where we used to sleep at night. They’ve closed it off with shutters.”Anderson says she was devastated when she heard of her friend’s death. “Of course, I knew somebody could die on the streets, but when it happens literally lying in front of you it doesn’t half shit the life out of you. It really does. Because you don’t expect it to happen to one of your own.” Does she still think of Remes? “Every day,” she says. “Every bloody day.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailingjo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The homeless death of Kane Walker: how we let down the kid from care,Kane Walker 1987-2019: How did a childhood spent in the care system lead to the young man everybody loved dying under an overpass – and could a new law help?,,2019-09-30T06:01:02+0100,"“We’re here today because someone has touched your life,” says the priest. “You can say Kane’s life is a tragic story and he’s a lost soul. Perhaps you’re right. But the measure of a life is how many other lives it touches, and Kane’s life has touched many people’s lives. It’s touched yours, that’s why we’re here. Everything becomes yesterday’s news, but we can’t let that happen.”The chapel is packed for Kane Walker’s funeral, and tensions are running high. Around 130 people have turned up at Perry Barr crematorium in Birmingham on a bright February day to pay their last respects. It is just over a month since he died, aged 31, and those at the service are angry. How could a young man be allowed to die of pneumonia and a drug overdose in a freezing city underpass? It wasn’t as if Kane was unknown to the police, outreach teams, the ambulance service or the local community. He had spent years sleeping in doorways and sheltering beneath bridges. Everybody knew Kane Walker – even if not by name. And it would seem, everybody loved him.He was the kind of person who if you dropped your keys would come chasing you down the street with them, ‘here you are, here you are’Yet here they are fighting over the legacy of his life. You can sense the unease even before the service starts. The crowd at the crematorium is divided into distinct groups. Smart girls in pinstriped suits wearing RIP Kane T-shirts, godly folk, and a band of young adults with damaged teeth who, despite their best efforts, still look the worse for wear. There is little intermingling.Like many people who grew up in care, Kane had several families – and, at the same time, none. So here today are cousins, nieces and nephews from his biological family, the foster family he spent eight years with, and his street family. Every group seems to regard the others with suspicion. Fingers are pointed, and the same question asked time and again – where were you when Kane needed you? When they aren’t blaming each other, they are blaming the system.While Kane’s biological family make it clear they don’t want to talk to us, his homeless friends are more welcoming. Natalie White met him “bobbing” on the street four years ago. “He was joyful when I first got to know him. He didn’t know what the streets were like, so we helped him. It’s what friends do.” White says the streets gradually wore him down. “I saw him two days before he died. He was in a really bad way – physically, mentally. He’d just drowned. He’d gone from somebody who was really hopeful to somebody who’d had enough. If the government helped more, Kane would still be here now. Everybody who’s died on the streets would still be here now.”White says she’s lucky. She’s not taken drugs for three years now and has rebuilt her life. She is living in nearby accommodation, and would eventually like to get a job working with homeless people. She says Kane was cursed by “black mamba” – the synthetic cannabinoid also known as spice. Mamba is the street drug for rough sleepers because it is cheap. And it is deadly. “It’s the worst drug in the world. It’s horrible,” she says. “It makes you walk round like a zombie and takes away the hope.”In the chapel, the priest admits he didn’t know Kane personally. But, he says, he has heard positive things about a man who couldn’t have had it much tougher. He tells us what little he does know of his life: that his father died in a bike crash before he was born; that he spent much of his childhood in care before being returned to his grandmother; that both his mother and grandmother died some years ago within a short space of time. As with so many people who die homeless on the streets and come from the care system, the details are pitifully scant. The priest fast forwards to Kane’s final days, and the shock of his death.Oliver Obee, a young artist and photographer, talks movingly about befriending Kane. “Even on the worst of days, he would always ask me how I was feeling, how my day had been and if my mum was OK. I’d offer to get the teas and he’d be like: ‘Nonono, I’ll get them.’ He’d get a big handful of 2p coins and he’d rustle up the coppers. He was the kind of person who if you dropped your keys would come chasing you down the street with them: ‘Here you are, here you are!’”Obee mentions his friend’s addiction to black mamba, and says that even when high Kane tried to protect him from the drug. “He’d say: ‘Sit on the other side, I don’t want the smoke to go in your face.’ He was still conscientious even when under the influence. Once I was walking through town and there was another lad having a mamba attack, and I was suddenly aware of Kane appearing and saying: ‘You’ve got to call an ambulance now.’ Although he was under the influence himself, he knew quicker than me what to do, and those were precious seconds saved.”Obee says his favourite memory is of Kane singing. “On the street he always loved to sing. He was a surprisingly good singer.”“He was always singing, brother,” shouts out one of Kane’s homeless friends from the back of the church.Durcella Davis, a conservatively dressed woman in her 60s, introduces herself to the congregation as Kane’s foster mother. She speaks with quiet conviction in a Jamaican lilt. “When Kane came to me he’d had 10 moves in six months. I was his last resort. He was hard work, but he had love and care from myself and the family.” She says when he left her home he kept in touch throughout his life, and continued to call her Mum. “He was happy [with us]. On one occasion he told me it was the best time he’d had. It was nice to know. A couple of weeks before he died he said to me: ‘Mum, don’t worry about me,’ because the day before I’d been crying and said: ‘Kane you’ve got to get off the streets.’ And he said: ‘Mum you taught me a lot, and everything I am now is what you taught me.’ I brought him up as a Christian. His own mum wanted me to bring him up that way because I asked her, and as a Jehovah’s witness we know that he’ll get a resurrection.”726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures. Over the next few months, G2 and Guardian Cities will look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain’s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life – what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by.There is a disapproving murmur in the church. “Excuse me,” says a woman loudly. “You said you wouldn’t talk about this.” Mrs Davis is brought to a premature, confused finish. “Thank you very much everybody,” she says with dignity, as she steps down.Outside the chapel, the sense of division is growing. “Do you know where the wake is being held?” a man with dreadlocks asks an upset woman. “I’m not going,” Alexandra Davis says. “The way they shut down Mum off the stage was out of order. They need to have respect. Everybody’s grieving.” She looks at the man with dreadlocks. “Who are you?” she asks him. “I’m pastor Colin Rankine, the one who highlighted it [Kane Walker’s plight]. I filmed Kane and fed him for four years on the streets.” Her face lights up. “Oh yeah, you did really well. He was hugging you in the film wasn’t he? My mum was the foster carer. I’m Kane’s sister.”Rankine is a controversial figure. He is an evangelical Christian who heads up his own ministry and does outreach work. Some people regard him as a saviour of Birmingham’s street homeless people, while others believe he is a self-publicist who just wants to convert the homeless to his brand of Christianity. Wherever the truth lies, it is unlikely we would have learned about Kane’s life without Rankine.Rankine feeds, prays for and films the street homeless people of Birmingham. He says he is documenting it all because somebody has to bear witness. After Kane’s death, he provided local television stations with heartbreaking footage taken in 2018 of the young man. Kane is in such distress that it is almost unwatchable. “I’m done now. There’s no point, brother, I’m not going to be here. I’m not living like this no more. This ain’t my life,” he tells Rankine, who is trying to comfort him with a cup of tea. “I’m done, Colin! I’m done. I’m done! You’ve never seen me like this before! I’m done! I am done, brother. I’m done. Oh God. I can’t do it no more. I can’t do it no more.”Rankine told ITV: “There are thousands of Kanes up and down the country. We as a nation can draw together. It’s all about showing love. It’s all about not vilifying people for being poor. Meanwhile, Obee went on TV to talk about the abuse his friend endured on the streets. “Kane told me that on a regular basis he was kicked, spat on; he’d wake up several times and he’d have been urinated on in the night. I’d see him regularly with black eyes and cut. There was not a lot of help for him there and there should have been.”In mid-February, a month after Kane’s death, Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, calls homelessness a “moral emergency”. Speaking after a memorial service for Kane, Byrne says: “We’ve just brought together homelessness charities across the city to meet with members of parliament about what we need to do to make sure there is never another homeless person dying in our city.” Byrne proposes new legislation that would require public services to work together to prevent homelessness and ensure there is an independent review after every death of a homeless person, and he says it should be called Kane’s law.Drug workers are having to tell people ‘Go back on heroin because we know how to detox you on heroin, but we don’t know how to detox you from mamba.’In May, Byrne enjoys a small victory when Birmingham’s Safeguarding Adults board agrees to a “formal multi-agency” review into Kane’s death. Astonishingly, it emerges that in 2017-18 it did not investigate the circumstances of a single one of the estimated 18 deaths of homeless people that occurred in the city. The council says outreach workers were reluctant to report vulnerable adults, while outreach workers tell us they simply didn’t know safeguarding adult reviews (SARs) existed. Rankine tells us he passed on his concerns about Kane to the council’s street intervention team, but that they were never acted on.Birmingham is a city in crisis. It may still be the UK’s largest council landlord, and it may be building more council homes through Birmingham Municipal Housing Trust than any other local authority, but these facts put a deceptive gloss on the housing situation. The number of properties owned by Birmingham city council has halved since the 1980s, from more than 120,000 units to 61,000. The overall estimate is that there are now 20,000 homeless people in the city. The council receives 600 applications every month from people who fear they are about to become homeless.A rise in street homelessness inevitably leads to a rise in drug addiction, and vice versa. There were 252 deaths related to drug poisoning in the city between 2016 and 2018 – the highest number since records began in 2001. Meanwhile, the correlation between being brought up in care and adult homelessness is stark. While one in 144 children have been in care at some point in their lives, one in four homeless people have been in care.It is July, six months since Kane Walker died, and we meet Liam Byrne in his office at Portcullis House, opposite the Houses of Parliament. Byrne’s team has done research on key underlying causes of homelessness. They discovered that the mental healthcare caseload is rising four times faster than the budget, while there has been a 20% fall in funding for drug and alcohol treatment. For Byrne, the issue is personal – his father and paternal grandparents were alcoholics, and his grandmother and uncle had schizophrenia. They weren’t homeless, he says, but they so easily could have been.Byrne is bright, open and very emotional. He weeps twice in our presence – once when talking about a homeless double amputee he met in an underpass while doing outreach (“He was still in his hospital gown with his hospital tag on. It took us two hours to get him an ambulance”) and again when describing the memorial service he attended for Kane.Was he angry about Kane’s death? “Furious. So furious I decided to run as mayor because I can’t be a bystander any more and watch people die on the streets.” The election is next May, and if he wins he will stand down as an MP. How was he failed? “In Kane’s case, the failure was deep in childhood. A lot of people can tell you about the effort that was made to try to help Kane in the last couple of years of his life. Some pretty serious outreach tried to catch him.” But he knows it wasn’t good enough. “When you have a broken care system and no mental health services and no addiction services, then it is very difficult to set people on a good path.” After Kane’s death it was also alleged that the ambulance service failed to get him to hospital promptly.Byrne is particularly horrified by the grip spice has on homeless people. Not only is it deadly, he says, but there has been no investment in detox programmes. “Because every mix is different, drug workers are having to tell people: ‘Go back on heroin because we know how to detox you on heroin, but we don’t know how to detox you from mamba.’ You’ve got to ask yourself why, in Birmingham, addiction services have been cut back so dramatically when there is this epidemic of psychoactive substances that we don’t know how to unravel. There wasn’t an emergency drug treatment programme available to Kane because we don’t know what the pathways of care look like. That is the scandal of Kane’s story.”Are people looking for a programme yet? “I don’t think they are. I don’t think people give a shit.” Although the coroner ruled that the principal cause of death was a heroin overdose and that a contributory cause was pneumonia, spice was found in his system. His friends are convinced it was this that killed him.Seven months after first getting in touch with Alexandra Davis, she agrees to see us. She suffers from anxiety and depression, and has struggled since Kane’s death. Talking about him tends to make her feel worse, she says, so she tries to avoid the subject. We meet at St Martin’s church in the Bull Ring – a bustling hub with market stalls and shops where Kane liked to hang out. She asks for one favour. “Please don’t call Kane my foster brother. To me, he was my brother, and I was his sister.”Davis turns up with her two children. Levi, 10, and Pearl, five, are lively, lovable and perfectly behaved. Both have fond memories of Kane. Levi shows me a photo of Kane on the day they took him to get a new phone on 20 July last year. That was an important day for all of them.Kane was four when he walked into Alex’s life; she was a year older. “I just remember this young pale-skinned boy coming into the house. He had a big grin on his face. He looked very innocent, so happy. I was so excited.” Davis’s parents had taken in foster children before, and continued to do so after his arrival. But Kane was different. He stayed with them for eight years. And when he finally left, none of them wanted him to go because he was family.“Our lives were relatively privileged,” Davis says. “We had apple trees, plum trees, a pear tree. We’d go in the garden, grab a little basket and spend time picking fruit and playing.” They would ride bikes, play with her dolls. Davis was the youngest of five girls. In summer, they would all go on holiday together – Alex, her four sisters, their mother and father, Kane, and often one other fostered boy. “We’d go to Prestatyn in a minivan and dad would drive us around. We’d go to the beaches and stay in chalets at Pontin’s. Kane used to love dancing with the human teddy bears during the holiday. We’d all be dancing and enjoying ourselves.”Were they into music as kids? “Oh yeah. Kane loved music. His favourite song was 21 Seconds and he memorised all the lyrics. He’d rap and really move to it.” They used to say that Kane could be an actor when he grew up. He performed in plays at school and church, and sometimes he and Davis would put on improvised dramas at home. “We did one for Mum and Dad’s anniversary about God testing Abraham’s faith and telling him to kill his son. Just before he killed his son the angel came and told him to stop. I was the director and Kane was the actor. He played the part so good.” He was bright, she says, but struggled with reading. “I think he was a bit dyslexic.”Young Kane and Alex were inseparable. Then suddenly he wasn’t there any more. She thinks she was 13 when they were told that Kane was going to live with his grandmother. Can she remember the day he left? “It was horrible. We were all crying.” She later discovered her parents had hoped to adopt Kane.He would occasionally return to visit the family, but she says he seemed different – less innocent and carefree. “After he left my mum he got into drug-taking, and when people take drugs they get desperate don’t they? I was told he was taking heroin soon after he left.” After one visit when he was 16, Davis discovered her phone was missing. Her mother told her Kane had stolen it. She didn’t believe her. So her parents took her round to Kane’s house, where he burst out crying and admitted he had taken it. She was devastated, and broke off contact with him.For around eight years they never saw each other, though she didn’t stop thinking about him. She still doesn’t know what he was doing in this time. But one of Rankine’s videos provides a clue: Kane tells the pastor he and his then girlfriend had been living in council property, but became homeless after being penalised by the bedroom tax.One day Davis saw him sitting on a street with his girlfriend. She was shocked. “She was skin and bone, like she was going to die. And he told me she was pregnant. I looked at her and thought there is no way her body would be able to maintain carrying a child. I was shocked about the state of him and his situation.” He told her that both his mother and grandmother had died. When she replied that her own mother wasn’t very well, Kane went ballistic. “He said: ‘No! It’s not your mum, it’s my mum. Your mum is my mum,’ and he gives me a big lecture. ‘You’re my sister. You’re not my foster sister. She’s not my foster mum. She’s. My. Mum.’ He said ‘Why did they take me away from mum, because I was happy there.’”From then on she saw him regularly on the streets. He told her things he had withheld when they were young. He said he had been abused as a child before he came to the Davises. “I think he had wanted to protect me from it,” she says. “When he got older he was very vocal about saying what had happened to him. He just blurted everything out. It was heartbreaking.”What upset her most was seeing him sitting on the pavement. She thought he was humiliating himself. “One day, I said: ‘I’ve had enough of this. Just get up now. You weren’t raised on the floor, that’s not where you came from. I said: ‘I’m serious, I’m sick and tired of going to sleep worried whether you’re dead or alive. Get up now.’ And I said: ‘We’re going to support you, get you a phone, and you will not sell this phone.’”Did he seem different? “He was troubled and agitated, but you could see he was the same Kane.” Was he still smiling? She shakes her head. “He wasn’t smiling. I could see he was in serious difficulty.” Davis might never have experienced street homelessness, but she understood what Kane was going through. She and her children had briefly ended up homeless after fleeing an abusive relationship.Over the next few months she would often meet Kane in town, and take him for a meal with the children. One day he was distraught. “I said: ‘Come here and give your sister a big hug.’ And he said, ‘I’ve got HIV.’ He was in tears, and I was so upset. I said: ‘Don’t worry. We can do this together, you can go on medication and still have a normal life.’” She was told he had been gang raped on the streets, but doesn’t know if that was true.After buying him the phone, they became as close as they had been when they were children. For four months they would talk to each other every day. “It wasn’t just once either, he’d call me eight times a day. Sometimes he’d be great – ‘Hi Alex, how are you doing, sis?’ – and sometimes it was like: ‘I don’t want to live any more.’”Davis took Kane to hospital appointments and out for meals with the children. Even though he was unkempt, she felt proud to be with him. “He had this fast, strong walk. He was so confident in town. He’d be going around saying: ‘Hi, hi,’ to everyone. When I walked around town with him I felt protected. He had a swagger.” Kane moved off the streets and into a hostel, and appeared to be doing well.And then around October last year the calls stopped. Davis learned later that his phone had been stolen. She went into town and couldn’t find him. She called the local hostels, and eventually one said he had been living there but had moved out. She wasn’t sure if he had left of his own accord or been kicked out. In tears, she called the police, said she was terrified for him and asked if they knew where he was. Later that night, she received a call from the police saying he’d been spotted walking around town and was fine, but they could not disclose any more information. “I said ‘I’ve been taking care of him, I’ve been doing support work with him, I need to know where he is.’ They said: ‘Sorry, that’s not information we’re willing to disclose to you.’ And a couple of months later my brother was dead.”It’s 9.30pm in the centre of Birmingham and Rankine’s team is about to start the night’s outreach. They come out armed with sandwiches, drinks and prayers. There seems to be someone sleeping rough – or trying to sleep – in every nook and cranny of the city. Dave is in his late 60s, has a gammy leg and has been sleeping rough for most of his adult life. Sam, in his 20s, split up from his girlfriend three weeks ago and is begging outside a pub. He has no addiction issues, but you wonder what state he will be in if he doesn’t get support soon. He says he won’t touch the hostels because they are full of booze, drugs and violence. A story we hear time and again – all over the country.Rankine asks the homeless people whether they will pray with him, and tells them he is baptising at the weekend if they are interested. Some actively want to pray with him, some agree to, and a few tell him to get lost. “Fuck off, I don’t want to be ambushed by a priest!” shouts one man. Rankine smiles. “It’s OK,” he tells us. “He’ll be begging for that prayer in a couple of weeks. These streets are not nice. If he doesn’t pray, who’s going to protect him tonight when he’s sleeping? I know guys who will come along, start searching his things and stamp on his head. If that guy dies tonight, he’ll do so without a prayer.” Rankine may not be to everybody’s taste, but he clearly has a genuine relationship with many of Birmingham’s street homeless.It’s midnight and we’re in the grounds of St Philip’s Cathedral, known as Pigeon Park – a common meeting place for the homeless and outreach workers. A group of young people gather. There are two main topics of conversation – black mamba and the latest roll-call of street deaths. Whatever postmortems may show, they are sure it’s mamba that’s killing the homeless. One drag and it can be fatal, they say. They talk among themselves about the recent death of Fungi, who starred in the reality TV show Benefits Street. Fungi did not die on the streets, but he had been homeless on and off for many years, and was much loved.Dan and Rachel are recovering addicts who were friends of Kane. With the help of Rankine, they have managed to get off the streets and are now living in decent accommodation. Tonight they are out to catch up with homeless friends and chat. Things are good, they say, but they miss their street family.Rachel and Dan are discussing Kane’s final day and why paramedics didn’t take him to hospital when they were called to him early in the morning. Another friend had called an ambulance because he was delirious and appeared to be overdosing. Kane refused to be seen by the paramedics, putting his sleeping bag over his head and saying he wanted to sleep. Rachel and Dan say he was in no fit state to make that decision, and that if he had been taken to hospital his life could have been saved. Other friends also say this to us. An ambulance was again called to Kane that afternoon, but when it arrived he was no longer breathing. He was confirmed dead at the scene at 4.16pm on 27 January this year.They lead us across the park to a shrine for the latest homeless person to die on the streets. Miguel was in his 20s and died in the doorway of a Lloyds bank. There are cellophane-wrapped flowers and a banner with pictures of a smiling young man saying: “You are unforgettable Miguel.” The message has been smudged by the rain and is fast becoming illegible.West Midlands ambulance service confirms it was called out twice to treat Kane that day – first at 8.27am, then at 3.39pm. “After assessing the patient,” it says, “the crew discharged him noting that the patient had refused treatment; they provided advice to Mr Walker’s friends at the scene that they should call 999 immediately if they had further concerns. No further calls were received until 3.39pm. The second call was to the same location … Unfortunately, despite advanced life support, it was not possible to save Mr Walker.”When invited to respond to comments made by Kane’s friends about the treatment he received, the ambulance service says: “Based on the comments the paper [the Guardian] has provided, a senior clinician has been assigned to review these two cases [the two callouts to Kane] to examine if there is any learning that can be taken from them. We would welcome the opportunity to speak to any of Mr Walker’s friends who have concerns.”It’s eight months since Kane died. Kane’s law is no nearer to becoming a reality, and Byrne says if he is elected mayor next May he hopes to introduce localised legislation in Birmingham. But there is another problem. While Byrne talks about the importance of safeguarding adult reviews for every death of a homeless person so we can discover everything that went wrong, the council won’t even share basic information with us about Kane’s life, such as whether he had care-leaver status (ie, was a care leaver at 16), what support he received, and whether anybody from the council’s vulnerable adults team was assigned to him. When we ask about Kane’s care record, the council says it will not provide this “without someone’s explicit permission”. But in this case it is not apparent whose permission it would seek; WKane’s parents and grandparents are dead, and he has no obvious next of kin.Back in the Bull Ring, Alex tells us that Kane’s dream was to start a foundation for homeless people providing food, counselling and therapy. She would love to do that on his behalf, but says she hasn’t got a clue where to start. She is still putting her faith in Kane’s law, and has a simple question for Byrne: “When will Kane’s law come into effect, because I can see plenty of homeless people sitting on the floor around Birmingham. It seems to me there is a lot of talk and not enough action.”She talks about the happy times she shared with her brother, and shows us a photograph of her and Kane together alongside a moving and detailed drawing of him. It was taken last year and means so much to her. “One day he said: ‘Come! Come!’ And I was like: ‘Where are you taking me?’ And he said: ‘I want to show you something.’ He goes: ‘People say I’m nothing, but I’m somebody. I’m famous. I’m in Birmingham Art Gallery.’ And I went: ‘Liar, I don’t believe you.’ And he said: ‘Come on, I’ll show you.’ So I’m running because he was walking so fast, and it was a really hot summer. And we got to the gallery and there it was. And I was like: ‘Oh my God! You are in Birmingham Art Gallery.’ And he said: ‘I told you!’” The portrait is by Obee, who gave a eulogy at Kane’s funeral. Davis zooms in on the photo. “Look at his eyes. He’s smiling with his eyes.”After their visit to the gallery, he went back to his hostel and spruced himself up. That night Kane called Davis. “He said: ‘Alex, I’ve had a wash and my clothes have been washed.’ He was so happy. He said, ‘See sis, I told you. I am somebody.’”In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

"The homeless death of Jake Humm: 'It was my deepest, darkest fear'","Jake Humm 1995-2018: He was a talented rapper with a loving father and access to support. So why did Jake die alone in a hostel, where his body lay undiscovered for two days? ",Simon Hattenstone,2019-09-24T06:00:17+0100,"Joules Humm has dedicated his left arm to his son, Jake. Every tattoo is a reference to him: his favourite numbers (one and three); his date of birth (13 October 1995); an image of the grim reaper alongside the words “Live now pay later”; a dragon koi, because Jake loved fishing; the musical notation for the chorus of his song Try Me. Then, tattooed along his forearm in script, is “Resilient J”, Jake’s rapper name.Jake had so much potential and was beginning to turn his life around. He had been sober for almost two years after drinking excessively since he was 16. After years in flux – pinballing from supported accommodation in Brighton to homeless hostels, squats and friends’ sofas – he seemed to be on the verge of getting his own place. He was even beginning to make inroads into the music industry: in January 2018, he joined in a filmed session with the hugely successful singer-songwriter Rag’n’Bone Man. But in the end, Resilient J wasn’t quite resilient enough. After losing a close friend to suicide and witnessing another overdosing, he relapsed. A three-week drinking binge followed, before he killed himself on 29 August 2018. Jake was 22.Suicide is the second-biggest killer of homeless people in the UK, and Brighton has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. The city is a transient place: great for holidaymakers and day trippers, but tough for many people growing up there. Austerity has rattled Brighton, producing a lack of secure employment and affordable housing, which has led to some of the highest rates of rough sleeping and homelessness outside London. Cuts have decimated social care and education, contributing to a mounting youth crisis and communities where one in three children are living in poverty. At the same time, the influx of wealthier people (often second-home owners) to the city has increased house prices.Jake didn’t leave a suicide note. It is impossible to know exactly what was going through his mind at the end. But the more you look into this life, the more you see all these elements coming into play – transience, loneliness, cuts to social care and support groups, unregulated services and, ultimately, institutional failings.We meet Jake’s father in a cafe on Brighton’s seafront, underneath the bandstand where Jake loved to hang out with friends. Joules is accompanied by Michelle Hunter, a project team leader at the YMCA DownsLink Group, which was supporting Jake at the time of his death. It is nine months since he died, and Joules is still staggering towards an understanding and acceptance of what happened. Jake was his only child, his fishing partner, his soulmate. And yet, as is so often the case, there were tensions; they bickered and, ultimately, couldn’t live with each other.Hunter had known Jake for years. She says he adored his father, and tells us how she and Joules would work together, behind his back, to try to keep Jake’s life on track. She talks about Jake with huge affection and emotion. She is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a little defensive.He was one of our young people. Once you’ve come to us and we’re there, the door is always openJoules, a 48-year-old carpenter, says it is uncanny how much he and Jake had in common – the same hobbies, obsessions and weaknesses. It was Joules who introduced Jake to music (all sorts, from Led Zeppelin to Eminem), taught him how to fish and encouraged his tidiness, which later became a fixation. But there was more. Joules knew exactly how tough it could be for young people, men in particular, trying to make their way in Brighton. He had moved there from London as a young man. Like Jake, he was creative, funny and handsome. Like Jake, he had struggled to make ends meet, battled depression and alcoholism (he last drank eight years ago) and spent time sofa surfing and in temporary accommodation. There is little that Jake went through that his father didn’t understand. Joules says there were times when he, too, was suicidal.Joules says he and his son always had a special bond. Jake’s parents split up when he was about four; Joules says he was denied custody because he was living in temporary accommodation. Four years later, when Joules was settled, Jake moved into a flat with him.726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures. Over the next few months, G2 and Guardian Cities will look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain’s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life – what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by.In some ways, Jake was a natural leader. At the age of seven, he was a star of the local football team, Saltdean United. Joules says he showed a rare maturity. “If someone was not pulling their weight in a certain position, rather than stand up front for the glory, Jake would drop into that position.” But in other ways, he struggled. School didn’t know what to do with Jake. He was bright, good with words, but he couldn’t settle. He played truant, and was disruptive when he did turn up.At the age of 14, he was being seen by the child and adolescent mental health services. Eventually, he was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder. He wasn’t violent or aggressive, but he was pig-headed. He would find daft, random ways of getting into trouble at school. Joules tells the story of the marrow. “He went into a biology classroom and he picked up a marrow that the year below were growing, and one of the kids said: ‘You can have it, Jake.’” When the teachers asked him to return it, he refused, telling them it was a gift. He was deliberately winding them up. But the game got out of hand. By the end of the day, it had become a perverse matter of principle. “Jake climbed up on the school roof and launched it across the playground so nobody could have it,” says Joules. “That’s when he got into trouble, because it could have hit somebody.”It is such a mild act of rebellion, yet somehow it sums up Jake’s brooding sense of injustice, that all was not well with the world. On social media he would vent his anger at all that was wrong with society. He became a conspiracy theorist, convinced that the US government was behind the bombing of the twin towers.He was 16, still at school and already drinking too much when he decided to leave home. Joules agreed it was the best thing. There were no dramas, he says; they just needed their own space. “The relationship didn’t break down, but both of us could see where it was going. Maybe it was an alpha-male thing. It wasn’t a case of me saying: ‘Jake, you’ve gotta go.’ It was kind of a mutual thing. It was quite calm; it wasn’t ugly.”Jake moved into accommodation at the YMCA in Brighton, a supported hostel with space for up to 15 residents. Hunter remembers that the first time she saw him he was wearing his school uniform. He was drinking more and more heavily, and started as he meant to go on – with spirits. We ask Joules where he got the money. Joules smiles and says he doesn’t think the local Co-op would have been best pleased with his son. When Jake wasn’t drinking, he would become agitated. At times, he would self-harm.Alcohol is strictly prohibited at the YMCA. Jake lasted almost a year with the charity before being evicted after a “number of incidents involving anti-social behaviour”. Hunter says there was no choice – he was breaking the rules and making it tough for others. She insists the YMCA continued to support him. “To us, he was one of our young people,” she says. “Once you’ve come to us and we’re there, the door is always open.” The door may have been open, but Jake was no longer allowed to sleep at the YMCA.After the YMCA, Jake’s living situation fell into chaos. He bounced around every kind of housing project throughout Brighton, Newhaven and further afield. He and Joules remained close, but they knew it wouldn’t work if he moved back in. Jake had admitted that there were numerous occasions when he was offered help and refused it.In October 2016, as he turned 21, he decided to take himself in hand and checked into a 10-day detox programme in London. At the end of that month, Jake announced to his Facebook friends: “A new chapter in my life is on the horizon, a life without drink an drugs, no doubt my demons will wanna war but [it’s] a war I’m gonna win!!! bring on tomorrow!”For a long time, it looked as if he was winning it. After kicking the booze, he got back into shape, took on voluntary work and strengthened his relationship with his father. Jake and Joules spent weeks together camped out on lakes, catching and posing with carp the size of pitbulls. For the first time in five years, Jake moved back in with the YMCA – this time into semi-independent accommodation, which he hoped would be a stepping stone towards independence. He also embarked on a period of ferocious creativity.The music organisation AudioActive is based in an old warehouse in Brighton. It looks like any old ramshackle building, until you enter and discover a rabbit warren of recording studios. AudioActive helps young people express themselves through music, and this is where Jake created some of his best work. For almost two years after Jake became clean, he attended a weekly session called Room to Rant, which provided just that. He was one of half a dozen struggling young men who turned up to express their anger, frustration and talent through music. Jake was older than most of his fellow ranters, but younger than the youth workers who supported them. He ended up close to both groups.In the video with Rag’n’Bone Man, Jake explained what Room to Rant had done for him. “There’s not enough places for young men to be able to express themselves and express their feelings. Whatever it is on your mind, you can come here and you’re not going to be judged for it,” he said. “You’re not going to have someone looking down their nose, like: ‘Oh, you’re weak, or you’re vulnerable,’ because we’re not. We just have trouble sometimes with life.”Tom Hines, AudioActive’s project manager, leads us to a studio where we meet four of Jake’s friends. Olly and Rob are regular ranters, while Ed Hallwood and Jon Clark are AudioActive mentors. Olly and Rob have also been homeless. Rob, clad head to toe in sportswear, is buzzing with restless energy. He rocks from one subject to another: his dramatic weight loss; the occasion he was battered by a police officer, leaving him with a classic boxer’s nose; AudioActive’s amazing equipment. Olly is quiet and still.Both boys talk about the horrors of hostel life and a welfare system they feel has let them down. “Hostels are shitholes,” Olly says. “I’ve got friends who were really fucked up by them. There are not people looking out for you the way they should be, and there’s drugs everywhere. I’ve had friends kicked out of the same shitty hostels for small reasons without a place to go.” Perhaps the hostels can’t win – after all, Jake felt hard done by when he was evicted for drinking. The one thing the boys seem uneasy talking about is Jake. After they leave, Hines tells us that Jake’s friends haven’t come to terms with his death, that it is still raw.Hines and his fellow mentors talk about Jake with love, admiration and pain. It feels like a group therapy session. Hines says Jake was like an older brother to the ranters: they listened to him, because he had been through it all. “He was happy to tell young people the dangers of drink and drugs. When I was about to do my job, I’d find he’d jump in and do it for me.”All three men agree he was the most talented rapper at AudioActive. “It was as if everything else in his week was funnelled into those two hours,” Clark says. “He’d turn up and have three or four new things he’d done. He’d do one and we’d all be gobsmacked, and do the next one and the next one, and it seemed like he was writing every night and this was his forum. This was his place to go and make it happen.”One of the reasons we couldn’t get funding is we couldn’t measure our impact. Unfortunately, we kind of can nowThe word they use again and again is “fierce” – not about Jake, but about his music. Jake didn’t run away from reality, or soften and sanitise, or big himself up in his lyrics. He rapped about addiction, homelessness, mental health, friendship, love. He was political, but not in an ideological way. “He would walk down the high street and analyse all the forces at work,” Clark says.They knew he was struggling at times – all the young men at Room to Rant were. There was even one occasion when he stood at the door screaming that he was sick of life and wanted out. But moments later, they say, he was smiling, anticipating a big future for himself. After all, he was Resilient J.Yes, he rapped about feeling desperate, Hines says, but rappers tend to rap in character. “I’ve talked to thousands of rappers, and you can’t just take the lyrics at face value. They’re often stories, they’re often metaphorical. People say all sorts of things about death, and sometimes it’s just the best rhyme for that scheme.” Hines says it is the most difficult part of his job – distinguishing between the rapper in character and the cry for help from the individual.Hallwood says that, of all the people who attended Room to Rant, Jake was the one he worried about least, because he was so sure he was destined for success. He talks about the last time he saw him – at the final Room to Rant session. “I didn’t have Jake as a Facebook friend, but it didn’t matter, because I had in my mind that next time I see Jake he’s gonna be on a viral YouTube video, or on a poster bill next to his favourite rappers.”Did anything happen towards the end of his life that may have made him fall off the wagon? The room goes quiet. “This is really important,” Hines says eventually. “We ran out of funding. Room to Rant had to close.” The grant, provided by Brighton and Hove clinical commissioning group, was for £5,000 – enough to run Room to Rant for a year. “One of the reasons we couldn’t get funding is we couldn’t measure our impact,” Hines says. “Unfortunately, we kind of can now, because another young man quickly ended up in jail and Jake lost a support network. There was a real sense of loss there.”How did Jake feel about Room to Rant ending? “He wasn’t happy about it,” Hines says. “No one was,” adds Clark. “Brighton can be a very difficult city to make real friends,” Hallwood says. “Especially for young people. You can find a lot of people who will happily drink with you, happily snort coke with you. You’ll feel like friends because you’re opening up while on drugs, but very few of them will actually put their hand on your shoulder and go: ‘Are you all right?’” That is why Room to Rant was so special for Jake and the others. “They were together a couple of years,” Hines says. “That’s a long time. When a group of young men really open up in front of each other, it makes them very close.”In her tiny office in a building called Norman Shaw North, near the Houses of Parliament, Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, burns with contained rage. She says Brighton and Hove city council has been devastated by the loss of more than £100m in core government grants since 2010. A report published last November by the housing charity Shelter revealed that Brighton and Hove had the second-highest rate of homelessness in Britain outside London, with 4,317 people registered homeless – one in 67 of the population. In 2017, Brighton and Hove recorded 178 street homeless people, second only to Westminster among England’s local authorities.It was hardly a surprise that taking housing benefit away from under-21s led to more young people being on the streetsLast year, there was a dramatic fall, to 64. But these figures were controversial – the council admitted it had changed the way it reached its total of street homeless people, and the figures were collated on a snowy November night when many homeless people were thought to have taken refuge indoors. Meanwhile, data published by the Office for National Statistics showed that, between 2013 and 2017, there were an estimated 48 homeless deaths in Brighton – among the 10 highest figures for local authorities in England and Wales.Lucas believes the homelessness crisis is a shocking but inevitable consequence of government policy. If you refuse to build council homes, sell off the remaining stock and strip young people of housing benefit, she asks, what else can you expect? “It was hardly a surprise that taking housing benefit away from under-21s led to more young people being on the streets. It’s a callous disregard. The government is content to see that as the collateral damage of its economic ideology.”Lucas is alarmed by the rates of homelessness and suicide in Brighton and is urging the council to hold an inquiry. The problem, she says, is that so much of the data is confidential. Without access to data, it is virtually impossible to find exactly where people have been failed. She has also been distressed by her own impotence. In January 2017, the Greens on the council proposed a 24/7, year-round shelter to ensure that nobody had to sleep on the streets: a simple enough plan with obvious benefits. But they were told it wasn’t possible. “We were told there just wasn’t the money for it,” says Lucas. “We proposed using council-owned buildings, at least to get a temporary roof over people’s heads. But, actually, the more you learn, the more complex it is in the sense that there isn’t a cost-free option, because people have got to be safe, and to make places safe costs money.” At the inquest into Jake’s death in January 2019, the coroner, Veronica Hamilton-Deeley, considered Jake’s relapse. She heard evidence about the suicide of his friend four months before he died and said it would have reminded him of another suicide (that of his step-sister, years earlier) and led to a rapid downward spiral. “This would have been history repeating itself for him,” said Hamilton-Deeley. “This instability would have played a huge part. It’s very hard to cope with everything and your own struggles when you’re low.” She concluded that he had killed himself, that it was “an impulsive act” and that he “obviously had the support around him”.Yet his social media posts suggest his suicide was anything but impulsive. He documented his final three weeks in unsparing detail, telling his friends he was back on the booze and this time determined to drink himself to death. Jake seemed to revel in his relapse. He announced it enthusiastically to his Instagram followers on 9 August 2018, with a picture of bottles of Coke and spirits and a Marilyn Monroe CD resting on top of his coffee table, captioned with the hashtags #relapse and #dontdothingsbyhalves. His inner battles spilled out on to his social media timelines, revealing shifts in mood from hope to despair. Five days into his binge, he posted on Facebook a list of all the drink and drugs he had consumed, while expressing confusion at still being alive with a laughing emoji.Over the next couple of days, the breezy take on his self-destruction was replaced with scathing rebukes of psychiatry and therapy, and a desperate lament for the perceived lack of support he had received. Jake ended the post by saying he hoped the alcohol “puts me in my grave in the next few days”. Days later, Jake seemed to have changed his mind again when he posted a picture of the empty bottles resting on his bed and announced he had sobered up. He even recorded himself pouring a bottle of Jack Daniel’s down a toilet. Now it was all about the future. “Watch this space next 2 years are gonna be a madness, focused an driven be ready when I call on u ... I see something new, I see another way out,” he wrote. This renewed optimism was short-lived, however: he relapsed again four days later.However anguished they were, these posts often went unliked and uncommented on. He became nostalgic for his childhood. He recalled his days at Saltdean United, including the occasion he almost scored a brilliant overhead kick in a new pair of boots (“Best years of my life so far thank u everyone that was apart of the team and the mums and dads that showed their support even in the pissing down rain”).On 26 August, he wrote a bleak and tender poem – one that echoes so much of what people have told us about him.My heart is pure,My mind distortsMy souls of course,The systems flawedI don’t live like societyAn abide by the law,Never believed inThe Lies you boughtNever agreed with howSchools taughtI see the world for what it isNow my eyes are so soreOn 29 August, the day Jake killed himself, he talked with friends on his feed about meeting up for a chat and buying a new Panic! At the Disco album, but his desolation was evident. Then he posted this:Laying on my floorWith a bottle full of brandy ...I just want to be dead,Coz I’ve got nothing leftNothing to hold on toEverything’s been saidI’ve got a girl in my bedBut I don’t even careBut I do I’m just scared.By now, he seemed exhausted, terrified and desperately lonely. “All I want is real love. In these days it seems impossible,” he wrote. He asked his father for money in a Facebook post, told him how much he adored him, then hanged himself. Joules was away that day and didn’t see the post.When the police came to inform Joules of his son’s death, he says he told them why they were there. “For a long time, deep down, it was my deepest, darkest fear. That’s why I knew when they came to the door.” Since that day, Joules has constantly interrogated himself about his role in his son’s suicide. “The hardest thing for me, even now, is to not beat myself up about it,” Joules says, his voice breaking. “You don’t need to,” Hunter says gently. “I like to think, deep down, that I did everything possible,” Joules says. “He did,” Hunter says to us. “But that does not stop me from kicking myself every day,” Joules adds.Jake’s body was discovered after other residents in the YMCA-run house in which he was living complained of smelly drains. “If you remember last year, we had a heatwave,” Joules says. “And I think the rest is pretty self-explanatory.”It was Hunter who discovered Jake, after he had been dead for two days. “And there’s my guilt,” she says. She is in tears; it is Joules’s turn to comfort her.The room in which Jake died is a little more than 200 metres from where we are seated with Joules and Hunter at the bandstand on the beach. We walk up to Bedford Square. It is the first time Joules has visited the building – a Regency townhouse – since Jake died there. Hunter points to the top floor, where Jake’s room was. Joules looks up and breaks down. He walks away, weeping.So many of Jake’s social posts in his final three weeks read like cries for help that went unheard. Yet throughout this time, he was living in semi-independent YMCA accommodation and was seen by Pavilions, the Brighton-based treatment centre for drug and alcohol abuse. Jake’s care co-ordinator at Pavilions, Paula Hinks, told the inquest that, during an appointment in August last year, he had said he was enjoying drinking and had no intention of giving up.We ask Pavilions if it was also aware of his suicidal thoughts, whether it shared information about his relapse with support staff at the YMCA and whether it considered sectioning Jake under the Mental Health Act. Pavilions tells us it does not share any information regarding the treatment and care of its service users because it is confidential.Hunter’s concern and affection for Jake could not be more apparent. Yet there is still a question mark about whether the YMCA did all it could do to protect him from himself when he was at his most vulnerable. Was Bedford Square sufficiently staffed to monitor Jake’s fatal three-week binge?Shortly after meeting Joules and Hunter, we receive an email from the YMCA DownsLink Group saying it would like to help in any way possible. We ask how many staff work at Bedford Square and whether they are residential. But the return email is surprisingly unhelpful. “My understanding is that the article is about Jake’s story and we want to keep it focused on him, therefore we don’t think the questions regarding our staffing and services etc are necessary,” says a manager at the YMCA DownsLink Group.We ask the YMCA whether it knew that Jake was drinking and suicidal. “We were aware that Jake had started using alcohol again in the weeks before his death,” the YMCA tells us. “Staff were supporting him to access specialist mental health and substance misuse services. Jake also expressed suicidal thoughts and we therefore agreed a ‘safe plan’ with him on 17 August.” When we ask what Jake’s safe plan involved, the YMCA does not respond. It does, though, quote the coroner’s findings that Jake “obviously had the support around him”.When Jake committed to things, he gave 150%, including his death. He meant what he did, as hard as that is to sayThe YMCA describes itself as “the largest provider of safe, supported accommodation for young people in England and Wales”, offering more than 9,100 beds, “which includes everything from emergency accommodation through to supported longer-term housing and youth hostels”. Although the YMCA is regulated by the Charity Commission and the Regulator of Social Housing, much of the support offered in its accommodation is unregulated. The semi-independent home in Bedford Square, where Jake died, is self-regulating because it provides support rather than “personal care”. This means that its support is neither monitored by the Care Quality Commission nor Ofsted, despite the fact that residents may be as young as 16.We ask Brighton and Hove city council if it is considering an inquiry into Jake’s death. The council quotes the coroner’s verdict, saying: “We do not see any basis for conducting a further inquiry into these circumstances. We had no involvement in the care he received from the YMCA DownsLink Group in the period leading up to his death, and have no comment to make on it.”However, the YMCA tells us it conducted an internal review after Jake’s death. We ask if the review considered whether the YMCA should have had Jake sectioned or moved into supported accommodation, whether they had seen Jake enough in the weeks leading up to his death and whether it was satisfactory that he had been left for at least two days despite being a known suicide risk. The YMCA did not answer these questions, but it did say: “Our review concluded that there were no errors or omissions in the service we provided, despite the sad outcome. However, we did identify some changes we could make, such as, for example, introducing a ligature risk assessment whereby potential ligature points could be identified and promptly removed if a resident was deemed to be at risk of suicide or self-harm.”For Caroline Lucas, self-regulation is simply not good enough. “Whenever you’ve got institutions that are unregulated, then you’re putting people at risk, because mistakes happen. Interventions should have happened and they didn’t, and risk factors should have been recognised and they weren’t.”It has been just over a year since Jake’s death. At AudioActive, they are continuing to feel the fallout. The project manager, Tom Hines, says his job has changed – much of it now is about safeguarding. He worries that he is nannying too many of the youngsters he works with. “It’s made my life a bit harder – I probably bother kids more than I should do.” One piece of good news is that they have managed to find the funds to relaunch Room to Rant, partly through donations made at Jake’s funeral, including £500 from Rag’n’Bone Man.As for Joules, he seems to be in a more profound state of shock than he was when we first met him three months ago. Recently, he had to talk one of Jake’s friends out of killing himself. Over the past week, he says two more young people have died through suicide in Brighton. Both of them knew Jake. He still believes that, ultimately, his son was determined to kill himself. “When Jake committed to things, he gave 150%, including his death. He meant what he did, as hard as that is to say.”He says he misses his son so much, and a day doesn’t pass without a what-if. Often, when he is out fishing on the lake by himself, he will tear into Jake for his stupidity, for leaving him in the lurch. “I swear at him a lot,” Joules says. “I’m not angry with him. I’ll be sitting there thinking about things we did, and it just hits you, and I’ll be like: ‘Yeah, you little bastard, we won’t be doing that again, will we?’”Nowadays, he says, it feels as if he has got an extended family – father to none and father to all. So many of Jake’s friends turn to him for advice, but he is in no state to carry their load. He has got enough baggage of his own. “To be honest, I’m struggling,” he says.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The homeless death of Aimee Teese: 'I didn't think it would come to this at 30',"Aimee Teese 1988-2019:  She was a much-loved mum with a ‘massive, infectious laugh’. So why did Aimee die in a tent in Liverpool city centre? ",Simon Hattenstone,2019-09-17T06:00:19+0100,"Aimee Teese’s final words to her friend and outreach worker Michelle Langan were: “Look after yourself.” Hours later, on 8 January this year, she was found dead in a tent on the outskirts of Liverpool city centre. Within three months, on 2 April, Richard Kehoe was discovered comatose in a tent opposite the Royal Liverpool hospital. Soon after, he was pronounced dead.Three days later, Liverpool’s mayor, Joe Anderson, announced he would remove all tents from Liverpool city centre. “We are going to give people a warning, give them an hour to take their tent down and say: ‘Here is a place for you to sleep, we will pick you up, take you with your goods.’”It was a dramatic – possibly draconian – statement. Anderson called the policy tough love, and said there was no other option. He was not prepared to have homeless people dying on his streets, hidden in tents. “When Richard Kehoe or Aimee Teese die, then we have all failed,” he said.726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures.

They have come to signify our fractured society. This is the seventh-wealthiest country in the world, where the disparity between rich and poor continues to grow, and where, according to Shelter, 320,000 people are homeless (roughly one in 200 of the population). Last year, it was reported by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism that at least 449 people had died in the UK while homeless in the 12 months up to October 2018.We meet Aimee’s aunt, Cathy Teese, in a tapas bar in Liverpool. A 45-year-old special-needs teacher, Cathy’s youthfulness belies the tough life she has led. Her drug-addicted father killed himself by setting fire to the family home when she was 11 (thankfully, there was no one else in the house), and her mother was left to bring up four children alone: Stephen, Aimee’s father John, Paul and Cathy.“Losing our dad hit the four of us in different ways,” she says. “The older two went to drugs, and me and Paul never touched drugs. I’m too scared of them. I’ve seen too much. I’ve instilled that into my girls as well.”Cathy’s oldest brother, Stephen, died when he was 35. Aimee’s mother, Jackie, who was also dependent on drugs, died aged 29 and was buried alongside Aimee’s brother, Mikey, who died when he was 14 months old.She didn’t set out to hurt people. You wouldn’t have met her and gone: ‘She’s a pain in the arse.’ You’d say: ‘Isn’t she a cracking girl?’Cathy apologises for rattling off these tragedies. “I must seem heartless. I can talk about it without emotion these days,” she says. But while Cathy is tough, she is also warm and selfless; a woman who has not just survived, but thrived.When Aimee was three years old, she was taken into care and fostered. Cathy, who was 17 and pregnant, fought for contact with her niece. The courts granted once a month, which increased to once a week, and she and Aimee became close. Then, when Cathy was 25, social services called out of the blue.“It was a Friday afternoon. ‘Hiya, are you able to take Aimee tonight?’ It was as quick as that because her relationship with the foster parents had broken down.” Cathy’s daughters, Lydia and Autumn, began sharing a room, and Aimee, who was almost 11, got a room to herself. “She was older. She’d been through a lot more. She had to get the room,” Cathy says. Aimee immediately fitted in. Lydia and Autumn had gained an older sister.Cathy and Aimee had a special bond. “We’d just lie on the bed and have a conversation. She’d tell me how much she loved me and I’d tell her how much I loved her.” Even as a young teenager, she says, what Aimee wanted most was to be a mum – to nurture and love a child in a way her own mother had never been able to.“She had a massive, infectious laugh,” Cathy says. “The girls would be upstairs with the Spice Girls on and our Aimee was the worst dancer ever, honest to God! She had no rhythm, but my two girls were brilliant. So I used to take the piss. I’d say: ‘Come on, do the Spice Girls,’ and she’d go: ‘No, no, no, no, go out of the room and I’ll do it,’ but I wouldn’t. I’d be by the door and go: ‘Oh my God!’” Was Aimee upset? “Nooo! We had a right giggle about it.”But Aimee grew more rebellious. At 14, she started drinking. Often she would have a drink early in the morning and her school would phone Cathy to complain. Aimee would stay out late, and Cathy would tick her off, but Aimee could always talk her round. “She had the gift of the gab. She was really popular. She was funny, she won over everybody.” What made her special, Cathy says, is that she never judged others. “You could have four heads and no legs and she wouldn’t be arsed. She was amazing.”The drinking got worse. Cathy encouraged Aimee to come out Thai boxing with the rest of the family, but she wouldn’t. When they came back home, they would find that Aimee could have got through five bottles of beer. “She was battling stuff in her own head,” Cathy says. “She talked to me about her mum. She’d say she wished she had what we had as a family.” Even though Cathy treated her like her own, Aimee was conscious that she wasn’t her daughter. “Living with girls who call me Mum, that’s a smack in the face,” Cathy says.The more Aimee drank, the more worried Cathy became about the influence her niece was having on her own children. “I spoke to social services; it got to the stage where it was too much to cope with.” At 15, Aimee went to live with her grandmother in Deal, Kent. She returned briefly to Cathy’s home, and tried her best. But by then she was also abusing substances. “I had a rule that if you’re drinking and doing drugs, I can’t have you around the house. It’s probably one of my regrets,” Cathy says. Even now, you can still see her weighing it up. “But maybe not, because I didn’t want my girls to see what I’d seen when I was growing up.”At 17, Aimee was given a council house. In retrospect, Cathy says this was almost as dangerous as providing her with nothing. “It was a proper bloody house, with a dining room and everything. She couldn’t cope with that. The whole street was terrace housing, and it was all bums outside. I remember walking down the street and every house was occupied by young people.” Liverpool’s most vulnerable young people had been provided for, but not supported, given homes to play adults in, doss, get wasted and deal drugs.Aimee was moved into a flat – smaller, more practical, in a better location. She was almost 20, clean and pregnant. Although she and the baby’s father broke up, she embarked on the happiest, most stable period of her life. “She was fantastic, a natural with babies,” says Cathy. “She didn’t need teaching anything. I’d ask her advice as much as the other way round. At school meetings, she was faultless.” Aimee volunteered as a cleaner in a care home when her daughter, Emily*, was at nursery. At this stage, Cathy and Aimee were more like sisters. Cathy split up with her partner of 22 years, and it was her niece, now 24, she looked to for comfort. “She was the first person I went to. She was just there for me.” They would sit in pyjamas and Aimee would roll cigarettes. “I was off the ciggies so I’d say, ‘Let me just have one’ and she’d be like, ‘No.’” Aimee was reckless herself, but a strict disciplinarian with those she loved.Everything seemed too good to be true. Then Aimee became involved with an abusive man. She started drinking and taking drugs again, and handed Emily over to another aunt because she couldn’t cope. Before long she had lost her house and was living on the streets. Cathy lost contact with her.Five years ago, when Cathy was pregnant with her son Earl, she heard Aimee was homeless. “Someone said: ‘Your Aimee’s begging outside Sainsbury’s,’ and I went: ‘Are you sure?’ She said: ‘Yeah, I took a photo of her.’” How did she feel? “Devastated. We’ve lost so many people in our family to drugs. I thought about my mum, who was close to Aimee. I thought, bloody hell, it’s not fair on her.”A few months later, Aimee turned up for a traumatic reunion. Cathy had just given birth to Earl after a caesarean section, and by now Aimee, who was bisexual, was living with a woman called Marie. “I’d just had a C-section, and I was at home in the bath in terrible pain. In marches Aimee up the stairs into the bathroom. She was pissed as a fart. She was just so overwhelmed with Earl, because she’d had a little brother, Mikey, and Mikey had died. All she kept saying to me while I was pregnant was: ‘I hope it’s a boy, hope it’s a boy.’ And she was just crying and stroking his face. I didn’t want to take that moment away from her.” But she knew she didn’t want Aimee to return in this condition. “I’d just had a baby. I couldn’t have her coming around like this. I was gutted, though. I felt I’d turned my back on her.”In November 2018, Aimee turned up unannounced at her grandmother’s house and stayed for a couple of weeks. Cathy says Aimee knew her nan, Cathy’s mother, would forgive her anything. But one day Aimee said she was going out for cigarettes, and they never saw her again.Michelle Langan, the homelessness campaigner who saw Aimee hours before she died, has been listening intently; her charity, the Paper Cup Project, supported Aimee for most of her time on the streets. When Cathy talks of Aimee’s warmth and humour, Langan smiles; she remembers Aimee as a great talker. She never saw her begging, but people would give her money. “A guy I know said to me: ‘I spoke to her the night she died. I chatted to her and gave her a couple of quid to get a drink.’ That’s the kind of person she was.”Just because you’re homeless doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a choice about thingsAimee was generous, always guiding outreach workers to homeless people she considered vulnerable. She was less good at looking after herself. Langan says she looked terrible in the last few weeks of her life. Her gorgeous red hair had been ruined. “One day she turned up to see us and I said: ‘What the hell have you done to your hair?’ She said: ‘I don’t want to talk about it.’ It was like somebody had got scissors and chopped it. It was short, just tufts.”Aimee was sharing her tent with a male partner at the end of her life, and ticked many boxes for street homeless women – a survivor of domestic abuse, a substance and alcohol addict, chaotic family background and vulnerable on many fronts.Langan says homelessness, and the threat of homelessness, has become much worse in Liverpool in recent years. In May, an average of 86 people used the council’s emergency homeless refuge, Labre House, every night. Last year, more than 5,000 used the council’s Housing Options service, which aims to prevent families from becoming homeless. Langan counts the causes on her fingers – austerity, universal credit, the bedroom tax, plus cuts to mental health, addiction and homelessness services at a time when the need for them is increasing.Does she think that, with more resources, Aimee might still be alive? “Yes, she could have gone into rehab 20 times, and the 21st time it might have worked for her. At the moment it’s like: this is your one and only chance and if you fuck it up, you don’t get another.”Cathy is less certain Aimee could have been saved. “Was she let down? Personally I don’t think so. I think she was given the help from a young age all the way through. I think Stephen, my brother who died, was also given a lot of help.”Why wasn’t she in a hostel, at the very least? Langan says Aimee hated hostels, but that Liverpool is better than most cities in its provision for homeless people. “Liverpool has got shelter available every night,” she says. “We fought for this. Beforehand, all over the country it was just when the temperature was -3C or something you opened up a shelter, so I just kept battering the council about this. In the end, the mayor, Joe Anderson, decided to set up a shelter that was open every single night.”Labre House is named after the patron saint of homelessness, Benedict Joseph Labre. Unlike many shelters it offers refuge to anybody who is homeless, including those without recourse to public funds – mostly on mats or in sleeping bags in two long dormitories. It’s a start, Langan says, but far from perfect. “We speak to people on the streets and feed that back to the council. I was speaking to one guy and said: ‘Are you going to Labre tonight?’ And he said: ‘I’m a recovering drinker, and if I’m in a room where I can smell drink, that’s it for me.’ And it can be very intimidating for survivors of domestic violence. So it’s not suitable for everybody, but it’s better than nothing. When I asked Aimee about it she’d say: ‘Nah, it’s not for me.’”When Langan started the Paper Cup Project three years ago, she coaxed and, when necessary, shamed local politicians into walking the streets with her to acknowledge the extent of the homelessness problem. “Joe and I used to fight like cats and dogs. We hated each other.” Why? “Because in the papers he denied Liverpool had a homelessness problem for ages. He was fed misleading facts and figures, and I kept going: ‘This is bullshit.’ He’d say: ‘We’ve only got 12 homeless people,’ because the government said that when you count rough sleepers they have to be bedded down, so if someone is sitting in a doorway, they’re not counted. I got a couple of council cabinet members to come out with us, and they went back to Joe and said: ‘She’s actually right.’ I then had a chat with him. So now we’re on the same page, and that’s great.”For Langan, homelessness is a political problem. The Labour party made homelessness a priority when it came to power in 1997, and claimed its Rough Sleepers Initiative reduced rough sleeping by around three-quarters. In March this year, the Conservative government promised £46m over the next two years to help get people off the streets (providing 2,600 beds and 750 extra support staff), but Langan is scathing about its efforts. “We shouldn’t have a homelessness problem in 2019. Homeless people don’t have a vote, so the Tory government doesn’t give a shit about them.” Is it incompetence? “No, I think it’s cruelty and greed. We shouldn’t have people sleeping in doorways in a rich country.”Both she and Cathy call it an uncaring culture. “Society has become callous and cold. It’s me, me, me,” Langan says. Cathy nods. “It’s completely changed,” she says. “Just seeing people mocking each other, saying: ‘I’ve got this, you’ve got nothing.’” They talk about common attitudes to homeless people – be grateful for what you’re given, don’t complain, you are the undeserving poor. “There was a homeless lad we knew who was a vegetarian,” Langan says, “and when people gave him a ham butty he’d be like: ‘No thanks, I’m a vegetarian.’ And some people would be like: ‘Oooh, I tried to give him a butty, and he refused it!’ They’d take offence. I’d be like: ‘Well, did you actually ask him what he wanted?’ Just because you’re homeless doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a choice about things.”You can’t cut and cut and cut, and not accept consequences. Aimee’s death is a mixture of lack of joined-up thinking and cutsAs we leave, Cathy says she hopes she’s not been too harsh on Aimee. “She didn’t set out to hurt people, she just did along the way. You wouldn’t have met her and gone: ‘She’s a pain in the arse.’ You’d say: ‘Isn’t she a cracking girl?’”Outside the restaurant we’ve been talking in, two people are bedding down for the night. Both knew Aimee and say she was funny and loud. Mary* tells us she is 17 weeks pregnant and still taking heroin. Moses, a middle-aged man who could pass for elderly, is also an addict. He is filthy, sharp and welcoming. We sit down with them. Moses has a shocking abscess that gnaws deep into a knuckle.Two young women approach, and one hands over a large pizza box. Moses politely asks what it contains. “Ladies, don’t be offended, but if it’s the remains and it’s cold, it’s better to put it in the bin than give it to me.” The women stare at him, aghast. “Right! Just leave it with him!” screams one, before they stomp off into the night. The box contains the sodden remains of pizza and chips, and a half-eaten chicken leg.The Whitechapel Centre, Liverpool’s leading homeless and housing charity, is based in a Victorian school that has seen better days. The smell is overpowering – booze, fags and sweat. Outside, men (nearly all the service users here are men) smoke by themselves or in huddles. Inside, clients are being served cooked breakfasts, showering, getting legal advice, benefits help or support with their search for accommodation. One man is having his hair cut.David Carter, the chief executive of the Whitechapel Centre and Labre House, has worked with homeless people for decades. He measures the crisis in bald statistics. Five years ago, 1,800 people came through the Whitechapel’s doors; last year, it was 4,025. In 2014, the biggest cause of homelessness was relationship breakdown; now it’s debt. “The impact of welfare reforms has had such a deep impact on people’s ability to sustain accommodation,” he says. Few of the people they see are simply homeless – 71% have drug or alcohol addictions, 61% have mental health problems, 50% have escaped or experienced abuse.The problems are increasingly complex. For example, there are more and more long-term IV substance abusers with amputated limbs needing adapted properties. While the level of need has risen for many clients, austerity, welfare reforms and the economic downturn have all had an impact. “A lot of the preventive services have folded,” Carter says. “So not only do we have more people coming through, but, at the same time, the options for those people have also decreased.” He says the Whitechapel is lucky – the charity gets £2.2m a year from the council to fund its services and its 90 staff. But it’s still peanuts. How much money does he need? Double maybe, he says.We are joined by Liverpool’s mayor, Joe Anderson, who bombards us with more figures. By next year, Liverpool’s budget will have been slashed by £444m in a decade, or 64% in real terms – more than any other UK city. Anderson sounds like Alexei Sayle, sticks the boot into political adversaries with the same relish and has a fondness for the F-word. “We are spending £50m on housing benefit, which mainly goes to the private sector. Is that not fucking madness? If you built more social housing you wouldn’t be paying that housing benefit bill. It’s absolutely crazy and incompetent.”We ask Anderson the official number of rough sleepers in Liverpool city centre. He looks at Carter. “What’s your version?” Carter laughs. As Langan said the other night, there are many ways of recording the statistics.“Each month, our outreach workers record every homeless person they see,” Carter says. “Last month, we saw 76 people bedded down. It has been pretty stable over the past 12 months. Of them, I would say we got 55 into new or existing accommodation.”Both men say there are homeless fakes – people who come into the city to beg, to feed addictions or just make a bit of cash. But they are a small minority. Their priority is to get the genuinely homeless off the street. “The first rule is: ‘No second night out.’ When we identify someone sleeping rough, we have them accommodated the following day,” Anderson says. Another motto is: “There’s always room inside” – and Anderson insists there is, now that Labre House has opened.But the fact remains that both Aimee Teese and Richard Kehoe were street homeless when they died. How does Anderson feel about them dying within three months of each other in tents on the streets of his city? “Absolute anger. When we talk about eradicating homelessness, it’s not just about moving them out of tents, it’s not just about finding them accommodation, it’s about finding them a job, it’s about changing their lifestyle.” Aimee was imprisoned in the run-up to Christmas 2018, just after disappearing from her grandmother’s home, and Anderson says he was angry when he heard that she had been released, “still addicted, with all the demons she still had to face – and we weren’t told about it. And the worst thing is she stayed a bit out of the city centre in a grim area next to a housing estate that we’ve got boarded up. If we’d known about it, Whitechapel could have done something. She might not have died.”Who is Anderson most angry with? “The system. Everybody. Me!” How has he messed up? “I feel guilty because I manage a city council, a system, that is not joined up. It hurts. I remember David Cameron coming in and talking about the ‘big society’ – and it’s the fucking broken society. That’s what we’re dealing with. And you can’t cut and cut and cut, and not accept consequences. Aimee’s’s death is a mixture of lack of joined-up thinking and cuts. If we’d had more public health workers connecting into probation, connecting into the Prison Service, we would have been told about her.”It is certainly true that people are slipping through some very leaky nets. But it’s not correct that nobody knew Aimee was living in a tent. After all, Langan visited her on the night she died.Why does Anderson believe that getting rid of tents is the answer? Many homeless people say a tent gives them privacy and a degree of warmth. Anderson insists that is the wrong starting point – there is no reason for anybody to be homeless in Liverpool; every night there are spare rooms at the YMCA or Labre House. “There’s no reason for anybody to sleep on the streets. If people choose to live on the streets, because they have mental health issues, for instance, then we’ll take that into consideration. But if somebody’s in a tent and they’re jacking up and doing stuff to themselves that no one can see, how are we going to know?”Carter and Anderson say that much of the city’s homeless drug dealing is done from within tents. The bottom line, Anderson says, is that tents hide illegal activity and vulnerable people who need support. When he announced the zero-tolerance policy on tents, people were sceptical – and worse. “I got a lot of shit on Twitter, as we usually do. People say we’re not doing enough. The city’s not doing enough. I get it all the time. People want to blame somebody for the problems we have in the city. They want to get angry with somebody, so they get angry with me.”I didn’t think she would ever be homeless and I didn’t think she’d ever die.The mayor has a reputation for grandstanding, but there is no questioning his desire to tackle the crisis. We mention pregnant Mary, who we met on the streets the previous night. Anderson and Carter look at each other. “Ah. We know her very, very well,” Anderson says. “And you know why she won’t accept accommodation? She’s had children before, she’s a drug user and we have a child protection order on the baby. We have issues with the father of the baby, her partner. She wants to live with him, and the order stops that happening. There’s much more to your story.” His version is consistent with what Mary told us – she admitted she was still taking heroin. Anderson says, as with Aimee Teese, it would be pointless to address her housing situation without tackling her addiction issues.It is late June, almost six months since Aimee died and three months since Anderson announced he was going to remove tents from the streets of Liverpool. We meet up with Langan and Cathy to distribute food and clothes to homeless people. Cathy now volunteers for the Paper Cup Project as an outreach worker. She says it has given her a new sense of purpose.Anderson is not the only public official who has been clearing tents from the streets. The Guardian has just revealed that the number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has more than trebled in four years (from 72 in 2014 to 254 last year). An encampment was defined as a location where one or more homeless people were living on private or public land. The Guardian also revealed there were 1,241 complaints to councils last year regarding “tent cities” and that some councils (including Brighton and East Dorset) charge for the return of seized tents.At Aimee’s inquest in April, the coroner recorded that she had been found dead in her tent in the back yard of a disused factory. It was revealed she had a medical history of hepatitis C, and drug and alcohol addiction. In the hours before her death she had smoked crack cocaine with her partner and used heroin “within the range of a fatal dose”. She was found by her partner, who returned to the tent after a disagreement with her. Cathy says her niece’s death has turned her life upside down. “It’s split me and my partner up. He’s a bit younger than I am, and he didn’t understand what I was going through. I kept everything in on myself. And I blame myself a lot as well. I took a lot of the guilt because I shouldn’t have said what I said to her.” What does she mean? “I said: ‘With drink and drugs, I can’t have you around here.’” She is becoming tearful. “But I didn’t think she would ever be homeless and I didn’t think she’d ever die.”There isn’t a day Cathy doesn’t think about Aimee. But one huge positive has come out of all this. She whips a photo out of her wallet. “That’s me, Aimee and her daughter Emily when she was a baby.” Cathy had been close to Emily, who is now 10 and still living with another aunt. Four years after losing contact with each other, she and Emily are rebuilding their relationship. Cathy is overjoyed to have her back in her life. “I had her for the day a few weeks ago,” she says. “We’re just getting to know each other again and we had an absolute ball. We went swimming and went to Anfield to watch the match. The kids love that they’ve got a new cousin.”Cathy still hasn’t come to terms with Aimee’s death, even though she half expected it. “I didn’t think it would come to this at 30. It sounds cold, but I thought she would die from drugs and things, but that she would be older.”It was Cathy who identified the body. What shocked her most was Aimee’s hair. “She had gorgeous hair. She was so proud of it – long and dyed red. And when I went to see her, it was all chopped off.”She was left alone with Aimee’s body. Cathy says it took her ages to say anything, then she let rip. “I gave her a bollocking. I gave her a really good bollocking. I told her off like a proper parent. I said: ‘I’m totally fucking pissed off with you.’ I was just kind of ranting. It felt good.” She is laughing and crying as she says this. “And then when I finished bollocking her, I told her I loved her.”Indicated names (*) have been changed.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Homelessness is now part of all our lives. Here's what you can do to help,"As someone who has experienced homelessness, here are my tips on what you can do (and what you should avoid) if you want to help someone on the street",Daniel Lavelle,2019-09-24T06:00:18+0100,"Britain’s homelessness crisis is out of control, with the numbers of homeless people and rough sleepers at their highest levels since 2010. Every day on the commute to work, the school run or shopping trips we pass the tent cities, flattened cardboard boxes lining doorways and paper cups resting on pavements. Homelessness is now part of all our lives. It leaves many of us feeling compelled to help, but unsure of how to do it in the right way.I’ve experienced homelessness. I slept rough in a campsite and on a bridle path for three weeks before living in hostels for more than 18 months. These experiences haven’t provided me with any special wisdom on the matter. In fact I’m probably just as unsure as most of you are. But one thing I am sure about, and that my own experiences underlined, is that homeless people are just that – people. Take that as your starting point: treat them as you would want to be treated if you ever found yourself in that situation.726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures. Over the next few months, G2 and Guardian Cities will look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain’s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life – what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by.Here are my thoughts on what the rest of us – the passers-by, the lookers-on, those who feel anxious and powerless – should do. Some of my suggestions are controversial and, as I said, I don’t feel I’ve got all the answers, but I’ve tried to be honest about the way I feel and about the lessons I learned from being on the streets and from talking to other people in a similar situation then and since, as part of my work with Simon Hattenstone on The Empty Doorway series.What should you do if you see a rough sleeper whose immediate welfare you are concerned about? In England and Wales, the official advice is to inform StreetLink, the national referral service run by St Mungo’s. This seems like a no-brainer: contact StreetLink and they will send an experienced person along who will attempt to get that person off the streets. But even this isn’t straightforward. St Mungo’s, in co-operation with the government’s hostile environment policy, were found to be recording the details of those they help and passing that information to the Home Office.This was stopped in 2017, but rough sleepers still don’t trust them. Many of the rough sleepers I’ve spoken to, even British citizens, refuse help from StreetLink over privacy concerns. This lack of trust is having a big impact in stopping rough sleepers getting the help they need. It’s vital that homelessness charities demonstrate their independence from government and start winning back trust.We also need to better understand what the practical results of referrals to these types of services are. There is evidence that a large proportion of the people referred are already known to the authorities, which suggests that the services to which StreetLink are supposed to refer them are already failing.It also proves difficult in many instances for StreetLink to identify or locate the person who has been reported. That’s why it’s crucial, if you have decided to report, to give as accurate and detailed a description of the person and their location as possible.If you are worried that a homeless person is in immediate danger, perhaps suffering from hypothermia or the effects of drugs, then you should call an ambulance or contact the police. That is doubly true if the person is under 18, as StreetLink only deals with adults. If you are reporting someone to the emergency services, it is best to stay with or close to that person until the police or ambulance crew arrive. But if your anxiety is more generalised or if, as is often the case, it is someone you see on your street frequently and whose condition is perhaps deteriorating, engage with them. Try to understand their situation, see if they want to be referred – give them as much agency as possible. Help that person make informed decisions; don’t try to impose your decisions on them.It can be daunting to approach someone on the street you are worried about. One thing that irritates homeless people is when you talk to them as though they are children. There is nothing more humiliating than having someone stooping over you, literally talking down to you. Sit down, share a drink or fag or bar of chocolate with them; tell them about your day; ask them about theirs, whether they’re getting enough help and if there’s anything else you can do. Obviously use your judgment. If they don’t seem receptive to conversation don’t thrust it on them. Maybe just give them a few quid and get on with your day.The big homelessness charities are almost unanimously against people handing over cash to rough sleepers. The argument for this is perfectly cogent: a lot of rough sleepers suffer with substance dependency, and giving them money allows them to buy more drugs and alcohol, which makes their lives worse. But put yourself in their position. Do you reckon you might want a wee tipple to take the edge off sleeping rough? Of course you would, so why shouldn’t they? In fact why not share a can or two with your new homeless mate? Remember, they’re just people after all.If you’re really worried about donating a fiver that turns out to be lethal, you can always offer to buy them some food or drink. Don’t pre-buy these. Ask the person what they want. It’s nice to be given choices when you feel like your life is out of control. It restores your humanity.And of course if you don’t want to donate directly to someone on the streets, charities will be happy to take your money (and will argue that donations, particularly regular ones, help them to plan and provide longer-term support). Their shops are also very pleased to receive good-quality products they can sell on. And as temperatures start to drop, there will be plenty of one-off appeals for you to donate a warm coat you no longer need, for example.If you’re convinced that handing over cash is not the way, you can volunteer for one of the many homelessness charities . For a start, there are outreach teams you can join, where you’ll work with like-minded people to distribute food, drink and clothes. Lots of people volunteer for Crisis at Christmas, and that’s great, but this is a year-round emergency. Charities are always looking for long-term volunteers to work in their shops and fundraise but also to act as mentors and night shelter workers. They will usually try to make use of any particular skills you have – cooking, IT, advocacy and legal knowledge.More challengingly, some charities look for hosts who are willing to give short-term emergency accommodation to homeless people, especially young adults. This will not be for everyone and demands a high level of commitment on the part of the volunteer, who may often have social work or other relevant experience, but the success of the Nightstop UK scheme shows what can be achieved.If your concerns go beyond what you see on the streets and you want to help find long-term solutions to this mounting crisis, you could always write to your MP with your suggestions, or join – or better still, organise! – a campaign aimed at putting pressure on the government or your local authority.One of the most worrying things I discovered when I experienced the care system and homelessness was the fact that many of the essential services tasked with helping people had been outsourced by local authorities and were now the remit of the third sector. Although there are many good third sector providers, including charities and voluntary organisations, they all have their own philosophies and practices, making the quality of support pot luck from region to region.These organisations often fall outside statutory regulation, meaning mistakes go unreported – and as a result we learn nothing from them. Also, because they are not public they don’t have to be transparent and can ignore things like freedom of information requests. For this reason I’d suggest that returning many of these services to public hands and giving them proper investment should be the focal point of any campaign to combat homelessness. If you agree, make some noise about it.Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"
We're telling the stories of those who died homeless – here's why,Hundreds of homeless people die on Britain’s streets every year. It’s time to recognise this as a societal failing – and to stop just passing by,Simon Hattenstone,2019-09-17T06:00:28+0100,"It started with the tents. From 2010 onwards it seemed they were springing up everywhere– in stations, shopping centres, tunnels, parks, wastelands. Blots on every landscape. Tents became a symbol of David Cameron and George Osborne’s austerity politics – or the Big Society, where statutory public services and benefits were slashed and replaced by the voluntary sector and well-meaning individuals with sandwich trolleys. In the blink of an eye, tents became normalised. Britain became a society in which those with nothing, and sometimes even those who worked for a wage, were housed in plastic.Then we discovered that people weren’t simply living in tents, they were dying in them too. Aimee Teese in Liverpool overdosed in her tent while Richard Kehoe was found dead in his after he stopped taking his diabetes medication – both in Liverpool. It’s a truism that society’s most vulnerable have been hardest hit by austerity politics. And you don’t get more vulnerable than the homeless. And of the homeless, you don’t get more vulnerable than the street homeless. And the most vulnerable of them all? They don’t get to live. They perish on the streets of Britain, or in hostels if they’re lucky.Last year it felt as if Britain had finally started to take notice of those dying homeless in Britain. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism undertook an important project to count and bear witness to Britain’s homeless dead, and soon after the Office of National Statistics started to collate figures – how they died, age, why, where, when. Shocking new data emerged. Last year Shelter estimated that 320,000 people were homeless in Britain – from sofa surfers to those in temporary accommodation and hostels, and ultimately those sleeping rough on the streets. The government’s own statistics, published in January 2018, show that street homelessness had increased by 169% since 2010. The average age of those dying on Britain’s streets is 42 for women and 44 for men. It is estimated that 800 homeless people died in the 18 months before March 2019, but the figures may be far higher.Horrific statistics. But in the end they are little more than that – statistics. What we want to do is tell the stories of some of these people. Not so much the story of their death, but the story of their life – what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We also wanted to find out what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently by statutory agencies or the voluntary sector to prevent their deaths.All the people we are writing about had their demons. Many were victims of abuse; some were self-destructive or suffering from mental illness; all were addicted to drink or drugs. At the same time, in virtually every case we discovered a failing of those who are there to protect them that could have been the difference between them living or dying.Over the next few months we will be recounting the lives of homeless people who have recently died in the UK. These stories will focus on a variety of issues, including addiction (the biggest killer of homeless people), suicide (the second biggest killer), care (a hugely disproportionate number of homeless people have been in the care system), , post-traumatic stress disorder, domestic abuse, disability, prison. The individual stories we tell will be a tribute to those who have died on the streets – an attempt to reclaim their lives – but also a way in to discussing fundamental issues around homelessness.We met politicians, mayors, outreach workers, charity executives who all talked about people falling through the network and a lack of joined-up thinking. At times these phrases felt abstract, divorced from reality. We wanted to discover what they actually meant in real terms; how did the lack of joined-up thinking contribute to the deaths of the people whose stories we were telling?Of course, it’s never quite as simple as that. And there are no definitive answers. But in most cases with more resources, compassion, efficiency, time, flexibility and luck these people could still be alive. Some of the failings happened early in life – for example, the boy from care who was moved numerous times before he was four years old, and then moved yet again when he was finally settled. But many of the failings happened in the final days or day of their lives. We heard the stories of the east European who was turned away from a hostel a week before his death because he did not qualify for benefits and was thought to have no reasonable prospects of a job; the young mother released from prison without accommodation to go to or her addiction treated; the woman who, three days before her death, finally admitted she needed help but was told to come back three weeks later for a rehab place; the young man who, ill and delirious, told the ambulance service he didn’t want to go to hospital and died later that day. None of this was malicious or deliberate. They are just examples of services stretched beyond breaking point, bogged down in bureaucracy, or not acting as wisely as they could.Many issues arise from what we heard and saw: the lack of accountability of those housing vulnerable people in semi-independent accommodation; the coroners who let statutory and voluntary services off the hook by concluding the deceased had all the support they needed without really scrutinising the situation; the lack of formal reviews into those who have died homeless. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and the organisations charged with helping the homeless to respond to the issues raised. We are also asking readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by.But this series is about much more than pinpointing institutional and governmental failures. Ultimately it is a tribute to those who lived and died homeless, and the families and friends who did their best to keep them alive. It has been tough for people like Cathy Teese, who today tells the story of her niece Aimee, to open up to us. But they have done so for one reason only – by telling the story of their loved ones, they hope to make it less likely that others will suffer such a terrible fate.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Homeless deaths: share your tributes,"As part of a new series, we would like to hear your memories and stories of people you knew who have died while homeless ",Guardian readers,2019-09-17T06:00:54+0100,"In recent decades countless homeless people have died on the streets of UK cities, or while in temporary accommodation. Far too often their stories have died with them.Not only are there no precise figures(official government estimates on homeless deaths in England and Wales were published for the first time last year, but the real numbers could be higher), but in many cases their deaths were not properly investigated, so we may never know who these people were and what happened to them. A new series by G2 and Guardian Cities tells the stories of homeless people in cities around the UK who have died, piecing together details about their lives to commemorate them and to try to answer crucial unanswered questions: why did they die? Could their deaths have been prevented? However, we know that far more homeless people have died without proper recognition than we can report on.

Hidden Tokyo: share your videos of your favourite quiet place 隠れた東京：一番のお気に入りの静かな場所を撮ったビデオを共有してください,"In the world’s most populous city, we want to hear from locals about where you go to get away from the crowds",Guardian readers,2019-06-03T06:55:16+0100,"When most people think about Tokyo, images of crowds often spring to mind: the ‘pushers’ who squeeze passengers on to packed rush-hour trains, or waves of pedestrians spilling across the Shibuya Crossing intersection. Even with Japan’s shrinking population, the capital is by far the most populous city in the world, home to 37 million people. However, Tokyo can also be a remarkably intimate, human-scale place – and as we prepare to spend a week exploring the city in detail, we’re keen to hear from Tokyo residents about where you go to get away from the crowds.Where’s your favourite place to enjoy peace and quiet, somewhere you can temporarily escape busy city life? Perhaps it’s a deserted back street, a particular park, or a little-known cafe. These are the places that only locals know about.世界でも最も人口密度の高い街として知らている東京ですが、あなたは人混みを避けるためにどこに行きますか？ほとんどの人がまず、東京というイメージで思いつくのが、ラッシュアワーの満員電車や渋谷の交差点を横切る人混みです。日本の人口は減少しつつありますが、13００万の人が住む大都会です。それなのに、東京はとても親しみのあるみじかな人間的な場所でもあります。私たち自身も街を一週間いろいろ探索してみて、東京の住民が人混みを避けるためにどこに行くのかとても興味があり、東京の人だけが知っているような場所をもっと知りたいと思いました。We’re keen to show this side of the city, so we’re creating a video featuring Tokyo residents sharing their favourite place to enjoy peace and quiet. It’s fun and easy to contribute – all you need is a smartphone. So if you live in Tokyo and want to take part, email instagramstories@theguardian.com and we’ll send you more details.Alternatively, take a short video of your favourite quiet spot in Tokyo, show us and tell us (in Japanese or English) where you are and why it’s your favourite peaceful place, and upload it to the form below.The deadline for videos is Monday 10 June.あなたの撮った映像を共有してくださいこのような東京の一面を私たちは色々な人に見せたく、東京に住むあなたが、落ち着いて静かな時間を楽しむことができる場所の映像を集めたビデオを製作します。スマホさえあれば、その方法はカンタン。東京住民で参加ご希望の方は、 instagramstories@theguardian.com にまずメールをください。もしくは、あなたの好きな静かな東京の場所はどこか、なぜ好きなのかを記して（日本語もしくは英語）、その場所の映像をこのメールアドレスに直接送ってください。締め切りは６月１０日（月曜日）です。If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.

"‘No sex please, we’re meditating’: peace and positivity on a weekend retreat","At a country house in West Sussex, meditation, yoga and detox come together for a weekend of mindfulness that expands your ‘protective bubble’",Nick Duerden,2019-10-23T06:30:28+0100,"The taxi driver appraises me with suspicion when I tell him my destination. “But you’ve not got a yoga mat,” he says.Having never been on a meditation retreat before, I was self-conscious of criss-crossing busy train stations with a yoga mat strapped to my back, so I’d concealed it inside a Sainsbury’s bag for life. I point it out now to the driver, and he offers a wry smile as he takes me to the place where, for the next four days, I’m to be immersed in an intensive period of “me time”. I’ve never done this before, so have no idea what to expect.Long-term health conditions can be interesting in all sorts of unexpected ways. You learn about your levels of resilience, and the efforts you are prepared to take to get better. I’ve been struggling with low physical energy for almost a decade, my mitochondrial cells malfunctioning after successive flu viruses never quite left my body. Doctors didn’t know what to recommend – these cells aren’t easily “fixed” – and so suggested what they suggest to anyone who presents mysteriously: eat better, sleep well. Do yoga, learn to meditate.I’ve spent the last five years dipping in and out of meditation – apps, YouTube, Ruby Wax’s focus on mindfulness through books and interviews – but it was vedic meditation (a close cousin of transcendental, which uses a silent mantra or sound repeated over and over) I kept returning to. I liked it but always let it slip. I knew that to establish a habit I would need to immerse myself, under in-person instruction.And so here I am, near Arundel in West Sussex, at a large, rambling country house with lush gardens, on a weekend vedic retreat run by Beeja. Its strapline suggests: Meditation for Everyone and its founder, Will Williams, has been teaching vedic meditation for more than five years. After a stint in the music business, and falling ill, he recovered through meditation – and began to teach what he had learned. He runs introductory courses in London. Will is a convincing communicator: Hoxton-bearded and smiley, dressed not in robes but in Edwin jeans, conspicuously one of us.There are 15 in attendance, eight women, seven men, ranging from 24 to 70. We’re a cosmopolitan bunch: there’s a Saudi, a Lebanese, one from Guadalupe, another from South Korea. Two from Essex. Some, like me, have medical issues, others are struggling with anxiety, depression and such pronounced social media addiction that handing over phones upon arrival proves problematic. I’m to share a dorm for four but – mercifully – there’s just two of us this weekend. After an introductory dinner of nut loaf, Will’s co-instructor, Niamh Keane, reminds us of the house rules: up at 6.45am, in bed by 10.30pm; respect one another’s confidentiality. No sex and no “solo sex”, as Niamh puts it, just unbroken serenity and purity of mind. We’re detoxing, so can have neither caffeine nor alcohol. No breakfast either, a fact that horrifies us all initially but becomes curiously unimportant by day two.On a meditation retreat I find you meditate, and do precious little else. Beeja’s version comprises a succession of “rounding” exercises: 15 minutes of yoga, five minutes of alternate nostril breathing, 20 of meditation, and 10 of the flat-on-your-back yoga pose, shavasana. We’re all given an individual secret mantra to repeat silently (though who’s to say we don’t have the same one?!). For three days.At first, most of us choose to do our exercises communally, in the living room, but increasingly we drift off in pursuit of solitude. I thought I’d struggle, because meditating at home is difficult, but here, with no distractions, I slide into it as if it were a hot bath. Hours pass, then hours more.Respite comes in the evenings, after simple vegetarian food (rice and dhal, Thai soup), when Will sits, Buddha-like, with us at his feet while he shares his vedic-derived wisdom. He’s a practitioner of many years and is so convinced of his discipline’s ability to heal the world that he can tend towards the over-prescriptive. He condemns most diets in favour of an ayurvedic-approved one, and proffers opinion on antidepressants, climate change, and Trump voters. He tells us that the introduction of 5G will kill off the insect world, that we should never cross our legs, and how we must avoid eating onions because the skin contains properties that promote selfishness. Much of what he says is fascinating, plenty else sails far above our heads.He asks how our sessions are going and when I tell him that during one of mine my hands began to levitate and my fingers grew like intertwining tree branches, as if I were morphing into a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, he beams with pleasure and says: “You’ve shifted some serious energy there, fella.”The more we meditate, the more our protective bubble expands. When we come to leave, Niamh implores we take care upon re-entering the world outside, as we will be newly hypersensitive to light, noise, other people. “Be gentle with yourselves,” she advises.The trip back home is complicated by the usual travel chaos – delays, overcrowding – but we endure it without any obvious adverse effect on our hitherto delicate dispositions. But then meditation affects different people differently and any long-term benefits may only announce themselves over time. What I know right now is that I’ve never had a weekend quite like it, never been so still, or rested, never spent so much time with myself, or by myself.It wasn’t quite bliss, but I did attain something conspicuously rare in a life otherwise filled with such perpetual distraction: peace.• Four-day, three-night weekend retreats cost from £594 for a twin room, £534 for a dorm room, and include food, drink and instruction; six-monthly payment options available, beejameditation.comNick Duerden’s memoir, Get Well Soon: Adventures in Alternative Healthcare, is out now (Bloomsbury, £12.99).

City breaks with kids: Edinburgh,"There’s a great family trip to be had exploring Edinburgh’s museums, beaches and parks, while an underground tour brings spooky moments, too",,2019-10-22T06:30:54+0100,"We love to stand on the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle and wait for the one o’clock canon to fire. It always makes us jump, even though we know it’s coming, but there are just such wonderful views across the city, and to the sea beyond, from here.To get a different perspective on this fascinating city, go from high to low, and head underground. The Real Mary King’s Close (adult £16.50, 5-15s £9.95, family 2+2 £43.50) offers a journey under the streets to a preserved 17th-century street, courtesy of costumed storytellers and with plenty of spooky moments. It’s fun for all but the youngest children.We are huge Harry Potter fans in our house and have had great adventures exploring a city closely associated with the author JK Rowling, who wrote the books here. Visit Greyfriars Kirkyard and see names on graves that inspired some of her characters; peep through the gates to the imposing 17th-century school Heriot’s (or is it Hogwarts?); walk the colourful, curving, cobbled Diagon Alley-like Victoria Street, and find the wonderful Ahaha joke shop. It’s been a firm favourite of our family for a couple of generations, with its giant pair of glasses and false nose across the shopfront. Inside is a wonderful collection of pocket-money friendly toys.With its free admission, the National Museum of Scotland is a gem for all ages. It’s packed with exhibits and a good spot to wait out a rainstorm or escape the crowds. The energy wheel is just like a giant hamster wheel and kids love the challenge of running around it to turn the lights on, before collapsing in a heap of giggles. The Planet Adventure area is perfect for younger children, with dinosaur-bone excavating, hands-on exhibits and dressing-up outfits.Edinburgh also has wonderful beaches, in the city itself and along the coast. Portobello beach is a sandy two-mile stretch, a wonderful place for kids to run and play. Cafes on its promenade allow you to sit and watch your kids as they build sandcastles and you enjoy coffee and homemade cakes, with a view over to Fife. We love Miro’s and The Beach House and, on the High Street, Bross Bagels is great for picnic essentials, including Montreal-style bagels. It’s always busy with children and dogs along the front, and there is also a playground, and a large softplay area if it rains. There is also a huge community of year-round sea swimmers.Cramond Island is an uninhabited island in the Firth of Forth connected to the mainland via a causeway when the tide is low. We love the walk over; there are always crabs to pick up, sometimes starfish, and loads of seabirds. The walk takes longer than you might imagine and isn’t suitable for buggies, though. If you are lucky you may spot dolphins, whales or seals from here. Cramond also has a long beach with a promenade that’s perfect for scooters and bikes, while the Boardwalk Beach Club is a fun refuelling pitstop – with tables made of surfboards.Edinburgh has a superb network of cycle paths on the old railway lines that once criss-crossed the city, providing miles of traffic-free, tree-lined pathways that are particularly good for those with younger children. You can get around most of Edinburgh on them and there are playgrounds and food pitstops along the way, notably brunch at Milk at the Sculpture Workshop .A climb up Arthur’s Seat is a good hike for children. Though it’s a bit of a scramble towards the top the views are worth it. This extinct volcano is in Holyrood Park, an untamed 263-hectare park in the midst of the city, with the ruins of St Anthony’s Chapel to explore, a loch with swans to feed, trails and hikes all around.The Botanic Gardens are a good spot for walking with buggies, playing hide and seek and exploring. There are little bridges over streams where you can play pooh sticks, plus an amazing rock garden with a waterfall, Victorian greenhouses, squirrels and kingfishers to spot. Our favourite is the Queen Mother’s Memorial Garden, with its little maze, perfect for playing tag with little ones, and a pavilion decorated inside with seashells and pine cones.Just outside the city, within Dalkeith country park, is the Fort Douglas adventure playground, with ziplines, tunnels across the River Esk, fortresses and slides (from £5 for 5-12s). Next to the fort are the old stables, which now feature two restaurants and a shop.For a sprinkle of magic, we love the Archerfield Walled Garden trail around the woods leading to beautiful fairy houses hidden in the trees, with teeny, tiny ladders, windows and doors, and houses made from teapots or old shoes. The attention to detail is amazing. You can buy a vial of fairy dust to sprinkle and a ribbon to tie on the wishing tree for £1 and run around and play hide and seek in the the willow structures on the way back. Entry is free.Edinburgh has a huge selection of independent cafes and restaurants. Our neighbourhood favourite is Herringbone, in Goldenacre. It’s a laid-back bistro with varied menus and great kids’ options. For superb fish and chips with a view across the harbour to the three bridges try The Fishmarket at Newhaven Harbour – there will always be a queue but it’s worth the wait. The Scran and Scallie in Stockbridge is Michelin-starred chef Tom Kitchin’s gastropub and it has a kids’ play area and mini versions of the adult meals. Mary’s Milk Bar on the Grassmarket is the place to go for gelato and has funky stools and a bar made from old milk bottles. Sugar Daddy’s Bakery is a good place for anyone with allergies, with a delectable selection of gluten-free cakes, sandwiches and soups; most are also dairy- and soy-free. Beetroot Sauvage is a plant-based cafe with a children’s play corner and delicious vegan food.B+B Edinburgh (family rooms from £69 a night) is a boutique property near the West End with large bedrooms, a library with board games, and it’s also pet friendly. Apex Grassmarket (family rooms from £153) is within toddling distance of all the main sights, has a pool and does great breakfasts. Edinburgh Castle Apartments offers 12 simple, serviced apartments from £149 a night in a great location in the New Town.It is worth downloading the Dribble app, which is a fabulous resource for family-friendly locations and events in the city.Anna Deacon is co-author of Taking The Plunge: The Healing Power of Wild Swimming for Mind, Body and Soul, published on 7 November (Black & White publishing, £20)Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Lonely Planet names England the world's second best tourist destination in 2020,"Travel guide company says ‘timeless treasures’, seaside and historic buildings put country in second place, behind Bhutan",,2019-10-22T03:07:39+0100,"England has been named the world’s second best tourist destination in 2020 due to its “timeless treasures” by the guide book firm, Lonely Planet, behind Bhutan.The list, featured in the Best in Travel 2020 book, was compiled based on “topicality, unique experiences and wow factor”.The entry for England states: “Brexit uncertainties have dominated the headlines in recent years but one constant amid all the confusion has been the timeless treasures that England is famous for: the historic castles and cathedrals, the quaint villages and rolling countryside, and of course, the seaside.“Taking a bracing walk on a windswept pier, eating delicious fish and chips, searching for marine life in rock pools, finding fossils in ancient cliffs, building sandcastles and dolphin-spotting on picturesque beaches are just some of the activities offered by the English seaside.”Lonely Planet noted that new sections of the England Coast Path are continuing to open, making it easier for people to explore the country’s coastline.Once complete, it will be one of the world’s longest continuous walking trails at nearly 3,000 miles.Number-one ranked Bhutan, in the Himalayas, plans to become the first fully organic nation by 2020.Other countries in Lonely Planet’s top five were North Macedonia, the Caribbean island of Aruba and Africa’s eSwatini (formerly Swaziland).Full listBhutanEnglandNorth MacedoniaArubaeSwatiniCosta RicaThe NetherlandsLiberiaMoroccoUruguay"
"A local’s guide to Ljubljana, Slovenia: top 10 tips","In one of Europe’s greenest cities, visitors stroll pedestrianised streets or hop into electric taxis to discover modernist and medieval architecture, fantastic food and microbreweries",,2019-10-21T06:30:19+0100,"Though it’s modest by modern standards (13 storeys and 70 metres tall), Nebotičnik was the first “skyscraper” in Yugoslavia, and the ninth-tallest building in Europe when it opened in 1933. Architect Vladimir Šubic was inspired by the art deco skyscrapers of New York, though more conservative residents dismissed it as a “freak”. Today, the wraparound rooftop terrace cafe offers impressive views of the Alps to the north and Ljubljana Castle, just a few blocks away. Access is via a lobby clad in black marble and a spiral staircase. At the top, you can enjoy Slovenian wines – try Rebula, a buttery white, still or sparkling.Ljubljana is no stranger to topiaried beards and artful tattoos, and you can explore its alternative side by strolling down Trubarjeva ulica, where Trubarjeva Antikvariat sells pieces of Yugo-nostalgia, such as busts and portraits of Tito, or industrial-design classics like the sleek, Lamborghini-red ETA 85 rotary telephone designed in 1979 by Davorin Savnik and made by Iskra. Reminiscent of a race car, this phone was produced in the millions and was a staple on the walls of Yugoslav homes – today one is on display at New York’s Museum of Modern Art.For clubbing, the Metelkova district is graffiti-laden but entirely safe and welcoming. Once a complex of barracks for the Austro-Hungarian and, later, Yugoslav armies, it is now home to bars, nightclubs and a former prison-turned-hostel. Its new life began as a squatters’ settlement on 25 June 1991, the day Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia. In 2005, Metelkova became part of a national cultural heritage list, but it remains on the edge of the law – raising its own funds, largely through concerts – and is the best place to go for friendly, alternative nightlife.JB, a restaurant on the ground floor of a Plečnik building (see below) that resembles a modernised Greek temple, has been the epitome of fine dining in the region since the 1990s. World renowned chef Janez Bratovž was the first to introduce dishes such as fish carpaccio and rare steak to a culinary culture that was used to well-done cutlets in cream sauce. Not long ago, he served his signature ravioli with pistachio, chestnut, pear and foie gras to Ferran Adrià and the pope (though not at the same event). Michelin does not yet have a guide to Slovenia, though it’s rumoured to be in the pipeline – and JB will surely be up for a star. It is reasonably priced for a restaurant of that level: the six-course fish or meat menu is €60 and the vegetarian version €50; the 12-course tasting menu is €95.• jb-slo.comOn Fridays from March until the end of October, the central market features a huge outdoor food fair called Odprta Kuhna (Open Kitchen), which can draw as many as 25,000 people. Founded by Israeli expat Lior Kochavy, it is the best way to sample a wide variety of specialities, as dozens of restaurants, from fancy to down-home, set up stands and offer food truck-style dishes. This is where you can try JB’s take on a burger made with dry-aged brisket (€6); a pulled duck and red cabbage sandwich – a street twist on a popular St Martin’s Day meal; and šmorn, an Austro-Hungarian shredded pancake topped with compôte (€3). For the most Slovenian of snacks, try Klobasarna, behind the cathedral, which offers only Carniolian sausage, a geographically protected local pork sausage served with a pot of mustard and a warm roll (half €3.50, whole €5.90). This is probably the only speciality sausage to have been consumed in space, as an American astronaut with Slovenian roots, Sunita Williams, took some to the International Space Station.In November 2018, Kanye West tweeted to his 29 million followers about a rather obscure Slovenian modernist architect called Jože Plečnik (1872-1957). Kanye and architectural historians agree on Plečnik’s brilliance, and Ljubljana is the place to see his work. In the decades following a devastating earthquake in 1895, Plečnik was commissioned to rebuild most of the important structures and spaces in the city. These included the National and University Library, the central market, the embankment of the Ljubljanica River, the main outdoor concert venue, the city cemetery, several parks and the football stadium, which he modelled on ancient Greek amphitheatres, lined with Doric columns and sunk into the earth, so fans step down into a roiling cauldron of cheers to find their seats. Take a guided tour or do one yourself, beginning at his ivy-clad home, which is now a museum, Plečnikova Hiša. A stroll past Plečnik buildings will take you through the most interesting spots in the city, crisscrossing the river via its many bridges, from the Cobblers’ Bridge, lined with columns that support nothing, to the Triple Bridge, based on Venice’s Rialto but with three separate bridges at slight angles to one another (one for pedestrians, one for cyclists, one for cars, and with one of the first public toilets in Europe hidden underneath). And on to the Dragon Bridge, the most photographed site in the city, with plinths on its four corners crowned with bronze, bat-winged dragons.A stroll through Tržnice, the central market, designed by Plečnik, should begin at Marjetka’s sauerkraut stand. She’s the only sauerkraut seller with a queue, and locals will tell you that it’s because her family is among the last in the country to cultivate indigenous Ljubljana cabbage, which makes the best sauerkraut. You can also pick up a bottle of – wait for it –sauerkraut juice, which is good for stomach complaints, and is also surprisingly refreshing. Follow the gently curved colonnade to visit stalls featuring pumpkinseed oil, made from an indigenous pumpkin type, Styriaca, that’s good in salads and even vanilla ice-cream. A section of the market is dedicated to slippers, which Slovenians wear at all times indoors (and pupils do at school) – these make for a good, lightweight souvenir. The most surreal detail of the market may be the vending machines selling grave candles in jewel-coloured plastic candle holders that are traditionally placed on tombs. Ljubljana was crowned Green Capital of Europe in 2016, and the city prides itself on its “zero waste” recycling programme and the highest percentage of pedestrianised streets of any capital in Europe. Enjoy this by strolling the cobbled, medieval Stari Trg and Gornji Trg, in the shadow of the castle, and looping along the riverbank, unencumbered by traffic. If you need a ride in the centre, what looks like a green golf cart, the Kavalir electric taxi, will shuttle you about for free. There is also Urban, a miniature electric train on wheels that snakes through the streets with zero emissions.Ljubljana has joined the speciality coffee revolution, with the best cup in town served by a Colombian expat architect named Alex. His pocket-sized cafe, Črno Zrno, is less than two metres wide, a corridor leading to an elevated bar lined with arabesque tiles, where Alex greets guests and prepares each coffee himself. The best cakes I’ve ever had are from Zvezda, a sweetshop with several locations and a window full of baked goods that sparkle like gemstones. The Slovenian specialities include kremšnita (millefeuille) and gibanica (layer cake with poppy seeds, walnut, curd cheese and apples), but my favourite is the čokoladne sanje, or “chocolate dream” (€4).My adopted hometown of Kamnik, just 30 minutes north and a gateway to the Alps, boasts three castles and, according to Atlas Obscura, is “a candidate for microbrew capital of the world”. Brewers are drawn to the town by its pristine water. The local pub, Pod Skalo, with old tin Yugoslav signs and a motorcycle mounted on the wall, has them all: Mali Grad, Maister, Barut, Meninc, Mister and Lampelj. Beside Kamnik is an elaborate botanical garden, Arboretum, once the grounds of a Versailles-inspired mansion destroyed by the partisans after the second world war. It’s a particular hit with children, with a playground area featuring lifesize moving dinosaur statues, an enormous maze and an array of ziplines, slides and trampolines. A few minutes beyond is the otherworldly Velika Planina, a mountain plateau that visitors describe as something out of Lord of the Rings, and where you can taste a local speciality, the pear-shaped trnič cheese.Where to stayLjubljana abounds with boutique hotels, but the classic is the Secessionist-style Grand Hotel Union in the centre (doubles from£83). For backpackers or younger travellers there’s the uber-hip Celica Hostel (beds from €24), a converted prison in Metelkova. Or Samostan Mekinje, a medieval monastery in Kamnik, is a 40-minute train ride from Ljubljana centre and has beds from €15.When to visitIn recent years Ljubljana has become overcrowded in the summer, so aim for any time other than high season – May and September are particularly lovely.Average pricesA half-litre glass of beer costs around €2; an espresso coffee is around €1.20; a three-course meal is €20 to €30.Getting thereLondon to Ljubljana by train takes 18 to 23 hours.

How to explore the world without harming it: Guardian climate pledge 2019,Guardian travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprint,Andy Pietrasik,2019-10-19T08:30:19+0100,"We recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on individuals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels; to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes; to meet people with different ideas and perspectives; to try out alternative lifestyles; to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes; to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the Guardian’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now diving instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."

Pistes in our time: What’s new for the 2019-20 ski season,"From cool hotels to fun, budget skiing trips for young people and some welcome green initiatives, there’s plenty happening on the slopes this winter",Gemma Bowes,2019-10-11T06:31:43+0100,"The past few years have seen a boom in tourism to Georgia: its cities for their fashion and food; and the Caucasus for hiking and mountain life. Things aren’t slowing down for winter, with several operators offering pricey but enticing new ski adventures to intrepid intermediate-plus downhillers. Mountain Heaven has a nine-night guided group tour departing 6 March, taking in Gudauri (the biggest resort with 80km of slopes), Bakuriani and the country’s newest resort, Mestia, as well as time in Tbilisi (€2,100pp including ski guiding, half-board, lift passes, a show in the capital and wine tasting, excluding flights). Silk Road Adventures has a seven-day break based in Gudauri, with a day of wine-tasting (four departures between January and March, £2,480pp including full-board, car with driver, guide, transfers, lift pass and ski equipment, excluding flights).The Post Office’s new family ski resort report has Bansko in Bulgaria as the cheapest in Europe, but the next four cheapest are all Italian: Bardonecchia, which has a historic centre and hosted the 2006 Winter Olympic snowboarding; Sestriere and Claviere in the Milky Way ski area; and the 1,883-metre Passo Tonale. The cheapest French resort was Morzine, in 11th place, followed by Alpe d’Huez in 14th. A self-catering studio in Bardonecchia’s Residence Les Lacs , near the ski lifts and train station, costs €300 pre-Christmas.With sustainability gaining traction across the industry, there are some interesting innovations. In Les Gets, France, electric snowmobiling is on offer as a kids’ activity by Mountain E-Park (from €20pp, ages 5-17). Val Thorens is to start using a 4WD self-driving shuttle bus to transport skiers around the resort, which is car-free during the week. German firm Kässbohrer is developing an electric piste-basher, the PistenBully 100E. Though it isn’t in use yet, it’s hoped once battery power is extended beyond a few hours, emission-free grooming could take off. And in Canada, it may be possible next winter to fly from Vancouver to Whistler by electric plane. Harbour Air Seaplanes is working with aviation company magniX to turn its whole fleet electric. And there’s a trend for synthetic ice rinks, which don’t use water or electricity and are made from recyclable materials. A new one opens in Orelle, in Les Trois Vallées, this winter.Bourg-St-Maurice, one of the French Alps’ main railway hubs, is a viable base for the vast Paradiski area, thanks to a funicular train to Arc 1600. A new hostel and hotel in Bourg, Base Camp Lodge (doubles from €67, dorm beds from €24) has 106 rooms and ticks a few sustainability boxes by doing all its washing in-house and offering free transfers to those travelling to France by train.There are big changes afoot in the Salzburgerland ski resorts of Kaprun and Zell am See, two great neighbouring all-round resorts, the latter of which has a railway station. A major new lift, the 3K K-onnection (terrible name!) is due to be completed by 30 November and will carry skiers from a beginners’ area in Kaprun to slopes on the 3,029-metre Kitzsteinhorn glacier which could previously be reached only by taking a bus to another resort. This link is the final stage in a line of six gondolas that together will cover 12km, the longest run of connected lifts in the Alps. A new lift in Zell Am See connects to Viehhofen in the Glemm valley, from where skiers can catch a bus 5km to the resorts of Saalbach, Hinterglemm, Leogang and Fieberbrunn, famous for steep freeriding. The stylish Active by Leitner’s hotel in Kaprun has lots of wood panelling and a spa (from €92pp half-board with use of spa). Action Outdoors, the UK branch of UCPA, a French not-for-profit activity holiday organisation, is launching its first trips specifically for young people. Aimed at 18-25 year-olds, the trips go to French resorts famed for après-ski and varied terrain, including Chamonix, Tignes and Val d’Isère. A beginners’ week in Tignes starts at £491pp, with full-board, 6½-day lift-pass, equipment hire and lessons. Similarly, the Ski Club of Great Britain is trying to attract young members with fun-focused group holidays for under-39s. The concept was launched last year and been expanded, with 12 new trips to resorts chosen for their “youthful vibe” and après-ski, from Val d’Isère to Jasna in Slovakia. A seven-night trip to Jasna aimed at intermediates includes three days skiing with an instructor and three days social skiing with the group, half-board at the ski-in, ski-out Hotel FIS, with pool and sauna, and transfers, from £999pp, departing 1 March. Refuge de la Traye, which reopens in December, is in a forest at 1,650 metres in Les Trois Vallées and only accessible on foot or in one of the hotels’ electric vehicles from nearby Les Allues. The refuge was built in 1982 but has been completely renovated to make a cosy and indulgent retreat that looks like a traditional hamlet. Beautiful wooden chalets have seven bedrooms, and there are two mazots (wooden huts sleeping three). A kids’ area with farm, restaurant, spa with sauna and hammam, yoga room and even chapel mean you may never make it to the slopes of Meribel. Mazots from €126pp B&B for three people. Obertauern, at 1,740 metres, has some of the Alps’ most reliable and deepest natural snow, according to a study last year by tourism researcher Gunther Aigner, making it a top choice for freeriding and end-of-season trips, with no need for snow cannons. A stylish budget place to stay – the timber-clad Hotel Foxy (flat for two from €106) – is due to open next month. A more upmarket new option in Untertauern, 10km along the valley, is the Lüzerhof Alpin Life Resort (from €123pp), which is now energy self-sufficient and CO2 neutral, using its own biomass heating plant and water from its own spring. Powder hounds have always loved Andermatt in Switzerland for its steep off-piste runs. But the town has been transformed, with new hotels and new lifts, making it suitable for beginners, intermediates and families as well as experts. Last year the ski area was extended with a lift to the village of Sedrun; this year it has expanded further with another lift, from Sedrun to Disentis. Together there’s 180km of pistes, and an après-ski train back to Andermatt, with a bar and DJ, if you can’t face the return trip on skis. The recently renovated River House Boutique Hotel (doubles from £500 for four nights’ B&B), is in a 250-year-old building by the river and has live music. Looking for a holiday with a difference?

"10 of the best things to see and do in Batignolles, Paris","Away from Paris’s more touristy areas, the Batignolles district in the 17th arrondissement is loved by locals for its bistros, bars, offbeat culture and romantic gardens",John Brunton,2019-10-09T06:30:43+0100,"This could be renamed the Batignolles food street, as both sides of the road are lined with restaurants symbolising the new image of the quartier. Meat-lovers should book the bistro-like Gaston, whose friendly owner, Rachid, serves traditional dishes such as oeufs en meurette (eggs poached in a rich red wine sauce) or aged prime rib with a béarnaise sauce (lunch menu €20). For more veggie-friendly dishes (plat du jour €10-€12), there is the casual Bar Pignon, while Formaticus is a fromagerie that serves sharing plates from its long list of cheeses and Le Costaud des Batignolles is part modern art gallery, part restaurant.The ideal introduction to Batignolles is to grab a pavement table at Dose and order a flat white, or its signature filter coffee. This self-proclaimed “Dealer de Café” is part of a wave of local cafes with a focus on barista skills, which are finally opening up in Paris – and offering an alternative to the bitter “express” many neighbourhood places serve. The location is perfect, opposite the entrance of the Square des Batignolles park (see below), so the clientele is a mix of parents with kids, shoppers taking time out from the nearby boutiques, and students and clubbers who roll up around midday for organic ginger juice, chocolat chaud and croissants.• Flat white €4, hot chocolate from €3.50, pastries from €1.50, 82 Place du Docteur Félix Lobligeois, dose.parisMore of a sprawling park than a simple square, this is the prime green space in the Batignolles, created in 1862 as a landscaped jardin à l’anglaise. A stream runs through manicured lawns, past statues and sculptures, then into a large pond filled with red Japanese carp and scores of ducks. It’s great for a picnic, and perfect for kids, as there are playgrounds, skateboard slopes and an old-fashioned carousel with wooden horses. In the early evening, older locals gather to play pétanque before going to a nearby bistro.• 144bis rue Cardinet, paris.frFrance’s first museum dedicated to street art is in a corner of the Batignolles, just by the péripherique ring road. It is in an IT college, and visiting is not easy (compulsory guided tours every other Tuesday 6pm-8pm, free, online booking essential) but it is worth the effort. This display of the private collection of Parisian gallerist Nicolas Laugero Lasserre spans 150 artworks by some 50 graffiti artists from across the world, including Invader, Shepard Fairey, Monkey Bird, Lek and Banksy. The college is worth a visit in itself: it’s open 24 hours a day, with facilities for students to sleep and shower on site, no fees, and no professors. Instead, there are just hundreds of students, day and night, huddled over computer screens, with the street art taking up most of the wall space.• 96 Boulevard Bessières, art42.frDorothée Beucher’s quirky concept store is typical of the shopping jewels to be found on the Batignolles’ narrow streets. You won’t find famous-name designers or global brands in this neighbourhood, but this eclectic boutique is a goldmine of clothing, accessories, jewellery, ceramics and objets handpicked by Dorothée from more than 50 lesser-known French designers. A few minutes walk away, on rue Boursault, is a similar French-style concept store, Les Passantes, but here you can also take a break from shopping – ordering tea and homemade cakes in its chic salon de thé.• 96 rue Nollet, desordreurbain.frAsk anyone in the long queue that invariably forms outside this hole-in-the-wall joint and they will say it serves the best kebab in Paris. Don’t be fooled by the name, this isn’t a restaurant – there’s not even a bar to eat standing up at. But the Square des Batignolles is a two-minute walk away, perfect for a picnic. The secret here is the quality of the veal that is prepared each day by the owners, brothers Ozlan and Erlan, marinated for 24 hours, then served from 11am till 9.30pm. It’s worth putting up with the long queue for a memorable €6.50 doner kebab.• 43 rue des Batignolles, no websiteRue Legendre is one of the busiest streets in the Batignolles, lined with fashion and vintage boutiques, casual diners and wine bars. One address not to be missed is this stylish furniture store, which resembles a designer apartment. It has made a name for itself by picking up eyecatching fittings and fixtures from the 1950s, 60s and 70s – chairs, sofas, mirrors, cupboards and lamps – restoring them and showcasing the finished items in-store. Next door is the minuscule Cinq Août, a recently opened secondhand shop specialising in vintage designer outfits, while down the street at number 78, Bloomy Star has a tempting selection of affordable handmade jewellery.• 108 rue Legendre, chezmobilhome.comOpened a few months ago, this smart, minimalist restaurant is set to be the new gourmet reference point in the Batignolles. Chef Thibaut Spiwack worked with celebrated chefs such as Alain Ducasse before opening his own restaurant, and it seems likely that the 2020 Michelin Guide will give him his first star. Although the evening is reserved for a gastronomic five-course tasting menu (€75) lunchtime is the perfect time to try Thibaut’s creative cuisine (three courses €29). Expect creative cocktails and a fine selection of organic and biodynamic wines, house-baked bread, seasonal locavore ingredients and dishes such as tuna tatami with strawberry and basil sorbet, or roast hake on a bed smoked potatoes.• 80 Boulevard des Batignolles, anona.frThe Batignolles covered market dates back to 1846, when this neighbourhood was a rural village. Although the present premises are an ugly 1970s concrete construction, there is a buzz about it the moment you walk amid the crowded stalls. Apart from the tempting fish, cheese and charcuterie on offer, there are affordable sit down lunches at several cosmopolitan canteens: Lebanese meze at Edgar; set menu Japanese at Onigiriya; and Senegalese maffé (peanut stew) and yassa (spicy marinated chicken or fish) at Madame Absa’s stall. Every Saturday morning there is also an outdoor organic farmers’ market on nearby Boulevard des Batignolles. It’s picturesque, but also more expensive.• 96 Rue Lemercier, parisinfo.comThe long, winding rue des Dames is the place to discover Batignolles’ nightlife. It is packed with popular bistros and cafes, and wine and cocktail bars that serve until the early hours. Les Caves Populaires stands out with its distinctive red facade and 1920s mosaic. A favourite daytime hangout for locals, who play cards and talk politics at the traditional zinc bar, the place gets busier at night with partygoers stopping off on a bar-crawl. It’s a good place to try fashionable natural wines and artisan ales at affordable prices, and it also serves generous plates of charcuterie and cheese.• 22 rue des Dames, on FacebookStay The Batignolles is not overburdened with accommodation but the recently renovated art-deco Hôtel des Batignolles has doubles from €89 room only.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Lille wonder: a whistle-stop tour of a Franco-Belgian jewel,Take a quick Eurostar trip from London for a short break to a city with a medieval heart but a modern approach to life,Sarah Turner,2019-10-13T07:00:43+0100,"Lille may not be the obvious city for a short break, despite the fact it’s highly convenient to reach via Eurostar. On the train, I flick through the current issue of Metropolitan, the Eurostar magazine, which skips past Lille to focus on the more obvious tourist locations of Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. However, when you alight here this city feels as if it’s transforming.Get past the sight of Primark that greets you from the station and there’s a medieval heart, with curving, pedestrianised streets. There’s a Franco-Belgium feel, from the place names to a love of mussels and the craft-brewery scene. Lille houses France’s biggest university; there are 67,000 students floating around in term-time.If the shops are closed on Sundays (this is France after all), the vast market at Wazemmes makes up for it. In the central hall you can find melons stamped with wax seals, pig heads and outsized globe artichokes. There’s clothing, more food and even, by Rue Parvis de Croix, some very good flea markets. It’s heaving with people, speaking a kaleidoscope of languages.Restaurants are largely good value, too. In Lille, you don’t go to La Ducasse expecting Michelin-starred finesse from Alain; instead, this is a resolutely French brasserie with rillettes and rabbit, coming in at €15 for a main course (but with better wine than you’d expect for that price). After lunch, head into the Palais des Beaux-Arts, stuffed with neoclassical heavyweights (although there’s room for a Picasso or two), courtesy of the city’s prosperous industrial past.Mines and mills brought workers to Lille in the 19th century, and the lines of flat-fronted brick terraces built to house them are still here. By the 1960s, Lille’s wealth had dwindled, but in recent years there’s been a determined renaissance. Today, the city’s brightest cultural jewel is La Piscine, a museum of decorative art. Located one stop from the centre by tram, in Roubaix, it was built by a socialist mayor and opened in 1932 as an enlightened art-deco temple to hygiene. One wing had bathrooms for workers whose housing didn’t include such niceties; a canteen allowed factory workers and their bosses to mix; there was a garden and – above all – the swimming pool, crowned either end by a stained-glass sunburst.After falling into disrepair, in 2000 it became a museum of decorative art, but it still showcases the original vision. The swimming pool has been narrowed to a reflecting pool, surrounded by grandiose sculptures. Elsewhere, art ranges from kitsch Victorian paintings of kittens to 1960s ceramics. Upstairs, overlooking the pool, what were once the changing rooms now house textiles.Nearby, La Manufacture museum tells the fascinating stories of the men and women who worked for Lille’s textile industry from medieval times to now, while La Villa Cavrois, a sleek modernist house built in 1932 for a local industrialist, is the perfect modernist gem with parquet and built-in kitchens to drool over.Into Lille’s growing verve now comes Mama Shelter, France’s home-grown groovy lifestyle hotel chain. You can see it from the station (which itself is designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas). Built on stilts, with a pitched roof, it echoes Vieux Lille’s medieval heart, but with a great deal more humour.Mama Shelter is the brainchild of Serge Trigano. In the 1950s his father created the Club Med brand, tempting generations of French families into beach resorts across the world, where they paid for drinks with beads. His son has almost as daunting a challenge, wooing millennials away from their Airbnb fixation. Partly, he’s doing it on cost – rooms are designed to be priced around the €69 mark – but also by turning his hotels into temples of urban fun and nostalgia: there are retro games in the lobby on free play and other witty touches throughout – look closely at the carpet in the lobby and you’ll see it’s a pattern of mussels. The 112 rooms are designed to be simple. There’s no room service, laundry or minibar, but the beds and the linens are seriously comfortable.Downstairs, the restaurant leads from the bar. It may be autumn, but we order rosé out on the terrace and nobody blanches as we drink it near the fire pit. As far as the menu goes, it’s comfort food all the way: mussels with thin and crunchy frites, casseroles and crème brûlée. Cocktails, which hover around the €13 mark, mix classic European negronis, with locally inspired ones. Definitely recommended is Le Dunkerque. It contains Picon, an orange-based bitters usually used to accompany beer in this part of France. A giant TV screen shows a loop of cool/kitsch clips from vintage films; a DJ booth is in one corner – the general message is clear, Mama Shelter want their hotels to feel distinctive.Children get their own menu and in a daring departure from the French norm, colouring books. On Sunday, the restaurant is given over to brunch; a very non-French all-you-can-eat affair (€35 for adults, €18 for children 6-11, under-6s free).The Lille hotel is the sixth Mama Shelter in France, (there are also branches in Rio, Los Angelesand it has just crossed the Channel opening in east London later this month – a room will start at £89 a night). For now it’s more of a novelty to head for Lille especially as next year this cultural hub will become France’s first World Design Capital, all the more reason to celebrate it – and it’s just 90 minutes from London.Eurostar tickets from £29 one way. Rooms at Mama Shelter Lille from £61. For more information, see hellolille.euLooking for a holiday with a difference?

10 of the best surfing beaches in the UK,There’s no need to head to Biarritz or Bali – the UK coastline has plenty of great waves and our surfing expert knows exactly where to catch them,Alf Alderson,2019-10-06T11:00:14+0100,"Northern Ireland’s toned-down answer to Newquay has a cheerful holiday vibe thanks to the swarms of beginners splashing around in the waves, in contrast to the more serious nature of some of the wilder and more remote surf spots found in this part of the world – especially to the west in Donegal. Portrush offers two options, West Strand (usually bigger) and East Strand, and like the rest of the breaks along this coastline they’re oriented in a generally northerly direction, which means the region’s prevailing winds are offshore, creating wonderful “clean” waves.Lessons and board hire From £30 for two hours, boards £12 a day at Troggs Surf School.Where to eat Check out the surf action with coffee and cake at Babushka Kitchen Café above West Strand.Where to stay Maddybenny Farm (camping from £7.50 adult, under-10s £5) offers quiet, family-friendly camping close to Portrush.The isle of Lewis and Harris has some of the most consistent waves in northern Europe thanks to its exposed location on the eastern edge of the Atlantic. And because of the Gulf Stream, the water isn’t as cold as you might expect (as high as 16C in the autumn). Add magnificent white sand beaches to that and if you catch it when the sun’s shining on a clean swell, you’ll consider the journey well worthwhile. Crowds are not an issue here and there’s usually a friendly vibe in the water, but bear in mind the isolation of the breaks when surfing in more challenging conditions, or if you’re inexperienced – novices should certainly be wary of going it alone.Lessons and board hire Adults from £45, children from £35, boards from £15 a day at Surf Lewis.Where to eat The nearby Uig Sands restaurant has superb sea views and is famed for its smoked Scottish salmon.Where to stay Ardroil Campsite (01851 672248, no website) is a basic community-run site with a toilet/shower/kitchen block situated above the beach; it operates on a donation system.A gorgeous swathe of pale sand and crystal-clear sea curves from Sennen Cove up towards Gwynver Beach, and provides the most consistent beach breaks in Cornwall (although Gwynver’s bigger breaks are better left to experienced wave riders). Sennen crams a village, surf shop, surf school, beach restaurant and busy car park between the sea, the cliffs and the steep sand dunes, and it’s always a hive of activity – but somehow there always seem to be enough waves to go around. The south end of the beach, where the waves are always smaller and more user-friendly, is perfect for beginners.Lessons and board hire £30 for two hours at Sennen Surfing Centre; boards £13 a day from Sennen Beach.Where to eat The Surf Beach Bar, which as the name suggests is right above the beach.Where to stay The family-run Trevedra Farm campsite (from £7.50 adult, £4 child + £3.50 tent pitch) above Gwynver has marvellous coastal views.Surfers have been riding the waves here since the 1960s, thanks to its proximity to Edinburgh and its reasonably mellow right-hand point break at the south end of the bay on good swells. This breaks over a cobble and sand bottom and can be pretty shallow at low tides, so you need to be reasonably competent to tackle it. There’s also a left-hander breaking off a sandbar at the north end of the bay. Autumn sees water temperatures at their highest – a balmy 14C.Lessons and board hire £35 for two hours, boards £6.50 an hour at St Vedas Surf Shop.Where to eat Try Graze Coffee & Chocolate House in Dunbar – the toasted Belgian waffles with a warm chocolate shot are particularly appealing after a cold session in the North Sea.Where to stay Meadowhead’s Mortonhall park has static caravans above the beach, but its campsite at nearby Belhaven Bay in the John Muir Country Park is a more attractive option (two people + tent from £19.80).This is the first place I ever surfed, and I’ve been riding the waves here with Nick Noble and Gary Rogers, the affable owners of the beachside surf shop and kit hire businesses, since 1979. The inclusive, down-to-earth vibe I encountered back then is still evident today as surfers of all abilities enjoy the beach breaks either side of the Victorian pier, and nearby there are some of the best and most challenging reef breaks to be found in England. Above the beach, one of the world’s oldest water-powered funicular railways runs up the sea cliffs to the neat streets of Saltburn-by-the-Sea, built under instruction from God by steel magnate and Quaker Henry Pease in the 1860s.Lessons and board hire £30 for two hours, boards £5 an hour at Saltburn Surf .Where to eat Watch the surf action with coffee and cake at the seafront Camfields Espresso Bar.Where to stay A few miles down the coast at Robin Hood’s Bay (which also gets surf), Bay Ness Farm (from £10 a night) has some of the best sea views in Yorkshire.It can be a bit of a zoo here on a good swell (the best waves tend to occur around low tide) but with so many surfers about, the buzz is reassuring if you’re a novice. If you’re looking to escape the crowds that’s easy enough – just leg it north up the huge expanse of Perran Sands, where you’ll find beach break peaks that are far less busy than the main beach, but beware of rips on bigger swells. There’s also a good right-hander breaking off Ligger Point at the very north end of Perran Sands, although it’s a slog to get there.Lessons and board hire £30 for two hours, boards from £7 a day at Piran Surf.Where to eat The Watering Hole is the obvious spot – it’s literally on the beach.Where to stay Tollgate Farm (from £5.50 adult, £2.50 child + £7 tent pitch) has access to Perran Sands through the dunes above the beach.Woolacombe is a beginner-friendly surf spot with mellow beach breaks, although it will certainly appeal to experienced surfers looking for bigger swells – especially as Croyde, the other local spot, is invariably far busier. At high tide a right breaks off the rocks at the northern end of the beach, which is what attracts experienced wave riders, and there are some decent low-tide peaks to be found in little Combesgate Beach just a bit further north. Most of the action at Woolacombe is right in front of the town, but since the beach stretches south for three miles you can avoid the inevitable crowds with a bit of a walk.Lessons and board hire £38 for two hours, boards from £6 a day at Hunter. Where to eat The Red Barn, which opened in early 2019, is in a prime location right above the beach.Where to stay Bay View Farmers campsite (from £7.50 adult, £3 child + £17 tent pitch) is a small, family-run site above the bay. The consistent beach breaks found here attract everyone from boogie boarders to longboarders. The peaks at Hillend, at the northern end of the three-mile strand, are the easiest to access and therefore the busiest, and you’ll always find surfers enjoying picnics and barbecues or just hanging out in the car park in the dunes above the beach. On bigger swells, paddling out at Langennith can be a real mission, with line after line of white water rolling relentlessly shorewards, so you’ll need some experience to attempt them. Avoid overcrowded waves by walking south towards Rhossili and, if you have the energy after surfing, climb Rhossili Downs above the beach for some of the best coastal views in Wales.Lessons and board hire From £22 at Llangennith Surf School, boards £12 a day at PJ’s Surf Shop.Where to eat Eddy’s Café at Hillend campsite (see below) is the most convenient après-surf hangout.Where to stay Hillend Caravan & Camping Park (tent for family of five or up to three adults from £21) above the beach is an appealing spot, but it can get very busy. One of the most accessible beaches in Pembrokeshire, two-mile-long Newgale has parking above most of its length, with the main surf action opposite the surf shop/school and campsite at the north end. There are beach break peaks all along it, and on smaller swells they’re pretty mellow – ideal for beginners and longboarders – but once it gets above head-high, paddling out is excruciatingly hard work. When I surf here I take time to scan the length of the beach before deciding where to paddle out, since a quick recce will invariably reveal a peak or two with few if any surfers on it.Lessons and board hire £35 for three hours at The Big Blue Experience, boards from £6 an hour at Newsurf.Where to eat Sands Café is conveniently located near the surf school.Where to stay Newgale Campsite (£8 adult, £4 child) at the north end of the beach is literally seconds from the surf.This is a vast stretch of sand and shingle at the southern tip of the lovely Llŷn peninsula, with beach breaks along its length plus a small reef at the north-west end of the bay, which will interest more experienced surfers. The beach break peaks along the rest of the bay are ideal for beginners (I did a lot of my early wave riding here) although you’ll need to watch out for rips on bigger swells – there’s a healthy and talented population of experienced local surfers ready to rip when a good swell hits. Porth Neigwl is known as Hell’s Mouth in English, but expect to hear Welsh being spoken out in the surf; the Llŷn peninsula is a hub of Welsh culture.Lessons and board hire £35 for two hours, boards £10 a day at West Coast Surf Shop in Abersoch, three miles to the east.Where to eat There’s nothing at the beach, but Mickey’s Boatyard & Beach Café in Abersoch is a good post-surf option.Where to stay Treheli Farm campsite (tent pitch £15) is right above the beach.

Where environmentalists go on holiday,"To mark Climate Week, campaigners and writers reveal how they take their holidays while staying true to their eco-values",	Antonia Wilson,2019-09-21T07:00:25+0100,"Kate Humble, TV presenter and authorI’d been having cabin fantasies – I wanted to go off-grid, swim in a river, eat tomatoes and read books. I wanted to be Huckleberry Finn. We booked a rural place in the north of the Dordogne, did lots of walking and as it was cep (porcini) season, the local market was full of delicious mushrooms. Most visitors to France buy wine and some cheese to take home, but by the end of the week we’d found some land nearby for sale, with a little fisherman’s hut by a lake, surrounded by trees. This was almost 10 years ago, and the two-room cabin is now our little piece of eco-heaven.We used clay and straw to plaster the inside, and the wood for the staircase and the handcut chestnut roof shingles came from our land or our neighbour’s. It has a kitchen-living area, a bedroom under the eves, a terrace and a composting loo, but no telly or phone signal. There’s a shower with a solar pump connected to the lake – but my favourite way of washing there is to heat a kettle on the woodburner and have a bucket shower.We go a couple of times a year, paddling on a raft and swimming, surrounded by kingfishers, swallows and dragonflies, with the sound of frogs in the evening. I once spent a month trying to spot a black woodpecker, which I saw fleetingly while running with my dog. You can feel like Henry David Thoreau on Walden Pond.For campervan drivers in France, there’s a system called France Passion . Membership costs €28 and includes a directory of places where you can stay for free for 24 hours. Some have a farm shop, so you can buy, say, some cider in return.My favourite thing is the night walk (about €12) from Busserolles village, which usually happens in July. About 300 people of all ages meet at 7pm to take one of two routes (8km or 12km). After a few kilometres, you convene in a field where there are lots of bottles of wine and little amuse-bouches. Further on, another field has rows of trestle tables for the main course – perhaps a huge bowl of bean soup with bread and cheese – by which time it’s dark and most people are a bit drunk. Back in the village there’s coffee and eclairs or sticky buns and a disco in the square. It’s a lovely community event that brings everyone together on the level that walking does. I’m researching a book about living simply, so in November I’m going to be an intern at the Earthship. It was started by architect Michael Reynolds, in Taos, New Mexico, who builds autonomous buildings made of 50% rubbish, designed to regulate temperature, recycle water, and have space to grow food. The book is about how to live happily with a lighter footprint on the planet. There’s no blanket solution but it’s about balance and consciousness, and as a global community, we’re all culpable.• Poacher’s Cabin sleeps two and is available to rent from Canopy & Stars (£90 a night)Craig Bennett, CEO, Friends of the EarthOne of the most important things to do on holiday is to disconnect from the outside world. No TV, no newspapers or looking at phones too much. When we visited the Norfolk Broads a few years ago, it was fantastic for going offline. Our children are 12 and 14, and it was the youngest who suggested it again for this year. Spending time as a family with the dogs on a boat with a top speed of about six miles an hour really makes you slow down.We picked up the boat in Stalham, cruised past Yarmouth to Beccles and Lowestoft then back up via Reedham. We did a few nights of wild moorings, under beautiful dark skies, and saw an otter or two, herons and lots of other wildlife. It’s a different experience from other ways of travelling around the UK – arriving at little villages by water, taking a walk to seek out a teashop, or into a pub for dinner. We loved the Ferry Inn in Stokesby and the Rising Sun in Coltishall, both with overnight moorings.We then drove up the east coast to Northumberland and stayed in a cottage on a farm near Alnmouth. I had my first family holiday in the village when I was 13 and I’d often pass it on the train to Edinburgh, and thought I’d like to return.We spent half a day at Druridge Bay, just south of Amble. Friends of the Earth have been fighting against a proposal for a new opencast coal mine on this unspoiled coastal stretch. Tourism has brought in £1bn for the region, but the proposal could end the very reason people visit these parts. The Northumberland coast is extraordinary, with beautiful sand dunes and hardly anyone there. We had a lot of long walks on dog-friendly beaches, made “water worlds” in the sand, and caught a whiff of smoky kippers in Craster.People will often talk about holidays in the UK as a “staycation” but I find that odd. When I was growing up, the normal thing was to holiday in the UK – it’s how I got to know the country I live in, an experience I want my children to have too.Emma Kemp, campaigner, 10:10 Climate Action, leader of its Climate Perks initiative Following a breakup, I decided to travel solo around Italy for two-and-a-half weeks in the hope of filling myself with Italian veggie food, sunny weather and Roman history. It was my first time travelling alone and the days before I left were speckled with excitement over my new-found independence, as well as nerves.I was stunned by the views from the train between Paris and Turin, through mountains and little villages. After a day spent cycling along the riverbank and eating amazing local raspberry and almond granita, it was on to the Cinque Terre, where fresh pesto in Vernazza was a highlight.Next, an overnight train took me to Puglia, the heel of Italy’s boot. I adored the whole region: Lecce is all baroque architecture, and in Ostuni I feasted on regional beetroot and turnip-top soup and truffle pasta with wild mushrooms. A lot of the traditional food in this region is vegetarian, because meat was once unaffordable for most.Everyone told me the same thing about Naples: that you cry twice. Once when you arrive and again when you leave. I was surprised by how much this rang true. When I got off the coach it was a shock after clean, quaint Lecce, but I fell in love while wandering the city’s streets and eating deep-fried pizza.After day trips to the Amalfi coast, Pompeii and Paestum – said to be the birthplace of mozzarella – I took a sleeper train to Sicily, which goes on the ferry to cross the Strait of Messina. Syracuse has an amazing archeological park, with both Greek and Roman ruins and, 15km south, a flawless beach called Fontane Bianche. Later in the trip I passed through Siena – stumbling on a vegan dessert shop during the busy horse race celebrations – and spent a rainy day in Venice.Going by train allowed me to rediscover the magic of travel, and although it was more expensive than flying, it didn’t break the bank.Neil Ansell, author of The Last Wilderness: A Journey into SilenceThis year I made a conscious choice to stay close to home, using public transport to visit a place where I spent a lot of my childhood – the New Forest in Hampshire. The forest has some spectacular ancient woodland but also wide expanses of lowland heath which is great for wildlife but a globally threatened habitat. I took advantage of fine weather with an exposed heathland walk on Hampton Ridge in the north of the forest. From the bus stop in Fordingbridge, I walked two miles along country lanes to the hamlet of Frogham, where there is a pub, the Foresters Arms. Beside this is Harry’s Field for camping, open only for summer weekends.The trail leads up onto a high gravel ridge with long views north and south over heathland flushed purple with heather. It looked just as I remembered it from my last visit, way back in the 1970s.The place is tranquil now, but it was not always so; in the 1940s it was part of a bombing range. There are still a few traces that remain, including a slightly alarming 30-metre concrete arrow, a directional marker for bombers.Beside the ever-present buzzards, there is a chance to see other birds of prey, including goshawks, hobbies and even honey buzzards; and in the gorse brakes along the ridge-line trail, there are stonechats and Dartford warblers, only found on lowland heath.At the end of the ridge, the trail leads left into the isolated Pitts Wood Inclosure, known for woodpeckers, crossbills, and hawfinches. I saw both roe and fallow deer too, fawns in tow, and by staying until dark, was able to watch the mysterious nightjar.From the wood, the path heads up Cockley Hill to the village of Godshill and the Fighting Cocks pub. I usually camp in the area; there are 40 campsites scattered around the forest, such as Longbeech close to this trail, where I’ve stayed before. The walk, from roadhead to roadhead, could be managed in two or three hours, but it’s better to make a day of it, or stay overnight, and just wander and soak up the atmosphere.Donnachadh McCarthy, co-founder of Stop Killing Cyclists and author of The Prostitute State – How Our Democracy Has Been BoughtI usually seek out a rural UK eco-retreat for a holiday, and this year headed to the Rewilding Consciousness retreat at the Embercombe Centre near Dartmoor. I travelled by fold-up bike to the station, took a train to Exeter, then cycled to Embercombe – a hilly but pleasingly low-traffic ride. The great thing about a bike is that if you have to push it uphill, you have fun free-wheeling down the other side.Halfway there, the heavens opened, turning the roads into raging muddy torrents. I got soaked, but this was warm summer rain so felt like a hilarious adventure. Rolling up to reception, I stood in silence looking at the valley below and felt a sense of achievement in getting there without motor transport.Accommodation was in little yurt villages, with woodburners and composting loos among trees laden with ripe fruit. The wind in the woodland whispered gently, and roared in a glorious storm one evening. Embercombe also has a lake called Tree Mirror, which is great for swimming.The course taught us to open our ears and eyes to nature and reconnect to it in a way that we have lost in our busy tech-based lives. On the final evening, I slipped out to the stone circle to spend the night in my sleeping bag under the full moon. By the end of a week without my phone, my soul felt recharged. Investing in such “holy-days” heals our hearts and minds.Roger Hallam, co-founder of Extinction RebellionOne of the under-reported things about Extinction Rebellion (XR) is that it’s developing into a really close community. A lot of people who felt isolated in their horror at the climate emergency suddenly find all these other compassionate, dedicated people who feel the same, so there’s an immediate connection. Naturally, people get to know each other and travel to see one another for talks and events. More than once I’ve rung someone in the organisation and they’ve helped me find somewhere to stay.I’ve been very busy this year, and didn’t have much planned for the summer. I was asked to talk at Byline Festival in East Sussex [which helps promote independent journalism], so decided to have a holiday in the area too. I phoned an XR friend in Brighton and asked if she knew of anyone with a bit of land to camp on but it turned out her family home was in the countryside near Pulborough, and she let us borrow it.We mostly relaxed at the house but did go to the local village fete in Rackham one day. But my thing is cooking. I’m an organic farmer (although I’m now mainly based in the XR London office), so I brought enough veg from the farm in Wales to last us the week. We had a vegan sausage barbecue, and there were apples, plums and blackberries growing onsite to make a pie from. The South Downs was great for long walks – it’s about as wild as southern England gets.I often travel around the UK, but I don’t take many holidays. There’s definitely a balance that we’re all trying to negotiate, and the two big lifestyle issues are flying and meat. My feeling is that we are on the verge of a major change in social attitudes.Nicoleta Carpineanu, founder of Forests Without FrontiersI live in Brighton but one of my favourite places to go on holiday is Transylvania, where I’m from. It’s a place of wild, untouched beauty and I go back whenever I can. Cluj is the second-largest city in Romania and is very multicultural, home to lots of artists and festivals, such as the Transylvanian film festival in May, and Untold dance music festival in August. Cluj is very close to the Apuseni mountains, where I stay in a restored village called Raven’s Nest. They’ve converted beautiful old houses into guest accommodation and source local products for everything, from soaps to throws.The views are stunning and there’s an outdoor hot tub for soaking under the stars. The restaurant uses regional, organic ingredients and has a good selection of Romanian wines. I love walking to waterfalls and caves in the surrounding wilderness. There are bears here and other amazing wildlife, too.I’m going back to Romania at the end of September and plan to take the train there via Vienna, where I’ll spend the night. It’s one of my favourite capitals, the meeting place of east and west Europe. I love the museums. I’ll continue to Romania by rail, and visit the area in the Carpathian mountains where I’m planting trees with my new reforestation charity, Forests Without Frontiers. I want to visit Amfiteatrul, an eco-lodge in the mountains that I’ve heard a lot of good things about. This is my favourite kind of trip – slow travel, really connecting with nature and with local people.Anna Hughes, author and founder of Flight Free UKI’m training for a big cycle ride this month, from Dieppe to Nice. I’ll take the ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe, stopping off at Mont Ventoux in Provence for the not-insignificant challenge of cycling up the mountain from three different approaches in one day. So my summer has been a series of weekend training trips in the UK, visiting places I love or have never been to.Abergavenny falls into the latter group. The Tumble, a famous climb at the edge of the Brecon Beacons, was my goal, and Wales didn’t disappoint. It was a weekend of cycling in horizontal rain. The River Usk foamed the colour of chocolate at the bottom of the valley, as the mercifully flat towpath led into Brecon for shelter and warming soup.The Lake District could not have been more different – it was the August bank holiday weekend, when heat records were broken yet again. Accommodation was at the YHA: it was comfortable, a great budget option, and a lovely melting pot of people. From the hostel, the views across Windermere were spectacular, and the cycling was terrific – wild, windswept moorland and rich, luscious greenery. It was really hard, but I was fuelled by Kendal mint cake. The view changed with every turn, from a corrugated skyline of mountains to smaller hills marked with sheep and the scribbling of dry stone walls.I haven’t flown for 10 years, and I’m not about to start now. There is so much variety here in the UK that we’re spoiled for choice with no-fly adventures. And my return from Nice next month will be by train.Sophie Sleeman, UK Student Climate NetworkAfter turning down a trip to New York in May because I didn’t want to fly, I had the chance to go to Lausanne in Switzerland for a week in August, for an international conference with other young climate activists. There were 25 of us from the UK, and 446 in total, from 37 different countries. I took the train from Exeter to London, the Eurostar to Paris and then the TGV to Lausanne. It was the best train journey I’ve ever done, watching the mountains pass as we travelled through the Alps. It was beautiful. We stayed in the Pontaise district and had meetings and workshops at the University of Lausanne. The food at the university was vegan, a lot of it from supermarkets who were about to throw it out – all fresh but going to waste because it had reached its sell by date.Lake Geneva is right beside the university. It has a beach where we went swimming and had seaweed fights. We also went into Lausanne town and bought Swiss chocolate. It was my first proper trip abroad without my family. They just went to Turkey without me, but I didn’t want to fly, and don’t enjoy the heat that much. We need to improve transport around the UK, and I think we should use a frequent flyer levy to invest in rail and bus travel, to make it easier to get around rural areas. Ruth Hyde, director, Woodland TrustThis summer I went to Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in Tarn-et-Garonne, in the south of France with a friend. I wanted somewhere I could drive to with my road bike, so we took the Eurotunnel, but abandoned the car for the week to cycle and walk around. We saw a lot on the way down, and felt we’d travelled properly; with air travel there’s no real sense of journey.We stayed in a friend’s townhouse a few minutes from the centre, called Cordeliers. There’s a great Sunday market on the town square selling local produce – cheese, bread, wine and wobbly fruit and vegetables that taste amazing.As the town is in a gorge, whichever way you cycle, it seems to be up. But there are plenty of medieval towns with old churches and ruins to explore, with masses of countryside and smooth riding on often empty roads in between.We’d go out in the mornings before it got too hot, then sometimes spend the afternoon relaxing by the River Aveyron, swimming or exploring by kayak. One ride took us to Saint Projet, where we joined a marché gourmand community food event, with lots of food stalls and everyone eating at communal tables. This one was big on goat’s cheeses and aligot – the smoothest mashed potato ever with cheese and garlic.Next year I’m planning to cycle coast to coast in France, probably from Caen to Nice, which is around 900 miles and will be a real adventure.Tiffany Francis, nature writer and author of Dark Skies: A journey into the Wild NightLast January, my husband and I went for a week of snowboarding and skiing for my birthday. We caught the Snow Express coach from London Victoria to Tignes in the French Alps, which took around 20 hours with stops for coffee breaks. Part of the journey was on the Dover-Calais ferry, which gave us a chance to stretch our legs. .We booked into a UCPA (French non-profit) hostel that provides equipment, half-day lessons, lift passes and meals. It was beautiful weather all week, with good snowfalls overnight. One morning I explored the area on foot, and loved watching a flock of Alpine choughs – a yellow-beaked member of the crow family – hopping over chalet roofs in the warm sun. The Alps in winter aren’t an obvious place to go birdwatching, but the snowy backdrop makes it easy to spot anything flying around. There’s also the chance to see bearded vultures, one instructor told us, which are on the rise in the area after a successful breeding programme.Being out on the slopes all day meant most evenings were spent eating and relaxing, but on my birthday we went to Cocorico après ski bar. The music was cheesy 1990s and noughties, which was perfect for singing along to, no matter what languages everyone spoke. We had a great night drinking beers and vodka shots and dancing under the stars.We both love travelling by train, and have decided to avoid taking flights in Europe for the foreseeable future. It’s increasingly difficult to justify the carbon emissions of flying. Next year, for any trips around the continent, the journey will be part of the holiday – watching the different landscapes pass by instead of hurrying around by plane. We love the idea so much we’re now thinking of saving up to take the Trans-Siberian Express to Mongolia.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

A weekend break on an organic farm in Kent,"Regular volunteering with Wwoof is like being in The Archers … you’re part of a farming community, make new friends – both human and animal – and learn to appreciate sustainability",,2019-10-01T06:30:33+0100,"As dusk fell, firelight spilled from the windows of the farmhouse and the hens trooped single file up a sloping branch to roost in the leafy canopy overhead.They woke me at dawn the next day, landing like ripe pears on the roof of the rickety caravan where I slept under two duvets and in a sleeping bag, hat and gloves. As an unpaid volunteer agricultural worker escaping from my London bubble, it was time to pull on my wellies and yomp across a muddy paddock to feed pigs. That was 6am on a freezing morning 18 months ago, and right from the start I was hooked.Burscombe Cliff Farm lies down a steep muddy lane on the side of a wooded escarpment in the Weald of Kent, at medieval Egerton village, near Ashford, just an hour down the M20 from my home. It has been welcoming “Wwoofers” for nearly 30 years, since the original Working Weekends on Organic Farms movement (now called World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, but still Wwoof) was founded in 1971. People of all ages and nationalities have fed the livestock, dug the veg patch, walked the young bulls and bunked down in the farm’s ancient caravans. Unlike me, most arrive by train or bike. But I got to go home piled high with fresh local produce and bags of compost.Our host is seventysomething former doctor Hilary Jones, who breeds award-winning Blonde d’Aquitaine cattle, gentle creatures the size of small elephants. She has been committed to sustainability since before ecotourism was a thing.A faded sticker – Nuclear Power No Thanks – reveals the remains of an old van once used to get to an Aldermaston march in a heap of brambles beyond her back door. For relaxation, Jones dyes and spins the wool from her sheep – in weld yellow, rose madder pink and indigo blue, and the bright orange she presses from onion skins. Nothing is wasted here. Everything is mended or repurposed. There is wifi, but no TV, just BBC Radio 3 and intelligent engaged chat to the click of knitting needles or the soothing clunk of the spinning wheel.The UK has more than 550 Wwoof hosts, dedicated organic farmers and smallholders promoting awareness of ecological management of our landscapes and wildlife by offering visitors bed, board and hands-on experience in exchange for six hours’ labour a day. There are also around 4,000 registered UK Wwoofers.In the 18 months I have been coming here, I have delivered lambs (“We are a grandmother”), groomed the prize bull, scythed a field, mended the greenhouse and learned to eat pigs whose ears I have scratched. It hasn’t turned me vegetarian, but I treat meat with more respect and buy less of it.Wwoofing this way, with regular return visits, is like walking into The Archers. I get updates on the fight to save the local shop and the library van, and chat to everyone from the artist neighbours in the cottage across the fields to the shepherd managing a large conventional flock on the next farm, the tractor man trying to set up his own decorating business, the veg box grower and passing hikers out enjoying the countryside.There are at least three regular Wwoofers at Burscombe Cliff: a teacher, a writer and a journalist. We could visit other farms and Wwoof in other countries – there are 132 member countries to choose from, and Australia, New Zealand and the US each has several thousand hosts – but we like it here, taking mini-breaks from our city lives, filling our lungs with fresh air and swinging our shoulders.Last week I popped back for a happy afternoon up a ladder in the orchard, picking apples. In the next weeks the cows will start coming in from the fields for calving, and the ram will go out to the ewes on 5 November for lambing in early April. In between, there are fences to mend, medlars to pick, broad beans and onion sets to plant, and above all logs to chop for the hungry Rayburn stove. There’s always plenty to do and winter is coming.• Find out more at wwoof.net.

Good nature: citizen science trips and holidays in the UK,Passionate about wildlife and nature? These surveys and activities offer volunteers a close-up of our fauna and flora while helping to safeguard the environment,Rhiannon Batten,2019-08-23T06:30:06+0100,"Forestry England’s Big Forest Find is the country’s largest survey of forest wildlife. Volunteers can download the free iNaturalist app, then use it to take and upload photographs of animals and plants in their local forest, identifying the species they find. This can be anything from lichen and other fungi to birds, butterflies and mammals. These observations are verified by experts and added to national records on biodiversity. Accurate records help ecologists, scientists and rangers provide homes for wildlife and care for the forests. There are also expert-led activities, such as one in Savernake Forest, Wiltshire, on 5 October. The Big Forest Find is part of Forestry England’s centenary celebrations – the Forestry Commission was founded in 1919 to restore the nation’s woods and forests after the first world war, and is now focusing on preparing for the climate crisis. • Until 31 October, free, forestryengland.ukThe National Trust’s working holidays involve various outdoor activities, including plant and animal surveys. Volunteers might be identifying plants on the Woolbeding estate in West Sussex, monitoring bats and birds at Arlington Court in Devon or surveying wildflowers and butterflies on Dorset’s Golden Cap estate. One appealing upcoming holiday is at the Holnicote estate in Somerset from 23-27 September, on 12,000 acres of moorland, woodland and beaches in Exmoor national park. Volunteers will take part in an annual dormouse survey, before the tiny creatures hibernate in October, and help with charcoal-making and coppicing – woodland management. This is vital to sustain the dormice population, because Hazel (or common) dormouse numbers in the UK have declined by a third since 2000. Volunteers will also join a deer stalker to learn about the ecology of Exmoor’s red deer. Accommodation is in a converted barn with two dormitories and there is a pub a short walk away.• £180, including food, accommodation and transfers, nationaltrust.org.ukRockpooling meets marine research in this year-old social enterprise project. Its family-friendly day trips around Falmouth and St Mawes offer a chance to discover the south Cornish coast and survey local wildlife along the way, helping to build a map of rock pool diversity across the project’s survey sites. Participants are given waterproof cameras with which to photograph finds over a two-hour guided experience, and at the end staff collect them and tag the images with species’ names before adding the information to the Rock Pool Project database.• Two-hour guided experience, child £3.83 to £6.52. The last of the summer’s group events runs on 31 August (St Mawes by ferry from Prince of Wales Pier) but private sessions can also be arranged, therockpoolproject.co.ukPlan ahead for next summer and join the “puffarazzi” with the RSPB. Between early June and late July 2020, visitors to the UK’s puffin colonies will be asked to take photographs of birds with fish in their bills, making a note of the date, time and location and then uploading that information to a dedicated page on the RSPB’s website. The idea is to help conservation scientist Dr Ellie Owen and her team pinpoint why puffin colonies are declining (the current thinking is that it is related to a reduction in food availability caused by climate change). The colonies include Skomer Island, in Pembrokeshire, to which the Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales runs day trips between Easter and the end of September.• Boat fares from Martin’s Haven to Skomer are £11 adult, £7 child, landing fee £11 adult, £5 child. Hostel-style overnight stay from £30 adult, £15 child. Details of Project Puffin at rspb.org.ukFor an in-depth citizen science experience, the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust offers research-centred boat trips of between seven and 12 days on its yacht, Silurian (which was used in filming BBC’s Blue Planet), between April and October each year. The project has been monitoring whales, dolphins, porpoises and basking sharks off the west coast of Scotland for 17 years and holds the largest database of its kind for UK waters, adding to its records each year by systematically surveying the west coast. There are also dedicated sailings just for 16- and 17-year-olds. If a week is too long, the charity also runs the Whale Track initiative, whereby anyone visiting Scotland’s west coast can record whale and dolphin sightings via a free app, helping to track the movements of different species. • From £950pp all-inclusive, hwdt.orgWhen Ryde Pier opened in 1814, the idea was to offer foot passengers disembarking from boats an alternative to walking across a long stretch of wet sand to reach dry land (at low tide this was up to half a mile). Today, however, getting sand between your toes is an attraction in itself. Especially on 30 August, at this year’s Under The Pier art and nature event. It’s a volunteer-powered survey of the marine wildlife in, on and under the pier, and finds can be identified with the help of professional ecologists, then verified, recorded and submitted to the Isle of Wight Natural History and Archaeological Society (which maintains the island’s species database). Along the way, younger visitors can sand-cast their own starfish or listen to the sea with a hydrophone. • 3.30pm-6pm, free (take your own net), open to all ages, underthepier.spaceThis year marks the 20th anniversary of Moth Night, with a host of moth-counting activities across the country from 26 to 28 September. One of the most sociable events will be at the Yorkshire Arboretum, at Castle Howard near York, on 27 September. Visitors can hear more about typical local species over a drink at the cafe, before joining experts to set moth traps around the trees in the late evening. The group return the following morning to inspect the traps, record what is inside them and so help monitor species numbers and, potentially, identify the migration of species over time.• 9pm-10.30pm, then 8am next day, £4 adult, £2 child, yorkshirearboretum.org, mothnight.info Otters are notoriously elusive but the island of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland, has over 300 miles of suitable coastal habitat and supports one of the highest densities of Eurasian otters in the UK. Many wildlife enthusiasts travel to the island specifically to spot them and, while the Mull Otter Group doesn’t reveal known locations (to avoid disturbance), it encourages visitors to record otter sightings via its website. Reporting sightings helps the group better understand otter biology and ecology, encourage responsible otter watching, reduce otter road casualties and generally keep tabs on local otter populations. There’s a better chance of spotting one of the glossy-backed creatures with one of local wildlife walk operator Mull Magic’s Otter Detective Walks. Sightings aren’t guaranteed but the idea behind the small-group tours is to help visitors responsibly look for, and learn about, otters.• mullottergroup.co.uk.

With plastic pollution now an issue on all the world’s beaches, the need for this annual event is indisputable. It’s not just about litter-picking, however. The Marine Conservation Society also collects data from the initiative to help support its campaigns (which have succeeded in introducing the plastic bag levy, a ban on microplastics in personal care products and better wet wipe labelling). Find an organised event using the map on the Marine Conservation Society website. Listings for group cleans currently range from Ballyhornan Beach in County Down to Gorleston in Norfolk.• Free, mcsuk.orgThe British Isles are home to more than 650 species of seaweed, which in turn create shelter and food for thousands of sea creatures, help protect coastlines from waves and are used in everything from foods to cosmetics. But rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification and the spread of non-native species are affecting seaweed health and distribution. To monitor this, the long-running Big Seaweed Project asks volunteers to visit British shorelines at low tide and record the seaweed, taking photographs and recording finds with a downloadable booklet.

Best vegan and vegetarian food tours in European cities,Plant-based tours are springing up in cities where meaty cuisine traditionally rules – and these choices also explore some of Europe’s coolest urban districts,	Antonia Wilson,2019-09-08T07:00:42+0100,"“Anything you can do I can do vegan,” says Vegan Food Tours, which runs jaunts through Rome’s Monti, one of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods (three hours, €67 adult, €29 child). While exploring the area, known for its gourmet street food and bohemian bars, travellers get to sample antipasti, fresh pasta, pizza and dairy-free gelato.In Tuscany, Fantastic Florence includes a veggie or vegan feast in the historic San Lorenzo neighbourhood (€65 an hour for up to eight people). The suggested tour (which can be customised) starts the day with an espresso, and heads to Mercato Centrale di San Lorenzo to sample balsamic vinegars, truffles, bread, pasta and regional soup. To finish, there’s a vegan-certified wine and chocolate tasting. In the Spanish capital, Madrid Vegan Travel’s tour includes plant-based tapas with craft beer and tinto de verano (red wine with lemon soda) in the Malasaña district, an area known for experimental eateries (three hours,€68/€38). Or there’s a heritage tour with a vegan lunch in the historic city of Toledo, 45 miles south of Madrid (seven hours, from €89).The team behind BeBike Tours in Barcelona can arrange tailor-made tours by electric bike with vegan guides, with stops at raw cafes, and a vegan cheesemongers (email for details and prices). Alternatively, the Gastronomic Segway Tour from sister company Barcelona Segway Tour takes in nine tapas dishes – with meat-free, dairy-free and gluten-free options – on a three-hour tasting route (from €83pp).London was voted best city in the world for vegans last year by Happy Cow, which ranks places by the number of vegan restaurants and “overall vegan-friendliness”. For a quintessential London experience, B Bakery’s vegan afternoon tea is served on a vintage Routemaster that heads to classic sights while travellers sip tea and nibble plant-based tarts and sandwiches (1½ hours, £45pp).Brighton has also long been veggie-friendly, and is one of the locations for VegFest food festival in March. Sussex Food Tours’ vegetarian tour of Brighton includes award-winning restaurants, and encourages carnivores to join too, claiming that it will be “a plant taste experience that will change your life” (three hours, £59pp).Berlin also has a wealth of meat-free dining and shopping options, coming in second on Happy Cow’s list of vegan-friendly cities. Fork & Walk’s vegan walking tour (3½ hours, from €44pp) explores Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg and Kreuzberg areas, passing the Stolpersteine “stumbling stones” Holocaust monument, vintage photo booths, 1980s squatting sites and street art. Vegan treats along the way include doughnuts, dumplings, raw cakes, street food and several pilsner beers – which have been vegan-friendly since the 1500s. Bite Berlin delves into the city’s history through its diverse food culture, exploring neighbourhoods from Hackescher market square to the Neukölln area, including currywurst and Turkish cuisine (pictured), which has been a popular budget choice in Berlin since just after the second world war (three hours, €50).Vegan Food Tours’ Amsterdam adventure begins close to Vondelpark (pictured), and heads into the city’s design-conscious Oud-West neighbourhood (three hours €79/€35). Travellers can sample vegan versions of Dutch bitterballen (meat balls), raw ice-cream, vegan junk food and weed burgers (made from seaweed). For a tour of the city by water, the Boat Boys run canal cruises on a 1920s saloon boat. The vessel has an open deck for sunny days, passes landmarks including Anne Frank’s house, and includes a vegan cheese platter and unlimited wine and beer, or vegan prosecco and champagne on request (1½ hours, from €25pp, up to 12 people).Vegan Food Tours in France (same name, different company) has a choice of routes in three cities. The company says most of its guests are omnivores or flexitarians, although the tours are all 100% plant-based. This doesn’t mean missing out on French classics though – vegan cheese, pâté (and wine on request) are served alongside contemporary health food and traditional market fare. In Paris, tours take in urban street art in Belleville, or an eclectic mix of old and new in the 10th arrondissement – the city’s most veggie-friendly district. Outside the capital, historical tours take travellers to vegan gems in Lyon and Bordeaux. Each comes with four vegan stops over a four-hour tour, with breakfast, lunch in two parts and dessert (from €55).Prague has seen an increase in meat-free restaurants in recent years, from a vegan doughnut shop to socially conscious veggie cafes employing homeless and disadvantaged people. I Like Veggie runs tours of the historic centre, exploring the new healthy gastronomy that is gathering force in the Czech capital, as an alternative to the country’s traditional meat-oriented dishes. There are four stops – including a raved-about raw cake – and sightseeing stops at the famous Astronomical Clock, the Old Town Square and Municipal House (four hours, €80) of Prague’s historic centre.According to a study last year, 30% of Swedes say they are eating more plant-based foods in a bid to help save the environment. For a taste of that Scandi spirit, Stockholm Food Tours’ vegetarian walk explores the southern district of Södermalm, a favourite with locals for its creative vibe and innovative restaurants. The four-hour tour (£77pp) mixes neighbourhood delis, high-end and health food restaurants – including a vegan buffet with panoramic city views – and also caters for raw food diets.Hungarian cuisine is traditionally meat-heavy, but it now has plenty of options for hungry vegan travellers. Budapest 101 offers private, tailormade tours with a local hosts (four hours, from €46pp for up to six), exploring Hungarian history and culture while tasting the city’s best veggie and vegan food, from traditional pickles to cakes, coffee and wine. Stops include markets, confectioners and health food shops for gooey, fried vegan cheese and traditional krumplis tészta (potato pasta and paprika).Also by Vegan Food Tours and new for this year is a journey around the pretty bakeries and squares of Lisbon’s Baixa district (pictured) – the city’s historic heart famous for its neoclassical architecture – for dairy-free pastries, “steak” sandwiches made with seitan and vegan cheese, and local vegan wine (three hours, from €59/€19pp). For traditional Portuguese food (adapted to be meat- and dairy-free) in a rural setting, take a trip to an organic farm in Sintra west of Lisbon. A farm tour is followed by a cooking class using seasonal ingredients – participants can then eat their creations at a table with a sea view (€40pp).Courgette fritters with tzakiki, slabs of feta, stuffed vine leaves and spinach pie… Vegetarians are unlikely to go hungry in Greece. But vegans can get their fill too – and the Secret Vegan Tour in Athens comes with a warning to bring an empty stomach. The two-hour-15-min tour includes vegan tacos, gyros souvlaki, Greek salad (pictured) and waffles with ice-cream, plus booze (€55). The company, Vegan Tour Athens, also runs a Beach Vegan Tour, heading out to two lesser-known beaches close to the city, with lunch at an award-winning restaurant, including vegan cheese tasting and raw food desserts (six hours, €109pp). Owner Frank is also the organiser of the Vegan Life Festival in Greece, with a bill of talks, exhibitions and parties (next on in Crete, 5-6 Oct 2019).• Looking for a holiday with a difference?

10 of the UK's best railway cycle paths,"Former railway lines up and down the country now offer great, family-friendly off-road cycle trails – and some even go up and down a bit",Dixe Wills,2019-08-31T07:00:55+0100,"Start/finish Wenfordbridge/Padstow (with a short spur to Bodmin)Distance 18 miles Getting there/away From Bodmin Parkway station it’s a short ride to the trail at Boscarne Junction, north-west of Bodmin town. Alternatively, pop your bike on one of Bodmin and Wenford Railway’s steam trains from Bodmin Parkway to the junction. Head north-east along the trail to reach Wenfordbridge or north-west for Padstow. Alternatively, from Bodmin Parkway take the 11A bus (plymouthcitybus.co.uk) to Padstow and hire bikes thereBike hire In Bodmin at Bodmin Bikes and Trail Munki; in Wenfordbridge at Snail’s Pace Cafe; in Wadebridge at Camel Trail Cycle Hire; and in Padstow at Trail Bike HirePotential stopovers Bodmin, Wadebridge and PadstowTop tips Check out the Camel River Festival or the Cornwall Folk Festival, both in Wadebridge each AugustThe nation’s best-known former railway cycle path is also one of the loveliest. Coursing for the best part of 20 miles around north Cornwall, it starts at the south-western edge of Bodmin Moor and follows the River Camel down into Wadebridge before heading along the estuary to the popular seaside foodie resort of Padstow. It’s mainly off-road, and combines most of the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway with a section of the North Cornwall Railway.Start/finish Callander/KillinDistance 24 milesGetting there/away Travel to Stirling by rail and hop on the no 1 or 59 or bus to Callander and hire a bikeBike hire From Wheels Cycling Centre just outside CallanderPotential stopovers Callander, KillinTop tips In Killin, visit the little-known island of Inchbuie in the middle of the River Dochart. Hidden among the conifers is a most unusual ancient burial ground, for chieftains of the Clan Macnab. Keys to the island’s entrance gate can be obtained from the local libraryIt’s not often a disused railway cycleway is described as “challenging” but this is Scotland, where the mountainous landscape often posed problems for Victorian civil engineers. This trail through the Loch Lomond and Trossachs national park largely follows the defunct Callander and Oban Railway. It shares the narrow valley carved by the River Garbh Uisge with an old military road before heading along the shore of Loch Lubnaig and the east bank of the River Balvaig. Passing high above the head of Loch Earn, it storms up Glen Ogle, over a magnificent viaduct (pictured), and down at last to Killin, at the southern end of Loch Tay. Thankfully, the licensed Broch Café at Strathyre provides a homely little place to stop mid-ride for a light meal or an Italian coffee and a traybake.Start/finish Bristol harbour/Bath city centreDistance 16 milesGetting there/away Bristol Temple Meads and Bath Spa railway stations are handily placed at either end of the trail (on the same line)Bike hire Pick up a Brompton folding bicycle at Bristol Temple Meads station or a more conventional bike nearby at Cycle the City. In Bath from Green Park Bike StationPotential stopovers Bristol, BathTop tip To do a circular trip, returning along the Kennet and Avon Canal towpathWhile this path is by no means the shortest route between Bristol and Bath – it describes a kind of seahorse-shaped curve – it’s by far and away the most pleasant way of travelling between the two. Running along the former track of the confusingly named Midland Railway, the smooth, wide path is lined with trees much of the way, giving it the feel of a secret tunnel burrowing from the heart of one grand old city to the other. Some of the former stations remain intact and the waiting room at Warmley has been turned into a cafe serving tea and cake on the old platform. There’s another cafe at Bitton station, home of the Avon Valley Railway and its three miles of restored track (the cycle path runs alongside). There are some splendid views of rural Somerset and Gloucestershire when the trees part, and the company of the River Avon to enjoy at the Bath end.Start/finish Whitby/ScarboroughDistance 21 milesGetting there/away The start and finish are close to Whitby and Scarborough railway stations respectivelyBike hire At the former Hawsker railway station near Whitby (trailways.info)Potential stopovers Whitby, Robin Hood’s Bay, ScarboroughTop tips Although winningly authentic, the trail’s cinder track is unsuitable for thin road tyres, so you’ll need a hybrid or mountain bike. The 18th-century coaching inn at Hayburn Wyke is a great place for some lunch and a pint of Black Sheep ale The railway line joining Whitby and Scarborough was in operation for 80 years from 1885, ferrying passengers and goods along the coast up the eastern edge the North York Moors. Named after the track ballast that still surfaces the route (somewhat unevenly in parts), the Cinder Track now forms a long off-road section of National Cycle Network Route 1. The 37-metre-high Larpool viaduct, high above the River Esk, makes a fittingly grand exit from Whitby. Along the way, Maw Wyke Hole and Cloughton Wyke are two of several cracking little bays if you fancy taking a picnic to eat by the sea. Robin Hood’s Bay (pictured), famous as the eastern end of Wainwright’s coast-to-coast walking route, is a delightful fishing village whose maze of narrow streets were beloved of smugglers. You can explore (for free) the ruins of the 16th-century Peak Alum Works at Ravenscar – one of Britain’s first chemical works. And Scarborough, with its promontory castle, makes for a dramatic destination.Start/finish Norwich/AylshamDistance 26 milesGetting there/away It’s a short distance from Norwich station to the start. At the end, it’s a six-mile ride to the nearest stations at North Walsham or Worstead. Alternatively, since the route ends at Aylsham station, pop your bike on the minimum-gauge Bure Valley Railway to Wroxham & Hoveton and change to a more conventional train there, or simply ride the nine-mile cycle path alongside the restored railway lineBike hire In Norwich at social enterprise Bicycle Links or the Bike & Go membership scheme from the stationPotential stopovers Norwich, AylshamTop tips Every August sees the Reepham 19 music festival and the annual agricultural Aylsham ShowNamed after innovative railway engineer William Marriott, this path cleverly combines two late-Victorian railway lines to create a pleasingly eccentric jaunt across the Norfolk countryside. One line belonged to the Eastern and Midland Railway (which became the Midland and Great Northern and was cruelly nicknamed “Muddle and Go Nowhere”) and ran north-west across Norfolk from Norwich. The other was built by the East Norfolk Railway and meandered south-westwards out of Aylsham. Together they offer a bucolic ride from the outskirts of Norwich along the vale of the River Wensum to Whitwell and Reepham station, where there’s a cafe, cycle hire and campsite. It then loops around to strike east through Reepham and arrive at Aylsham and its medieval half-timbered houses. There are railway-inspired sculptures to spot along the trail and the Foxley Wood nature reserve in which to take a breather. Start/finish Aberdeen/BallaterDistance 41 milesGetting there/away The start is easily reached from Aberdeen stationBike hire In Ballater at Cycle Highlands and Bike StationPotential stopovers Aberdeen, Banchory, Aboyne and BallaterTop tip Visit deesideway.org for mapping and information on planning your rideThough the Deeside Way doesn’t always follow a defunct railway line – there’s a 13-mile road-and-forest-track section in the middle – it heads through such magnificent countryside that one can quite forgive it. The former Royal Deeside Railway once ferried monarchs out to Balmoral on the royal train: now it takes cyclists out of the Granite City south-west to Banchory. After a largely sylvan stretch to Aboyne, the trail rejoins the old railway for the journey into the Cairngorms national park, finishing at Ballater. Along the way, there’s a good deal of railway infrastructure still in evidence, including the ghost stations of Pitfodels, Cults and Bieldside. The path crosses a couple of historic drove roads, passes close by medieval Drum Castle and through Kincardine O’Neil, the oldest village on the Dee. Look up and you might see red kites, ospreys and even the odd white-tailed eagle, if you’re lucky. And for an idea of how the line once looked, have a ride on the small heritage Royal Deeside Railway at Milton of Crathes.Start/finish Aberystwyth/TregaronDistance 21 milesGetting there/away There are direct rail services to Aberystwyth from Birmingham New Street (three hours). Tregaron is a bit in the wilds but if you hire your bike from Crys Melin Cycling (see below), after you’ve dropped it off you can catch the 585 bus back to AberystwythBike hire Crys Melyn Cycling has a free pick up/drop off service for the Ystwyth Trail so you can collect your bike or drop it off at Aberystwyth, Trawsgoed, Pontrhydygroes or TregaronPotential stopovers Aberystwyth, Pontrhydfendigaid, TregaronTop tips The 2019 Ceredigion Art Trail brings a host of artists and performers to the county until 5 September, or curate your own art trail around Aberystwyth by visiting ceredigionarttrail.org.ukIn the 1860s, the dream of the owners of the Manchester and Milford Railway was to link the cotton mills of Lancashire with the port of Milford Haven. Their ambitious plans were knocked off course by the mighty Cors Caron peat bog and the Cambrian mountains beyond. In the end, they succeeded merely in connecting Milford with Aberystwyth. The Ystwyth Trail follows the northern end of this sidetracked venture, which eventually closed in 1965. The creators of the cycle path have similarly been derailed at the southern end, where the trail is pushed off the track bed and on to roads from time to time. However, it still makes for a cracking ride: leaving the coastal resort of Aberystwyth, the path follows the banks of the Afon Ystwyth before dropping south along the Teifi to Tregaron. Start/finish Dowlow Farm near Pomeroy/CromfordDistance 17 milesGetting there/away From Buxton railway station pick up NCN Route 68, which takes back roads to the start of the trail. The end is about a mile from Cromford station on the line between Derby and MatlockBike hire There’s a Bike & Go membership scheme hub at Buxton station. The council-run Middleton Top Cycle Hire centre at Middleton by Wirksworth is near the southern end of the trailPotential stopovers Buxton, Wirksworth, Cromford and MatlockTop tips 2019 marks the 25th anniversary of the Wirksworth Festival (6-15 Sept), which will celebrate the work of around 150 artistsIn 1831, the Cromford and High Peak Railway carried its first minerals between the Cromford Canal and the Peak Forest Canal at Whaley Bridge. For such an unusual canal-to-canal line, it did well to survive until Beeching did for it in 1967. The trail it now hosts rises to 386 metres at Ladmanlow, affording great views over the White Peak area of the Peak District national park. Other highlights include the neolithic henge monument of Arbor Low and the picturesque market town of Wirksworth.Start/finish Just west of Durham/Just south of ConsettDistance 12 milesGetting there/away The start can be easily reached from Durham railway station on NCN Route 14. There are no stations close to the end, so the best course is either to buy a house in Consett or cycle back to DurhamBike hire None near the routePotential stopovers Durham, Lanchester and ConsettTop tips There are excellent downloadable leaflets with maps and information on a whole stack of County Durham railway cycle paths at durham.gov.ukIn 1862, the Lanchester Valley Railway began thrumming to the sound of locomotives hauling iron ore to the steelworks at Consett and coal from the mine at Langley Park. The last one chugged along the line around a century later, to be replaced by this scenic cycling route. Starting at Broompark, just outside Durham, the trail soon arrives at Bearpark’s 13th-century Beaurepaire Priory. Lanchester provides not only a bustling market town with cafes and restaurants but also the remains of a Roman fort, Longovicium, which once guarded a major thoroughfare between York and Hadrian’s Wall. The trail commands fantastic views over rural County Durham and the River Browney, and there’s plenty for nature lovers, who can look out for roe deer, great butterfly orchids and, when winter comes, redwings and fieldfares. Near the trail’s end there are also some startling sculptures of mammoth surveying instruments (pictured) to enjoy. Start/finish East Grinstead/GroombridgeDistance 11 milesGetting there/away There are railway stations at both ends of the trailBike hire In East Grinstead at On Your Bike; Deers Leap at Saint Hill Green; in Forest Row via a community app-based scheme; and in Groombridge, Hartfield and Forest Row with CountrybikePotential stopovers East Grinstead, Forest Row, GroombridgeTop tip Time your trip to coincide with the Forest Row Festival , with music, arts and workshops from 18 to 22 SeptemberWhen Richard Beeching axed most of the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells line in the 1960s, one of the villages affected was Forest Row, where the good doctor lived. Thenceforth, he and his fellow villagers would have to travel four miles to East Grinstead to catch a train. The upside is that the Forest Way is not just a cycle path on the former railway line but a designated linear country park. The green corridor runs through the High Weald area of outstanding natural beauty just north of the Ashdown Forest and provides an important habitat for wildlife. Leaving East Grinstead, the trail passes through the attractive villages of Forest Row, Hartfield and Withyham to arrive at the small town of Groombridge. The old line crosses a Roman road and passes close by Pooh Bridge (pictured) near Hartfield, where folk still play Poohsticks.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Offsetting carbon emissions: ‘It has proved a minefield’,More and more people are trying to offset their travel emissions – so why isn’t it straightforward? We explain the options and how to navigate them,John Vidal,2019-08-02T12:30:19+0100,"Here’s the problem: in two months’ time I must travel to Malawi in southern Africa to help Gumbi Education, a small, Guardian-led kids’ education charity that I chair. There’s no Skype option, no railways or boats, and travelling 3,000 miles across Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania by bus is not recommended.I’ve cut my annual holiday flights, I’ve reduced my work travel, and my carbon footprint is nothing to what it was. But realistically, I must fly the 10,200 miles to and from Lilongwe – and I want to offset my emissions in some way. If done correctly, this should mean that I do less harm overall.But what I thought would be easy to arrange has proved a minefield. There is no agreement on how much carbon dioxide a journey may emit, confusion about what actions best reduce emissions, a huge choice of where to direct your money, and growing cynicism as airlines, airports and giant carbon-greedy corporations use offsetting to sell more flights or get permission to grow even further.A decade ago, the voluntary carbon offset market was tiny, unsophisticated and largely unregulated. The little money raised was aimed at worthwhile projects, but few schemes to cut emissions or promote development were verified or certified. Exposés, the financial crash and painfully slow progress in the UN climate talks all helped discourage individuals and companies from offsetting.But as awareness of the climate crisis has grown, corporates in particular have turned to voluntary offsetting and sent the market mainstream. Small companies have been weeded out, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been set up, and thousands of participating companies and charities are now theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers.As the climate emergency grows, so too does the money involved – and the need for accountability.Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent “credits” from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. One tonne of carbon is usually the equivalent of one credit and the market for these credits, worth possibly a few tens of millions of dollars in 2007, is now valued at over $500m a year and growing fast.Even though the International Air Transport Association (IATA) says that just 1% of passengers offset their carbon emissions through voluntary programmes, there has been a 140-fold growth between 2008 and 2018, with 430 million tonnes of emission reductions generated since 2005.This is equivalent to more than all of Australia’s energy-related emissions in 2016, according to Forest Trends, a New York-based conservation finance company that tracks carbon offset projects. The company’s report, Voluntary Carbon Markets Insights, says: “Demand for voluntary carbon offsets has grown … from just 0.3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2008 to 42.8 million tonnes in 2018.”Sarah Leugers, communications director of the Geneva-based nonprofit Gold Standard, which was set up by environment group WWF, says that – paradoxically – Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement transformed the market, with companies and individuals all now wanting to do the right thing in contrast.As the market matures, so the choice of ways to offset emissions increases. You can now offset rail, road and air journeys, your stay in a holiday hotel, your daily commute, your home heating – indeed you could offset the emissions of your whole life.You could have a forest of banana trees or avocados planted in Kenya, reduce the amount of methane emitted from an Indonesian waste dump, provide fresh water to Malawians, rewild Romania or reforest areas of the Amazon basin home to communities of indigenous peoples.Today, the big offset certifiers such as American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Plan Vivo and Verra offer many hundreds of projects. To make it even more complex, the carbon price of these projects depends on where they are and the benefits they offer. Standards of verification also vary but in general are considered to be much tighter in Europe than the US.Most voluntary offsetting organisations operate as nonprofits, but few of them will spell out the fact that they might take up to 20% of what users contribute as running costs.The problem is knowing what is best. Tree planting is theoretically highly effective but some offset schemes have attracted criticism for displacing people or creating monocultures; wind and solar power projects are usually widely welcomed on a community level; capturing methane gas from waste tips and landfill sites makes total sense but is hardly attractive; and energy efficiency works best with the profligate rich. All schemes have pluses and minuses.“Offsetting must go hand in hand with an ambitious internal reduction strategy,” says Leugers. “The first priority should always be to reduce your own footprint before offsetting, but the reality is that not every individual or business can do that quickly.“Business is putting in more money, but the number of people acting individually is growing significantly. We have 1,500 projects in the pipeline. We don’t choose them; NGOs come to us. They are all independently verified. The best advice I can give is to always look for the underlying standards.”Robert Stevens of Climate Care agrees: “Until we reach a zero-carbon world … paying to reduce an equivalent amount of carbon emissions through voluntary offsetting is the most cost-effective, quickest and efficient way of doing this.” But even trying to establish how much you emit on a journey is hard. Some offsetters take into account the extra impact of flying at an altitude above 35,000 feet; others look at the age of the aircraft type you are likely to fly in, whether you travel business class, any stop-off points and how full the plane is likely to be. As the market grows, it throws up anomalies and prompts accusations that it legitimises the growth of emissions. Twenty-nine of the most fuel-profligate airlines, including Emirates, Delta, BA, Air Canada and Gulf, now offer to offset their customers’ flights, and 15 airlines now voluntarily offset their own emissions in some capacity.According to Airport Carbon Accreditation, 43 European airports (representing 26% of European air traffic) are now certified Level 3+ neutrality, with a further 232 around the world part of the same accreditation scheme, meaning they have at least begun their journey towards reducing emissions.This allows Heathrow – which hopes that with a third runway it will be able to take an extra 265,000 flights a year – to say that it plans to use offsets to make it “carbon neutral” by 2030 and to be “zero-carbon” by 2050, even though it will build one of the world’s largest car parks and directly increase global emissions by millions of tonnes of CO2.This is wholly disingenuous, says Green MP Caroline Lucas, who describes Heathrow as “taking economy with the truth to new levels”.But there’s no doubt that companies, individuals, nonprofit groups, even cities are now using offsets to go “carbon-neutral” or even “zero carbon”. Liverpool is working with Malta-based blockchain nonprofit Poseidon to offset emissions with projects in Africa; and brands such as Disney, Microsoft, Lyft, Apple, Aviva and Sony have pledged to use offsets to become climate neutral.The bottom line is that to offset emissions, it is now possible to pay almost what you want to whom you want (though it is surprisingly difficult to calculate cruise ship emissions). The key to gauging the large-scale projects favoured by companies is to ascertain that they are real, measurable, independently verified and permanent, and would not have taken place without the finance provided by the sale of credits.Ideally, say observers, travellers should check to see whether they offer verified emission reduction (VER) credits, as offered by Gold Standard.The other approach is to use DIY offsets. This involves working out your emissions using an online calculator (see calculator tool above), then finding a project that roughly compensates (for example Gold Standard). Or you could just donate to an organisation working to suck up carbon or generate renewable energy. Many admirable environmental projects run by small energy and conservation groups do excellent work on tree planting and clean energy without always offering credits – just contributing would effectively help offset emissions. Forests Without Frontiers in Romania, Tree Aid and the Woodland Trust are personal favourites.Offsetting can work, and it allows people who have to travel to do so with a clearer conscience. But the best strategy must be to reduce your own emissions first.For his 10,200-mile round London to Lilongwe round-trip via Nairobi, John asked eight offsetting companies to calculate his CO2 emissions, how much they would cost to offset, and where the money goes. The results proved highly variable.Climate CareCO2 emissions 2.35 tonnesCost £17.61Projects Safe drinking water in Malawi, fuel efficiency in Ghana, landfill energy in Thailand, rainforests in BrazilAtmosfairCO2 emissions 5 tonnesCost £106Projects Energy efficiency in South Africa, biogas in Nepal, wind and hydro powerCarbonfund.orgCO2 emissions 2.24 tonnesCost $47Projects Water treatment in Kenya, hydroelectric in IndiaClevelCO2 emissions 2.6 tonnesCost £38.74Projects Restoring grasslands in Mongolia, reducing deforestation in TanzaniaFlygreenCO2 emissions 2.4 tonnesCost £20.79Projects Solar panels in IndiaMyclimateCO2 emissions 3.1 tonnesCost £72Projects Energy efficiency in Africa, reforestation in NicaraguaCarbonfootprint.comCO2 emissions 2.74 tonnesCost Between £7 and £30 a tonneProjects Borehole rehabilitation in Uganda, hydroelectric in ChileGold StandardAsks you to calculate your own emissions and choose a projectProjects Water purifiers in Cambodia, fuel-efficient stoves in Sudan"
Carbon calculator: find out how much CO2 your flight will emit,"The Guardian’s carbon calculator works out the emissions on flights from the world’s 100 busiest airports, as well as from selected UK airports",The Guardian,2019-07-31T12:09:34+0100,"The aviation sector is one of the fastest-growing polluters. It currently accounts for about 2% of global emissions but that figure could more than double by 2050 according to research by Manchester Metropolitan University – or triple if planes don’t become substantially more fuel efficient. New airports continue to open and new routes are being added to airline schedules. According to forecasts, 2019 will be another record-breaking year for air travel, with passengers expected to fly a total of 8.1tn km, up 5% from last year.What can you do as an individual? Avoid flying and opt for alternative modes wherever possible. If you do fly, you can work out the CO2 emissions generated by your flight using this calculator, created by German nonprofit Atmosfair.Read this article by John Vidal to find out about the growing number of carbon-offsetting schemes and how they work. Make your flight count – travel with an ethical holiday company and look for holidays that make a positive difference to the destination you’re visiting."
Go loco: top 10 autumn city breaks in Europe by train,"With the crowds gone but the cultural scene buzzing, autumn is perfect for a European break. And our pick of destinations in five countries are reachable by train in less time than you might imagine",,2019-10-19T07:00:38+0100,"Fastest journey from London 6½ hours via ParisCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £168 returnWith its remarkably well-preserved Roman amphitheatre plus its new museum of artefacts, not to mention great shops and restaurants, Nîmes makes a superb autumn destination. The crowds have gone and although the intense heat has rescinded, the surrounding hills trap the summer temperatures, making it warm enough to sit out on a cafe terrace and watch the world go by.Make your first port of call the amphitheatre - Les Arènes (entrance €13, including the other two Roman attractions mentioned below). Explore the interior corridors (vomitories), then climb to the top of the terraces to see the amphitheatre (133 metres long by 101 wide) in its full glory. The top tier also offers views of the surrounding hills (seven, just like Rome), including Mont Cavalier, the highest point of the city, on which the Roman Tour Magne, built by Augustus, stands sentinel.Opposite the amphitheatre, explore the Musée de la Romanité, which opened in 2018 and holds a fascinating collection of artefacts, from large and exquisite mosaics to statues and glassware that survived 2,000 years buried in sarcophagi. There are interactive exhibits, too, which help bring the history to life. The museum’s own architecture is also impressive – from its glass mosaic-tiled facade that represents the ripples of a toga, to the different levels within the museum that allow you to view the exhibits from above.Next stop should be Nîmes’ old town: the warren of streets that runs north of the amphitheatre is punctuated with sunny squares, cafes and restaurants, along with independent boutiques for clothes, jewellery and homewares. Stop for lunch at Le Vintage, where you can devour bistro classics on its pavement terrace. Skip dessert though, because the best ice-cream and patisserie in town is a few steps away at Maison Villaret, which was established in 1775. Try its speciality, croquants – delicate almond biscuits flavoured with orange water. Nîmes is also famous for another kind of biscuit, caladons, with almonds and honey.The old town opens out into a grand square where La Maison Carré, the only surviving intact Roman temple in France, stands proud on a plinth with bright white pillars. Inside, there’s a screening of the film Nemausus, the Founding of Nîmes.Nearby, the Jardins de la Fontaine are the town’s breathing space: these ornate baroque gardens feature terraces, statues and ornamental ponds, as well as the remains of the town’s original water source, housed in the remains of the Temple de Diane. Up the hill behind it is the Tour Magne.For dinner, L’Imprévu serves seafood and Italian-inspired dishes and has a terrace on one of the city’s liveliest squares, Place d’Assas.Example journey Take the 09.24 from St Pancras, crossing Paris to Gare de Lyon for the 14.07 to Nimes, arriving at 17.05. Returning, the 07.58 gets to Paris Gare de Lyon at 10.53, then across Paris to Gare du Nord for the 12.13 to London, arriving at 13.30.Stay at cosy, beautifully decorated La Maison Rousseau B&B (doubles from €105pn). It’s in a peaceful spot and an easy walk to the main sites. Carolyn BoydFastest journey from London 5 hours via LilleCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £95 returnThough it isn’t as well-known as other cities of the Loire, Angers makes the most of its unique position on the River Maine, just before it joins the Loire, with riverside restaurants and enchanting cycle trails, as well as art deco architecture, distilleries and an imposing chateau at the heart of the city.Château d’Angers is a good place to start. This mighty fortress is surrounded by 17 towers which punctuate its mighty 2½-metre thick walls. For superb views of the city and river, walk around its ramparts, which enclose a tiny vineyard and gardens. Inside, the rooms and exhibits tell the story of the Dukes of Anjou who held court here in the 14th and 15th centuries and were great patrons of the arts. The main draw, however, is the 104-metre Tapestry of the Apocalypse illustrating the Book of Revelations. It took seven years to complete in the late 14th century and its six-metre-high panels, which depict 90 scenes, are beautifully lit in an atmospheric gallery. The chateau’s own restaurant serves good hearty dishes with mains from around €10.Outside the chateau, follow the blue line painted on the pavements to guide you around a loop of the best sights in the old town. Highlights include the beautiful medieval Cathédral Saint-Maurice with its wonderful stained-glass windows. Just behind it is the six-storey, half-timbered Maison d’Adam, built in 1491 and home to decorative carvings of bawdy figures. A chain department store wouldn’t usually star in a city’s list of must-sees, but the elegant facade and art deco glass roof of Galeries Lafayette will delight fans of fine design. For more art deco, keep following the blue line to La Maison Bleue, an apartment building built in 1929 and decorated with colourful mosaics and ornate ironwork.Autumn is the ideal time to pedal along the Loire à Vélo cycling track, which follows the famous river. Hire bikes at Vert Event Angers (from €15 a day) and cycle 8km down to the attractive village of Bouchemaine, where Le Noé is one of the region’s many guinguettes – riverside cafe-bistros that offer a host of entertainment, music and activities.Three kilometres to the east, just outside peaceful Sainte-Gemmes-sur-Loire village, is another hub of activity at Guinguette de Port-Thibaut, with superb views over the broad river. Further down the Loire, a 30-minute cycle away, is the Île Béhuard – an island with monastery and historic chapel at the heart of the characterful village.Angers is the home of Cointreau: the orange liqueur was created here in 1875 and visitors can tour the distillery. On the other side of town, Distillerie Giffard also has a visitor centre, with a range of liqueurs, including the Menthe-Pastille that made its name.Example journey Though most Eurostar journeys go via Paris, it is easier to go via Lille as there is a direct train from there to Angers. It also means you only have to cross the platform to change, rather than crossing Paris from Gard du Nord to Gare Montparnasse, and only one change. Take the 15.04 from London St Pancras, then the 17.52 from Lille. Returning, take the 12.41 to Lille, then the 17.35 back to London. Stay Hotel 21 Foch (doubles from €89 room only) is a small, contemporary hotel in the city centre. CBFastest journey from London 7½ hours via Paris (about an hour longer inbound)Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £120 returnFor fresh sea air, fabulous food and Basque culture, a short break in Biarritz fits the bill even in the cooler months. Though its glorious golden beaches and surf culture may suggest it’s a summer-only destination, there is plenty to draw you there in autumn.Try to time your visit with the Fête de la Saint Martin (8-11 November) to see the town celebrate its Basque heritage through concerts, dance shows, workshops, food events and the Basque racket game, pelota.Foodies will love Restaurant Week also in early November (4-10), when many of the town’s restaurants showcase their best Basque dishes for €20 for lunch or €30 for dinner. Though you can embrace the French Basque country’s piquant cuisine any time of year at Les Halles market – tuck into pintxos (Basque tapas) and sip local wine at the many stalls.For goodies to take home, explore the town’s many chocolateries, such as Pariès or Maison Adam, and Rue Victor Hugo, home to the ultimate cheese shop, 1001 Fromages, and the Maison Arostéguy épicerie, which is rammed to the rafters with fantastic Basque and French products.The other streets that surround the market are great for restaurants, as is Rue Gambetta, leading south from the market. Elsewhere, one of the best tables in town is Le Pimpi Bistrot on Avenue de Verdun, where chef Manu Michel’s dishes showcase the seafood, fish and charcuterie that the Basque country does so well, while nearby locals’ favourite Tantina de Burgos on Place Beau Rivage serves excellent dishes flavoured with the local chilli pepper, piment d’espelette.Autumn sees the mighty Atlantic waves roll ever more fiercely to shore, and if you dare take to the water there are several surf schools (try hastea.com, 90-minute group lessons from €40) to hire you a board, wetsuit and the guidance of an instructor. A more indulgent way to enjoy the sea, though, is with a thalassotherapy session – seawater therapy – which will blast, drench or sprinkle you with seawater in a variety of treatments said to help circulation and skin tone. Try it at the Sofitel (treatments from €45).Or to enjoy the ocean without getting wet, take a coastal walk from the lighthouse along the Grande Plage, through the cluster of fisherman’s cabins at Port des Pêcheurs, and on to Le Rocher de la Vierge – a rock formation topped with a Virgin Mary statue, on the site of a miracle. Then follow the road around to the small Plage de Port Vieux, and finish at the incredible Côte des Basques beach. At this end of town, you can also explore the Cité de l’Océan, an interactive nautical museum, which includes a virtual reality surf experience – the cheat’s way to hit the waves.Example journey It’s quite a distance, but a relatively quick and very easy way to whizz down to the south of France, and the scenery is a treat in itself. Take the 11.31 from London to Paris Gare du Nord, then from Paris Gare Montparnasse the 15.52 gets you to Biarritz in time for dinner at 19.58. Returning, the 09.58 gets to Paris Montparnasse at 14.08, then the 16.13 from Paris Gare du Nord gets into London at 17.39.Stay Hotel de l’Océan (doubles from €69 B&B) is a friendly three-star hotel in the town centre, just above the Port des Pecheurs. CBFastest journey from London 3½ hours via BrusselsCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £78 returnGhent’s cobbled streets, art nouveau townhouses and imposing gothic architecture initially give the feeling of having stepped back in time. But it doesn’t take long to notice the city’s other main appeal: a very modern eco-friendly shopping and food scene. The vegetarian food is varied and high quality – the city became the first in the world to introduce a weekly vegetarian day a decade ago. For a taste of the veggie scene, head for Lokaal, which serves €12 homely vegan bakes and quiches made using in-season produce, or fill your plate up at a wholesome vegan buffet of colourful salads and pulses at cooperatively run Lekker GEC.For something higher-end, Lof offers an elaborate five-course vegetarian dinner (€65) that can be paired with vegan wines, while Michelin-starred Vrijmoed has an award-winning seven-course vegetarian menu (€102) that ranges from Japanese-inspired glazed aubergine with kombu seaweed to more typically Belgian fare such as a pavé of goat’s cheese swirled with honey and nuts. Among Ghent’s other charms are its prettily decorated independent shops. Lots of these sell locally made homeware and decoration, with tea towels, crockery and stationery designed by local artists (a Made in Ghent badge scheme provides helpful signposting). There’s also an emphasis on fairly-made clothing from around the world at shops such as Just Hazel, Visitrice, Mieke and A.puura.a. If you want to shop and relax in a low C02-environment, Broesse is a plant shop which is part tropical jungle, part rattan-furnished cocktail bar, where a young crowd sip creative vermouth-based cocktails surrounded by palm fronds.It wouldn’t be a trip to Belgium without sampling craft brews. The country’s signature Trappist beers are arguably the original green business model: brewed by monks in small batches that prioritise sustainability and quality, they’re available in most bars. For something more modern, go for a tour and tasting of the home brews in the giant taproom at microbrewery Dok, which is reinventing Belgium’s storied beer tradition with new recipes and flavours; or ascend to historical music venue Vooruit’s relaxed roof terrace to catch the last afternoon rays before winter.Ghent is also known for its thriving music scene, which keeps up the city’s rootsy image through bands which play anything from punk to futuristic jazz in dimly lit bars like Trefpunt, Bar Mirwaar and Charlatan. The Vrijdag markt is a good place to start a bar-hopping evening – and thanks to the city’s sizable student population, things are lively most nights of the week. Try nights run by the city’s legendary Democrazy promoters.Getting there The Eurostar runs from London to Brussels eight times a day and a ticket includes a free onward journey to any Belgian station within 24 hours of departure. Trains to Ghent depart from Gare du Midi, where the Eurostar arrives, every 15 minutes and take 29 minutes.Stay Ghent’s Eco Hostel Andromeda (doubles from €68) is a series of simple rooms and colourful shared spaces on a converted barge, and calls itself carbon-neutral. Water is purified on the roof, breakfasts are vegetarian, organic and fair trade, and mattresses are made from natural fibres. For a higher-end but still low-impact option, there’s Studiomie’s chic one-room hotel – the room features furnishings from local designers and Egyptian cotton sheets, all inside a shipping container (double from €130 room-only).Rachel HallFastest journey from London 3¾ hours via BrusselsCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £78 returnAntwerp’s most obvious appeal is its winding, cobbled streets culminating in the spectacular gothic cathedrals of the Grote Markt. But Belgium’s second city is its uncontested capital of cool. It has a longstanding reputation as an international fashion hub, buoyed by the fame of the Antwerp Six, a group of designers who graduated from the city’s art school in the early 1980s, but it’s also a port city, where bars, clubs, art galleries and restaurants vie for space in converted warehouses.Those looking for Antwerp’s hipper side should head to the formerly seedy docks area in the north. MAS, a skyline-dominating red brick and glass block, is a museum that explores the city’s maritime heritage where you can ascend to the roof for spectacular city views free of charge. Nearby is aBc, a brewery and taproom, which produces beers exploring Antwerp’s brewing history, from the Seefbier, based on a 16th-century recipe, to Bootje’s Bier, spiked with ginger and coriander. Move on to grungy Het Bos, a former anarchist squat turned cultural centre that hosts an eclectic mix of gigs, film showings, workshops and pop-up dinners.The city’s post-industrial appeal extends to the south. One of the highlights is Pakt, a sustainably run warren of progressive businesses in a disused factory. The heat from the pizza oven warms the offices on the top floor, and laid-back restaurant Racine sources vegetables for its seasonal salads and cold-pressed juices from its rooftop garden.For more traditional flavours, the legendary Frituur No 1 does Antwerp’s most famous chips and mayo, presided over by owner Maria’s unique, occasionally brusque style of service.The city is a shopper’s paradise and winter collections will be arriving in store now. The most obvious stop off is its fashion strip, Nationalestraat. Antwerpians particularly love “concept stores” that mix fashion, lifestyle, food and art, such as Stay, which champions “slow shopping” by serving cappuccinos and style advice to encourage people to take their time and choose beautifully made pieces they’ll keep forever. Visitors on this street should also rifle through pre-loved pieces at Melting Pot Kilo, which sells vintage threads by weight.A five-minute walk away, towards the sea, is Kloosterstraat, an iconic strip of antique shops, art galleries, vintage boutiques and designer outposts – try Five Fridays for Scandi style or Made By Hand, which showcases handcrafted jewellery and beautiful knits by local designers.Getting there See Ghent, above, for Eurostar details. Trains to Antwerp depart from Gare du Midi, where the Eurostar arrives, every 15 minutes and take from 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the train.Stay The stylish Hotel Indigo (doubles from €115 room-only) is part of a small international chain with decor in contrasting shades of pink and blue, with velvet and brass accents. Hotel Julien (doubles from €140 room-only), echoes Antwerp’s signature mix of the historical and contemporary with beautifully renovated rooms in a 16th-century building.RHFastest journey from London 3¼ hours direct (4 hours inbound)Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £86 returnThe Netherlands’ second-largest city has world-class museums and galleries, excellent seafood and a feisty spirit – which makes it perfect for those who want to see the “real” modern Netherlands, away from the tourist hordes of Amsterdam. Autumn is the perfect time for a short break.Rotterdam’s biggest attraction is probably its architecture. Bombed heavily during the second world war, the city today boasts several daring modern tower blocks which would not look out of place in Manhattan. Begin your day with a walk along the riverbank to take in the skyline, perhaps followed by a visit to the famous Cube Houses, an apartment building which looks like a string of discarded yellow Rubik’s Cubes.Nearby stands the Markthal, a striking indoor food market housed in a building that looks like an upturned horseshoe. Browse the stalls and enjoy a basket of kibbeling fish nuggets, some local cheese or perhaps a glass of jenever (gin) brewed in nearby Schiedam.Rotterdam grew prosperous thanks to its location near the mouth of the River Rhine, and the city’s giant port – the largest in Europe – has given it a tough, streetwise character.However, it also has a lively cultural scene. Highlights include the Fotomuseum photography museum and the Kunsthal art museum, which this autumn displays photographs by Daniël van de Ven telling the story of Rotterdam’s astonishing postwar rise. If you feel like roaming further afield, take a tram or metro to Delfshaven, where old sailing barges line the canals and you feel you might bump into Rembrandt or Vermeer around every corner.In the evening, watch the sun set as you walk over the famous Erasmusbrug (Erasmus Bridge) which connects the north and south sides of the city (once neglected, the south is now being gentrified). Have dinner at Hotel New York, a grand brownstone building perched imperiously on the riverside. Soak up the panoramic views and dine on local mussels cooked in Pernod or fresh chilled crab legs. Afterwards, walk over the nearby footbridge to Fenix Food Factory, a hipster food market and craft brewery where the glasses are always half full. If the dark local beer goes to your head, you can always order a water taxi to zip you back across the river to bed.Example journey The Eurostar goes direct from London St Pancras to Rotterdam Central seven times a day (five times on Saturdays): depart at 07:16 and arrive at 11:32. Returning, border restrictions mean you will have to change trains in Brussels: depart Rotterdam at 16.58 and arrive Brussels Midi at 18.08. You will then have time for a quick coffee before boarding the 18.56 Eurostar to London, which arrives at 19.57.Stay Hotel Bazar (doubles from €70 B&B) is quirky, colourful and surrounded by lively bars and restaurants. Ben Coates, Netherlands-based author of The Rhine: Following Europe’s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps Fastest journey from London 5¼ hours via Amsterdam or BrusselsCheapest Nov fare with Loco2 £140 returnAs first impressions go, Arnhem railway station makes a grand statement. A soaring modernist structure made of undulating glass, exposed concrete and steel, it took two decades to build, at a cost of €37.5m. It ushers travellers into a city that has had its fair share of makeovers – most notably after the second world war battle in 1944, depicted in the film A Bridge Too Far, which left only 212 houses undamaged.Right outside the station is the 1oo-metre-long art wall called The Reconstruction. Painted by local artists and residents, it displays figures and events that played an important role in rebuilding the city. One of the icons is Marga Klompé, who in 1956 became the Netherlands’ first female cabinet minister, and whose work led to the social welfare law.The story of Operation Market Garden, the biggest airborne landing operation of the second world war, is told at the Airborne at the Bridge museum, the British headquarters during the battle. It’s next to the John Frost Bridge over the Lower Rhine – the one that British, Canadian, Polish and American forces tried and failed to capture.Today, Arnhem is a city of fashion and design. Its art academy was home to internationally acclaimed fashion designers such as Viktor & Rolf and Pauline van Dongen, and industrial designer Marcel Wanders. For unique items made by a local designer, visit the fashion district in the Klarendal neighbourhood, with its many studios and boutiques – try sustainable fashion label Studio Elsien Gringhuis, or Atelier Judith van den Berg for beautiful, handmade leather bags.Afterwards, go for a bite atop Karendal’s hill at cafe/restaurant Sugar Hill, popular among Arnhemmers for its no-nonsense food (quality burgers, sandwiches, and three-course meals) and calm atmosphere. A 10-minute walk away is Café Restaurant Caspar, with a wide variety of craft beers, like Mooie Nel (Pretty Nel) or Dunkel CC, and impressively large cups of coffee.While tourists have taken over the streets of Amsterdam, chances are you’ll have those in Arnhem to yourself. Despite its lively cultural scene – 18 museums and many concert options – the city is less of a tourist attraction, and has a much more laidback vibe. And it’s much greener (or red and orange, this time of year).For the perfect autumn stroll, and to get your bearings, visit Sonsbeek city park and climb the spiral staircase of the 25-metre 19th-century Belvédère. The tower offers an excellent vantage over the city and its surroundings, but is only open to climb on the last Sunday of each month. Warm up afterwards in Stadsvilla Sonsbeek with a hot chocolate and Arnhemse meisje (sugary biscuit) on the side. Follow your Sonsbeek stroll with one in Hoge Veluwe national park, a sprawling nature reserve that includes one of Europe’s largest sculpture gardens, featuring 160 artists including Barbara Hepworth, Aristide Maillol, Marta Pan and Pierre Huyghe. The park is also the home of the Kröller-Müller Museum, which boasts the second-largest Van Gogh collection in the world, with nearly 90 paintings and over 180 drawings.In the evening, make your way to cosy cafe Stella by Starlight, near Arnhem central station, for live music and beers selected by Arnhem’s beer sommelier, Maarten Exel. Or go to cafe Stan&Co, round the corner, to end the night dancing.Example journey Take the 11.04 from St Pancras, arriving at Amsterdam at 16.11; get the next (half-hourly) direct train to Arnhem central station (1 hour). To return, take the 13.56 from Arnhem central station, transfer at Breda to Brussels-Midi, arriving at 17:17 (1 hour 35 mins) and take the 18.04 to London, arriving at 21.05.Stay Hotel Molendal (doubles from €80 B&B) is in an art nouveau building in Sonsbeek overlooking the park and a stone’s throw from the concert hall Musis Sacrum (home to dance company Introdans) and the city centre.Caroline van Keeken, Netherlands-based writer and journalistFastest journey from London6¼ hours via Brussels and Frankfurt or Cologne (with short transfer times); 7¼ hours inboundCheapest Nov fare with Loco2 £125 returnIn the 19th century, Wiesbaden was revered as the “catwalk of the society spa”, with royalty, aristocracy and dignitaries from across Europe visiting this elegant town to see, be seen and benefit from the medicinal properties of the water. The heart of the spa town is the Kurhaus, which was rebuilt in 1907 in neo-classical style to house a restaurant, casino, ballroom and concert hall.The casino is located in the former wine parlour, a handsome room with cherry wood panelling and crystal chandeliers. The roulette wheel where Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky allegedly lost his fortune in 1865 – and which inspired his short novel, The Gambler – is on display. It’s a pleasant way to while away a few hours, and a few euros, in splendid historic surroundings, while sipping a glass of sparkling Henkell trocken, the locally produced sekt sparkling wine.To experience the healing water, try the Kaiser-Friedrich-Therme, a beautifully restored art nouveau baths with green-tiled interior and Roman frescoes. As the nights draw in and temperatures drop, do as the Germans do and go textile-free into the tranquility of the soothing, warm water.If art nouveau decor piques your interest, the Museum of Wiesbaden’s recently opened permanent exhibition is a must. It’s one of the most important private collections in Europe, donated by local patron and former art dealer FW Neess with over 500 original objects, paintings and pieces of furniture – look out for the Nature sculpture by Alphonse Mucha, and furniture and glass pieces by belle époque designer Louis Majorelle.Art and spas aside, wine is the reason many visitors come to Wiesbaden. Known as the “gateway to the Rheingau”, the most distinguished wine-growing region in the Rhine valley, this is the place to discover refined rieslings or a full-bodied spätburgunder. Among the stalls overflowing with flowers, fruit, cheese and bread, the Wiesbaden Winegrowers stand can be found at the weekly Saturday farmers’ market, where various wineries take turns to present their produce to try for a few euros a glass. For a more formal tasting, Balthasar Ress in the centre of town offers wines at good-value winery prices, along with plates of local cheeses, meats, gherkins and bread.This chic little town is also home to one of the few urban vineyards in Germany, the Neroberg. Take the cute yellow funicular train, the Nerobergbahn up to the hillside estate for panoramic views across the vineyard, town and over the Rhine to Mainz. From here, there are various nature trails through the forest to enjoy and a magnificent, if a little incongruous, Russian Orthodox church, an opulent monument to Princess Elizabeth Michailowna, the Russian wife of Duke Adolph von Nassau, who died here in childbirth. For something more testing, the Kletterwald Neroberg offers 10 gradients of rope-slung courses high in the treetops, a great activity for families with children aged four and over.Head back into town for a shopping spree along upmarket Wilhelmstrasse and get cosy in Webers Wikinger for a traditional fireside schnitzel, roast potatoes and more of that glorious riesling.Example journey Take the 08.55 Eurostar from London St Pancras, arriving in Brussels at 12.05; board the 12.25 to Frankfurt Airport, arriving at 15.16; then depart for Wiesbaden on the 15.50, arriving at 16.10. The return journey leaving Wiesbaden at 07.41 arrives in London at 14.05.Stay The laid-back Hotel Klemm (doubles from €90 B&B) occupies a smart red-brick art nouveau villa and has a stylish decor.Celia ToppingFastest journey from London 4 hours via BrusselsCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £115 returnCologne station is in the shadow of the city’s dramatic gothic cathedral. It’s well worth a trip up the 533 steps, past Fat Pete (the largest free-swinging church bell in the world) and up to the observation platform for panoramic views of the city and beyond. Walking south from the cathedral takes you through the charming cobbled streets of the old town, with its skinny pastel-coloured houses and architectural gems such as the Romanesque Gross St Martin church. Enjoy a traditional halve hahn (gouda cheese with a rye roll, raw onions, pickles and a dollop of mustard) from Peter’s Brauhaus and wash it down with a cold Kölsch, the local beer.Venturing further south along the river will take you to the recently modernised, popular waterfront district of Rheinauhafen. The Kranhäuser (crane towers) dominate the skyline of this former industrial dockland area, and the curious blend of old and new buildings makes for an interesting stroll. On a chilly autumn day, warm up in the boat-like Chocolate Museum, reached by a swing bridge, and enjoy fine Rhine views.The west is traditionally seen as the classy side of the river, whereas the east bank was known as Schäl Sick, the rather undesirable “wrong” side. But things have changed in recent times, with prices pushing residents over the river, and regeneration projects such as the Rheinboulevard making a trip across the Hohenzollern bridge genuinely worthwhile – rather than just for “that photo” of the bridge and cathedral.Turn left and head north from the bridge, stopping for a drink at the Rheinterrassen, and onwards through the Rheinpark, one of the region’s green spaces. From here, catch the Kölner Seilbahn (cable car) back over the river to Cologne’s truly wonderful zoo. This is a zoo for people who don’t like zoos, with happy animals that produce lots of babies, huge enclosures and a delightful programme of special events. But if this really isn’t your thing, the botanical gardens are just next door, perfect for brisk autumn days, with a deliciously warm Palm House and beautiful greenhouses filled with tropical plants.With two such exceptional attractions nearby, the Sculpture Park often goes unnoticed, which is a shame, as this small, free-to-enter park houses a remarkable collection of international contemporary sculpture, and is newly curated every two years. Cologne is also home to several superb museums, including the Roman-Germanic Museum and Museum Ludwig. If you can, plan your visit for Museum Night on 2 November, for over 200 concerts, exhibitions, DJs and other artistic events at locations across the city until 2am.For a more low-key evening’s entertainment, head over to the hip Belgisches Viertel (Belgian Quarter), buy a Kölsch from a kiosk and go people-watching in Brüsseler Platz as night falls. From here it’s a short step to some of the area’s coolest bars, with classics like the super-popular Sixpack, or Salon Schmitz, where the bold and beautiful of the city go out in style.Example journey Take the 8.55 Eurostar from London, arriving in Brussels at 12.05; catch the 12.25 to Cologne arriving at 14.15. The return journey leaving Cologne at 08.55 arrives in London at 14.15.Stay Maison Marsil (doubles around £95 room-only) is in the old town between the Rhine and the Belgian Quarter.CTFastest journey from London 7¼ hours via ParisCheapest Nov fare with Loco2 £175 returnThere’s a back-to-work atmosphere in Lausanne each autumn, after a summer in which most people spend their free time lazing by Lake Geneva or escaping the heat for the cool of the mountains, leaving the city centre in a slumber. Energy returns in September, building to a crescendo when the Christmas market kicks off at the end of November, sparking a month of vin chaud-fuelled revelry all over town.In between times, autumn has its own special appeal. For starters, it’s the best season for walking. Head to the terraced vineyards of Lavaux, just outside the city, where the turning leaves are at their most glorious and activity peaks with the annual grape harvest. Taste wine in the various caves as you stroll through the vines between the pretty medieval villages of Lutry and Saint-Saphorin, high above the lake.Alternatively, Sauvabelin park, on a hill in the north of Lausanne, is a lovely spot to wander among kaleidoscopic trees – climb the wooden viewing tower to see the city and lake spread far below. On your way back downhill towards the town centre, stop at the wonderful Fondation Hermitage to see the permanent collection of impressionist and post-impressionist painters.A new museum district opens in the city this autumn: Plateforme 10, so-called because of its location near the nine platforms of the main rail station, will house three museums by 2021. The fine art museum, Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts, is the first to move in this October, followed by the Musée de l’Elysée (photography) and Mudac (contemporary design and applied arts).As it is home to the International Olympic Committee headquarters, Lausanne is also dubbed Switzerland’s Olympic city, and it hosts the Winter Youth Olympic Games next January. The flashy Olympic Museum, in the lakeside resort of Ouchy, south of the city centre, features a temporary multimedia exhibition, with 50 athletes sharing tales of their personal Olympic experiences. While it’s always fondue time here (Café du Grütli does a good one), autumn in Switzerland means la chasse (hunting season), so game meats are on the menu at many restaurants in October and November, typically accompanied by spätzle (a sort of Swiss pasta), chestnuts, red cabbage and fruit. Try wild boar stew at Brasserie de Montbenon, or venison filet mignon with truffles and grapes at La Croix d’Ouchy, where you should turn up ravenous, since you get two servings.For a non-game lunch or brunch, Le Pointu is a good bet for salads and tranches (fancy open sandwiches) if you can get a table – it’s hugely popular; or head to Lausanne institution La Chandeleur for a simple sweet crêpe. For an apéro, Les Boucaniers has a good beer list, or try local wines at crowdfunded bar, Ta Cave.Example journey Take the 11.31 Eurostar from London to Paris Nord, arriving at 14.47; cross to Paris Gare de Lyon by taxi/metro, to take the 15.57 TGV to Lausanne, arriving at 19.37. To return, take the 13.31 from Lausanne, changing again in Paris, and you’ll be back in London by 21.37.Stay The Alpha Palmiers (doubles from €129 room only), a light, bright space with a central tropical garden, near the railway station.Caroline Bishop, Lausanne-based authorLooking for a holiday with a difference?

"Into the past, and the woods, on a car-free break in Cheshire","Chester’s Roman treasures are just part of a trip (by rail, boat and on foot) exploring the area’s industrial heritage and natural beauty",Phoebe Taplin,2019-10-16T06:30:10+0100,"The rain has stopped. Wet beeches and coppery bracken shine in the autumn sunlight. I’m walking through Delamere Forest, Cheshire’s biggest woodland area, past prehistoric bogs with carpets of starry sphagnum, and flooded Blakemere Moss – the wetland cacophonous with rain-loving ducks and greylag geese. Pine cones, acorns and bristly sweet chestnuts pepper the forest paths. There’s a visitor centre nearby and the refurbished Delamere Station House is an atmospheric cafe, where the day’s specials include mushroom stroganoff (£6.50) and butternut couscous (£6).I arrived the previous morning in Chester, a two-hour train ride from London Euston, and spent a day exploring the city. The rebuilt walls, where Roman legionaries once guarded the fortress of Deva, now provide an hour-long, traffic-free stroll, overlooking the racecourse, the Roman amphitheatre (Britain’s largest) and the Rows: medieval shops with half-timbered upper galleries.The Grosvenor Museum (free), with its ornate Roman gravestones and 18th-century oil paintings of Chester, is a great place to shelter from the changeable Cheshire weather. So is the cathedral and, behind it, Chester’s indoor market. I browse through paperbacks in Bookingham Palace and have coffee at Crustum. Then I buy a floury brown cob and crumbly white Cheshire cheese to eat among columns, mosaics and poplars in the Roman gardens, before taking a short cruise up the River Dee. Covered boats leave every half an hour, from the far end of the garden. Even in winter they sail hourly past spread-winged cormorants, Victorian villas and willow-fringed meadows.It’s a 10-minute train ride to Lloyds Meadow, where I’m glamping. Six bell tents, spaced around lakes with wooded islands, opened just a few weeks ago and are now booking for next year. A morning walk through the dew startles rabbits, moorhens and long-necked herons from the grassy banks and bulrushes. After dark, soft solar globes glow in the trees and fish jump in the water outside the tent entrance. The site is on the edge of Ashton Hayes (which has been aiming for some time to be the UK’s first carbon neutral village) and near Mouldsworth railway station with its neighbouring pub, The Goshawk.Delamere station is one more stop by train but I walk the couple of miles to the forest, along field paths fringed by late poppies and delicate wild pansies. I’m sustained by a breakfast of local produce, including prize-winning sausages and Cheshire oak-smoked bacon from a nearby butchers and sweet-sharp juice from Ollie’s Orchard near Delamere (Lloyds Meadows can provide hampers, including cooking gear, £25).Next day, I catch the train from Delamere to Northwich, 15 minutes further east, to explore the area’s industrial heritage. The Anderton Boat Lift, opened in 1875, towers on cast-iron pillars over the Weaver Navigation, lifting boats 50 feet to the Trent and Mersey Canal. The visitor centre is free, but I’ve opted for another boat trip, along the green-banked river to the edge of the half-timbered town, and a ride up in the lift itself, where water cascades above the boat’s glass ceiling (combined trip adult £12.25, child £7.25). The No 4 bus stops nearby but the weather is fine again so I walk from Northwich along the Weaver. It’s two more miles beside the canal to the Lion Salt Works, and roughly the same again from there to Lostock Gralam railway station.Apart from short urban stretches at the start and end, this six-mile waterside loop, punctuated by year-round heritage attractions with cafes, proves an ideal autumn stroll. There’s a cidery smell of windfall apples and woodsmoke from narrowboats, chugging past through seasonal mist. There’s plenty of mellow fruitfulness, too: hedges heavy with dark, jewel-like elderberries, crimson hawthorn and blood red rosehips. The canalside Lion Salt Works (adult £6.25, child £4) reopened for visitors four years ago after a £10m restoration. It manages to combine hi-tech exposition with an evocative sense of past effort. Among rusting brine tanks and brick chimneys, dioramas and projections conjure up sweaty 12-hour shifts working boiling salt pans.My last day, with an early evening train booked, and it’s raining again so I decide to check out Chester Zoo (15 minute bus ride from Chester station, with discounted rail-bus-entry tickets from £24). Without kids to entertain, I plan to whizz round the 125 acres and spend the afternoon in town but half an hour’s gone before I’ve even left the first aviary. I’m watching the orange and turquoise starlings, which I last saw outside a tent in the Maasai Mara 30 years ago.Over the next few hours, I’m transported round the world. I take a leisurely boat trip through the Islands, a series of south-east Asian habitats that opened in 2015, and walk through the warm, leafy tropical house, full of free-flying Madgascan red fodies and emerald doves. New grasslands, opening this autumn, will house Asiatic lions. Besides the low-carbon travel, this is colour therapy for a wintry day: clownfish swim through coral, huge blue morpho butterflies hover among scarlet hibiscus and candy-pink flamingos balance in a grey-green lake. Autumn is still evident in the caramel scent of a katsura tree or a pond of otters playing with yellow birch leaves; it’s a bright finale to four days of woods and water.• Rail travel was provided by Virgin Trains (London Euston to Chester from £19 one-way).

Shingle and Saxons: a car-free trip to the Suffolk coast,"Suffolk’s marshes, beaches and estuaries meld into a dreamy landscape rich in history in our final car-free coast instalment of the summer",Phoebe Taplin,2019-09-21T11:00:37+0100,"A beautiful late summer’s day and I’m swimming in the sea, south of Shingle Street. It feels like elemental coast: a steep bronze bank of pebbles sloping down to a gentle curve of green water. Jellyfish float past under the glinting surface and a white sail drifts on the horizon. Sandwiched between the River Deben and the North Sea is an enchanting, embattled corner of Suffolk.Bleakly beautiful Shingle Street was evacuated during the second world war and rumours of a failed German invasion persist years after declassified files have shown them to be myths. A row of houses faces the sea across the stones, where there are patches of sea kale and pink-flowered sea peas and a long line of bleached shells, first put there by letter-carver Lida Kindersley and a friend.I spend the morning exploring Sutton Hoo, a mile down the road from Melton railway station. I’ve caught the train to this stretch of coast several times since moving to Essex nine years ago, but a landlocked suburb-dweller’s thrill at racing past shining estuaries has still not worn off. The National Trust has almost finished a £4m upgrade at Sutton Hoo (£13.50 adult/£6.75 child). A gleaming new exhibition and glass-walled visitor centre complement the site’s shady paths and valleys. Overlooking the harebell-carpeted mounds of the royal burial ground itself, where a treasure-filled 27-metre-long ship was unearthed in the 1930s, an observation tower is under construction and should be open soon.Exploring the area, I cross banks of purple heather and reedbeds alive with dragonflies. There are views across the River Deben to Woodbridge and its white weather-boarded Tide Mill.Bawdsey Hall, where I’m staying, is eight miles away and I’ve pre-booked demand-responsive public transport, at a fraction of the cost of a taxi (£3.70 from Sutton Hoo, Connecting Communities, 01728 635938). I’ve used this minibus before to access the Deben peninsula’s walking and great pubs – the riverside Ramsholt Arms and the pink, thatched Sorrel Horse at Shottisham.I wander past Bawdsey’s flint-towered church, where sunlight slants among the graves, and walk along the coast to Shingle Street for a swim and seaside picnic. The sun is setting behind the Martello towers as I head back. These defensive forts are just part of the area’s epoch-spanning military history. Second world war anti-tank obstacles stretch across marshy lagoons with plovers and swallows, which are starting to return south, darting overhead. The area’s history and wildlife attract specialists and acronyms; it’s a heritage coast, an AONB, an SSSI and a lepidopterist’s paradise with hundreds of moth species. Back at Bawdsey Hall, I fall asleep to the calls of owls and wake to find the trees round the misty lawn full of chirruping goldfinches and cooing doves.On a slightly inland stretch of the Suffolk Coast Path, Bawdsey Hall attracts hikers and cyclists; two fellow guests at breakfast have walked 20 miles from Ipswich via the Shotley peninsula and two ferries. Inspired, I ramble a mile or so southwards, sampling blackberries and yellow bullaces from the roadside hedges. On the way, I pass the Radar Museum at Bawdsey Manor, where Robert Watson Watt pioneered the use of radio signals to locate U-boats and aeroplanes (£7/£1). To cross the River Deben to the fish stalls and smokehouses of Felixstowe Ferry, I wave a white paddle left on a jetty and pay £3 to the ferryman (daily in September, weekends in October, call 01394 282173).The weather is warm again, as I walk past more Martello towers, and I stop for another swim below a cheerful line of beach huts. Soon after Felixstowe’s Victorian seafront gardens, revamped a few years back, I wander five minutes off the coast path to check out the town’s first plant-based cafe, opened a few months ago. The Greenhouse is relaxed and thriving and today’s special (a vegan version of a Reuben sandwich, featuring roasted celeriac, sauerkraut and dill mustard, £6) is seriously tasty.Outside, I catch the No 77 bus (£1.60) the last two miles from the cafe to Landguard Fort (£5.50/£2.50 including audio tour, English Heritage members free) at the southern tip of the town. Wandering the maze of cool, dark tunnels, learning about the Dutch invasion of 1667 and how soldiers stored gunpowder, is a surprisingly good way to spend a warm afternoon.From one bastion of the citadel, there are views across to Harwich, where I’m headed. The shingle bank below, in the shadow of Britain’s biggest container port, could hardly be more of a contrast with quiet, sandy Bawdsey Quay where I started this morning. My second ferry of the day (£4.50, harwichharbourferry.com) cruises hourly from this beach across to the old pier at Harwich, where I have 40 minutes to admire the lanes and lighthouses before boarding the train.Several plaques in Harwich relate to the Mayflower, which was probably built here and whose master, Christopher Jones, lived on Kings Head Street. The famous ship’s 400th anniversary, celebrating the voyage that started in the late summer of 1620, kicks off in November this year (mayflower400uk.org).The railway from Harwich Town, branded the Mayflower Line, runs beside miles of marshland, glowing orange in the evening sun. Through trackside oaks and tall sweet chestnuts, I see Grayson Perry’s green and gold-walled House for Essex near Wrabness and, beyond it, the wide Stour with swans, gulls and sailing boats, like a last glimpse of the sea.• Accommodation was provided by Bawdsey Hall (doubles £95 B&B, bawdseyhall.com). Rail travel was provided by Greater Anglia. Trains run from London Liverpool Street to Melton via Ipswich (from £13 each way) and Harwich (from £11.50) or Felixstowe (£13)Looking for a holiday with a difference?

10 classic UK trips by public transport,"Trains in hidden valleys, scenic bus routes, fun ferry rides … many journeys are better by public transport.  Kevin Rushby plots exciting itineraries for the carefree and car-free",Kevin Rushby,2019-05-18T07:00:27+0100,"With a car, most of these amazing journeys are impossible or prohibitively expensive. Most of these 10 routes could be done in a day or with a single overnight, but ideally you will spread them over a weekend, using the opportunity to hike over a mountain, laze by a lake or build a sandcastle. All routes only use public transport or scheduled services on heritage railways.Times given are for Saturdays and Sundays through the summer unless stated. Ticket prices (correct as of 14 May, 2019) are regular adult singles except where statedStart/end Shrewsbury stationMinimum One dayPotential stopovers Shrewsbury, Machynlleth, Aberdovey, Barmouth and BalaWeekend Friday night in Shrewsbury, Saturday Aberdovey or Barmouth for sandy beachesCost £25.70 (without rail extras)This fabulous odyssey through deepest Wales offers lots of jumping-off possibilities and alternatives. From Shrewsbury, get on the correct part of the train for Barmouth (it divides at Dovey Junction).The line gets more and more scenic. Machynlleth would make a nice stop, with its cafes and Centre for Alternative Technology. From there the line follows the wonderful Dyfi estuary, passing through Aberdovey (possible overnight, with a great beach), then turns north up the coast.Railway lovers will want to stop at Tywyn for an excursion on the oldest heritage railway in the world, the Talyllyn, which takes 2½ hours and offers great views of Cadair Idris with its tarns.There is a second lovely alternative just before the Mawddach estuary: get off at Fairbourne and then walk – or take another steam train, the Fairbourne Railway – to the tiny ferry across to Barmouth. You are in good company: Shelley, Wordsworth, Darwin and Gladstone all travelled this way.The nearby railway bridge also has a footway. Once in Barmouth (a good overnight) catch the T3 bus via Dolgellau, another great stopping point, to Bala, where there’s another little railway experience: the Bala Lake Railway to Bala, where you can rejoin the T3 to Ruabon.This route is steeped in Owain Glyndwr history: Corwen, for example, is where he raised his banner of rebellion in 1400. The church is well worth a scout round.At Ruabon, you could take a train back to Shrewsbury, but there is one last wonderful diversion, the Pontcysyllte aqueduct, where the Llangollen canal crosses the River Dee – a remarkable Georgian engineering feat. Jones the Boats does trips across by canal boat (five a day, £4 one way), but you can just walk across on the towpath.Top tips In Aberdovey, buy a crab line on the seafront and take the kids to fish off the pier, or walk to the beach beyond the golf course. Get off the T3 bus two miles before Ruabon at Trevor and walk the Pontcysyllte aqueduct, then walk on south to rejoin the route at Chirk railway station. Do it in a day Take the 07:27 train from Shrewsbury to Barmouth (change at Machynlleth, arr 09:59, £11.50).Alternatives 1 Disembark at Tywyn for Talyllyn Railway at 09:20 and catch 10:30 train, returning at 12:57 (£17.70) for the 13:25 to Barmouth, arr 13:55. Take 14:29 T3 bus onward. 2 Disembark at 09:47 at Fairbourne for the 10:40 Fairbourne Railway train, then the Barmouth ferry across the Dyfi estaury to Barmouth, arr about 11:30 and take the 12:50 bus T3 (£6 train, £2 ferry), 10: 50 bus T3 from Jubilee Road in Barmouth to Ruabon railway station (arr 13:10, £6.70). 3 Disembark at Llanuwchllyn (arr 11:45). Take the Bala Lake Railway 12:45 steam train to Bala (arr 13:10, £7.50), the 13:55 T3 bus to Ruabon station then Shrewsbury. 4 Disembark at Corwen and visit the atmospheric 13th-century church of St Mael and St Sulien (free, allow an hour). 5 Disembark at Trevor for the Pontcysyllte aqueduct. Cross the aqueduct and walk to Chirk station to connect for Shrewsbury (free for walking, allow 3 hours). The 22:58 is the last train to Shrewsbury (£8:60). You could not do all the alternatives in one day, but in a weekend it would be possible.Start Belfast Minimum Two nights if over a weekendPotential stopovers Ballycastle or Rathlin IslandCost £45 (iLinkcard for two days at £16.50 per day plus £12 Rathlin ferry)This classic route encompasses some of Northern Ireland’s greatest landscapes. Start out early from Belfast with a bus to Derry then change to rail for the superlative coastal journey to Coleraine, described by no lesser connoisseur of the iron roads than Michael Portillo as “one of the most beautiful rail journeys in the world…breathtaking.”The line sweeps past some great beaches and cliffs – hop off at Castlerock to walk miles of sand at Benone beach. At Coleraine change for the Portrush service, then buses carry you east through Bushmills, “the world’s oldest whiskey distillery” (tours £9) and the Giant’s Causeway, where there are various walks. A few miles further, a good stop is at Ballintoy, where there’s a great coastal walk to the spectacular Carrick-a-Rede rope suspension bridge. It was first put up by salmon fishermen in 1775 to connect a small offshore islet. Game of Thrones used many locations around here: Ballintoy Harbour, for example, was Pyke, one of the Iron Islands.Continue along the coast to reach Ballycastle, a good overnight stop with restaurants and pubs, plus the possibility of a ferry ride out to Rathlin Island, one of Europe’s top birdwatching destinations. You could also stay out here on the island, returning the next morning to Ballycastle. If you are then trying to get back to Belfast on a Sunday, the only option is to retrace your steps to Coleraine. Any other day, however, keep going along the coast via the pretty village of Glenarm to Larne. There a train takes you back into Belfast.Top tips Sunday services are thin on the ground, so use that day for visiting Rathlin Island. Buy an iLink card for each travelling day at Europa bus centre in Belfast or online.Do it over a long weekend At 06:45 take the 212 bus from Belfast to Derry (arr 08:35, £13), then catch the free bus to station for the 09:38 train to Coleraine (arr 10:16, £10). Change here for the 10:45 train to Portrush (arr 10:57, £2.60), then get on the 172 or 402 bus to Ballycastle at 11:20 (arr 12:29). Stay in Ballycastle. On Sunday, either return via Coleraine or spend a day here before proceeding at 10:55 Monday on the 162 bus along the coast via Glenarm to Larne. At Glenarm, it’s worth getting off the bus to explore this pretty village. Get back on the 162 to Larne at 14:56. It arrives at 15:21, connecting with 15:55 train from Larne Harbour back to Belfast (arr Great Victoria Street station 17:05). Alternatives From May to September, the hop-off, hop-off 252 Causeway Rambler (day rover ticket £8) is a good way to see the Giant’s Causeway coast, including Carrick-a-Rede (adult £9, child £4.50), before reaching Ballycastle. Take the 13:00 ferry to Rathlin Island (25 mins, £12 return), returning at 17:30 (in July and August there’s a later one at 19:30).Start/end York stationMinimum One dayPotential stopovers York, Pickering, Grosmont and Whitby all make good overnight stopsWeekend Friday night in York. Saturday in WhitbyCost £30 or £47.80 with North York Moors steam railwayThere’s a great mix of public transport on this classic circuit that starts with the Coastliner bus outside York station. At Pickering you have a choice: the North York Moors Railway is a must if you have any Dad’s Army, Heartbeat or Harry Potter fans aboard, but otherwise stay on the Coastliner bus, especially if you want more time in Whitby. The route heads through the Hole of Horcum, gouged out by the Saxon giant Wade, according to legend. Watch out for curlews, merlins and lapwings. From the train, you might get a stop in Grosmont, a lovely village with a ruined castle – there are pubs and B&Bs for overnight stays, and good walks. This is the junction for national rail services, so you could actually skip Whitby and head east, but why would you?In Whitby, walk up the magnificent harbour wall and pier, then cross the swing bridge and tackle the steps up to the abbey. Here, Count Dracula, transformed into a hellhound, was spotted racing away from the wreck of a Russian freighter by Bram Stoker. He visualised that scene in his epic tale of horror while sitting on a park bench on West Cliff (it’s still there). Leave Whitby on the Middlesbrough train, which goes back through Grosmont, then continues into superb moorland scenery with lots of remote villages.At Middlesbrough, a diversion for the most unusual item of public transport in Britain, the Transporter Bridge, a 10-minute walk away, is highly recommended. Then hop on a train back to York.Top tips Go in mid-July to August, when large expanses of moorland heather turn purple. Check out Whitby’s steampunk and goth festivals. Great views from Pickering all the way to Middlesbrough, where you should consider a side trip to see the incredible Transporter Bridge (a half-mile walk). Do it in a day Take the 08:32 Coastliner 840 bus from outside York station to Whitby (arr 10:40, £12).Alternative Get off the bus at Pickering (arr 09:38). Catch the 11:00 North Yorkshire Moors Railway to Grosmont, arr 12:05 (this is a steam service but you can leave at 10:00 if you don’t mind a diesel-hauled train). An hour to stroll around this lovely village, or stop for a night then continue by rail to Whitby on the 13:05 (arr 13:45, £19.80). At 16:00 take an Esk Valley train to Middlesbrough, arr 17:32, then, at 17:57 take the train back to York (arr 18:50, £18 for Whitby-York).Start Glasgow Minimum Two nightsPotential stopovers Port Ellen, Bowmore, mountain bothiesCost £57.60It would be a shame to use public transport and not benefit from a major freedom that brings, so here’s the ultimate distillery tour by bus and boat. The day starts early at Glasgow’s Buchanan bus station to catch the wonderful Citylink 926 for Campbeltown on the Mull of Kintyre, a great route that takes you past Loch Lomond then through Inverary, with its imposing Georgian waterfront. Disembark at Kennacraig and jump on the CalMac ferry to Islay, which, on a Saturday, goes to Port Askaig on the north-east coast of the island.There are two distilleries within walking distance of the port: Caol Ila and Bunnahabhain, both with great views across the Sound of Islay to the paps of Jura, and both offering tours. This coast also offers lovely walks and a good chance of spotting sea otters. There would be time for a single distillery visit before catching the last bus across the island (unless you’d like to scoot over to Jura, £3.70 return, 14 sailings a day from Port Askaig).Planning a weekend is vital on Islay as there are no buses at all on Sundays. If you don’t want to rely on taxis, there is cycle hire available in Port Ellen, from where Bowmore is a gentle 10-mile ride. There’s a distillery there plus others in Bruichladdich and Kilchoman. In fact Port Ellen is a whisky-lover’s paradise and could readily sustain a day without travelling, except on Shank’s pony. Three distillers of great malts are strung along the shore, a stroll apart: Lagavulin, Laphroaig and Ardbeg, the latter with the highly recommended Old Kiln Café.West from Port Ellen is the Oa peninsula, home to resident golden eagles. The return journey sails from Port Ellen back to Kennacraig then cuts across Kintyre for the Arran ferry. Hopefully there is time for a last tot in the Lochranza distillery before one more ferry and the train back to Glasgow.Top Tips Accept that Sunday on Islay is for walking. Watch out for the Islay Festival of Music and Malt, held in the last week of May. Do it over three days Day 1 (Saturday) Take the 06:25 Citylink bus 926 from Glasgow to Kennacraig (arr 09:30, £19.20 single or £22.80 return if returning from Islay) to connect with the 09:45 CalMac ferry to Port Askaig (arr 11:50, £13.80 return). Walk to the Caol Ila or Bunnahabhain distillery for a tour (from £6 and £5 respectively). Take the 451 bus to Port Ellen at 15:20 (arr 16:09, £4). Day 2 (Sunday) Tour distilleries on foot, walk to the Oa and cycle to Bowmore (bike hire £20 a day or £70 a week). Day 3 (Monday) Take the 09:45 CalMac ferry to Kennacraig (arr 11:55), which connects with the number 448 West Coast Motors bus to Claonaig, departing at 12:10 (arr 12:24, £1.40), then catch the 12:35 CalMac ferry to Lochranza on the Isle of Arran (arr 13:05, £3). Then get Western 324 bus to Brodick ferry terminal at a 15:30 (arr 16:08, £4) and on to the 16:10 CalMac ferry to Ardrossan (arr 16:36, £4), connecting with the 16:36 train to Glasgow Central (arr 17:22, from £8.20).Start/end Llandudno Junction (from Chester/Crewe)Minimum One day/weekend for Snowdon summitPotential stopovers Best option is to get to Betws-y-Coed (from Llandudno) for the first night, then Port Meirion or Caernarvon. Landmark Trust has a cottage on the Ffestiniog line with its own stationWeekend Friday in Betws, Saturday in Caernarvon, Snowdon on SundayCost £66.25 (Snowdon railway £30 return, £39 for steam train)This circuit features the most sustained and magnificent steam railway experiences available in the UK, plus a bus route that won bronze medal in a recent poll of bus users to find the most scenic routes in the UK. At its heart is Wales’ highest peak, itself accessible by train.The entry point for national rail services is Llandudno Junction from where, going clockwise, you take the train to Blaenau Ffestiniog. If you’re not trying any of the gut-wrenching zipwire experiences available here, cross over to the adjacent Ffestiniog line and catch the next service to Porthmadog. This old slate quarry narrow-gauge line is one of the most beautiful rail journeys in the UK, crossing a narrow sea wall at its finish in Porthmadog.An overnight in nearby Port Meirion is not cheap, but is special (get off at Minfford for a shorter walk there). Rejoin the circuit at Porthmadog station for a second steam experience with the Welsh Highland line to Caernarvon via the stunning Aberglaslyn pass.Caernarvon Castle is the unmissable item, and then there’s a big choice too: Snowdon, or the award-winning Caernarfon-to-Bangor bus service. Since reaching the top of any country’s highest mountain by public transport is a rare thing, grab the 85 or 86 bus to Llanberis, then the rack railway to the summit (book in advance). Walking up or down, of course, is a possibility. Either way, take the Bangor bus from Llanberis, then a train back to Llandudno Junction.Top tips Take the Welsh Highland Railway to Rhyd Ddu station at the foot of Snowdon’s Rhyd Ddu path, hike to the summit and return via the Ranger path to pick up the train at the Ranger request stop (there’s a YHA hostel there too). Mountain bikes can travel on many services on both Ffestiniog and WHR. Check out the Sherpa bus route map.In a day Take the 10:23 Llandudno Jn to Blaenau Ffestiniog (arr 11:33, £9.20) train or the 07:25 to allow time to test the zipwires or view the slate mines in Blaenau. Join the 11:35 Ffestiniog steam train to Porthmadog (arr 12:45, £17.15). Take the 14:15 Welsh Highland line to Caernarvon (arr 16:30, £27.80).Alternative (not possible in one day). Sherpa Bus or 88 to Llanberis summit railway (allow three hours and pre-book). 85 bus to Bangor (last bus 17:30 on Sundays). At 17:00 take bus 5c to Bangor (arr 17:32, £4.50), then the 18:10 train to Llandudno Junction (arr 18:31, £7.60).Start/end Gallions Reach on London’s DLR line/City of London Minimum One day (Tilbury ferry does not run on Sundays)Potential stopovers Gravesend is an interesting town, but Leigh-on-Sea is probably the best potential stopoverCost £40.35Bleak mud flats. Even bleaker concrete flats. Yes, there is a lot of unloved landscape down the Thames, but this route is also full of incredible history and pleasures that are all the better for being so unexpected. From Gallions Reach DLR, walk to the Woolwich ferry via the Thames path (25 minutes) with views of planes coming in to London City airport. At the ferry, there’s a choice – boat across (it’s free) or a walk through the Edwardian foot tunnel (much less well-known than its counterpart in Greenwich but very similar).On the south bank, explore the refurbished Woolwich Arsenal buildings on the way to the station, then catch a Rainham train. At Dartford station, you may might want to disembark briefly to pay homage at the blue plaque on platform 2 marking the spot where Mick Jagger met Keith Richards in 1961 … Except some say they didn’t. The platform numbers changed over the years and the true platform 2 is now number 3.Continuing by rail to Gravesend, stroll down through the historic town (popping in at Pocohontas’s grave in St George’s Church) and catch the passenger ferry across the river to Tilbury. The main ferry terminal is where the MV Windrush first landed with its complement of Caribbean immigrants on 22 June 1948. This year, the ship’s arrival will be celebrated as part of Tilbury Carnival (July 20), the culmination of a fortnight of walks and food events in the area.Next door, there’s more history at Tilbury Fort, where Elizabeth I reputedly delivered her “I have the heart and stomach of a king” Armada speech. Determined history hounds will want to forage on the riverside path for Blitz rubbish dumped there, and there’s an old fort at the place where Captain Kidd’s body was gibbeted. From Tilbury Fort, walk or take a bus to town and get the train east to Leigh-on-Sea, a lovely seaside town with great pubs, then a bus to Southend, to ride the little train or walk the mile out to sea on the world’s longest pleasure pier.There are weekend boat trips from the pier and barge racing on the Thames on 22 June. From Southend, it’s a short hop on the train back to London.Top tips A good side addition would be to head east from Tilbury to Purfleet, close to RSPB Rainham Marshes. In Southend, check out the new Saxon treasure gallery at the central museum.In a day Take the 09:00 Woolwich ferry over to the south side of the river (every 10-15 minutes from 06:20. , 11:30 Sundays); the 10:31 train from Woolwich Arsenal to Gravesend (arr 11:26 including a change in Crayford on weekends, £8.30); 12:30 Tilbury Ferry (every half-hour Mon-Sat, £4, buy tickets on board); 13:10 Ensign bus 99 to Tilbury Town railway station (£1); 13:33 train to Leigh-on-Sea (arr 13:59, £6.10); 15:30 train from Leigh to Southend Central (arr 15:37, £3) or walk the Western Esplanade from Leigh (70 mins, 3½ miles); 16:00 train along the pier (£5.35 return); to walk is £2. The pier is open 08:15-20:00 daily in summer (or check out the stunning display of newly discovered Saxon burial chamber that opened at Southend Museum, 18:01 train back to London Fenchurch Street (£12.60).Start: Alnmouth/Berwick stationsMinimum It can be done in one day, depending on the tide Potential stopovers Lindisfarne, Bamburgh, Seahouses, Craster, Alnwick and Alnmouth are all fine stopsCost £11.20, excluding East Coast mainline ticketsMany travellers will have glimpsed this route while charging along the East Coast mainline between London and Edinburgh: a few brief vistas of wonderful seascapes and cliffs together with the fleeting thought, “I must get off and explore one day.” No better decision could be made. The beaches of Northumberland are superb, the castles magnificent, the bus services thoroughly practical. Start by hopping off the East Coast mainline at Berwick-on-Tweed and catching the Borders 477 bus to Lindisfarne.This is one of the few services that can fairly claim to be governed by the tides, so this trip has to be carefully calculated according to your chosen date. Once on the island, one of the great religious sites of medieval Europe, you will need a couple of hours to see the priory, castle and museum, then leave time to walk back across the causeway before the tide comes in.Back on the mainland, pick up the X15 bus to Belford, then change for the 418 to Bamburgh, where you will need a couple of hours to explore the castle (adult £11.25, child £5.50), beach and dunes. In fact, this makes a great stopover. Further down the bus route is Seahouses, from where boat trips run to the Farne Islands (£20).Get on the X18 further south and stop at Craster to walk along the wild coast to Dunstanburgh Castle (adult £5.70, child £3.40). Take care not to miss the last bus for East Coast mainline connections, although real fortification-ophiles will want to sit on the bus to Warkworth then Alnwick (the latter also of interest to Harry Potter fans as the castle has played Hogwarts). Alnmouth is a lovely town perched on a sandy promontory between the Aln and North Sea, well worth a stroll.Top Tip Get the Discover North Northumberland bus ticket for buses 418, X15 and X18 for £6.70 a day (the 477 to Holy Island is not included).In a day You can reach Berwick from Edinburgh or Newcastle on the same morning, but from London you’d need to arrive on a Friday night. Take the 09:05 number 477 from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Lindisfarne (arr 09:40, £4.50). Woody’s Taxi also does a bus service. Walk off the island before the tide towards Beal for the bus stop. Take the 11:23 number X15 to Belford Market Cross (arr 11:33, use Discover ticket), then the 11:38 number 418 to Bamburgh (arr 11:50). Take the 14:48 number X18 to Craster (arr 15:26). The last X18 from Craster departs at 19:36 on Sat and Sun, arriving at Alnmouth station ay 20:23.Start/end Penrith/LancasterMinimum One dayPotential stopovers Penrith, Pooley Bridge, Glenridding (to climb Helvellyn), or Windermere for lake boat tourWeekend If you reach Penrith on Friday night before 17:35 you could hop up to Pooley Bridge for the night, then proceed to Glenridding or Windermere for SaturdayCost £52.30This classic route gives you the best of Lakeland scenery, particularly if combined with a few side walks. Most travellers will come in via Penrith, from where the Stagecoach bus runs to Pooley Bridge, a pleasant small town at the eastern end of Ullswater.From there, jump on the steamboat all the way up the lake, getting one of the best lake cruises in the world before hopping off at Glenridding. Keen walkers might get off earlier, at Howtown, and hike, either around the shore or over High Dodd and Place Fell (my favourite). It’s seven miles: watch out for red squirrels.Glenridding is base camp for climbing Helvellyn: the Striding Edge route is arguably England’s greatest ridge walk. Either go over the top and down to Thirlmere, picking up the 555 bus to Ambleside, or return to Glenridding for the 508. The bus route then climbs over Kirkstone Pass and down to Bowness-on-Windermere.This would make a convenient overnight – plenty of hotels to choose from. Then walk to the steamer pier and buy a single to Lakeside Pier at the south end of the lake (single tickets are only available on the day at the ticket office: if you want a guaranteed seat, buy a cruise online).After the superb scenery of the lake, head for the railway station and jump on the Lakeside and Haverthwaite steam service (last connection is the 16:00 boat from Bowness) to Haverthwaite. From there the X6 bus connects to Ulverston and the final treat, the Furness line back through Grange-over-Sands to rejoin the north-south mainline at Carnforth, where, if romance calls, you can re-enact the scene from Brief Encounter (or stay on the train for Lancaster and London).Top tips Leave the route at Glenridding, walking over Striding Edge and Helvelyn (OS Map OL5) then down to Thirlmere to pick up a 555 bus into Ambleside or Bowness-on-Windermere.In a day 09:20 Stagecoach bus 508 from Penrith to Pooley Bridge arr 09:50 (£4.30).Alternative Reach Penrith in time to get the last Friday bus to Pooley Bridge at 17:35 and get a head start. Take the 10:55 Ullswater steamer to Glenridding (arr 11:55, £14.50). Disembark at Howtown (arr 10:10) for the hike to Glenridding and climb up Helvellyn from Glenridding (about five hours). Or without going up Helvellyn, take the 12:11 bus from Glenridding to Bowness-on-Windermere pier (route 508, arr 12:59, £7); take the 13:50 steamboat to Lakeside pier (arr 14:30, £9.30); at 14:40 take the steam train to Haverthwaite (arr 14:58, £4.40). 15:47 X6 bus to Ulverston (arr 15:59, £3) then, at 16:08 join the train to Lancaster (arr 16:42, £9.80).Start/end Bournemouth stationMinimum One dayPotential stopovers Bournemouth, Swanage, around Lulworth CoveWeekend Stay in Swanage and enjoy Studland peninsula beaches and walksCost £42.90This is a great loop along the Jurassic coast. From Bournemouth station, take the hourly Breezer 50 bus towards Swanage, crossing the mouth of Poole harbour on the chain ferry to Studland, with its miles of sandy beaches, cliffs and heathland to explore. This is a superb bus route, one of Britain’s best on a fine day, often operated with open-top vehicles.Reaching Old Harry Rocks requires a walk but is definitely worth it. Swanage is a lovely small town with a fine beach and a newly restored Victorian pier. From there, catch the Swanage steam railway to Corfe Castle, one of England’s most scenic ruins and site of many historic moments, including a royal assassination (King Edward the Martyr in 978, probably at the instigation of his brother Ætheldred, later to be found unready). From here, take either the 40 bus to Wareham station or the Saturday-only train, and pick up the X54 bus to Lulworth Cove, Britain’s first world heritage site.Here the best idea is to walk the coastal path to Durdle Door, rejoining a later bus. From Durdle Door or Lulworth, the X54 continues to Weymouth – another great beachside town with a busy harbour – before the final leg out to Portland Bill lighthouse on the 501. If you have more time, keep going west: take the X53 for Lyme Regis or set out walking along Chesil Beach. If time is up, there’s a direct train back to Bournemouth (that goes on to London Waterloo).Top tips Leave the bus at Lulworth, walk the coast from Lulworth Cove to Durdle Door, then rejoin the bus on a later service or skip Weymouth and head back to Poole/Bournemouth.Do it in a day Breezer 50 bus (first one 08:02, single £6.80) to Swanage takes in the beautiful ferry ride at Sandbanks (a boat from Poole also links directly to Swanage pier) Alternatives1 Disembark to explore Studland and Old Harry rocks. 2 Take the 10:00 Swanage steam railway to Corfe Castle (arr 10:20, £8). 12:10 40 bus or rail to Wareham (arr 12:37, £4.20). 13:01 X54 bus from Wareham Station to Lulworth Cove and Weymouth (arr 14:17, £5.50), 14:25 501 bus to Portland Bill (arr 15:17, return £4.50, last bus back to Weymouth 17:23). 19:03 train to Bournemouth (arr 19:54, or Waterloo 21:49, £15.70). 3 Disembark at Lulworth and walk the coast path to Durdle Door, rejoining the route on a later service of the X54 bus.Start Glasgow Minimum A long, magnificent three-day weekendPotential stopovers Plenty of opportunity: Glasgow is probably necessary, Castlebay a definite, but also Uig, Tarbert, Berneray, Eriskay or ObanCost £106.10It starts with a panoramic bang: a seven-hour bus marathon from Clydeside that bursts with incredible scenery and locations. Slipping past your window: Loch Lomond, Glencoe, Fort William and on over the sea to Skye (well, the Kyle of Lochalsh bridge, actually) where the road finally ends at Uig pier. Here you have a choice: head for Lochmaddy on North Uist or Tarbert on Harris and open up the possibility of doing the entire outer archipelago of the Western Isles from north to south. Watch out for whales and eagles on the crossing and, when you reach Tarbert, the Harris Distillery.If you have time, there are plenty of diversions, including up to Callanish standing stones. Otherwise head south, hopping down the islands to the jewel that is Barra, where you could loop down to Vatersay, most southerly of the inhabited outer islands, or visit the iconic Kisimul castle out in the bay. If you are bagging islands, time this trip to leave Barra on the Wednesday ferry: it loops out via less-visited Coll and Tiree before heading in to the mainland. Back in Oban you could walk up to McCaig’s Tower, a neo-classical Victorian folly, or visit the distillery. The final treat is the magnificent rail trip across the Highlands back to Glasgow.Top tip Arrange to reach Barra on a Wednesday and you could return to Oban via Coll and Tiree. Do it in two nights Day 1 06:50 Scottish Citylink from Glasgow to Uig (arr 13:50: £45.60), 14:10 CalMac ferry to Tarbert (arr 15:50, £6.50), 15:55 bus W10 from Tarbert pier to Leverburgh pier (arr 16:35, £3.20), 18:30 CalMac ferry to Berneray (arr 19:30, £3.70), walk to Berneray Hostel (dorm bed £16).

King of the castles: a cabin stay on Northumberland's mighty coast,"In Alnmouth, new off-grid seaside huts make a great base for car-free exploring – whether you like your fortresses ruined or smartly kept",Robert Hull,2019-08-19T06:30:32+0100,"As night fell, a lighthouse beam caught my eye as it flickered across the sea from Amble. I folded away the seaside cabin’s mini-table, switched off the radio and stepped out on to the porch, waiting for my eyes to adjust to a night sky packed with stars. It was spellbinding. The north-east coast, with its castles, characters and legends, has magic everywhere, and miles of long beaches on which to contemplate it all.My wife, Mim, and I had travelled by train to Alnmouth for a car-free weekend getaway, with the historic coastal village as our base (a 20-minute stroll from the station). We’d soon settled in, sitting on the cabin’s steps to drink tea and eat bacon rolls while listening to the sea, not crashing but idling. Within a few hours, a spell had been cast, and cares packed away, replaced by fresh air and relaxation.But as much as it offers a welcome chance to do nothing, this coast is also rich in places to visit: Bamburgh and its castle, the Farne Islands for seabird-spotting, the fishing village of Craster, 14th-century Dunstanburgh Castle, and Howick Hall Gardens (for tea time at the ancestral seat of the Earls Grey).This area of outstanding natural beauty is home to many treasures. But how best to explore them? Easy: arrive by train, hire a bike, take buses, and walk. Alnmouth station is on the east coast mainline, so travelling from London (or Peterborough, Doncaster, York, Newcastle and Edinburgh) was a book-reading, nap-taking, coffee-sipping three hours and 41 minutes from King’s Cross.We arrived at Alnmouth’s Old School Gallery in the early afternoon, with the weather still pondering: breezy sunshine or windy grey-fest. As I chatted to Dale and Penny who run the gallery and its cafe, where vegetable frittata, couscous and salad (£8) kept us filled till bacon-roll time, I sensed Dale’s disappointment at the prospect of drizzle, or worse.The couple also own our weekend billet. Shoreside Huts are three off-grid seaside cabins a short walk from the village, and which opened in May. Designed by local Riba award-winning architecture firm Elliott and artist and joiner Adam Clarke, they have a stylish, wooden simplicity, with double bed, solar lights, washroom with composting toilet, log-burner, sofabed and space-saving ingenuity (although for now, showering means a trip back to the gallery).Waking with the sunrise and a view of the sea is how I wish I started all my days but it’s not viable to live on just bacon and tea, so we left our cabin – St Aidan – for breakfast in Scott’s Deli in Alnmouth (orange juice, granola, salmon and egg on brioche). There, families, locals and lycra-clad would-be peloton members were setting themselves up for the day as we studied our route to Bamburgh on the 418 bus (Discover day ticket £6.50pp).The route meandered through countryside and along the coast, passing villages we could have jumped off at to explore. Instead, we eavesdropped on walkers plotting routes from Embleton and Low Newton-by-the-Sea that would take them on St Oswald’s Way. This 97-mile footpath runs from Holy Island to equally blessed-sounding Heavenfield, close to Hadrian’s Wall in the south of the county. After an hour and 10 minutes on the bus, Bamburgh and its 11th-century castle (adult £11.25, 5-16s £5.50, family £28) came into view.Mim deemed the castle not damaged-looking enough: she prefers them as ragged as possible. Still, we toured its state rooms, took in tales of dragons and ghosts and discovered you can live there, in rented apartments. We had ice-cream from Wyndenwell on Front Street, and wandered to Bamburgh’s magnificent beach for a stroll south to Seahouses.On the horizon were the Farne Islands, and their two lighthouses, one of which was home to Grace Darling, and whose story is affectingly told at Bamburgh’s RNLI museum (admission free). Darling and her father, William, tended the Longstone lighthouse and on 7 September 1838 risked their lives in a storm to rescue passengers and crew from the stricken SS Forfarshire. They did so in a wooden boat not much longer than a family estate car. Grace’s reward was a celebrity that meant constant intrusion from an admiring public, hastening her early demise from TB. Bamburgh, with its stone-fronted houses, feels genteel, but Seahouses is a typical seaside town of fish and chips and arcades. And so our two-hour walk ended with a stop at Lewis’s (haddock/cod and chips £9) before taking the X18 bus back to Alnmouth.At first glance, Alnmouth had appeared scenic but sleepy. Yet its main road, Northumberland Street, is home to pubs including the Red Lion, the Tea Cosy Tearoom, the highly regarded Beaches restaurant, and a shop for hut supplies. There’s even an ironic slice of village history, too: what used to be the home of its anti-smuggling officer in the 18th century is now the Aln Gift Shop.On our first afternoon we had waited on Alnmouth’s Riverside Road for Adam from the Bike Shop in nearby Alnwick to deliver our hire bicycles (from £25 a day, delivery/pickup available). We saw how the Aln estuary curved around the village to meet the sea, and looked over to Church Hill – the cross at its summit an evocative vision amid mottled skies. Adam’s suggested route – an easy ride on Sustrans National Cycle Route 1 to Warkworth and its castle – proved a highlight. He also tipped Bertram’s in Warkworth for lunch: its crab cakes (£9.95) and apple crumble (£4.95) fuelled our return ride to Alnmouth.Warkworth Castle (adult £7.20, 5-17s £4.30, family £18.70), with its cast of custodians, including Harry Hotspur, was more to Mim’s liking: grand, yet suitably broken-looking. We wandered its ruins, before venturing along the River Coquet to visit its 15th-century hermitage. The boat ride there encapsulated, for me, the soulful heartbeat of this break – and this part of the world. Mark, at the ticket desk, had encouraged us not to miss the hermitage. I asked why. “There’s a moment of peace, midway across the river trip, that you should listen out for. It only lasts a couple of seconds but it’s magical.

"Top of the Bill: a car-free trip to Portland, Dorset","Our car-free coast series explores the trails, history and beaches of Hardy’s favourite ‘island’ on foot and by bus",Phoebe Taplin,2019-08-24T07:00:42+0100,"‘The peninsula carved by Time out of a single stone,” Thomas Hardy called it. He set his strange 1890s novel The Well-Beloved on Dorset’s Isle of Portland, which stretches out “like the head of a bird” into the channel. Connected to the mainland by a causeway and long, pebbly Chesil Beach, the “island” is famous for the pale limestone that built Saint Paul’s cathedral. There are still quarries here, and striking stone structures: churches and castles, harbours and prisons.The three of us arrive in Weymouth, a couple of miles north of Portland, from different directions. My mum (using her bus pass) along the coast, my brother by rail from Somerset, and me from Essex (via London). The Waterloo to Weymouth train takes three hours. South Western Railway has a patchy record, but today’s journey, with air-con, window seat, table and power sockets, is a model of civilised travel. The onboard wi-fi comes with free entertainment, from Love Island to Darkest Hour; the scenery offers marshy estuaries and miles of brackeny New Forest.We meet at King’s Statue on the seafront. George III, in a blue and ermine cloak, looks anxiously through palm trees towards a replica of his royal bathing machine. Regular buses head from here towards Poole and Axminster along the Jurassic Coast. We take the open-topped 501, which leaves hourly in summer for the red-and-white lighthouse at Portland Bill on the far end of the peninsula.After generous crab sarnies (£10.25) at Portland Bill’s The Lobster Pot café, we set off along the coast path on the hottest day of the year so far. The heat draws lightning-fast lizards out on to the sun-warmed rocks and releases the Mediterranean aroma of wild marjoram and aniseedy fennel into the shimmering air. Three shadeless miles to Church Ope Cove leave us sweaty and we swim off the white rocky beach, cooling down in the clear turquoise water.The ruins of 12th-century Rufus Castle stand on the cliffs above us, near Portland Museum (adult £3.50, child 6-15 £1). Family planning pioneer Marie Stopes founded the museum in 1930. She was friends with Hardy, who based Avice Caro’s house in The Well-Beloved on one of the museum’s thatched stone cottages. The rooms are stuffed with local curios, from mummified cats and puffer fish to stone masons’ tools and a U-boat compass. There’s more in the shady garden – fossilised dinosaur vertebrae, a Roman sarcophagus, the wooden arm of an old windmill…Two of Portland’s most interesting churches are close by: ruined St Andrew’s, its overgrown graves carved with piratical skulls and crossbones, is five minutes’ walk away down a wooded path, where butterflies flicker among the buddleias and clematis. Clifftop Georgian St George’s, 15 minutes in the other direction, has an evocative time-warp interior of box pews and twin pulpits. Nikolaus Pevsner called it Dorset’s most impressive 18th-century church.The White Stones Art Café in the nearby village of Easton supplies cake and huge mugs of tea in a vine-covered courtyard full of mosaic archways and blooming agapanthus. From the stop outside the door, the year-round number 1 bus, which shuttles between Portland’s villages and Weymouth every 12 minutes, takes us down to Portland youth hostel, where we’re staying the night. The sturdy brick hostel overlooks neat houses built for the sailors competing in at the 2012 Olympics. For dinner, we have seafood at the sunset-facing Cove House Inn (mains from £8.50) on Chesil Beach, down the road. We stroll back next morning and follow the coast path to Quiddles for breakfast. This cheerful beachside cafe in a candy-pink-painted former public convenience serves sustaining fry-ups (from £5.50) or veggie-friendly bubble and squeak (£3). This sets us up for the short, steep climb up to Tout Quarry (admission free), half a mile away at the top of the cliff. This labyrinth of hidden carvings and half-emerged stone creatures winds through banks of summer flowers. In one disused pit, Antony Gormley’s carved figure, Still Falling, dives headfirst down the cliff.The bus takes us down again to Portland Castle, built by Henry VIII. While the others check out the waterfront, I climb the old Merchant’s Incline, once a railway taking quarried stone down to the harbour. At the top, I walk through the daunting archway of 19th-century Verne Citadel, now HMP The Verne, to visit the Jailhouse cafe (panini from £5.25, jacket potato from £6), which reopened earlier this year. It’s an optimistic place with one of Portland’s best views, over miles of sea and curving breakwaters to the chalk-cut white horse at Osmington.Up to 52 passengers and their dogs can sardine into the old wooden ferry for a boat ride back to Weymouth. The 1930s boat was requisitioned during the second world war to carry soldiers out to the breakwater forts. Now it’s a pleasure boat again and we relax as sea air soothes our sunburned faces.After the wild cliffs and lonely quarries, Weymouth’s screaming fairgrounds and beeping arcades feel more than usually crowded, but there’s still space on the long sandy beach for a last swim. Hardy regularly swam here. In The Dynasts, his closet drama in verse, he has George III telling Pitt the Younger “The bathing is unmatched … The air like liquid life.”We sit by the Victorian kiosk near the Punch and Judy show and drink tea before heading to the station, looking out at the view described by Hardy: white cliffs, a cannon-topped headland and “the crescent-curved expanse of the Bay as a sheet of brilliant translucent green”.• Train travel was provided by South Western Railway (London to Weymouth from £14.50 one-way); bus travel was provided by First and ferry trips by Coastline Cruises (£7 one way).

Great modern architecture in Europe: readers’ tips,Our readers’ selection of (mostly) urban design masterpieces contrast or harmonise with traditional surroundings,Guardian readers,2019-10-17T06:30:34+0100,"With its quirky blob architecture, this gallery is nicknamed the “friendly alien” by locals, and viewed from Schlossberg hill in the city centre, it does look like an extraterrestrial has landed smack bang in the old town – especially at night, when the facade glows in a pixellated light show. The contemporary art shows are well worth a look, too.• Adult €9.50, 6-26 years €3.50, museum-joanneum.atJoe“You can tell I’m pretty obsessed with our new library,” my Finnish friend said when I asked for highlights. And from the sunlit top floor of the Oodi library we could see why she was so enthusiastic. Rows of books in all languages were spread out below for browsing, comfy chairs with travellers hiding out for a few hours, play areas, and a cafe with an all-you-can-eat brunch. It felt as if anyone from anywhere could find their place for a moment or hours. We had a cinnamon bun and coffee, taking obligatory photos trying to capture the architecture!• oodihelsinki.fiFranEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The Port Authority wished to renovate the fire station and add a new building to house over 500 employees. What makes it so striking is that it retains the old brick fire station, with a new glass structure, representing a sailing boat on a hydrofoil. It looks impressive from any angle. • There are guided tours on Tues, Thurs and Sat.visitantwerpen.bePaul TunneyAt the entrance to Marseille’s harbour sits the black cube of the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations, opened in 2013. The first French national museum outside Paris, designed by Rudy Ricciotti, it radiates a confidence that could brush off criticism with a Gallic shrug. The black concrete latticework channels papparazzi-like flashes of the sun on the sea. You can walk around the building without paying to see the exhibitions, and relax on loungers. Cross the bridge to Fort St Jean and you travel through time as the modern gives way to the 17th-century fort walls.• mucem.orgHelen ClaytonDriving to the south of France, we found what Le Corbusier had planned for Dominican friars 60 years earlier: silence and peace. Keeping watch from a hillside, the Sainte Marie de La Tourette monastery is a brutalist box with an inner beauty. My nine-year-old daughter and I were the only non-architect visitors on the guided tour, and we marvelled at the shapes conjured in concrete. Like any good tour, it ends with a big reveal, and the mastery of space, light and colour in the main chapel are a spiritual experience for those of any faith and none.• couventdelatourette.frAdrian KnowlesThis waterfront arts centre and cafe was built in 2014, and what really sets it apart is the terrace roof, which extends across the pedestrian walkway over the sea, creating a sense of continuity between land and ocean. Mirrors on the ceiling create a magical effect through the sun’s reflection on the moving surface of the water.• centrobotin.orgJusta“Ugly isn’t it, in a beautiful way!” my friend said. This geometric and bubbly building is the National Library of Kosovo. Nobody warned me as I set out to explore. All of a sudden there it was, like a Rubik’s Cube for passing giants to play with. This asymmetrical jumble of cubes and domes, far more beautiful than ugly, sits in solitude at the heart of a scrubby park – all the better for appreciating its myriad aspects. And frankly what other building would dare go near it!• dtk.rks-gov.netTim NicholsTowering over the cathedrals and palaces of Seville’s old quarter, the Metropol Parasol is a strikingly modern wooden structure by German architect Jürgen Mayer. Known locally as Las Setas (mushrooms) de Sevilla, the hugely ambitious project on Plaza de la Encarnación incorporates designs inspired by the vaults of Seville Cathedral. Its unique aesthetic has polarised opinion. Nevertheless, it provides an unmatched panaroma of the beautiful cityscape • Entry €3 including a drink, alcazartickets.comJackWhile the De Krook gets most of the press in Ghent, the building I love is the City Pavilion, right in the middle of the town. Surrounded by the type of period architecture that Ghent is known for, it sticks out like the sorest of thumbs. Asymmetric and brutalist yet welcoming and with a slanted chimney, it’s a brilliant example of refusing to let a town be preserved in aspic. It takes on an entirely different dimension when lit up at night, and I’ve seen it used for everything from student celebrations to a shelter for horse-drawn carriages. Public architecture at its best.• visit.gent.beJoelSmall but rather lovely, this new cafe in Hyde Park has a brass roof that’s designed to look like a stingray. The undulating shape creates the impression of a smiling mouth. From a distance, it looks like a Japanese pagoda. Inside, the theme continues: the underside of the roof is ridged to give the impression that you are inside the mouth of a sea creature. If that sounds creepy, it’s not.

10 of the best small ski resorts in Europe: readers’ travel tips,"From Spain to Greece, these less-obvious ski areas offer great value and a more local feel than the big, busy Alps resorts",Guardian readers,2019-10-10T06:30:09+0100,"Port Aine is a lovely ski resort with 22 pistes, reaching a height of 2,440 metres. As with many small Spanish resorts it is only busy at weekends, so during the week you can enjoy deserted beautifully groomed pistes, with lovely off-piste challenges as well. Food and drink prices are very low, and the people really welcoming. Lift passes at €65 for two days are great value, or just €3 if, like me, you are over 70. There’s accommodation in Rialp at the foot of the mountain or stay at Red Rock Trails near Tremp, if you want a multi-activity holiday. Note: Spanish schools don’t have half-term, so those periods are no more expensive than any other time.• portaine.catDavidKranjska Gora is a brilliant small ski resort in Slovenia’s Julian Alps, close to the Italian and Austrian borders. There’s a great mix of slopes, including plenty of easier runs for families and beginners – all accessible via chair lifts and drag lifts. I thoroughly recommend the ski and snowboard school, and the nearby cross-country skiing centre makes a great day out. The village itself is full of Alpine charm – particular highlights were Lake Jasna (a stunning turquoise lake), Pizzeria Pino for wood-oven pizza and Slascicarna Kala for the best cake we’ve ever eaten. • Two-day ski pass €59, kranjska-gora.siMattieChampex-Lac is a small village built around a lake that freezes for skating or cross-country skiing. Only two lifts, but it still has powder in a tree-lined bowl after nearby Verbier is skied out. The restaurants are traditional but good value (for Switzerland), and there are shops and ski rental in the town. There’s plenty to do for kids – ice rink, nursery piste, sledge runs and a good ski school. It can be reached by train from Geneva via Martigny then the connecting branch line to nearby Orsières and a short bus ride. Verbier is a 20-minute drive away, if you want the big resort experience. • Two-day pass CHF56 (£46), champex.infoJames PooleyEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

It is a small town surrounded by the Bjelasica and Sinjajevina mountains, which rise to above 2,000 metres. Skiing costs from €30 a day including lift pass, and there are also children’s slopes with instructors. My seven-year-old loved it. The great-value Balkan cuisine is delicious and accommodation ranges from upmarket Hotel Bianca to reasonably priced log cabins. The ski slopes are 7km away and accessible by bus. For a winter holiday without queues and high prices, I’d really recommend the area.RalphClose to Germany’s highest mountain, the 2,962 metre Zugspitze, Garmisch-Partenkirchen is a relatively unknown resort. Home of the hair-raising Kandahar downhill race, it boasts good transport connections from Munich and Innsbruck, quality family-run hotels and chalets close to the slopes, good rental equipment, varied ski runs, spectacular views, the Zugspitze glacier and vast off-piste, ski touring and cross-country skiing. The town is the epitome of charming old-style Bavarian prettiness complete with traditional festivals. Après-ski activities range from local food and beer on and off the slope, to gorge walks and castles. A great place to get away from overcrowded, busy and better-known resorts. • Two-day ski pass €88, zugspitze.deJuliaWe had a fantastic long weekend in the Sierra Nevada resort, Spain. It’s only a couple of hours’ drive from Málaga or 50 minutes from Granada. The resort is small but lively, with plenty of bars and restaurants. It is also super-cheap in comparison with the Alps. The skiing is great for beginners and intermediates – not so much for advanced but nice easy slopes to cruise at high speed. It certainly kept our mixed-ability group happy for a few days. • Three-day pass €137, sierranevada.esAnna SkeltonNear Lourdes there is another place of miracles. La Mongie surprises with 68 pistes from 1,800 to 2,500 metres, and truly delights. Two functional apartment pyramids close to the village provide tiny flats for super-easy access to the 100km of pistes and close to all amenities. We opted for a cute studio. It’s in the impressive Grand Tourmalet region in the Midi-Pyrenees, and skiers have access to eight resorts. Lourdes railway station is just under an hour away by bus, and Pau is 95 minutes away. • Two-day pass €90, n-py.com/enSarah HydeSkiing in Levi, northern Finland, was perhaps the most enchanting winter experience I have ever had. As the sun goes down just after midday, a lot of the skiing takes place under floodlights (and in -40C), not to mention the aurora borealis. But among our family’s favourite local touches were the small smoke huts lining the edges of some slopes. These were small log teepees with a fire burning in the middle, topped with a grill to cook your locally bought meat on. I think that more or less every day we bought sausages or reindeer steaks to cook on an open flame for lunch. • Two-day pass €44, levi.fiRobinA wonderful ski experience is to be had in Hania on the slopes of Mount Pelion. If the sun is shining on the glittering snow, it is possible to ski with the blue Aegean gleaming on one side and the islands and hills of the Pelion peninsula emerging out of the mirror of the Pagasitikos Gulf on the other. The ski centre is within easy distance of the city of Volos with its hotels, museums and restaurants, and picturesque villages in the area. Hania has 3km of slopes of varied difficulty, and five ski lifts. Lessons and equipment hire are on tap and prices are unbelievably reasonable.• Ski pass €13 a day, aroundpelion.comJulietAn extensive ski area in the Apennines, with mountains of around 2,000 metres, Roccaraso is big enough to occupy good intermediate skiers for a few days. It is covered in beech forest rather than pine, and outside of weekends is incredibly quiet. The mountain restaurants on the outside look uninspiring but the homecooked food served within is better and far cheaper than Alpine equivalents. Everyone, we found, was incredibly friendly and welcoming. The weather can change quickly but when conditions are good you may never want to ski anywhere else again. To round off your break, spend a night or two in Rome. In short a perfect winter holiday. • Two-day ski pass €81, skiabruzzo.comAndyLooking for a holiday with a difference?

We started at G2’s HQ just south of Aviemore, where we picked up wetsuits and helmets then drove to the Bruar canyon, 50 minutes to the south and joined our guides. Here, amid pine forest and the constant sound of rushing water, we discovered the thrills of natural water slides over bare rocks, abseiling through waterfalls and leaping into deep rock pools. I was a bit apprehensive about the trip to be honest but I couldn’t have had a more thrilling time. G2 also offers ziplining, gorge walking, rafting and skiing. • £60pp for five-hour trip, minimum age 13, g2outdoor.co.uk KimmichI’ve been to the Peak District many times, walking, cycling and fishing.

It has a great community feel, everyone is incredibly supportive and kind, and there is a great range of routes for all abilities.

You can see their point. The 1960s-built distillery eschewed the traditional pagoda-style skyline of the malting roof (which is now mostly a distillery affectation anyhow, as barley is malted off site). However, the 200-year-old distillery buildings – home to the holy grail of lost malts: Brora – are being recommissioned by beverage multinational Diageo. The distillery has a dark past: it was built by one of the chief architects of the Highland clearances, the Duke of Sutherland.

This pocket-size distillery’s tours offer a rare chance to sample a west-coast style (somewhere between a sweet Speysider and the smokey islands).

Of the three remaining distilleries, Springbank is the oldest, producing its complex maritime dram on the same fortress-like site in the centre of town since 1828.

How to make the most of the woods this autumn,"Foraging, wildlife, art, cycling and walks feature in this pick of autumnal activities, set to a glorious backdrop this year as leaf colours promise to be particularly rich",,2019-09-25T06:30:19+0100,"Westonbirt Arboretum near Tetbury is one of the best places in the UK to view a huge variety of autumn colours. The arboretum has 2,500 tree species from all over the world, including a national collection of maples. This autumn is predicted to be spectacular, thanks to a wet June and a sunny July, which provided trees with the right balance of sunlight and rain to produce the sugars that create the colours. Visitors can call the autumn hotline (0300 067 5691) to find the most vibrant areas to visit on the 600-acre site, and follow two seasonal trails through the Acer Glade in the Old Arboretum (one mile) and the Maple Loop in Silk Wood (two miles). There are free guided walks every day throughout September and October, and three autumn photography workshops (£125 on 15, 23, 25 October, imageseen.co.uk).• Adult £10 adult, child £4, until mid-November, forestryengland.ukThe UK’s first “leaf peeping drive” has been mapped out through the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley, offering domestic vistas to rival fall foliage tourism in New England and Japan. The 50-mile drive passes oak, ash, birch, beech, larch and sweet chestnut, and has 10 hotspots to stop at for the best views. Visitors can also explore the area on foot, by bike or by canoe, kayak or paddleboard; there are guided walks on 27-29 September (£5, walkinginross.co.uk) and 26-28 October (walksinchepstow.co.uk).• wyedeantourism.co.ukPonies and cattle roam the New Forest in Hampshire all year round, but in autumn visitors can spot another creature: pigs. Up to 600 pigs and piglets are released each year to eat the fallen acorns, beechmast and chestnuts, an ancient practice called pannage – acorns are poisonous to horses and cows. Good places to spot them are around Bramshaw village, near Bolderwood deer sanctuary and on the northern edge of the national park. But don’t get too close – they bite.• Until 10 November, thenewforest.co.ukBedgebury pinetum in Kent has one of the most complete collections of conifers in the world: 610 of the 810 species that exist worldwide. Some that are particularly colourful in autumn are sweetgum, maidenhair tree, golden larch, cypress and redwood. Bedgebury also holds regular events, from children’s treasure hunts to bat walks. This month, there is an activities taster day, when visitors will be able to try Nordic walking, Pilates, zipwiring or campfire cooking. There are walking, cycling, running and orienteering trails all year round.• From £10 for parking, entry and activities free, 28 September, bedgeburypinetum.org.ukA series of 10km runs is being held in 16 English forests this year. Still to come are runs around High Lodge in Thetford Forest, Suffolk (6 October); Salcey Forest, Northamptonshire (12 October); Sherwood Pines, Nottinghamshire (20 October); Thames Chase Forest, Essex (10 November); and Jeskyns Community Woodland, Kent (7 December). The routes are largely flat with even paths, making them suitable for novices as well as those looking to set a new off-road PB.• £20 each, forestryengland.uk/run100There are more than 70 events taking place in forests, woodland, gardens and parks during the Scottish Tree festival. They include Treefest at Armadale Castle on the Isle of Skye; autumn walks and fungal forays at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh; and a tree treasure hunt and Samhain fire party at Cambo Gardens in Fife (from free, 28 September to 2 December, visitscotland.com).The annual Tweed Valley forest festival celebrates the woodland culture of the Scottish Borders. It incorporate the Peebles food festival and wood market; the Scottish conker championships; and Carvefest, a chainsaw-carving exhibition (free, 19 and 20 October, forest-festival.com).Fifty shortlisted entries in the annual Earth Photo competition are being exhibited in two English forests until the end of April 2020. Images fit into one of four categories: People, Place, Nature and, new this year, Changing Forests. The exhibit is at Moors Valley country park near Ringwood in Dorset from 30 September to 15 December, then moves to Grizedale Forest in Cumbria (19 December to 28 April). • Free, earthphoto.worldThe Custody Code, a film by artist Amanda Loomes, tells the story of sustainable timber production and the men and women who work in the industry, from the seed bank to the sawmill. The 25-minute film was commissioned as part of Forestry England’s 100th birthday celebrations – the organisation was founded as the Forestry Commission in 1919, and now looks after more than 1,500 forests. Fittingly, the film is being shown in a wooden, solar-powered installation deep in Kielder Forest, Northumberland.• Free, until 1 December, forestryengland.ukThe Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail has a new permanent sculpture, Threshold by Natasha Rosling, next to a woodland pond. Visitors can walk through the artwork – two curved, interlocking red walls – which was inspired by the area’s mining history. There are now 16 sculptures on the trail, which opened in 1986 with work by Cornelia Parker and David Nash (free, daily, forestofdean-sculpture.org.uk). Sculpture fans can also visit Rachel Whiteread’s Nissen Hut in Dalby Forest, North Yorkshire, which was installed last year to mark the centenary of the first world war (free, daily, 1418now.org.uk).Shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing, is said to reduce blood pressure, lower cortisol levels, improve concentration and memory, and boost the immune system. It’s not difficult, either: it simply involves spending time in the woods, paying close attention to nature. And what better time to try it than in autumn? The National Trust website has a handy beginners’ guide. For those who would prefer a real-life guide, there are plenty of organised forest bathing sessions on offer. For example, Mindful Walks offers forest-bathing walks and mindfulness practices in Fforest Fawr, eight miles north of central Cardiff.• £10, next walk 17 November, mindfulwalks.ukAutumn is a great time to go foraging in the forest for mushrooms, nuts and berries. Unless you are an experienced forager, though, it is best to go with an expert to ensure anything harvested is safe and sustainable. One such company is Northern Wilds, which runs foraging days in Kielder Forest. The hunt ends with a feast prepared in the “wild food wagon” – a former military truck now powered by biodiesel and equipped with a wood-fired Rayburn. The day is based at Kielder campsite, handy for spending a night stargazing in the forest (Kielder is a dark sky park). • Adult £65, child £45, 5 October, northernwilds.co.ukKnapdale Forest in Argyll & Bute is known as Scotland’s rainforest – the oak woodland is bisected by lochs and backs on to the sea. It is also home to a population of beavers, which were reintroduced in 2009. The Argyll Beaver Centre runs weekly guided beaver walks through the forest, viewing the work of “nature’s ecosystem engineers”, and hopefully a glimpse of the rodents themselves.• Adult £6, child £3, Wednesdays until 30 October, argyllbeavercentre.co.ukEvery autumn, for the past 18 years, Faskally Wood in Highland Perthshire has been transformed into an Enchanted Forest by a sound and light show. The 2019 show is called Cosmos, and takes its inspiration from the skies above the tree canopy. Visitors follow an illuminated trail past Loch Dunmore, deep into the woods, with laser shows, video projections, pyrotechnics and a soundscape. A new feature this year is an inflatable geodome hosting an immersive experience that makes audiences feel as though they are flying through space (adult £20, child £10, 3 October-3 November, enchantedforest.org.uk). In Cheshire, the Magical Woodland is a similar show (adult £17.95, child £14.50, 12 October-3 November, magicalwoodland.com).Garvagh Forest, 11 miles south of Coleraine, County Derry, opened new walking and biking trails this summer. The three walks include a 5km Agivey River route and a 6.9km circuit that skirts the perimeter of the forest, with great views. There is an easy circuit for family cycling and three mountain bike trails, from a short skills loop to a 4.7km technical trail (visitcausewaycoastandglens.com). For more high-octane adventures, Go Ape has some new night-time activities in forests this autumn. Sundown Segways take visitors speeding through the forest on Segways with only a head-torch to light the way, while Night Zips feature tree-top crossings and zipwire flights in the dark. Locations include Dalby Forest in North Yorkshire and Aberfoyle Forest near Stirling (selected dates in October and November, goape.co.uk).The Woodland Trust is the UK’s biggest woodland conservation charity, working to protect and restore existing woods, and plant new ones. It runs lots of guided walks and talks in its woodlands: upcoming events include a bat walk (soprano pipistrelle pictured) on the Smithills Estate in Bolton (free, 26 September) and a magical lantern walk in Plas Power Woods near Wrexham (£2 children, adults free, 12 October). It also runs short courses, such as a two-day introduction to hedge laying at Hedley Hall Woods near Newcastle (£80, 4, 5, 17 and 18 October and 18 and 19 November).• Find an event at woodlandtrusttickets.cloudvenue.co.uk• Article altered on 25 September because Fforest Fawr is near Cardiff and not in Powys and Mindful Walks’ next outing is 17 November, (Forest bathing walks).Looking for a holiday with a difference?

"Two wheels, no rules: bikepacking across Scotland","Where hiking can be a slog, cycling offers freedom. Nowhere more so than in the Highlands, where wild camping is legal and bothies abound",,2019-10-08T06:30:12+0100,"In the dog days of summer 2016 I rode my bike from Taynuilt on Loch Etive to Findhorn on the Moray Firth using the wildest and loneliest ways I could find. Logging and estate tracks, stalkers’ paths, drovers’ and 18th-century military roads and disused railways, as well as modern cycle paths and tarmac took me from one coast of Scotland to the other. At the time, the adventure was simply an act of care for myself after months in a job I had to drive to, following decades of cycling to work. I was sad and weak as a result of hours wasted on the motorway, and waking up on 24 June to learn the result of the Brexit referendum left me needing time alone with my own country.Riding a bike on wild paths turns what might be a slog on foot into a pleasurable amble. If you’re walking for several days in Scotland, the weight of food, fuel, camping kit and bad-weather clothing can be a real barrier to enjoyment. On a bike, I let the wheels take the load and put my effort into the pedals, revelling in the simple majesty of moving myself and my essentials through the landscape. It leaves time and energy for other pursuits. I’ve packed a wetsuit in the past, for dips in remote river pools.So many people have cottoned on to this that bicycles, electronics, bags and camping kit now come in space-age designs with astronomical prices. And while some of that stuff is lovely, none of it is essential to a satisfying and safe bikepacking trip into the wild. All you need is a solid bike with chunky tyres and a means of carting ordinary camping gear: panniers, or a single-wheel trailer for longer trips. One constant is a decent map, as it’s all too easy to get carried away down the wrong forest path.Any part of my coast-to-coast route would make a great overnight bikepacking trip, but one that stands out in its versatility is the first part – up Loch Etive and into Glen Kinglass. It’s easiest to start from the right bank of the River Awe, after the A85 bridge: from here I soon plunged off the tarmac on to a forest road, leaving the scant traces of civilisation behind. The track twists and turns, dips and rises along the eastern shore of the sea loch. It never rises to more than 50 metres but does so often and steeply, and the surface is loose. I found myself working harder and progressing more slowly than expected. But so what?As I looked around I saw things that are more obvious from the saddle than on foot. After the first climb, you can pretty much see the whole sea loch stretching to the north-west. Looking down, you notice that Loch Etive is a proper Nordic fjord, a steep-sided gouge in the edge of the Grampians. Low-lying grassland is fringed with scrubby oaks and sandy bays fringed with yellow flag iris.At Ardmaddy, I turned inland up the River Kinglass, a deep, dark channel with a magnificent conical mountain in the distance: Stob Dubh, summit of Buachaille Etive Beag, overlooking the pass of Glen Coe. Heading inland, I freewheeled down to the timber bridge and paused to look over the side, hypnotised by the peaty water, eyes scouring the bed for resting Atlantic salmon.In Scotland you can camp responsibly on most open ground. The lower stretches of the Kinglass abound with perfect spots, with lush grass and the last remnants of the Atlantic temperate rainforest clinging to the foothills of the Ben Starav. I like to stretch out and feel for stones and hollows before I pitch my tent, and orient it for the best morning view. The bike goes out to pasture and the stove goes on, the lid gently chiming as water boils for pasta.But there’s another possibility in Scotland: bothies. If you ride light and don’t mind who you share a roof with, these basic shelters are free for any passerby. When I got to the one in Glen Kinglass – a cruck-framed cottage – it was deserted, so I laid my sleeping mat on the bare earth floor, effectively camping indoors – and away from the midges. The bothy is set back from the track among broadleaved woods. The crag above is cut in two by the gorge of the Allt Narrachan and reminds me of a Chinese silk painting, the diagonal of the stream flicking side to side before leaping off into a waterfall with trees on crazy ledges either side. Next day you can ride back the way you came or head on to Bridge of Orchy and Tyndrum for the train back to Taynuilt. It’s a wild trail with unbridged rivers and sketchy tracks at best. But the thing with bikepacking is that you go where you fancy and take risks and perils on the chin. It’s your choice and there are no rules. You have options that don’t make sense on foot. You are free.Alan Brown is the author of Overlander: Bikepacking coast to coast across the heart of the Highlands (Saraband, £9.99).

Go loco: top 10 autumn city breaks in Europe by train,"With the crowds gone but the cultural scene buzzing, autumn is perfect for a European break. And our pick of destinations in five countries are reachable by train in less time than you might imagine",,2019-10-19T07:00:38+0100,"Fastest journey from London 6½ hours via ParisCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £168 returnWith its remarkably well-preserved Roman amphitheatre plus its new museum of artefacts, not to mention great shops and restaurants, Nîmes makes a superb autumn destination. The crowds have gone and although the intense heat has rescinded, the surrounding hills trap the summer temperatures, making it warm enough to sit out on a cafe terrace and watch the world go by.Make your first port of call the amphitheatre - Les Arènes (entrance €13, including the other two Roman attractions mentioned below). Explore the interior corridors (vomitories), then climb to the top of the terraces to see the amphitheatre (133 metres long by 101 wide) in its full glory. The top tier also offers views of the surrounding hills (seven, just like Rome), including Mont Cavalier, the highest point of the city, on which the Roman Tour Magne, built by Augustus, stands sentinel.Opposite the amphitheatre, explore the Musée de la Romanité, which opened in 2018 and holds a fascinating collection of artefacts, from large and exquisite mosaics to statues and glassware that survived 2,000 years buried in sarcophagi. There are interactive exhibits, too, which help bring the history to life. The museum’s own architecture is also impressive – from its glass mosaic-tiled facade that represents the ripples of a toga, to the different levels within the museum that allow you to view the exhibits from above.Next stop should be Nîmes’ old town: the warren of streets that runs north of the amphitheatre is punctuated with sunny squares, cafes and restaurants, along with independent boutiques for clothes, jewellery and homewares. Stop for lunch at Le Vintage, where you can devour bistro classics on its pavement terrace. Skip dessert though, because the best ice-cream and patisserie in town is a few steps away at Maison Villaret, which was established in 1775. Try its speciality, croquants – delicate almond biscuits flavoured with orange water. Nîmes is also famous for another kind of biscuit, caladons, with almonds and honey.The old town opens out into a grand square where La Maison Carré, the only surviving intact Roman temple in France, stands proud on a plinth with bright white pillars. Inside, there’s a screening of the film Nemausus, the Founding of Nîmes.Nearby, the Jardins de la Fontaine are the town’s breathing space: these ornate baroque gardens feature terraces, statues and ornamental ponds, as well as the remains of the town’s original water source, housed in the remains of the Temple de Diane. Up the hill behind it is the Tour Magne.For dinner, L’Imprévu serves seafood and Italian-inspired dishes and has a terrace on one of the city’s liveliest squares, Place d’Assas.Example journey Take the 09.24 from St Pancras, crossing Paris to Gare de Lyon for the 14.07 to Nimes, arriving at 17.05. Returning, the 07.58 gets to Paris Gare de Lyon at 10.53, then across Paris to Gare du Nord for the 12.13 to London, arriving at 13.30.Stay at cosy, beautifully decorated La Maison Rousseau B&B (doubles from €105pn). It’s in a peaceful spot and an easy walk to the main sites. Carolyn BoydFastest journey from London 5 hours via LilleCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £95 returnThough it isn’t as well-known as other cities of the Loire, Angers makes the most of its unique position on the River Maine, just before it joins the Loire, with riverside restaurants and enchanting cycle trails, as well as art deco architecture, distilleries and an imposing chateau at the heart of the city.Château d’Angers is a good place to start. This mighty fortress is surrounded by 17 towers which punctuate its mighty 2½-metre thick walls. For superb views of the city and river, walk around its ramparts, which enclose a tiny vineyard and gardens. Inside, the rooms and exhibits tell the story of the Dukes of Anjou who held court here in the 14th and 15th centuries and were great patrons of the arts. The main draw, however, is the 104-metre Tapestry of the Apocalypse illustrating the Book of Revelations. It took seven years to complete in the late 14th century and its six-metre-high panels, which depict 90 scenes, are beautifully lit in an atmospheric gallery. The chateau’s own restaurant serves good hearty dishes with mains from around €10.Outside the chateau, follow the blue line painted on the pavements to guide you around a loop of the best sights in the old town. Highlights include the beautiful medieval Cathédral Saint-Maurice with its wonderful stained-glass windows. Just behind it is the six-storey, half-timbered Maison d’Adam, built in 1491 and home to decorative carvings of bawdy figures. A chain department store wouldn’t usually star in a city’s list of must-sees, but the elegant facade and art deco glass roof of Galeries Lafayette will delight fans of fine design. For more art deco, keep following the blue line to La Maison Bleue, an apartment building built in 1929 and decorated with colourful mosaics and ornate ironwork.Autumn is the ideal time to pedal along the Loire à Vélo cycling track, which follows the famous river. Hire bikes at Vert Event Angers (from €15 a day) and cycle 8km down to the attractive village of Bouchemaine, where Le Noé is one of the region’s many guinguettes – riverside cafe-bistros that offer a host of entertainment, music and activities.Three kilometres to the east, just outside peaceful Sainte-Gemmes-sur-Loire village, is another hub of activity at Guinguette de Port-Thibaut, with superb views over the broad river. Further down the Loire, a 30-minute cycle away, is the Île Béhuard – an island with monastery and historic chapel at the heart of the characterful village.Angers is the home of Cointreau: the orange liqueur was created here in 1875 and visitors can tour the distillery. On the other side of town, Distillerie Giffard also has a visitor centre, with a range of liqueurs, including the Menthe-Pastille that made its name.Example journey Though most Eurostar journeys go via Paris, it is easier to go via Lille as there is a direct train from there to Angers. It also means you only have to cross the platform to change, rather than crossing Paris from Gard du Nord to Gare Montparnasse, and only one change. Take the 15.04 from London St Pancras, then the 17.52 from Lille. Returning, take the 12.41 to Lille, then the 17.35 back to London. Stay Hotel 21 Foch (doubles from €89 room only) is a small, contemporary hotel in the city centre. CBFastest journey from London 7½ hours via Paris (about an hour longer inbound)Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £120 returnFor fresh sea air, fabulous food and Basque culture, a short break in Biarritz fits the bill even in the cooler months. Though its glorious golden beaches and surf culture may suggest it’s a summer-only destination, there is plenty to draw you there in autumn.Try to time your visit with the Fête de la Saint Martin (8-11 November) to see the town celebrate its Basque heritage through concerts, dance shows, workshops, food events and the Basque racket game, pelota.Foodies will love Restaurant Week also in early November (4-10), when many of the town’s restaurants showcase their best Basque dishes for €20 for lunch or €30 for dinner. Though you can embrace the French Basque country’s piquant cuisine any time of year at Les Halles market – tuck into pintxos (Basque tapas) and sip local wine at the many stalls.For goodies to take home, explore the town’s many chocolateries, such as Pariès or Maison Adam, and Rue Victor Hugo, home to the ultimate cheese shop, 1001 Fromages, and the Maison Arostéguy épicerie, which is rammed to the rafters with fantastic Basque and French products.The other streets that surround the market are great for restaurants, as is Rue Gambetta, leading south from the market. Elsewhere, one of the best tables in town is Le Pimpi Bistrot on Avenue de Verdun, where chef Manu Michel’s dishes showcase the seafood, fish and charcuterie that the Basque country does so well, while nearby locals’ favourite Tantina de Burgos on Place Beau Rivage serves excellent dishes flavoured with the local chilli pepper, piment d’espelette.Autumn sees the mighty Atlantic waves roll ever more fiercely to shore, and if you dare take to the water there are several surf schools (try hastea.com, 90-minute group lessons from €40) to hire you a board, wetsuit and the guidance of an instructor. A more indulgent way to enjoy the sea, though, is with a thalassotherapy session – seawater therapy – which will blast, drench or sprinkle you with seawater in a variety of treatments said to help circulation and skin tone. Try it at the Sofitel (treatments from €45).Or to enjoy the ocean without getting wet, take a coastal walk from the lighthouse along the Grande Plage, through the cluster of fisherman’s cabins at Port des Pêcheurs, and on to Le Rocher de la Vierge – a rock formation topped with a Virgin Mary statue, on the site of a miracle. Then follow the road around to the small Plage de Port Vieux, and finish at the incredible Côte des Basques beach. At this end of town, you can also explore the Cité de l’Océan, an interactive nautical museum, which includes a virtual reality surf experience – the cheat’s way to hit the waves.Example journey It’s quite a distance, but a relatively quick and very easy way to whizz down to the south of France, and the scenery is a treat in itself. Take the 11.31 from London to Paris Gare du Nord, then from Paris Gare Montparnasse the 15.52 gets you to Biarritz in time for dinner at 19.58. Returning, the 09.58 gets to Paris Montparnasse at 14.08, then the 16.13 from Paris Gare du Nord gets into London at 17.39.Stay Hotel de l’Océan (doubles from €69 B&B) is a friendly three-star hotel in the town centre, just above the Port des Pecheurs. CBFastest journey from London 3½ hours via BrusselsCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £78 returnGhent’s cobbled streets, art nouveau townhouses and imposing gothic architecture initially give the feeling of having stepped back in time. But it doesn’t take long to notice the city’s other main appeal: a very modern eco-friendly shopping and food scene. The vegetarian food is varied and high quality – the city became the first in the world to introduce a weekly vegetarian day a decade ago. For a taste of the veggie scene, head for Lokaal, which serves €12 homely vegan bakes and quiches made using in-season produce, or fill your plate up at a wholesome vegan buffet of colourful salads and pulses at cooperatively run Lekker GEC.For something higher-end, Lof offers an elaborate five-course vegetarian dinner (€65) that can be paired with vegan wines, while Michelin-starred Vrijmoed has an award-winning seven-course vegetarian menu (€102) that ranges from Japanese-inspired glazed aubergine with kombu seaweed to more typically Belgian fare such as a pavé of goat’s cheese swirled with honey and nuts. Among Ghent’s other charms are its prettily decorated independent shops. Lots of these sell locally made homeware and decoration, with tea towels, crockery and stationery designed by local artists (a Made in Ghent badge scheme provides helpful signposting). There’s also an emphasis on fairly-made clothing from around the world at shops such as Just Hazel, Visitrice, Mieke and A.puura.a. If you want to shop and relax in a low C02-environment, Broesse is a plant shop which is part tropical jungle, part rattan-furnished cocktail bar, where a young crowd sip creative vermouth-based cocktails surrounded by palm fronds.It wouldn’t be a trip to Belgium without sampling craft brews. The country’s signature Trappist beers are arguably the original green business model: brewed by monks in small batches that prioritise sustainability and quality, they’re available in most bars. For something more modern, go for a tour and tasting of the home brews in the giant taproom at microbrewery Dok, which is reinventing Belgium’s storied beer tradition with new recipes and flavours; or ascend to historical music venue Vooruit’s relaxed roof terrace to catch the last afternoon rays before winter.Ghent is also known for its thriving music scene, which keeps up the city’s rootsy image through bands which play anything from punk to futuristic jazz in dimly lit bars like Trefpunt, Bar Mirwaar and Charlatan. The Vrijdag markt is a good place to start a bar-hopping evening – and thanks to the city’s sizable student population, things are lively most nights of the week. Try nights run by the city’s legendary Democrazy promoters.Getting there The Eurostar runs from London to Brussels eight times a day and a ticket includes a free onward journey to any Belgian station within 24 hours of departure. Trains to Ghent depart from Gare du Midi, where the Eurostar arrives, every 15 minutes and take 29 minutes.Stay Ghent’s Eco Hostel Andromeda (doubles from €68) is a series of simple rooms and colourful shared spaces on a converted barge, and calls itself carbon-neutral. Water is purified on the roof, breakfasts are vegetarian, organic and fair trade, and mattresses are made from natural fibres. For a higher-end but still low-impact option, there’s Studiomie’s chic one-room hotel – the room features furnishings from local designers and Egyptian cotton sheets, all inside a shipping container (double from €130 room-only).Rachel HallFastest journey from London 3¾ hours via BrusselsCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £78 returnAntwerp’s most obvious appeal is its winding, cobbled streets culminating in the spectacular gothic cathedrals of the Grote Markt. But Belgium’s second city is its uncontested capital of cool. It has a longstanding reputation as an international fashion hub, buoyed by the fame of the Antwerp Six, a group of designers who graduated from the city’s art school in the early 1980s, but it’s also a port city, where bars, clubs, art galleries and restaurants vie for space in converted warehouses.Those looking for Antwerp’s hipper side should head to the formerly seedy docks area in the north. MAS, a skyline-dominating red brick and glass block, is a museum that explores the city’s maritime heritage where you can ascend to the roof for spectacular city views free of charge. Nearby is aBc, a brewery and taproom, which produces beers exploring Antwerp’s brewing history, from the Seefbier, based on a 16th-century recipe, to Bootje’s Bier, spiked with ginger and coriander. Move on to grungy Het Bos, a former anarchist squat turned cultural centre that hosts an eclectic mix of gigs, film showings, workshops and pop-up dinners.The city’s post-industrial appeal extends to the south. One of the highlights is Pakt, a sustainably run warren of progressive businesses in a disused factory. The heat from the pizza oven warms the offices on the top floor, and laid-back restaurant Racine sources vegetables for its seasonal salads and cold-pressed juices from its rooftop garden.For more traditional flavours, the legendary Frituur No 1 does Antwerp’s most famous chips and mayo, presided over by owner Maria’s unique, occasionally brusque style of service.The city is a shopper’s paradise and winter collections will be arriving in store now. The most obvious stop off is its fashion strip, Nationalestraat. Antwerpians particularly love “concept stores” that mix fashion, lifestyle, food and art, such as Stay, which champions “slow shopping” by serving cappuccinos and style advice to encourage people to take their time and choose beautifully made pieces they’ll keep forever. Visitors on this street should also rifle through pre-loved pieces at Melting Pot Kilo, which sells vintage threads by weight.A five-minute walk away, towards the sea, is Kloosterstraat, an iconic strip of antique shops, art galleries, vintage boutiques and designer outposts – try Five Fridays for Scandi style or Made By Hand, which showcases handcrafted jewellery and beautiful knits by local designers.Getting there See Ghent, above, for Eurostar details. Trains to Antwerp depart from Gare du Midi, where the Eurostar arrives, every 15 minutes and take from 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the train.Stay The stylish Hotel Indigo (doubles from €115 room-only) is part of a small international chain with decor in contrasting shades of pink and blue, with velvet and brass accents. Hotel Julien (doubles from €140 room-only), echoes Antwerp’s signature mix of the historical and contemporary with beautifully renovated rooms in a 16th-century building.RHFastest journey from London 3¼ hours direct (4 hours inbound)Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £86 returnThe Netherlands’ second-largest city has world-class museums and galleries, excellent seafood and a feisty spirit – which makes it perfect for those who want to see the “real” modern Netherlands, away from the tourist hordes of Amsterdam. Autumn is the perfect time for a short break.Rotterdam’s biggest attraction is probably its architecture. Bombed heavily during the second world war, the city today boasts several daring modern tower blocks which would not look out of place in Manhattan. Begin your day with a walk along the riverbank to take in the skyline, perhaps followed by a visit to the famous Cube Houses, an apartment building which looks like a string of discarded yellow Rubik’s Cubes.Nearby stands the Markthal, a striking indoor food market housed in a building that looks like an upturned horseshoe. Browse the stalls and enjoy a basket of kibbeling fish nuggets, some local cheese or perhaps a glass of jenever (gin) brewed in nearby Schiedam.Rotterdam grew prosperous thanks to its location near the mouth of the River Rhine, and the city’s giant port – the largest in Europe – has given it a tough, streetwise character.However, it also has a lively cultural scene. Highlights include the Fotomuseum photography museum and the Kunsthal art museum, which this autumn displays photographs by Daniël van de Ven telling the story of Rotterdam’s astonishing postwar rise. If you feel like roaming further afield, take a tram or metro to Delfshaven, where old sailing barges line the canals and you feel you might bump into Rembrandt or Vermeer around every corner.In the evening, watch the sun set as you walk over the famous Erasmusbrug (Erasmus Bridge) which connects the north and south sides of the city (once neglected, the south is now being gentrified). Have dinner at Hotel New York, a grand brownstone building perched imperiously on the riverside. Soak up the panoramic views and dine on local mussels cooked in Pernod or fresh chilled crab legs. Afterwards, walk over the nearby footbridge to Fenix Food Factory, a hipster food market and craft brewery where the glasses are always half full. If the dark local beer goes to your head, you can always order a water taxi to zip you back across the river to bed.Example journey The Eurostar goes direct from London St Pancras to Rotterdam Central seven times a day (five times on Saturdays): depart at 07:16 and arrive at 11:32. Returning, border restrictions mean you will have to change trains in Brussels: depart Rotterdam at 16.58 and arrive Brussels Midi at 18.08. You will then have time for a quick coffee before boarding the 18.56 Eurostar to London, which arrives at 19.57.Stay Hotel Bazar (doubles from €70 B&B) is quirky, colourful and surrounded by lively bars and restaurants. Ben Coates, Netherlands-based author of The Rhine: Following Europe’s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps Fastest journey from London 5¼ hours via Amsterdam or BrusselsCheapest Nov fare with Loco2 £140 returnAs first impressions go, Arnhem railway station makes a grand statement. A soaring modernist structure made of undulating glass, exposed concrete and steel, it took two decades to build, at a cost of €37.5m. It ushers travellers into a city that has had its fair share of makeovers – most notably after the second world war battle in 1944, depicted in the film A Bridge Too Far, which left only 212 houses undamaged.Right outside the station is the 1oo-metre-long art wall called The Reconstruction. Painted by local artists and residents, it displays figures and events that played an important role in rebuilding the city. One of the icons is Marga Klompé, who in 1956 became the Netherlands’ first female cabinet minister, and whose work led to the social welfare law.The story of Operation Market Garden, the biggest airborne landing operation of the second world war, is told at the Airborne at the Bridge museum, the British headquarters during the battle. It’s next to the John Frost Bridge over the Lower Rhine – the one that British, Canadian, Polish and American forces tried and failed to capture.Today, Arnhem is a city of fashion and design. Its art academy was home to internationally acclaimed fashion designers such as Viktor & Rolf and Pauline van Dongen, and industrial designer Marcel Wanders. For unique items made by a local designer, visit the fashion district in the Klarendal neighbourhood, with its many studios and boutiques – try sustainable fashion label Studio Elsien Gringhuis, or Atelier Judith van den Berg for beautiful, handmade leather bags.Afterwards, go for a bite atop Karendal’s hill at cafe/restaurant Sugar Hill, popular among Arnhemmers for its no-nonsense food (quality burgers, sandwiches, and three-course meals) and calm atmosphere. A 10-minute walk away is Café Restaurant Caspar, with a wide variety of craft beers, like Mooie Nel (Pretty Nel) or Dunkel CC, and impressively large cups of coffee.While tourists have taken over the streets of Amsterdam, chances are you’ll have those in Arnhem to yourself. Despite its lively cultural scene – 18 museums and many concert options – the city is less of a tourist attraction, and has a much more laidback vibe. And it’s much greener (or red and orange, this time of year).For the perfect autumn stroll, and to get your bearings, visit Sonsbeek city park and climb the spiral staircase of the 25-metre 19th-century Belvédère. The tower offers an excellent vantage over the city and its surroundings, but is only open to climb on the last Sunday of each month. Warm up afterwards in Stadsvilla Sonsbeek with a hot chocolate and Arnhemse meisje (sugary biscuit) on the side. Follow your Sonsbeek stroll with one in Hoge Veluwe national park, a sprawling nature reserve that includes one of Europe’s largest sculpture gardens, featuring 160 artists including Barbara Hepworth, Aristide Maillol, Marta Pan and Pierre Huyghe. The park is also the home of the Kröller-Müller Museum, which boasts the second-largest Van Gogh collection in the world, with nearly 90 paintings and over 180 drawings.In the evening, make your way to cosy cafe Stella by Starlight, near Arnhem central station, for live music and beers selected by Arnhem’s beer sommelier, Maarten Exel. Or go to cafe Stan&Co, round the corner, to end the night dancing.Example journey Take the 11.04 from St Pancras, arriving at Amsterdam at 16.11; get the next (half-hourly) direct train to Arnhem central station (1 hour). To return, take the 13.56 from Arnhem central station, transfer at Breda to Brussels-Midi, arriving at 17:17 (1 hour 35 mins) and take the 18.04 to London, arriving at 21.05.Stay Hotel Molendal (doubles from €80 B&B) is in an art nouveau building in Sonsbeek overlooking the park and a stone’s throw from the concert hall Musis Sacrum (home to dance company Introdans) and the city centre.Caroline van Keeken, Netherlands-based writer and journalistFastest journey from London6¼ hours via Brussels and Frankfurt or Cologne (with short transfer times); 7¼ hours inboundCheapest Nov fare with Loco2 £125 returnIn the 19th century, Wiesbaden was revered as the “catwalk of the society spa”, with royalty, aristocracy and dignitaries from across Europe visiting this elegant town to see, be seen and benefit from the medicinal properties of the water. The heart of the spa town is the Kurhaus, which was rebuilt in 1907 in neo-classical style to house a restaurant, casino, ballroom and concert hall.The casino is located in the former wine parlour, a handsome room with cherry wood panelling and crystal chandeliers. The roulette wheel where Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky allegedly lost his fortune in 1865 – and which inspired his short novel, The Gambler – is on display. It’s a pleasant way to while away a few hours, and a few euros, in splendid historic surroundings, while sipping a glass of sparkling Henkell trocken, the locally produced sekt sparkling wine.To experience the healing water, try the Kaiser-Friedrich-Therme, a beautifully restored art nouveau baths with green-tiled interior and Roman frescoes. As the nights draw in and temperatures drop, do as the Germans do and go textile-free into the tranquility of the soothing, warm water.If art nouveau decor piques your interest, the Museum of Wiesbaden’s recently opened permanent exhibition is a must. It’s one of the most important private collections in Europe, donated by local patron and former art dealer FW Neess with over 500 original objects, paintings and pieces of furniture – look out for the Nature sculpture by Alphonse Mucha, and furniture and glass pieces by belle époque designer Louis Majorelle.Art and spas aside, wine is the reason many visitors come to Wiesbaden. Known as the “gateway to the Rheingau”, the most distinguished wine-growing region in the Rhine valley, this is the place to discover refined rieslings or a full-bodied spätburgunder. Among the stalls overflowing with flowers, fruit, cheese and bread, the Wiesbaden Winegrowers stand can be found at the weekly Saturday farmers’ market, where various wineries take turns to present their produce to try for a few euros a glass. For a more formal tasting, Balthasar Ress in the centre of town offers wines at good-value winery prices, along with plates of local cheeses, meats, gherkins and bread.This chic little town is also home to one of the few urban vineyards in Germany, the Neroberg. Take the cute yellow funicular train, the Nerobergbahn up to the hillside estate for panoramic views across the vineyard, town and over the Rhine to Mainz. From here, there are various nature trails through the forest to enjoy and a magnificent, if a little incongruous, Russian Orthodox church, an opulent monument to Princess Elizabeth Michailowna, the Russian wife of Duke Adolph von Nassau, who died here in childbirth. For something more testing, the Kletterwald Neroberg offers 10 gradients of rope-slung courses high in the treetops, a great activity for families with children aged four and over.Head back into town for a shopping spree along upmarket Wilhelmstrasse and get cosy in Webers Wikinger for a traditional fireside schnitzel, roast potatoes and more of that glorious riesling.Example journey Take the 08.55 Eurostar from London St Pancras, arriving in Brussels at 12.05; board the 12.25 to Frankfurt Airport, arriving at 15.16; then depart for Wiesbaden on the 15.50, arriving at 16.10. The return journey leaving Wiesbaden at 07.41 arrives in London at 14.05.Stay The laid-back Hotel Klemm (doubles from €90 B&B) occupies a smart red-brick art nouveau villa and has a stylish decor.Celia ToppingFastest journey from London 4 hours via BrusselsCheapest Nov fare with Eurostar £115 returnCologne station is in the shadow of the city’s dramatic gothic cathedral. It’s well worth a trip up the 533 steps, past Fat Pete (the largest free-swinging church bell in the world) and up to the observation platform for panoramic views of the city and beyond. Walking south from the cathedral takes you through the charming cobbled streets of the old town, with its skinny pastel-coloured houses and architectural gems such as the Romanesque Gross St Martin church. Enjoy a traditional halve hahn (gouda cheese with a rye roll, raw onions, pickles and a dollop of mustard) from Peter’s Brauhaus and wash it down with a cold Kölsch, the local beer.Venturing further south along the river will take you to the recently modernised, popular waterfront district of Rheinauhafen. The Kranhäuser (crane towers) dominate the skyline of this former industrial dockland area, and the curious blend of old and new buildings makes for an interesting stroll. On a chilly autumn day, warm up in the boat-like Chocolate Museum, reached by a swing bridge, and enjoy fine Rhine views.The west is traditionally seen as the classy side of the river, whereas the east bank was known as Schäl Sick, the rather undesirable “wrong” side. But things have changed in recent times, with prices pushing residents over the river, and regeneration projects such as the Rheinboulevard making a trip across the Hohenzollern bridge genuinely worthwhile – rather than just for “that photo” of the bridge and cathedral.Turn left and head north from the bridge, stopping for a drink at the Rheinterrassen, and onwards through the Rheinpark, one of the region’s green spaces. From here, catch the Kölner Seilbahn (cable car) back over the river to Cologne’s truly wonderful zoo. This is a zoo for people who don’t like zoos, with happy animals that produce lots of babies, huge enclosures and a delightful programme of special events. But if this really isn’t your thing, the botanical gardens are just next door, perfect for brisk autumn days, with a deliciously warm Palm House and beautiful greenhouses filled with tropical plants.With two such exceptional attractions nearby, the Sculpture Park often goes unnoticed, which is a shame, as this small, free-to-enter park houses a remarkable collection of international contemporary sculpture, and is newly curated every two years. Cologne is also home to several superb museums, including the Roman-Germanic Museum and Museum Ludwig. If you can, plan your visit for Museum Night on 2 November, for over 200 concerts, exhibitions, DJs and other artistic events at locations across the city until 2am.For a more low-key evening’s entertainment, head over to the hip Belgisches Viertel (Belgian Quarter), buy a Kölsch from a kiosk and go people-watching in Brüsseler Platz as night falls. From here it’s a short step to some of the area’s coolest bars, with classics like the super-popular Sixpack, or Salon Schmitz, where the bold and beautiful of the city go out in style.Example journey Take the 8.55 Eurostar from London, arriving in Brussels at 12.05; catch the 12.25 to Cologne arriving at 14.15. The return journey leaving Cologne at 08.55 arrives in London at 14.15.Stay Maison Marsil (doubles around £95 room-only) is in the old town between the Rhine and the Belgian Quarter.CTFastest journey from London 7¼ hours via ParisCheapest Nov fare with Loco2 £175 returnThere’s a back-to-work atmosphere in Lausanne each autumn, after a summer in which most people spend their free time lazing by Lake Geneva or escaping the heat for the cool of the mountains, leaving the city centre in a slumber. Energy returns in September, building to a crescendo when the Christmas market kicks off at the end of November, sparking a month of vin chaud-fuelled revelry all over town.In between times, autumn has its own special appeal. For starters, it’s the best season for walking. Head to the terraced vineyards of Lavaux, just outside the city, where the turning leaves are at their most glorious and activity peaks with the annual grape harvest. Taste wine in the various caves as you stroll through the vines between the pretty medieval villages of Lutry and Saint-Saphorin, high above the lake.Alternatively, Sauvabelin park, on a hill in the north of Lausanne, is a lovely spot to wander among kaleidoscopic trees – climb the wooden viewing tower to see the city and lake spread far below. On your way back downhill towards the town centre, stop at the wonderful Fondation Hermitage to see the permanent collection of impressionist and post-impressionist painters.A new museum district opens in the city this autumn: Plateforme 10, so-called because of its location near the nine platforms of the main rail station, will house three museums by 2021. The fine art museum, Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts, is the first to move in this October, followed by the Musée de l’Elysée (photography) and Mudac (contemporary design and applied arts).As it is home to the International Olympic Committee headquarters, Lausanne is also dubbed Switzerland’s Olympic city, and it hosts the Winter Youth Olympic Games next January. The flashy Olympic Museum, in the lakeside resort of Ouchy, south of the city centre, features a temporary multimedia exhibition, with 50 athletes sharing tales of their personal Olympic experiences. While it’s always fondue time here (Café du Grütli does a good one), autumn in Switzerland means la chasse (hunting season), so game meats are on the menu at many restaurants in October and November, typically accompanied by spätzle (a sort of Swiss pasta), chestnuts, red cabbage and fruit. Try wild boar stew at Brasserie de Montbenon, or venison filet mignon with truffles and grapes at La Croix d’Ouchy, where you should turn up ravenous, since you get two servings.For a non-game lunch or brunch, Le Pointu is a good bet for salads and tranches (fancy open sandwiches) if you can get a table – it’s hugely popular; or head to Lausanne institution La Chandeleur for a simple sweet crêpe. For an apéro, Les Boucaniers has a good beer list, or try local wines at crowdfunded bar, Ta Cave.Example journey Take the 11.31 Eurostar from London to Paris Nord, arriving at 14.47; cross to Paris Gare de Lyon by taxi/metro, to take the 15.57 TGV to Lausanne, arriving at 19.37. To return, take the 13.31 from Lausanne, changing again in Paris, and you’ll be back in London by 21.37.Stay The Alpha Palmiers (doubles from €129 room only), a light, bright space with a central tropical garden, near the railway station.Caroline Bishop, Lausanne-based authorLooking for a holiday with a difference?

"‘No sex please, we’re meditating’: peace and positivity on a weekend retreat","At a country house in West Sussex, meditation, yoga and detox come together for a weekend of mindfulness that expands your ‘protective bubble’",Nick Duerden,2019-10-23T06:30:28+0100,"The taxi driver appraises me with suspicion when I tell him my destination. “But you’ve not got a yoga mat,” he says.Having never been on a meditation retreat before, I was self-conscious of criss-crossing busy train stations with a yoga mat strapped to my back, so I’d concealed it inside a Sainsbury’s bag for life. I point it out now to the driver, and he offers a wry smile as he takes me to the place where, for the next four days, I’m to be immersed in an intensive period of “me time”. I’ve never done this before, so have no idea what to expect.Long-term health conditions can be interesting in all sorts of unexpected ways. You learn about your levels of resilience, and the efforts you are prepared to take to get better. I’ve been struggling with low physical energy for almost a decade, my mitochondrial cells malfunctioning after successive flu viruses never quite left my body. Doctors didn’t know what to recommend – these cells aren’t easily “fixed” – and so suggested what they suggest to anyone who presents mysteriously: eat better, sleep well. Do yoga, learn to meditate.I’ve spent the last five years dipping in and out of meditation – apps, YouTube, Ruby Wax’s focus on mindfulness through books and interviews – but it was vedic meditation (a close cousin of transcendental, which uses a silent mantra or sound repeated over and over) I kept returning to. I liked it but always let it slip. I knew that to establish a habit I would need to immerse myself, under in-person instruction.And so here I am, near Arundel in West Sussex, at a large, rambling country house with lush gardens, on a weekend vedic retreat run by Beeja. Its strapline suggests: Meditation for Everyone and its founder, Will Williams, has been teaching vedic meditation for more than five years. After a stint in the music business, and falling ill, he recovered through meditation – and began to teach what he had learned. He runs introductory courses in London. Will is a convincing communicator: Hoxton-bearded and smiley, dressed not in robes but in Edwin jeans, conspicuously one of us.There are 15 in attendance, eight women, seven men, ranging from 24 to 70. We’re a cosmopolitan bunch: there’s a Saudi, a Lebanese, one from Guadalupe, another from South Korea. Two from Essex. Some, like me, have medical issues, others are struggling with anxiety, depression and such pronounced social media addiction that handing over phones upon arrival proves problematic. I’m to share a dorm for four but – mercifully – there’s just two of us this weekend. After an introductory dinner of nut loaf, Will’s co-instructor, Niamh Keane, reminds us of the house rules: up at 6.45am, in bed by 10.30pm; respect one another’s confidentiality. No sex and no “solo sex”, as Niamh puts it, just unbroken serenity and purity of mind. We’re detoxing, so can have neither caffeine nor alcohol. No breakfast either, a fact that horrifies us all initially but becomes curiously unimportant by day two.On a meditation retreat I find you meditate, and do precious little else. Beeja’s version comprises a succession of “rounding” exercises: 15 minutes of yoga, five minutes of alternate nostril breathing, 20 of meditation, and 10 of the flat-on-your-back yoga pose, shavasana. We’re all given an individual secret mantra to repeat silently (though who’s to say we don’t have the same one?!). For three days.At first, most of us choose to do our exercises communally, in the living room, but increasingly we drift off in pursuit of solitude. I thought I’d struggle, because meditating at home is difficult, but here, with no distractions, I slide into it as if it were a hot bath. Hours pass, then hours more.Respite comes in the evenings, after simple vegetarian food (rice and dhal, Thai soup), when Will sits, Buddha-like, with us at his feet while he shares his vedic-derived wisdom. He’s a practitioner of many years and is so convinced of his discipline’s ability to heal the world that he can tend towards the over-prescriptive. He condemns most diets in favour of an ayurvedic-approved one, and proffers opinion on antidepressants, climate change, and Trump voters. He tells us that the introduction of 5G will kill off the insect world, that we should never cross our legs, and how we must avoid eating onions because the skin contains properties that promote selfishness. Much of what he says is fascinating, plenty else sails far above our heads.He asks how our sessions are going and when I tell him that during one of mine my hands began to levitate and my fingers grew like intertwining tree branches, as if I were morphing into a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, he beams with pleasure and says: “You’ve shifted some serious energy there, fella.”The more we meditate, the more our protective bubble expands. When we come to leave, Niamh implores we take care upon re-entering the world outside, as we will be newly hypersensitive to light, noise, other people. “Be gentle with yourselves,” she advises.The trip back home is complicated by the usual travel chaos – delays, overcrowding – but we endure it without any obvious adverse effect on our hitherto delicate dispositions. But then meditation affects different people differently and any long-term benefits may only announce themselves over time. What I know right now is that I’ve never had a weekend quite like it, never been so still, or rested, never spent so much time with myself, or by myself.It wasn’t quite bliss, but I did attain something conspicuously rare in a life otherwise filled with such perpetual distraction: peace.• Four-day, three-night weekend retreats cost from £594 for a twin room, £534 for a dorm room, and include food, drink and instruction; six-monthly payment options available, beejameditation.comNick Duerden’s memoir, Get Well Soon: Adventures in Alternative Healthcare, is out now (Bloomsbury, £12.99).

City breaks with kids: Edinburgh,"There’s a great family trip to be had exploring Edinburgh’s museums, beaches and parks, while an underground tour brings spooky moments, too",,2019-10-22T06:30:54+0100,"We love to stand on the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle and wait for the one o’clock canon to fire. It always makes us jump, even though we know it’s coming, but there are just such wonderful views across the city, and to the sea beyond, from here.To get a different perspective on this fascinating city, go from high to low, and head underground. The Real Mary King’s Close (adult £16.50, 5-15s £9.95, family 2+2 £43.50) offers a journey under the streets to a preserved 17th-century street, courtesy of costumed storytellers and with plenty of spooky moments. It’s fun for all but the youngest children.We are huge Harry Potter fans in our house and have had great adventures exploring a city closely associated with the author JK Rowling, who wrote the books here. Visit Greyfriars Kirkyard and see names on graves that inspired some of her characters; peep through the gates to the imposing 17th-century school Heriot’s (or is it Hogwarts?); walk the colourful, curving, cobbled Diagon Alley-like Victoria Street, and find the wonderful Ahaha joke shop. It’s been a firm favourite of our family for a couple of generations, with its giant pair of glasses and false nose across the shopfront. Inside is a wonderful collection of pocket-money friendly toys.With its free admission, the National Museum of Scotland is a gem for all ages. It’s packed with exhibits and a good spot to wait out a rainstorm or escape the crowds. The energy wheel is just like a giant hamster wheel and kids love the challenge of running around it to turn the lights on, before collapsing in a heap of giggles. The Planet Adventure area is perfect for younger children, with dinosaur-bone excavating, hands-on exhibits and dressing-up outfits.Edinburgh also has wonderful beaches, in the city itself and along the coast. Portobello beach is a sandy two-mile stretch, a wonderful place for kids to run and play. Cafes on its promenade allow you to sit and watch your kids as they build sandcastles and you enjoy coffee and homemade cakes, with a view over to Fife. We love Miro’s and The Beach House and, on the High Street, Bross Bagels is great for picnic essentials, including Montreal-style bagels. It’s always busy with children and dogs along the front, and there is also a playground, and a large softplay area if it rains. There is also a huge community of year-round sea swimmers.Cramond Island is an uninhabited island in the Firth of Forth connected to the mainland via a causeway when the tide is low. We love the walk over; there are always crabs to pick up, sometimes starfish, and loads of seabirds. The walk takes longer than you might imagine and isn’t suitable for buggies, though. If you are lucky you may spot dolphins, whales or seals from here. Cramond also has a long beach with a promenade that’s perfect for scooters and bikes, while the Boardwalk Beach Club is a fun refuelling pitstop – with tables made of surfboards.Edinburgh has a superb network of cycle paths on the old railway lines that once criss-crossed the city, providing miles of traffic-free, tree-lined pathways that are particularly good for those with younger children. You can get around most of Edinburgh on them and there are playgrounds and food pitstops along the way, notably brunch at Milk at the Sculpture Workshop .A climb up Arthur’s Seat is a good hike for children. Though it’s a bit of a scramble towards the top the views are worth it. This extinct volcano is in Holyrood Park, an untamed 263-hectare park in the midst of the city, with the ruins of St Anthony’s Chapel to explore, a loch with swans to feed, trails and hikes all around.The Botanic Gardens are a good spot for walking with buggies, playing hide and seek and exploring. There are little bridges over streams where you can play pooh sticks, plus an amazing rock garden with a waterfall, Victorian greenhouses, squirrels and kingfishers to spot. Our favourite is the Queen Mother’s Memorial Garden, with its little maze, perfect for playing tag with little ones, and a pavilion decorated inside with seashells and pine cones.Just outside the city, within Dalkeith country park, is the Fort Douglas adventure playground, with ziplines, tunnels across the River Esk, fortresses and slides (from £5 for 5-12s). Next to the fort are the old stables, which now feature two restaurants and a shop.For a sprinkle of magic, we love the Archerfield Walled Garden trail around the woods leading to beautiful fairy houses hidden in the trees, with teeny, tiny ladders, windows and doors, and houses made from teapots or old shoes. The attention to detail is amazing. You can buy a vial of fairy dust to sprinkle and a ribbon to tie on the wishing tree for £1 and run around and play hide and seek in the the willow structures on the way back. Entry is free.Edinburgh has a huge selection of independent cafes and restaurants. Our neighbourhood favourite is Herringbone, in Goldenacre. It’s a laid-back bistro with varied menus and great kids’ options. For superb fish and chips with a view across the harbour to the three bridges try The Fishmarket at Newhaven Harbour – there will always be a queue but it’s worth the wait. The Scran and Scallie in Stockbridge is Michelin-starred chef Tom Kitchin’s gastropub and it has a kids’ play area and mini versions of the adult meals. Mary’s Milk Bar on the Grassmarket is the place to go for gelato and has funky stools and a bar made from old milk bottles. Sugar Daddy’s Bakery is a good place for anyone with allergies, with a delectable selection of gluten-free cakes, sandwiches and soups; most are also dairy- and soy-free. Beetroot Sauvage is a plant-based cafe with a children’s play corner and delicious vegan food.B+B Edinburgh (family rooms from £69 a night) is a boutique property near the West End with large bedrooms, a library with board games, and it’s also pet friendly.

"A local’s guide to Ljubljana, Slovenia: top 10 tips","In one of Europe’s greenest cities, visitors stroll pedestrianised streets or hop into electric taxis to discover modernist and medieval architecture, fantastic food and microbreweries",,2019-10-21T06:30:19+0100,"Though it’s modest by modern standards (13 storeys and 70 metres tall), Nebotičnik was the first “skyscraper” in Yugoslavia, and the ninth-tallest building in Europe when it opened in 1933. Architect Vladimir Šubic was inspired by the art deco skyscrapers of New York, though more conservative residents dismissed it as a “freak”. Today, the wraparound rooftop terrace cafe offers impressive views of the Alps to the north and Ljubljana Castle, just a few blocks away. Access is via a lobby clad in black marble and a spiral staircase. At the top, you can enjoy Slovenian wines – try Rebula, a buttery white, still or sparkling.Ljubljana is no stranger to topiaried beards and artful tattoos, and you can explore its alternative side by strolling down Trubarjeva ulica, where Trubarjeva Antikvariat sells pieces of Yugo-nostalgia, such as busts and portraits of Tito, or industrial-design classics like the sleek, Lamborghini-red ETA 85 rotary telephone designed in 1979 by Davorin Savnik and made by Iskra. Reminiscent of a race car, this phone was produced in the millions and was a staple on the walls of Yugoslav homes – today one is on display at New York’s Museum of Modern Art.For clubbing, the Metelkova district is graffiti-laden but entirely safe and welcoming. Once a complex of barracks for the Austro-Hungarian and, later, Yugoslav armies, it is now home to bars, nightclubs and a former prison-turned-hostel. Its new life began as a squatters’ settlement on 25 June 1991, the day Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia. In 2005, Metelkova became part of a national cultural heritage list, but it remains on the edge of the law – raising its own funds, largely through concerts – and is the best place to go for friendly, alternative nightlife.JB, a restaurant on the ground floor of a Plečnik building (see below) that resembles a modernised Greek temple, has been the epitome of fine dining in the region since the 1990s. World renowned chef Janez Bratovž was the first to introduce dishes such as fish carpaccio and rare steak to a culinary culture that was used to well-done cutlets in cream sauce. Not long ago, he served his signature ravioli with pistachio, chestnut, pear and foie gras to Ferran Adrià and the pope (though not at the same event). Michelin does not yet have a guide to Slovenia, though it’s rumoured to be in the pipeline – and JB will surely be up for a star. It is reasonably priced for a restaurant of that level: the six-course fish or meat menu is €60 and the vegetarian version €50; the 12-course tasting menu is €95.• jb-slo.comOn Fridays from March until the end of October, the central market features a huge outdoor food fair called Odprta Kuhna (Open Kitchen), which can draw as many as 25,000 people. Founded by Israeli expat Lior Kochavy, it is the best way to sample a wide variety of specialities, as dozens of restaurants, from fancy to down-home, set up stands and offer food truck-style dishes. This is where you can try JB’s take on a burger made with dry-aged brisket (€6); a pulled duck and red cabbage sandwich – a street twist on a popular St Martin’s Day meal; and šmorn, an Austro-Hungarian shredded pancake topped with compôte (€3). For the most Slovenian of snacks, try Klobasarna, behind the cathedral, which offers only Carniolian sausage, a geographically protected local pork sausage served with a pot of mustard and a warm roll (half €3.50, whole €5.90). This is probably the only speciality sausage to have been consumed in space, as an American astronaut with Slovenian roots, Sunita Williams, took some to the International Space Station.In November 2018, Kanye West tweeted to his 29 million followers about a rather obscure Slovenian modernist architect called Jože Plečnik (1872-1957). Kanye and architectural historians agree on Plečnik’s brilliance, and Ljubljana is the place to see his work. In the decades following a devastating earthquake in 1895, Plečnik was commissioned to rebuild most of the important structures and spaces in the city. These included the National and University Library, the central market, the embankment of the Ljubljanica River, the main outdoor concert venue, the city cemetery, several parks and the football stadium, which he modelled on ancient Greek amphitheatres, lined with Doric columns and sunk into the earth, so fans step down into a roiling cauldron of cheers to find their seats. Take a guided tour or do one yourself, beginning at his ivy-clad home, which is now a museum, Plečnikova Hiša. A stroll past Plečnik buildings will take you through the most interesting spots in the city, crisscrossing the river via its many bridges, from the Cobblers’ Bridge, lined with columns that support nothing, to the Triple Bridge, based on Venice’s Rialto but with three separate bridges at slight angles to one another (one for pedestrians, one for cyclists, one for cars, and with one of the first public toilets in Europe hidden underneath). And on to the Dragon Bridge, the most photographed site in the city, with plinths on its four corners crowned with bronze, bat-winged dragons.A stroll through Tržnice, the central market, designed by Plečnik, should begin at Marjetka’s sauerkraut stand. She’s the only sauerkraut seller with a queue, and locals will tell you that it’s because her family is among the last in the country to cultivate indigenous Ljubljana cabbage, which makes the best sauerkraut. You can also pick up a bottle of – wait for it –sauerkraut juice, which is good for stomach complaints, and is also surprisingly refreshing. Follow the gently curved colonnade to visit stalls featuring pumpkinseed oil, made from an indigenous pumpkin type, Styriaca, that’s good in salads and even vanilla ice-cream. A section of the market is dedicated to slippers, which Slovenians wear at all times indoors (and pupils do at school) – these make for a good, lightweight souvenir. The most surreal detail of the market may be the vending machines selling grave candles in jewel-coloured plastic candle holders that are traditionally placed on tombs. Ljubljana was crowned Green Capital of Europe in 2016, and the city prides itself on its “zero waste” recycling programme and the highest percentage of pedestrianised streets of any capital in Europe. Enjoy this by strolling the cobbled, medieval Stari Trg and Gornji Trg, in the shadow of the castle, and looping along the riverbank, unencumbered by traffic. If you need a ride in the centre, what looks like a green golf cart, the Kavalir electric taxi, will shuttle you about for free. There is also Urban, a miniature electric train on wheels that snakes through the streets with zero emissions.Ljubljana has joined the speciality coffee revolution, with the best cup in town served by a Colombian expat architect named Alex. His pocket-sized cafe, Črno Zrno, is less than two metres wide, a corridor leading to an elevated bar lined with arabesque tiles, where Alex greets guests and prepares each coffee himself. The best cakes I’ve ever had are from Zvezda, a sweetshop with several locations and a window full of baked goods that sparkle like gemstones. The Slovenian specialities include kremšnita (millefeuille) and gibanica (layer cake with poppy seeds, walnut, curd cheese and apples), but my favourite is the čokoladne sanje, or “chocolate dream” (€4).My adopted hometown of Kamnik, just 30 minutes north and a gateway to the Alps, boasts three castles and, according to Atlas Obscura, is “a candidate for microbrew capital of the world”. Brewers are drawn to the town by its pristine water. The local pub, Pod Skalo, with old tin Yugoslav signs and a motorcycle mounted on the wall, has them all: Mali Grad, Maister, Barut, Meninc, Mister and Lampelj. Beside Kamnik is an elaborate botanical garden, Arboretum, once the grounds of a Versailles-inspired mansion destroyed by the partisans after the second world war. It’s a particular hit with children, with a playground area featuring lifesize moving dinosaur statues, an enormous maze and an array of ziplines, slides and trampolines. A few minutes beyond is the otherworldly Velika Planina, a mountain plateau that visitors describe as something out of Lord of the Rings, and where you can taste a local speciality, the pear-shaped trnič cheese.Where to stayLjubljana abounds with boutique hotels, but the classic is the Secessionist-style Grand Hotel Union in the centre (doubles from£83). For backpackers or younger travellers there’s the uber-hip Celica Hostel (beds from €24), a converted prison in Metelkova. Or Samostan Mekinje, a medieval monastery in Kamnik, is a 40-minute train ride from Ljubljana centre and has beds from €15.When to visitIn recent years Ljubljana has become overcrowded in the summer, so aim for any time other than high season – May and September are particularly lovely.Average pricesA half-litre glass of beer costs around €2; an espresso coffee is around €1.20; a three-course meal is €20 to €30.Getting thereLondon to Ljubljana by train takes 18 to 23 hours.

Green and pleasant land: readers on six of the best places to visit in England,"Lonely Planet has named England the second best country in the world for travel in 2020. Here, readers suggest a few of their favourite destinations",Lucy Campbell,2019-10-23T07:00:48+0100,"The timeless treasures of England’s natural and cultural heritage have an enduring appeal for travellers from far and wide. In a Lonely Planet list, England was named the second-best tourist destination in the world to visit in 2020, after Bhutan, earning its rank through “topicality, unique experiences and wow factor”. Here are some of our readers’ favourite undiscovered spots.The beautiful 20-hectacre estate, nestled in the Weald, boasts a plethora of woodland and renowned gardens, as well as an orchard, a nuttery and a moat, making it perfect for rambling and wildlife- watching all year round.Whether you are a walker or a cyclist, you will find solace in this valley, tucked away in the Forest of Bowland (itself a designated area of outstanding beauty) – a dramatic, remote landscape of heather moorland, farms and quiet lanes. Known for fine local produce and breathtaking scenery, Bowland makes for a wild rural retreat and is only a stone’s throw from Preston and Lancaster.Tucked between Falmouth and the Lizard peninsula, the scenic estuary is ideal for bird watching, spotting marine life and enjoying aquatic activities such as sailing, kayaking and snorkelling. There are shoreline villages brimming with pubs and quiet gardens, while the secluded beaches and wooded inland creeks can also be explored by boat.Charles I is thought to have called the view from Bridgnorth the finest in the kingdom. Split in two by the River Severn, residents are transported from High Town to Low Town by the Cliff Railway, the oldest and steepest inland electrical funicular in England. The ruins of Bridgnorth Castle lean at an angle of 15 degrees – four times the lean of the leaning tower of Pisa.The 18th-century landscape garden, wildflower meadows and working vineyard scratch the surface of what Painshill has to offer. Throw a Turkish tent, a crystal grotto, a gothic tower and the stunning Serpentine lake into the mix and you have a gorgeous day out.The quaint, historic market town on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales makes a great base for exploring the unspoiled surrounding countryside. Highlights include ancient monuments such as the triple-arched Devil’s Bridge and the famous Ruskin’s View, immortalised by JMW Turner."
'The perfect combination of art and science': mourning the end of paper maps,"Digital maps might be more practical in the 21st century, but the long tradition of cartography is magical",Jeff Sparrow,2019-10-19T20:00:40+0100,"“Some for one purpose and some for another liketh, loveth, getteth, and useth Mappes, Chartes, & Geographicall Globes.”So explained John Dee, the occult philosopher of the Tudor era.The mystical Dr Dee would, perhaps, have understood the passion stirred by Geosciences Australia’s recent decision to stop producing or selling paper versions of its topographic maps in December, citing dwindling demand.As someone who loves the #outdoors & loves his maps, I'm devastated to hear that hard copy topographic maps will become a thing of the past.https://t.co/LIy3XjwBbh😞 pic.twitter.com/Wd9V0kPI4IIn the 21st century, digital files might be more practical, particularly for a cash-strapped federal government agency.But not everyone loveth and getteth their maps for purely practical reasons.Just ask Brendan Whyte. He’s a curator at the National Library of Australia, responsible for acquiring a copy of every map published in Australia, as well as managing a collection of perhaps a million or so charts and about the same number of aerial photographs.A geographer by training, he knows that some people don’t appreciate electronic cartography.“One of the problems, with the development of GIS [geographic information systems] and everyone making their own maps is that people just dump their data without thinking about the aesthetics or what the map is trying to tell a reader.”A map, he says, needs beauty so that users want to look at it and absorb what it contains.But that’s less about particular platforms, whether digital or otherwise, than the cartographer’s skill.Whyte gives, as an example of what can be done with data, Minard’s famous map of Napoleon’s Russian campaign, on which a band represents both the progress and the extent of the Grande Armée juxtaposed against temperatures in 1812 and 1813, so that the viewer necessarily imagines the privations of a disintegrating army throughout a terrible Russian winter.Whyte also admires the artistry of the Marshall Island stick charts from the NLA’s own collection. It’s believed to be from the early 1970s.“They’re thin pieces of coconut wood put together in a sort of lattice like a cat’s cradle and wherever there was an atoll they’d lash on [a] little cowrie shell to represent that island. The bits of coconut wood represent the routes, the wave patterns, the winds, the currents. So they’re not a geographical representation like a modern map, but more how a navigator might get from one island to another via the sea route in a canoe with a big sail.”His favourite catalogued item might also be one of the smallest, an atlas from Queen Mary’s dollhouse.“A lot of publishing companies and authors produced real books for her dollhouse. The famous map shop and publishers Stanfords made her the Atlas of the British Empire, reducing it to about two inches high.”At the State Library of Victoria, the librarian Sarah Ryan also nominates an atlas – albeit a rather bigger one – as a particularly treasured item.“It’s known as the first modern day atlas, even though it was produced in 1572: Ortelius’s Mirror of the World. The printing of that volume is beautiful and the maps are very colourful, and you’ve got lots of iconography like sea monsters and ships and compass roses.”She agrees that, while digital maps can be more convenient, a lot of people still prefer paper, particularly for recreational uses. Ultimately, though, it’s relationships that matter.“What pulls you to maps,” she says, “is that connection with people and place and culture.”By way of example, she talks of looking at the SLV’s Atlas of Paris from 1739, just after her own first trip to the city.“I’d visited all those places, so that has a strong connection to me.”Maps, of course, also document territorial claims.The catalogue describes the SLV’s rarest map as coming “from the survey of Mr Wedge and others”.The attribution sounds innocuous until you identify the surveyor as the John Wedge who accompanied John Batman on his expedition across Bass Strait.The yellowing paper thus signals the plans for a township in Port Phillip – and the beginning of Indigenous dispossession.Yet, if maps represent power, they can also show change.It’s a point made by Kay Dancey, the CartoGIS Services Manager at the College of Asia and the Pacific at the Australian National University.A cartographer by training, Dancey provides data visualisation for ANU researchers, as well as managing a collection of hardcopy and digital maps. Her holdings feature items dating back to the 17th century, and include 18th-century works by the French hydrographer and philosopher Jacques-Nicolas Bellin.“The sheer craft of how they produced these maps … They’re invariably copper engravings, and there’s such skill required in this process. And then there’s the beauty: the fabulous colours and cartouches that they employ.”But, when asked to describe a favoured map, she nominates something very different.“There’s a lovely map here,” she says, “a wall map of Africa from the 1950s. It’s one of my favourites because it has hand made corrections to the country name Zaire or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as it is now. I particularly love that because it has been in this mapping unit for 60 years and these hand annotations have been by made by cartographers over that time. So it’s a gorgeous link back to the people who have worked as cartographers at the ANU, a reminder of changing sovereignties and what a map is: a snapshot of time and an abstraction of place.”In that spirit, she notes the real innovations of digital technology making both data and mapping platforms more widely available, and thus facilitating what she calls “a democratising phase of cartography”.The maps of Adam Mattinson provide an obvious example.By day, Mattinson works as a geospatial analyst for an engineering firm. In his own time, he uses his cartographic training to represent the local landscape in strange and fantastical forms.In one project, he depicts a Melbourne constructed on Port Phillip as it looked in the Ice Age; in another work in progress, he imagines the city after massive rises in sea levels.In the book How to Lie with Maps, Mark Monmonier notes what he calls “the cartographic paradox”. To present complex information from a three-dimensional world clearly in two-dimensional format, the surveyor must abstract and distort.In other words, as Monmonier says, “to present a useful and truthful picture, an accurate map must tell white lies.”Mattinson’s work takes that idea to its logical conclusion.He’s probably best known for his Tolkienesque depiction of the Yarra Ranges, in which The Patch looks almost like Hobbiton and the warning “Puffing Billy Roams this Area” appears alongside a depiction of a dragon.“It’s covering an area in which I grew up,” he says. “To me, the landscape there really lends itself to a Middle Earth kind of quality.”As a child, Mattinson used to open the street directory at a random page and then trace his finger to find his way home.“I think that’s where the passion for maps springs for a lot of kids. They look at a map and they see that the world is bigger than they had thought.”Though he works with digital platforms, he loves how physical maps encourage people to gather and discuss the landscape.“It really is a perfect combination of art and science, cartography. To have something that’s beautiful to look at but also an object you can look at and think, ‘Oh, I used to live near here’ or ‘I want to go there’ and so on. It’s part of the beauty of mapping, the shared experience.”A kind of magic, as John Dee understood."

"England’s 2,800-mile Coast Path to open in 2020","When the England Coast Path opens four years from now, it will cover the country’s entire seashore and be one of the world’s longest walking routes. Alan Franks walks a 25-mile stretch in Norfolk",Alan Franks,2016-04-02T07:00:01+0100,"For a small country like Britain, the idea of claiming one of the longest footpaths in the world sounds a little ambitious. But that’s what we’re up to with the creation of the England Coast Path, and the proposed completion date of 2020 is not too far away. The route will go all the way round the English coast, and a quick look at the map of this island nation, with its countless inlets, estuaries and jagged bits, shows that the projected total length of 2,795 miles is not as outlandish as it sounds.It’s already possible to walk round the whole of the south-west peninsula, from Minehead in Somerset to Poole in Dorset, on the 630-mile South West Coast Path. This accounts for roughly a quarter of that target. There are also footpaths along substantial stretches of the coasts of Sussex, Kent, Essex, Lincolnshire and Northumbria.Then there is the East Anglian rump of Suffolk and Norfolk. For a walker prepared to shuttle between the backs of beaches and the low tops of crumbling cliffs, this is perhaps the most dramatic of England’s hinterlands. The sea and the land have been fighting it out for ever, with thriving medieval ports like Dunwich in Suffolk now beaten back to a handful of streets. The remnants of the original Roman settlement are now more than a mile out beneath the waves.The stretches of English coastline that do not yet have pedestrian rights of access are in various stages of negotiation involving landowners, user groups and other interested parties on the one hand, and the government’s advisory agency, Natural England, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the other. There are 66 such stretches, overseen by eight teams. In each case, the process takes about three years and it finds England in its most meticulous vein of local democracy: intense consultation, on-path meetings, reports, period for objections and examination by independent DEFRA-appointed inspector. Finally, after another six to nine months for work on ground issues such as silage and drainage, the process produces a Commencement Order.One stretch that is already up and running – or walking – is the 25-mile section between Sea Palling and Weybourne, which is part of the established Norfolk Coast path, one of England’s 15 National Trails (the South West Coast Path being the longest).To come this way is to find yourself right on the frontline of the elemental war. In the Norfolk village of Happisburgh, four miles north of Sea Palling, people joke grimly that Beach Road is now more beach than road. Around here I’ve heard stories of householders having to pay for the removal of their collapsed homes; of insurance companies withdrawing cover; of sea-dredging being to blame for the currents ripping into the soft shore with extra force; of the tidal defences at Bacton gas terminal having a similar effect.When I first came here, more than 20 years ago, I slept in a B&B from which I could hear the sea thudding, almost as if it was in the next room. This time I made sure to head a few crucial yards inland, to the Hill House pub in the village centre. My bedroom here is a converted signal box for the never-completed extension to the Great Eastern Railway.One man in the village reckoned that if the sea comes just a couple of feet higher than in previous winter storms, it could spill over the lip of the dunes and flood all the low-lying ground between here and Norwich, nearly 20 miles inland.Alarmist? Possibly, but then this coast is still awash with memories of the great floods of 1953, in which more than 300 people lost their lives. It may have been a different England – a post-war, monochrome place with Churchill still in Downing Street and the young Queen yet to be crowned in the wake of her father’s death – but the resonances are fearsomely topical. Infrastructure was trashed, bridges swept away, 160,000 acres of land washed out of production and £1.2bn of damage in today’s money. A train pulling out of Hunstanton was lifted clean off the rails by a following wave, and further south a miracle baby floated to safety in her cot.The echoes of that disaster are almost audible along these massive sand fringes, the human responses defiantly, hopefully visible in the groynes taking the battle out into the water and the revetments doing their best to shore up the flaky little rearguard cliffs.It’s easy to see why Natural England thinks the 2020 coastal path project is an idea whose time has come. Sally Fishwick, senior adviser for coast path delivery, points out that in Trimmingham, north Norfolk, a people-counter recorded 2,036 walkers on a newly opened stretch of path in the spring of 2014. In the same period last year, the number had risen to 3,097.To be on foot here is to court a slow hypnosis. Walcott, Broomholm, Paston (where the medieval family of that name wrote their famous letters), Mundesley (popular with Victorian holiday-makers), Sidestrand, Overstrand … The places pass by on their low ledges as the route leans to the left round the long shoulder of this embattled land. In the gaps between the towns and villages it has as strong a sense of Empty Quarter (the desert in the Arabian peninsual) as anywhere in the country.Then, some 12 miles from my Happisburgh starting point, a bigger protrusion comes into view. From a distance it could be an enormous breakwater, until the unmistakable contours of an English seaside pier, with a theatre on the end of it, harden through the sea air. This is Cromer, jewel of the north Norfolk coast, where the crabs come from and the OAPs’ charabancs go to. I stayed at the Hotel de Paris where, although in my sixties, I felt like a boy.The last eight miles to Weybourne follows the relatively built-up shoreline via Sheringham, with its excellent crab restaurants, its throwback Little Theatre, its restored steam railway line to Holt and the indispensable Coasthopper bus plying the route. After all the beaches of the day before, the shallow slopes as I look inland seem to have acquired the grandeur of Himalayan foothills."
"Nigel Slater’s roast tomatoes, whipped cheese and samphire recipe",An unusual hot-and-cold take on a piquant herby classic,Nigel Slater,2019-10-22T12:00:59+0100,"Put 1kg of assorted tomatoes into a roasting tin, tuck in 6 sprigs of thyme, season with black pepper and trickle over 5 tbsp of olive oil. Roast at 200C/gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft and their skins lightly browned in places.Finely chop 2 tbsp of tarragon leaves and the same of basil. Mash 150g of goat’s cheese with a fork and then stir in 100g of crème fraîche. Add the chopped herbs and a little pepper then chill until needed.When the tomatoes are ready, remove them from the oven and transfer to a serving plate. Toss 100g of samphire into the tomato roasting juices in the tin then add next to the tomatoes on the serving plate. Spoon the herbed cheese into a small bowl then serve with pieces of crusty white baguette to soak up the juices. Enough for 2.To get the full sweet, sharp and smoky flavour of the tomatoes, roast them until their skins start to blacken here and there. Serve them hot, straight from the oven to contrast with the chilled whipped cheese.The tomatoes can be replaced by aubergines. Cut them into large cubes, then add to the roasting tin with the thyme and olive oil and bake for a good half hour or so, turning them as they burnish and soften. Season with a sprinkling of za’atar, fresh mint and serve with the whipped cheese and samphire.Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater"
A South African shepherd's pie: Thomasina Miers' family recipe for bobotie,"An intriguing recipe handed down by Tommi’s mischievous nanna Mimi – a sort of South African, spicy version of shepherd’s pie called bobotie ",Thomasina Miers,2019-10-21T12:00:25+0100,"My maternal grandmother was known for being a tiddlywinks demon, having the naughtiest twinkle in her eye and, whenever she went home to South Africa, for disappearing into the bush to hang out with Zulu tribespeople – the people with whom she seemed to feel most at home. Her stories of her time there were always captivating, and of the recipes she made that were both homely and exotic, this was one of the best.Don’t be put off by the long list of ingredients – this is essentially a South African shepherd’s pie, only easier, with some lovely spicing thrown in.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 6-8Butter, for greasing4 tbsp olive oil3 onions, peeled and choppedSalt and black pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped2 bay leaves1½ tsp mustard seeds2 tsp curry powder½ tsp chilli flakes1 tsp turmeric1 ½ tsp garam masala1kg beef or lamb mince100ml red-wine or cider vinegar100g flaked almonds120g raisins50g fresh breadcrumbs75g fruit chutney (I like Tracklements’ Country Garden Chutney)For the topping3 eggs500ml whole milk3 bay leavesGrease a large baking dish and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. Warm a large, wide casserole pot over a medium heat and, when hot, add three tablespoons of oil.Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and sweat for 10 minutes, until soft. Stir in the garlic, bay leaves and spices and cook for another three to four minutes, until fragrant. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. When hot, season the meat with salt and pepper, and brown in the pan in two or three batches, breaking up the meat with a spoon and cooking until caramelised and dark. Once all the meat is browned, return the onion mixture to the pan and add the vinegar, almonds and raisins.Turn the heat down to low and simmer for five minutes, to allow the flavours to mingle. Take off the heat, stir in the breadcrumbs and chutney and check the seasoning. Transfer to the baking dish, smooth over with the back of a spoon and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes.To make the topping, beat together the eggs and milk and pour over the meat. Scatter over the bay leaves, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden and the custard just set. This is delicious served with brown rice and some greens.Leftover flaked almonds make the best biscuits. I love florentines, or you could mix them with honey and a little butter for a crunchy topping for shortbread. Leftover bobotie makes a killer filling for a jacket potato, so don’t eat it all at once."
Bitter-sweet memories: Rachel Roddy's recipe for marmalade cake,Hand-me-down recipes come inseparably steeped in memories – such as this recipe for marmalade cake from an old friend that became etched into the family biography,Rachel Roddy,2019-10-21T12:00:28+0100,"The other day I opened a book to find a sentence, and a bit of paper fell out. As the square piece of block pad glided to the floor like a dead moth, I recognised it as a recipe for a ring cake written out for me not long after coming to Italy, about 14 years ago. I remember making the recipe several times, before using it as a bookmark that was left at page 76. What I don’t remember or recognise is whose neat writing it is.My memory lapse is frustrating. Sharing a recipe is an open-handed act, one made even more tangible if the person sharing has taken the time physically to write it out, maybe with notes, which is a small labour in these copy-and-photograph times.Even if the recipe given is never made, I want to remember where the Post-It lemon pudding or back-of-envelope braised chicken came from. And if the recipe becomes part of my cooking life, it is no different from a recipe from a book or famous chef: it absolutely must have that person attached to it, like a name tag sewn into a collar. Then, every time the recipe is made, the person and your relationship to them, whatever it was, is remembered. Even if it means you have to relive a tired exchange about authenticity, or be reminded that Mario subsequently left his wife for his secretary, recipes have names: Mario’s red-wine risotto; my elegant neighbour Vera’s creme caramel; Lise from Bavaria’s liver and apple.Shared name-tagged recipes are also a way of marking time. Years ago, I organised my mum’s loose recipes, gluing the loose-leaf pages and lips of envelopes into a book and noting where and who they came from. The book is now a sort of collective biography of our family – a strained one.Freda Coleman was a neighbour in the late 1970s, and her marmalade cake marks the margarine years. It was, and is, an ideal cake for a family with congenital marmalade dependency: a rich pound batter into which you stir orange marmalade, which bakes into a bitter-sweet cake. The icing is as good as the cake, which you zig- zag over the top where it then sets into a hard lattice that can be pulled off, although hopefully not from the entire cake as once happened.Part of the pleasure of a cake is the smell as it bakes: marmalade bakes into an almost toffee-like sweetness, and hopefully a bit of peel at the bottom of the cake catches and the smell of that, like dark treacle, assaults your senses.Recipes are only recipes, but they can become fixed points in our lives around which other things move: with them, we can measure time, places, people. Freda’s cake – now our family cake – is one such recipe. If I could only remember the name of the person who gave me the recipe that fell out of the book, that would have a name tag too. Until then, it is just a ring cake. Both cakes are good, but the marmalade triumphs for its amber chunks of peel and icing which, because cake is 50% pleasure, 50% habit, I still want to pull off before eating a slice.This is a cake of four equal parts, plus marmalade (thick-cut or thin, you decide). It is a preference based on habit, but a loaf tin (lined with parchment) seems the best tin for this cake.Prep 10 minCook 40 minMakes 1 loaf110g margarine or butter, at room temp110g sugar2 medium eggs110g self-raising flour4 heaped tbsp marmalade50g icing sugarHot waterBeat together the butter and sugar until soft and creamy. Beat in the eggs, followed by the flour, before stirring in three tablespoons of marmalade.Scape the mixture into a loaf tin lined with parchment. Bake at 170C (150C)/335F/gas 3 for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is puffed up and cracked, and a strand of spaghetti comes out clean.Leave to cool for 30 minutes, then lift the cake from the tin.To make the glaze, loosen the remaining tablespoon of marmalade with a little hot water, then brush the cake.Make a thick icing by mixing the icing sugar with just a little water, and zig-zag it over the cake, letting it dribble down the sides."

Nigel Slater’s autumn recipes to take time over,"Spiced rice and pumpkin, comforting beef rib and potato, raspberry mille-feuille: layered recipes, contrasting autumn flavours",,2019-10-21T08:00:41+0100,"I am on the brink of lighting the first fire of the year. In fact, by the time you read this, I shall probably have done so. And with the cooler weather comes a different type of eating. Slower and (slightly) more complex, the sort of cooking that keep us a little longer in the kitchen but also at the table. Food to linger over.Lasagne aside, the most famous of layered recipes is probably biryani, where meat and rice is pressed down in a pot with onions and spices and often enclosed in a pastry crust. To say it’s a lot of work is an understatement. It is one those dishes I tend to leave to restaurant cooks.A somewhat simpler version can be made without meat, and without the pastry crust. I did a version this week, layering saffron rice with mashed pumpkin and spiced onions that took a good hour, but without the inevitable fuss of the classic.Serves 4onions 2 mediumgroundnut oil 4 tbspginger 60gchilli flakes 1 tsppumpkin 1.5kgwhite basmati rice 300gsaffron 2 pinchesgreen cardamom pods 12peppercorns 8bay leaves 4cinnamon 1 stickbeetroot 200gPeel and roughly chop the onions. Warm 3 tablespoons of the oil in a deep pan then add the onions and cook over a low to moderate heat. Grate the ginger and stir into the onions with the chilli flakes, and let them continue cooking until the onions are soft and golden brown – a good 25 minutes.Peel the pumpkin, cut into large pieces, then steam for 15 minutes till soft. Drain and mash with a vegetable masher or fork. Stir in black pepper and a little salt.Wash the rice in warm water: put the rice in a large bowl with plenty of warm water, stir the rice around in the water with your hand, pour off the cloudy water, then repeat twice until the water is almost clear. Drain the rice, put in a medium-sized saucepan with enough water to cover by 3cm. Add the saffron and whole cardamom pods, peppercorns, bay leaves and cinnamon stick, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the water simmers, then cover tightly with a lid. Leave to cook for 10 minutes.Remove the rice from the heat and leave to rest without removing the lid. Coarsely grate the beetroot and set aside. Lift the lid from the rice and stir briefly with a fork to separate the grains.Now assemble the dish. Pour the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the dish then add one third of the rice followed by a third of the pumpkin. Scatter a third of the onions over the pumpkin then half of the beetroot. Now continue layering until all the rice, pumpkin, onion and beetroot is finished.Bake for an hour at 200C/gas mark 6.Crab and avocado is a comfortable marriage, needing only something crisp to press all my bells at once. (I often serve carta di musica with mashed avocado and white crab meat.) I sometimes dice cucumber finely and fold it into the avocado cream too. A layer of crunch amid the smooth green cream and flakes of seafood.You can make a modern version of the seafood cocktail by layering mashed avocado, cucumber and crab meat – I use both the brick-red brown meat and the snowy needles of sweet white flesh. It can look beautiful in a wine glass, especially when the layers are put together loosely rather than tightly packed. A squeeze of lime wouldn’t go amiss and I like to put in some coriander too, a herb very much at home with both crab and avocado.Serves 4avocados 3 ripelime juice 4 tbsp red chilli 1 large cucumber ½white crab meat 250gbrown crab meat 250gcoriander leaves 3 tbsp, choppedPeel and stone the avocados, then put the flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Squeeze in the lime juice. Halve, seed and finely chop the chilli then add to the avocado and process it all to a smooth, pale green paste.Peel the cucumber, core with a teaspoon and discard the seeds, then cut first into thick strips then into small cubes and fold into the avocado cream.Check the white and brown crab meat for any remaining shell, then fork the chopped coriander through the white meat.Loosely layer the avocado and white and brown crab meats in four glasses or small dishes, chill for half an hour and serve.The first time I met the mixture of filo, spinach and feta was aboard a ferry bound for the Greek islands circa 1980 and I have loved it ever since. For all its cellophane wrapper and dubious age, I wolfed my flaky pastry parcel gratefully and have used the combination in tarts, salads and little pies ever since. (Try brushing a sheet of filo with melted butter then sprinkling it with sea salt and dried thyme. Bake till crisp, then shatter the cooked pastry and scatter over a salad of spinach leaves and feta.)This time, a roll-up of chilli-flecked spinach and melted cheese baked inside the filo. The rolled layers of vegetables, cheese and pastry formed a simple lunch with a salad of tomato, black olive and basil.Serves 6spinach 600gdill 30gfeta 400gmozzarella 375gdried chilli flakes 2-3 tspbutter 105gfilo pastry 6 sheets (about 250g)nigella seeds 2 tsppoppy seeds 2 tspsesame seeds 2 tspSet the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Wash the spinach, then, with the leaves still wet, place it in a large saucepan over a moderate heat. Cover tightly with a lid and let the leaves cook in their own steam for a minute or two till wilted. Tip them into a colander and squeeze out any moisture.Roughly chop the spinach and the dill and mix them together. Coarsely grate the feta and mozzarella into the spinach and dill, then season with black pepper and the chilli flakes. Melt the butter in a small pan.Place a sheet of filo on a work surface or chopping board. Brush generously with some of the melted butter. Place a second sheet on top, butter it, then repeat with a third sheet. With the longest edge towards you, shape half of the filling in a long sausage, along the nearest edge.Roll the pastry away from you, covering the filling and forming a long cylinder. Transfer to a baking tin.Now repeat with the remaining three sheets of pastry and the remaining filling. Place the second roll close to the first. Brush with the last of the butter then sprinkle with the nigella, poppy and sesame seeds.Bake for about 20 minutes till the pastry is pale gold, then serve immediately.It was the first properly cold morning of autumn when we set about making this deeply comforting dish. Layers of potato and cheap, bone-in meat for a night when the chestnut leaves are piling up in the lane outside the house. The hands-on cooking time here is minimal, involving little more than the slicing of onions and Maris Pipers, but the unattended cooking time, when the recipe gets on with things itself, is a good two hours. The dish is all the better for that, the flavours deepen and the separate elements – the meat, stock and potatoes – become, deliciously, as one.During the layering of meat and potatoes I like to tuck in the stripped rib bones, and in so doing extracting every last bit of goodness and savour from them. On the side, a crisp white cabbage salad, perhaps (olive oil, white wine vinegar, dill), and some bread with which to sponge up the herb-stippled juices.Serves 6 beef short ribs 1.4kgolive oil 4 tbsponions 3 mediumthyme 8 sprigsrosemary 4 bushy sprigsbay leaves 4black peppercorns 8beef stock 2 litreslarge potatoes 1kgCut the beef into ribs. Warm the oil in a large, deep-sided pan, then brown the ribs all over, taking care as they may spit and pop. Turn the ribs over with kitchen tongs as they colour, removing them to a plate when their fat is golden.Peel and thinly slice the onions then put them into the pan in which you have just browned the beef, adding the thyme, rosemary, bay and peppercorns, and lower the heat to moderate. Let the onions cook, giving them the occasional stir, for about 20 minutes, until they are soft and light gold.Return the beef ribs to the pan, together with any juices from the plate, then pour over the beef stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the liquid quietly putters, partially cover with a lid, and leave for 1 hour or until the meat can easily be cut from the bones.Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Remove the ribs from the pan and pull the meat from the bones. Slice the potatoes thinly, using a mandoline if you have one, a large cook’s knife if not. In a large, shallow baking dish or roasting tin, layer the potatoes and the meat and onions, seasoning each layer as you go with salt and black pepper, then pour over the stock from the pan.Bake for an hour to 90 minutes, until the potatoes are soft and giving.As much as I like the idea of the classic layered mille-feuille I feel it only works when the pastry is very dark, thin and crisp and the filling involves a few sharp fruits to contrast the soft, billowing blandness of the cream. Raspberries, blackberries and blackcurrants then, rather than peaches and strawberries. You can go further with the contrasting textures by adding crushed brittle or almond or pistachio praline to the whipped cream. The cream is best when beaten until only just thick enough to spread.Serves 8caster sugar 125gshelled pistachios 125gpuff pastry 320gdouble cream 500mlraspberries 250gTo decorateicing sugar 3 tbspraspberries 125gYou will need a small, lightly oiled baking sheet and two large baking sheets, one of which is lined with baking parchment.Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 8. Put the sugar in a non-stick shallow pan over a low to moderate heat. Watch very carefully as it melts, then, when it is golden, add the shelled pistachios. As the sugar darkens to a deep bronze, tip the mixture out onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and leave to cool.Roll out the pastry to a rectangle measuring 28cm x 33cm. Transfer to the baking sheet lined with baking parchment. Place a second sheet of parchment on top, then cover with the second large baking sheet. Place a heavy roasting tin on top then bake for 15-20 minutes.Remove the roasting tin, baking sheet and top layer of parchment, then continue to bake for a further five minutes or until the pastry is deep golden brown and very crisp.Break the pistachio brittle into large pieces and reduce to coarse crystals using a food processor. If you prefer, pound the brittle to crumbs with a pestle and mortar.Whip the cream until thick. Crush the raspberries with a fork and fold them into the cream together with three quarters of the crushed nut brittle. Cut the pastry in half lengthways and trim the edges, crushing the trimmings to crumbs with a knife.Place one of the two sheets of pastry on a serving dish or board. Spoon the cream, fruit and nut filling on top, smooth the surface flat pushing the cream right to the edge of the pastry, then cover with the second piece of pastry. Press down lightly on the cake with your hands or a baking sheet to settle the layers of cream and pastry.Smooth the edges flat with a palette knife, then cover the sides with the reserved pastry crumbs, pushing them in with the knife.To decorate, mix the reserved brittle with the icing sugar, then scatter over the top of the cake. Place the remaining raspberries along the top and serve.@NigelSlater"
OFM Awards 2019: Best producer – Jess’s Ladies Organic Milk,"The judging panel’s choice for this award, Jess Vaughan, makes dairy products that fly off the shelves at farm shops. Her secret? A small herd of happy, well-cared-for cows, aka the ‘ladies’",Amy Fleming,2019-10-22T08:01:11+0100,"It’s like the milk I remember drinking as a child,” is what Jess Vaughan’s customers tell her when they inevitably come back for more. In an industry that views milk as a cheap and homogenous commodity, sloshing down the motorways in vast tankers, Vaughan has blazed a trail in turning the output of her British Friesians and Brown Swiss into cult ingredients. As well as the milk, her cream, yogurt and kefir are revered for their rich, untampered flavours. Vaughan’s secret? “A small herd of happy cows,” she says, but there’s more to it than that.As the third generation of her family to run Hardwicke Farm, near Gloucester, Vaughan knows the land and her ladies (as she affectionately calls the herd) intimately. Many of them are descended from the first three cows her grandparents began farming with in 1955: Bluebird, Gypsy and Glow-Worm. Alongside her father, Mike, with help on bottling days from sister Sophie, and milking assistance from a newly recruited cowman, she controls the journey of her products from udder to bottle.Much of the flavour of the milk is governed by the grass itself, Vaughan tells me as she practically vaults over a five-bar gate to introduce me to the 75-strong herd. “Lots of people outside agriculture think that grass just grows, but you do treat it as a crop,” she says. The farm gained organic certification in 1999 and the land, from the grass and clovers for chomping to the soil beneath them, benefits from “a full organic cycle”. Fields are rotated, with some reserved for red clover which is fermented as silage for winter feed.The ladies themselves appear to be living the bucolic dream; grazing and rearing their calves amid jaw-dropping views of the Cotswolds and the spire of Gloucester cathedral rising in the distance. “A few of them are on their summer holidays,” she says, “taking three months to just chill out round the farm.” All the calves are kept with their mums until they’re fully weaned, she says. “We had about six arrive in the last two weeks.” She points out Roo, just 12 days old and growing well. Once the males are weaned, they’re bought by a nearby farmer friend to rear for meat, and will never face stressful cattle markets.There’s nothing intimidating about walking among this friendly herd of ruminating beasts, lolloping about as proprietorially as pets. Tigger, so-called because of her unusual stripes, is still going strong at 16 years old whereas, on average, says Vaughan, “dairy cows don’t often get much beyond five. Our average is 15, but then they’re not pushed in their production.” They don’t have their first calf until they’re three and a half – a good year later than standard practice.Vaughan grew up on the farm, only leaving briefly to study agriculture and animal science at Aberystwyth University. When she returned in 2002, she recalls, “the organic market was flat on the floor”. The family had no choice but to sell their organic milk into “conventional supply at about 15p a litre, which was not sustainable”. Her dream for the family to bottle and sell their milk direct to the public was perhaps their only hope of being able to stay afloat.“In 2006 we set about converting the shed on the farm to a bottling plant,” she says. Much like the bijou milking parlour, the bottling production line is so dinky that you could imagine Wallace and Gromit operating it. “It’s semi-automatic but it’s also semi-chaos,” she says. The raw milk is first gently pasteurised, but at a lower temperature and for less time than regular milk. It isn’t homogenised, which is when fat molecules are broken down so the cream can’t separate – a process that prolongs shelf life but destroys flavour.You do get very attached to the cows because you have them as long as a family dog, and you’re with them every dayTheir whole milk, which they call breakfast milk, flies off the weekly stall at nearby Stroud Farmers’ Market, its taste as good as identical to that of its raw state. The creamy yogurt contains no added sugar or stabilisers, and the kefir comes in both “skinny” and full-fat versions. Chefs love Jess’s Ladies’ cream not only for its taste but its viscosity and tendency not to split in cooking. “We used to supply the Fat Duck and lots of famous restaurants, but it was just getting it there,” says Jess.While the products are currently mostly sold at farm shops and Co-ops in the south-west and Midlands (where they plan to introduce refillable glass bottles), new distributors have now made nationwide shipping possible, starting with overnight kefir deliveries, ordered online.As we talk, we pass a pair of cows nuzzling each other. “They love each other,” says Vaughan. “There’s research showing that cows can’t remember any more than eight individuals, so in big herds you’ll find little pods of cows who know each other.” Next we pass an old girl of 18. “You do get very attached to them because you have them as long as a family dog, and you’re with them every day,” she says. Vaughn feels no need to capitalise on her success and scale up: “We don’t want to risk dumbing down what we already do.” And besides, she adds, “We’ve got plenty enough milk to be doing what we want.”Hardwicke Farm, Glos, GL2 3QE; theladiesorganicmilk.co.uk"
From coconut curry to hoppel poppel: Yotam Ottolenghi’s family recipes,"A diverse heritage has led to Yotam’s eclectic toolkit of international hand-me-down recipes, from Germany via the American Midwest to Malaysia",Yotam Ottolenghi,2019-10-19T09:30:22+0100,"The food legacy handed down to me by my parents is probably best embodied by hoppel poppel, a leftovers dish featuring potato, onion, sausage and egg, all mixed together into a glorious hodgepodge. It’s a kind-of bubble and squeak, and comes from my mother’s German heritage but, with pork sausage at its core, it couldn’t be more distasteful to the two other cultures that dominated my early years in Israel: Jewish and Arabic.It also didn’t work at all for my father, a proud Italian and a master of refined understatement in the kitchen. The beauty of today, though, is that I get to choose my childhood favourites from a whole range of formidable and delicious traditions.This soup is a speciality of my father’s. It uses the tiniest amount of potato to thicken the base while still keeping the soup light and fresh. My dad would buy in pickles to garnish his, but I’ve made my own quick one here. You can go either way.Prep 20 minChill 1 hr-plusCook 30 minServes 4 as a light lunch2 cucumbers, 1 sliced into ¼cm-thick rounds, the other roughly choppedSalt and black pepper2½ tbsp white-wine vinegar1½ tsp caster sugar1 medium (130g) maris piper potato, peeled and cut into 1½cm cubes2 leeks, cleaned, trimmed and roughly chopped (250g net weight)350g Greek-style yoghurt80g ice cubes20g roughly chopped parsley2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed3 tbsp olive oilIn a medium bowl, toss the sliced cucumber with a teaspoon and a half of salt, then tip into a colander and set it back over the bowl. Leave to sit for 20 minutes, to draw out as much liquid as possible, then push down gently on the cucumber and transfer to a clean bowl; discard the salty liquid. Add the vinegar and sugar, toss to mix, then leave to pickle for 30 minutes while you get on with the soup.Put the potato and 700ml water in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once it’s simmering, add the leeks and cook for eight minutes, or until the vegetables have softened. Drain and leave to cool for 15 minutes.Transfer the leeks and potatoes to a blender, add the yoghurt, ice, parsley, garlic, two tablespoons of olive oil, 100ml water, all the chopped cucumber, 150g of the pickled cucumber and a tablespoon and a half of its pickling liquid, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, then blend until very smooth. Transfer to the fridge to chill for about an hour, or longer if you want to get ahead.To serve, divide between four bowls, top with the remaining pickled cucumber (discarding its liquid) and drizzle with the last tablespoon of oil.My mother made this, a Berliner dish that became very popular in the American midwest, with leftover cooked potatoes. The meat element can be sausage (any sausage, really) or bacon, and she’d serve it with a tomato and cucumber salad dressed with lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic. Prep 20 minCook 30 minServes 48 large eggs2 tbsp double cream5g chives, cut into 1cm lengths, plus 1 tbsp extra to garnishSalt and black pepper40g unsalted butter2 tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled, halved and cut into ¼cm-thick slices250g cooked waxy potatoes (eg, charlottes), peeled and cut into roughly 2cm cubes200g frankfurters, cut at a slight angle into ½cm-thick slices1 green pepper, stem, pith and seeds removed, cut into roughly 1½cm cubes (130g net weight)80g mozzarella block (ie, low-moisture mozzarella), roughly gratedIn a bowl, beat the eggs, cream, chives, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper and set aside.Melt 30g of the butter with all the oil in a large, nonstick saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry the onion, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned – about six minutes. Add the potato and frankfurters, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and fry, again stirring occasionally, until everything is starting to brown and crisp up – another five or so minutes. Stir in the green pepper and cook, shaking the pan often, until it softens and everything is nicely coloured – about seven minutes.Turn down the heat to medium, add the last 10g butter and swirl the pan to melt. Pour in the egg mix, sprinkle on the cheese and cook for about three minutes, gently folding over the mixture here and there with a spatula, though without mixing everything completely together. Sprinkle over the extra chives and serve directly from the pan.My mum’s favourite cookbook was Myra Waldo’s The Complete Round-The-World Cookbook from 1954. It would take her to all corners of the globe, and we were her guinea pigs. This sweet, coconutty dish became her favourite, and ours, too. It’s not one bit authentic, but it is addictive. Serve with plain or sticky rice. Prep 30 minCook 1 hr 30 minServes 4100g fresh coconut, finely grated50g piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped6 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped20g fresh turmeric, peeled and roughly chopped (or ½ tsp ground turmeric)1 red chilli, roughly chopped, seeds, pith and all2 tsp ground star anise1 tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar2½ tbsp sunflower oil1 onion, peeled and finely chopped (150g net weight)1kg boneless and skinless chicken thighs, each cut into 4 piecesSalt and black pepper1-2 limes – zest grated, to get 1 tbsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp2½ tbsp plum (or apricot) jam 130ml full-fat coconut milk, plus 1 tbsp extra to serve2 tbsp coriander leaves, pickedPut a large saute pan for which you have a lid on a medium heat and, once hot, dry-fry the grated coconut, stirring often, for about 20 minutes, or until golden. Tip into a bowl, and set aside one tablespoon to garnish.Meanwhile, put the ginger, garlic, turmeric, chilli, star anise, coriander seeds and three tablespoons of water in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz to a coarse paste, scraping down the sides a few times as you go.Heat the oil in the same saute pan on a medium-high flame and, once hot, fry the onion, stirring now and then, until softened and lightly browned – about seven minutes. Add the spice paste and cook for another two minutes, until fragrant. Add the chicken, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is no longer pink on the outside – another seven minutes or so – then stir in the lime zest, jam, coconut milk, 120ml water and the toasted coconut. Bring the mix up to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover the pan and leave to cook for 40 minutes. Remove the lid, turn up the heat to medium and cook, stirring now and then, for seven minutes more, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick and rich. Stir in the lime juice.Transfer to a shallow serving platter and drizzle with the extra coconut milk. Sprinkle with the reserved toasted coconut and the coriander leaves, and serve warm.

Nonna's kitchen secrets: authentic fresh pasta recipes from the Pasta Grannies,Learn the art of homemade fresh pasta from those who’ve spent a lifetime making it to perfection with these rustic Italian recipes,,2019-10-19T07:00:41+0100,"Prep 45 minRest 35 minServes 1100g 00 or plain flour1 x 55g egg without its shell (if your eggs are on the small side, add water or another yolk to bring it up to the right weight, if needed)Tip the flour on to a board and use your fingers to make a well in the centre, making sure it’s not too wide nor the rim too low. Pour the egg into the welland scramble together with a fork – they are mixed sufficiently when you lift the fork and you have a homogeneous, non-clumpy looking liquid that falls smoothly from your fork. Draw a fork round the inside of the flour wall, so a small quantity of flour falls into the egg mixture. Whisk it in, smooshing any lumps, so you gradually create a batter. Repeat until you have a mixture that won’t run all over the board, then cave in the flour walls and mix in the rest of the flour with a bench scraper by scraping the flour inwards and over the batter.Mop up any flour with your dough and give it a quick knead. If it is sticky, add a tablespoon of flour and knead again. Knead the dough for 10 minutes minimum: it should feel soft and pillowy. Think of your hands as waves: the heels of your hands push the dough away from you while your fingers pull it back. Once the dough becomes a log, turn it 90 degrees, fold it in half and continue kneading. You want to work at a brisk pace, as air is the enemy of decent pasta – it will dry it out. If the pasta feels too dry, dampen your hands with water to put moisture back into the dough. Your dough should feel silky and smooth. Put the dough in a lidded bowl, cover it to stop it from drying out, and leave the dough at room temperature for 30 minutes (or in the fridge overnight – but bring back to room temperature before you try rolling).Cup your hands over a rolling pin so your wrists nearly touch the pasta board, and flatten the dough with a pin, turning it a few degrees at a time. When it is the size of a plate, start with your hands at hip width and roll the top third of your dough (furthest away from you) by following the curve of the circle and drawing your hands inwards as you push the pin away from you. Your hands will meet in the middle. Stop the pin before it reaches the very edge. Roll the dough four times, turn the pasta from 12 o’clock to 1 o’clock and repeat, going round the clock. To get rid of the bump of pasta in the middle, flip the outer edge of pasta over the pin, hold the pasta with one hand, and put the other hand on the dough to stop it moving. Give the pin a tug with the pasta hand to create a snug fit around the pin. Roll the dough over the pin towards you. Move your hands wider, stick your elbows out and, pressing down, roll the pasta out two or three times.This will flatten the thicker central zone of your pasta. Finish with the pasta rolled up and turn it 90 degrees, opening it out across the board. Repeat this process until the sfoglia (the pasta sheet) is too large to move comfortably by hand. At this stage, you will need to Roll it up around the pin and turn it, as described above. Allow your pin to roll on its own across the dough to remove any air after you have turned it.To check it’s evenly rolled, roll up a third, hold the edges (it will fall off the pin otherwise) and hold it up to the light. Darker patches mean thicker dough and that you haven’t rolled it uniformly, so you will want to go back over these areas. Leave your pasta sheet to dry on the board for five minutes.Prep 1 hr 15 minCook 5 minMakes 32 cestini (enough for 4, as a starter)For the pasta300g 00 flour or plain (all-purpose) flour3 eggsFor the filling250g ricotta, drained weight70g grated Parmigiano ReggianoZest of 1 unwaxed large lemonTo serve30g butter2 tsp ground cinnamonMake the egg pasta as described above. Roll it out to about 1mm thick, so you can see the board beneath it. Cut into 7cm squares – Monica has a special roller to do this, but you can use a ruler and a pastry cutter.Combine all the ingredients to make the filling. Dot a teaspoon of the ricotta mixture into the centre of each square. Gather the four points together and firmly press the adjoining edges together to create four seams. Repeat until you have used all your filling.Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle canter of a simmer and lower the cestini into it with a small sieve or slotted spoon. Cook for three to four minutes.While they are cooking, melt the butter in a small pan. When the cestini are ready, don’t drain them, but scoop them out with a sieve or slotted spoon and plate them up with a couple of spoonfuls of melted butter and a dusting of cinnamon. Allow about eight per person.Prep 1 hr 15 minRest 1 hrCook 10 minServes 4For the pasta400g 00 flour or plain flour4 eggsFor the dressing4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled3 tbsp chopped fresh mint (preferably nepitella)500g fresh porcini, wild, girolle or chanterelle mushrooms, choppedSaltMake the egg pasta dough as described above. Once it has rested for 30 minutes, roll it out to the thickness of shortcrust pastry – aim for 2-3mm thick. Roll it up around your pin while you make the dressing.Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan. Add the garlic and mint, and fry for a couple of minutes before adding the chopped mushrooms. Keep frying to soften the mushrooms, season with a pinch of salt, and add 100ml water. Let this cook off, then continue frying the mushrooms until they are golden.Remove the garlic. Boil a large saucepan of water, salt it, and return it to the boil. Keeping the pasta rolled around your rolling pin, hold the pin above and near the water (don’t burn yourself in the steam). Pull pieces off and drop them in the water. For those of you who don’t want to brandish your rolling pin, simply tear off pasta strips/squares/odd shapes roughly the size of a credit card and then dump them into the boiling water.Cook for two to three minutes, depending on the thickness of your pasta pieces.Drain and add the pasta to the mushroom mixture. Give everything a good stir, toss together and serve.Prep 1 hrRest 35 minCook 25 minServes 4For the pasta300g farro flour (if you can’t find any, use spelt flour)100g 00 flour or plain flour, plus extra for rolling4 eggsFor the pancetta2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil4 thick rashers pancetta, sliced into matchsticks1 onion, peeled and diced1 red chilli, deseeded (or not if you like it fiery)125ml glass white wine400g tin chopped tomatoes (or fresh if it is the height of summer)Salt25g grated pecorino romano, plus extra to serveMake the egg pasta dough as above, and leave your pasta sheet to dry while you make the sauce. Heat the oil in a saute pan, add the pancetta and fry briskly, until the fat has been released from the meat and it’s starting to colour. Remove the pancetta from the pan, leaving the fat behind, and put it to one side.Add the onion and chilli to the pan and fry over a medium heat for seven minutes, or until the onion is soft. Deglaze the pan with the wine and keep frying while the alcohol evaporates. The steam from the pan should cease to smell winey. Add the tomatoes and pancetta, and give everything a good stir. Season with a pinch of salt. Let it bubble away while you slice your pasta.Smooth your sfoglia (pasta sheet) with a little 00 flour. Roll the pasta up like a carpet and, using a cleaver or straight-bladed knife, slice across as thinly as possible to create fine ribbons. Unroll the ribbons and toss them with your hands to give them a good airing. Keep the ribbons apart to stop them from sticking.Bring a pan of salted water to a spirited boil, and heap your pasta into the water. The tagliolini will cook quickly, in about two minutes.Remove the chilli from the sauce. Scoop the pasta out of the pan with a slotted spoon or sieve and ladle it into the sauce. Add the grated pecorino romano, toss and serve immediately, sprinkling with more cheese if you wish.Prep/rest 2 hr 5 minCook 45 minServes 6For the pasta200g 00 or plain flour200g finely ground semolina flour, plus extra for sprinkling4 eggs, plus 1 egg yolkFor the fillingCoarse sea salt1 large pumpkin, peel on, cut into 6 large chunks, seeds removed¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg100g parmigiano reggiano, grated, plus extra to serveSalt and black pepperTo serve120g butter1 handful fresh sage leaves, tornMake the egg pasta dough as above, and leave your pasta sheet to dry while you make the sauce above and let it rest. Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/gas 3. Weigh out 1kg of pumpkin and keep the rest for another dish. Cover a baking tray with a layer of sea salt, put the pumpkin pieces on the tray and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the flesh is soft. Cool, then remove the peel from the pulp. Mash the pumpkin, then stir in the nutmeg and parmigiano reggiano. Make sure the cheese is thoroughly mixed in and season well. Set aside while you make the pasta.Roll out the dough to 1mm thick – you should be able to see your hand through it. Use a pastry cutter or knife to cut 7cm squares. Put a teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each pasta square. To make a cappellaccio, fold the pasta over the filling to make a triangle. Hold one of the smaller corners between your finger and thumb and bring the opposite corner around your forefinger so the two corners meet and create the hat. Make sure the edges are firmly pressed together. Put each one on a tray covered with a cloth and sprinkle with semolina.Bring a large pan of salted water to a rolling boil. In another large pan, melt the butter over a gentle heat and add the sage leaves, allowing them to crisp up.Once the pan of water has reached a simmer, drop in the cappellacci and cook for about four minutes, before tasting one for doneness. Continue to cook for another minute or so if necessary. Drain the pasta carefully, add it to the butter and sage pan and continue to cook for another minute.To serve, gently scoop the pasta into six bowls, dividing the buttery sauce equally between them. Scatter over extra freshly grated parmigiano reggiano and serve.• Recipes from Pasta Grannies: The Secrets of Italy’s Best Home Cooks by Vicky Bennison (Hardie Grant, £20)"
Liam Charles' recipe for coconut bread pudding – direct from his nan's kitchen,"Nan’s always right, and as ever she gets it spot-on with this coconut-infused bread pudding",Liam Charles,2019-10-19T11:00:25+0100,"I bake and my nan cooks. Well, I cook as well, but you know what I mean. I have to admit, there have been a few times when Nan has stepped on my territory, the baking world.Did she succeed? Of course she did – with this bread pudding. And this is why she bossed it: it’s super simple, tasty and has a few twists here and there (she added coconut to it!).

Meera Sodha’s family recipe for vegan Gujarati tomato curry,From western India via Uganda comes this vegan curry made irresistable when topped with crunchy fried noodles known as sev,Meera Sodha,2019-10-19T10:00:26+0100,"This is an ancient Gujarati dish from the Kathiyawad peninsula, where my ancestors are from. This recipe was carried by my great grandfather in the 1940s when he set sail for Uganda with his big ambitions and his sev sancha (a little machine that’s used to make chickpea flour noodles).The recipe travelled again decades later, in 1972, with my grandparents when they left Uganda for Britain. It was passed on to me by my mother last year, and now it’s yours for safekeeping.The recipe has stayed the same; it’s only the cook and the times that have changed.You might think that tomatoes are out of season, but the Isle of Wight’s Tomato Stall still supplies much of the UK for another few weeks yet.The sev – super-thin, fried chickpea noodles often called “nylon” sev – can easily be bought here in the UK: try the world food or ethnic aisles at bigger supermarkets, your local Indian grocer or online. Eat this with another vegetable curry (such as my potato and spinach curry), rice and/or chapatis.Prep 10 minCook 15 minServes 4 as part of a main meal3 tbsp rapeseed oil ¾ tsp mustard seeds 1 big pinch fenugreek seeds 5 fat garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1kg mixed tomatoes, quarteredSalt1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder1 tsp ground coriander ¾ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp tomato puree30-50g nylon sevFresh coriander, shredded, to serveIn a large frying pan for which you have a lid, heat the oil over a medium heat until it’s shimmering hot. Add the mustard and fenugreek seeds, leave them to pop for a minute, then add the minced garlic. Stir until the garlic is golden and getting sticky in the pan – this will take a minute, possibly two – then add the tomatoes and a big pinch of salt. Stir to combine, then cover the pan and leave everything to cook on a high heat for five minutes – it should be bubbling fiercely. Add the chilli, ground coriander, cumin, turmeric, tomato puree and a couple of tablespoons of water, if need be to loosen the mixture, cover again and cook for a further two minutes.Taste and adjust the salt or chilli, if you wish, then distribute the curry across four bowls and add a small handful of sev and a sprinkle of coriander to each. Serve as part of a meal with freshly steamed basmati rice and/or chapatis.

How to turn onion skins into an on-trend ingredient,You may not be dyeing your underpants with onion skins any time soon – though you could – but this onion skin ash adds a smoky flavour to all sorts of dishes,Tom Hunt,2019-10-19T06:00:30+0100,"My first job in a commercial kitchen was with a veteran hotel chef called John. He knew all the tricks, but also when to do things properly. Each Sunday, we made stock in a vast pot that would simmer on the stove, full of bones, trotters, herb stalks and onion skins. Once ready, it was reduced to a thick gravy and used as a base for many of our sauces.Traditional recipes such as that stock are one way to reduce our waste, but we can also do so in other ways. Babs Behan, my friend and author of Botanical Inks, taught me how to upcycle onion skins into a fabric dye that imparts a surprisingly intense bronze colour. To make your own, weigh some natural fabric (silk works well), then collect and weigh out half its weight in onion skins (ie, 200g cloth will need 100g skins). Simmer the skins for 30 minutes in enough water to let them move about freely, then leave to cool. Add the cloth and soak for one to three weeks, until it has a good depth of colour. Rinse in lukewarm water, wash with a PH-neutral soap, rinse again, then hang to air-dry out of direct sunlight.Much more recently than my youthful stock-making days, I was taught by my friend and chef Justin Horne at Sativa restaurant in west London to make onion skin ash. He uses it as an avant-garde seasoning for dishes containing onions, to add smokiness, and as a bitter twist for some of his desserts. This idea might seem barmy, but ash has always been part of cooking. Even now, it is a common ingredient in many products, from ash-rind cheese and preserved herring in Europe to Pokot ash yoghurt in Kenya. There is, however, inconclusive scientific evidence about the health/side-effects of ash, so use it sparingly, just as it is in those traditional foods. That said, there is no doubt that cooking with ash is a fun way to turn an otherwise waste product into a striking ingredient that can give a contemporary look to your food. Add a pinch to aïoli to give it a smoky flavour and intriguing grey colour, or simply finish a dish with a pinch, much as you would salt, to add a bitter, contrasting flavour and appearance.Roast at least a handful of onion skins at 230C (210C fan)/475F/gas 8 for 30-40 minutes, or until blackened and completely charred (cook them alongside something else, ideally, to make full use of the oven). Grind to a powder, and use sparingly to add pow to all kinds of dishes."
Welsh cakes and bara brith: Anna Jones’ family recipes,"A distinctly Celtic flavour to the hand-me-down recipes of Anna’s family, with a teatime treat of Welsh cakes and fruit cake – or bara brith ",Anna Jones,2019-10-18T12:00:54+0100,"Some families have a wealth of handed-down recipes, carefully written into notebooks with welcome splatters and curling corners. My family does not. My dad is one of 12 brothers and sisters, so my nan (or, “mam”) didn’t have time to go to the corner shop, let alone write down a recipe.On my mum’s Irish, Catholic side, there was just my grandma, and while she and my mum both loved food, their life in a bedsit on a budget meant neither of them were keen cooks. So my food inheritance was simple Sunday roasts, egg and chips, and the odd treat: chocolate bars, fruit pies and – the favourite – Welsh cakes. Another treat was always a slice of fruit cake, which even as a kid I loved. This bara brith comes from my husband’s mum, Sian, but I’ve taken a few liberties with the recipes to update them with flavours I now love. Recipes to me are like a food tapestry, with new threads being added as the old ones fray.Traditionally, these are made with raisins and a little bit of nutmeg. You could stick to these flavours if you like, but I love them with a hit of citrus, sour cherries and vanilla. They are best eaten warm, and can be heated for a couple of minutes in an oven, pan or even in the toaster.Prep 20 minCook 25 minMakes around 20350g plain flour2 tsp baking powder175g unsalted butter or dairy-free spreadSea salt115g golden caster sugar, plus extra for dusting100g sour cherries1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out, or 1 tsp vanilla bean pasteZest of 1 unwaxed lemonZest of 1 unwaxed lime1 egg, beaten2-3 tbsp milkSift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Use your fingertips to rub in the butter or dairy-free spread until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then mix in the salt, sugar, sour cherries, vanilla and citrus zests. Mix in the beaten egg and two tablespoons of the milk, then bring together with your hands to form a firm dough. If it seems a bit dry, add another tablespoon of milk.Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out the dough to about 1cm thick. Use a 6cm round cutter to stamp out circles, bringing the dough back together and recutting until it has all been used up.Heat a large, heavy frying pan or flat griddle over a low heat (no need to add any oil) and cook the Welsh cakes five at a time. This should give you plenty of room to flip them over and will ensure they cook evenly. Cook for about two to three minutes each side, until deep golden.Cool the cakes on a wire rack, and dust with caster sugar and a little salt. Eat warm on the day you make them, either on their own or with butter and jam.Bara brith translates from Welsh as “speckled bread”, which I find adorable. I use Earl Grey in this recipe, because that’s the tea I like to drink, but you can use whatever black tea you like. If you’re using a less strong tea, such as Earl Grey, brew it using two teabags. Traditionally, raisins, currants and sultanas are used in bara brith, but I like to mix in dates, dried apricots and sour cherries, too. Basically, a mixture of whatever I have.Prep 20 minSoak 1 hrCook 1 hr 30 minMakes 1 x 2lb/900glarge loaf250ml strong, hot tea (I use Earl Grey)450g dried fruit (sultanas, currants, raisins, chopped dates, chopped apricots)1 organic egg, beatenZest of 1 unwaxed lemon200g dark brown sugar1 tsp baking powder200g plain wholemeal flourHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/ gas 4. Make your tea nice and strong, and let it brew for a few minutes longer than you would a cup of tea. Put the dried fruit in a large bowl, pour over the tea and leave it to soak for at least an hour – you can leave it overnight, if you like, but I find an hour is long enough.Mix the egg into the soaked fruit (reserving any remaining soaking liquid for later) and add the lemon zest: if you have soaked the fruit overnight, the liquid should be soaked up, so just add the zest.Mix the sugar, baking powder and flour in a bowl with a whisk to break up any clumps, then mix this into the fruit and eggs.

How do I make fish soup the way the French make it?,"There’s no quick answer to making a proper soupe de poissons, unfortunately, and – surprise, surprise – much of the jarred stuff isn’t genuine",Bob Granleese,2019-10-11T12:00:15+0100,"I love jarred soupe de poissons, but it’s hard to find in the UK. I’d like an easy recipe, because all the ones I’ve tried are very complicated.Peter, Chippenham, WiltshireAh, fish soup … along with onions on strings, La Marseillaise and gilets jaunes, there’s little that’s more evocative of la belle France. The thing is, though, many of those alluringly branded supermarché jars aren’t true soupes de poissons at all, but mass-produced imposters. As Henry Harris, one of the UK’s most respected purveyors of Gallic cuisine, explains: “The real deal should be a murky broth of immense flavour, not claggy and rusty-red.” In other words, the dense texture of some jarred soups isn’t a sign of superior contents; it’s culinary subterfuge. “They’re thickened with cornflour,” Harris says, “which makes a gloop you can stand a spoon up in.”As with all fish cookery, the principal raw ingredient is all-important. “You need spanking-fresh fish, or it’s really not worth bothering with,” argues Harris, who heads the kitchens of the Harcourt Inns group of restaurant-pubs in London, with French-leaning menus inspired by his 35-odd years at the stove.But what fish exactly? Claude Bosi, chef/patron of two-Michelin-starred Bibendum in London, insists it has to be rockfish; being irreparably French, he adds that “it must come from the Med”. Sadly, we don’t get much rascasse and sea perch on UK fish counters, so go for red gurnard and, if your pocket can stretch to it, red mullet, and bulk up the fishy quota with cheaper bream. Mind you, Harris says, gurnard alone works just fine: “The key is whole, cleaned fish, not fillets. The bones are what give the soup body and flavour.”It’s not at all complicated to make, either, Bosi adds: “You don’t need lots of ingredients, but it is time-consuming.” His top tip? Don’t cut corners or you won’t get the depth you’re after. Harris agrees: “The idea’s the same as with stock – the aim is to extract as much flavour as possible.”The other ingredients are simply regular soup veg – for each 1kg fish, you need an onion, a carrot, two celery sticks, four garlic cloves, a fennel bulb for that trademark aniseedy back note, all chopped – plus thyme, bay, tomato puree and a nip of saffron. Fry the fish in olive oil, and I mean really fry it, because if you don’t get some colour on it now, your soup will end up paler than Macauley Culkin after a two-day bender. Bosi takes it even further: “Fry it until it starts to break down.”Bosi now adds the raw soup veg, while Harris browns it separately first. Fry some more, then stir in tomato puree before adding any liquid. Bosi opts for a litre of fish stock, but Harris turns the dial right up by adding a third of a bottle of red wine and reducing by half, repeats that with a can of tomatoes, and only then adds stock, his preference being for chicken. Season generously – “now’s not the time to be shy,” Bosi orders – then cook gently for up to an hour and a half.Bosi and Harris are adamant that the soup must now be passed first through a food mill, then through a sieve and, ideally, again through muslin – see what they mean by time-consuming? – and never, ever blend it, both chefs warn, because that blitzes the fish skeletons into tiny bone fragments, which give the soup “a deeply unpleasant, gritty texture”, Harris explains. “Ignore anyone who tells you otherwise, professional or not. That includes John Wayne – yes, that John Wayne – who fancied himself so much in the kitchen that he wrote a couple of cookbooks.” Where soupe de poissons is concerned, at least, blending is cowboy behaviour of the very worst kind.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

OFM Awards 2019: Best cheap eats – 288 Bar & Wok,"He was a lawyer, she was a teacher. Then they decided to open a noodle bar in Cheltenham. Fifteen years later, it’s still going strong – and OFM readers love it",Killian Fox,2019-10-22T08:01:09+0100,"“You’ve got young families and pensioners, people driving BMWs and people who’ve come on the bus, all sitting at one table. It doesn’t have to be a special occasion: our prices are low enough that everybody can afford a starter, a main course and a drink. We want people to eat well and go home happy.”Pak Wai Hung is outlining the egalitarian vision behind 288 Bar & Wok in Cheltenham, which he opened with his wife Jody in 2005. It’s a Chinese noodle bar on the high street with communal tables and laminated menus offering crab claws, honey-roast spare ribs plus vast bowls of their house noodles, filled with char sui, shrimp and chicken. Nothing on the menu costs more than £10 (unless you go large on the crispy aromatic duck).Pak Wai’s parents arrived from Hong Kong in the 1960s and his father, and later his stepfather, set up a series of restaurants in the Midlands, as well as a market garden in the Vale of Evesham growing specialist Asian vegetables. He never thought his mum would allow him to become a restaurateur. “I followed the classic immigrant path: my parents wanted me to be a dentist, accountant, doctor or lawyer.”He chose the latter and went into human rights law, practising in London for 10 years while Jody, who was born in Durham and grew up in the south-east, worked as a teacher. The idea of opening a restaurant didn’t occur to them until Pak Wai’s mother unexpectedly suggested it.“She asked if I enjoyed being a lawyer and I really did – I thought I was doing quite worthy work,” he says. “Then she asked how much I was earning and it was a pittance, because it was all legal aid work. Jody as a teacher was earning more money than I was.”“So it wasn’t a hard decision,” says Jody. “It took 10 minutes.”Despite their lack of experience, the couple had clear ideas . “In London we’d been eating in Japanese and Chinese noodle halls and I thought, what happens in London will eventually spread to the provinces,” says Pak Wai. “So we’re going to have long tables and Cheltonians are going to sit at benches, sharing the space. We’ll have no tablecloths, no side plates, no waiters in little bow ties.”Pak Wai chats to everyone who comes through the door, often at length, and delights in watching new customers become regulars. He nods at a young couple who’ve just sat down for lunch across from us. “When we first opened, Luke and Annabel were just courting,” he notes. “Now they’re married and are here with their second baby.”If treating their customers as extended family is one reason for their success, keeping prices low is another. The weekday lunch deal they introduced a couple of years ago – a starter, a main and a soft drink for £10 – keeps the place bustling throughout the day.“We’ve kept ingredient quality high since the start,” says Pak Wai, “and even though the costs have risen, I’d prefer our margins to be smaller so we sleep better at night.” “And make people happy,” adds Jody.Pak Wai grins. “We’ll never be rich, but if people are happy, that’s our job done.”barandwok.com"
"OFM Awards 2019: Best restaurant – The Oystermen, London",Matt Lovell and Rob Hampton started out working weddings and music festivals – they even fed Grace Jones. Now their restaurant has been voted your favourite place to eat,Tim Lewis,2019-10-21T08:00:37+0100,"The Oystermen – Matt Lovell, 41, and Rob Hampton, 35 – are pretty sure they weren’t the first restaurateurs to be offered the site they took on in Covent Garden in 2017. “I reckon the agent pitched it to everyone else and no one wanted it,” says Lovell, as we sit down for lunch, two massive platters between us laden with oysters, raw and cooked, Pacific rock oysters and the Oystermen’s first native oysters of the season, from as close as Essex and as exotic as Carlingford in Ireland.“No one would have taken it, it was too small,” adds Hampton, who has a big reddish beard, oversized trucker cap, DM boots; big everything really. “There was no storage, no prep kitchen, no space for more toilets.”The pair turned the limitations of the space to their advantage. With nowhere to shuck oysters in the back, they’d do it at the table in front of the customers. It was theatre in the heart of Theatreland, putting Lovell and Hampton – probably the only restaurant owner in London with a degree in war studies – front and centre. They even believe it improved what they put on the plate.“It reinforced the freshness of the food we sell – oysters, crabs, seafood,” says Hampton. “We could only get a day’s worth of stock into the fridges. There would be deliveries in the morning and then sell, sell, sell and reorder overnight.”“We would start again every day,” continues Lovell, who has dark, swept-back hair and hefty, oyster-shucking forearms. “It’s not any different now: we haven’t got any freezers, because we can’t fit them in, so everything has to be fresh daily.”I’m there shucking, with Grace Jones pretty much naked next to me slurping oystersThe Observer’s readers agree and the Oystermen Seafood Bar and Kitchen has been voted OFM’s best restaurant for 2019. Its popularity enabled it to take over the coffee shop next door in January: it’s still basically tiny, but they can now squeeze in 47 for dinner instead of 26. And that extra space has allowed the food – from 28-year-old head chef, Alex Povall, a long-time sous chef for Angela Hartnett – to flourish. At the heart of the operation are, of course, plump oysters, but the restaurant has a well-earned reputation for crab, especially a white-and-brown-meat ragu, served with gnocchi. “The hardest thing in life is not eating that every day,” confesses Hampton. You’d also need an iron will to leave without having Povall’s white chocolate and yogurt ganache.Still, it is service that comes up again and again with Lovell and Hampton, perhaps because both men worked front of house in restaurants as managers and waiters, not as chefs, before opening the Oystermen. And meeting them, it’s hard not to wish that more restaurants were set up by those drilled in the rhythms of hospitality.“There’s a danger of falling into a trap of having perfect Instagram-able food at the core of your business,” says Hampton, “when restaurants are about having a two-hour moment or holiday or journey or experience.”The pair met when Lovell interviewed Hampton for an assistant manager job – at “another non-leading seafood brand” they’d rather not name – and they hit it off immediately, spending their time off together scouring London for oyster happy hours. Both quit “good jobs” to start the Oystermen in 2015, initially working weddings and pop-ups.Funds came from personal savings, a small government loan and maxed-out credit cards and, almost immediately, they wondered if they’d overstretched themselves. At an early gig, a music festival in Yeovil, they filled Lovell’s bashed-up Honda with oysters, crab and smoked salmon. “It rained so hard at that event and we sold nothing,” recalls Hampton, shaking his head. “All the money we’d put aside for the business was gone. It nearly killed it. The next day we ran around pubs in south London shucking oysters, at £1 an oyster, just to make some money back.”There were some brighter moments in the early days, namely a commission to supply oysters for Grace Jones’s dressing room at London’s Afropunk Festival in 2016. “Her rider had 50 Colchester oysters, a couple of bottles of Cristal,” says Hampton. “So I’m there shucking, with Grace Jones pretty much naked next to me slurping oysters.”Today, the Oystermen is an idiosyncratic, personality-heavy spot that offers Michelin-level food without the fuss – the dream for most diners. “I wouldn’t want a star,” says Lovell, and you believe him. “The chefs would want one, but it would damage our business. Maybe one day we will open a restaurant geared towards that. But this place is too relaxed. I want people to come not expecting too much – because it’s a bit ramshackle – but then say, ‘The staff were great, the wine list was banging, the food blew my mind … Why don’t you have a star?’”Hampton nods, and sums up the feelings of the OFM voters: “You want to exceed expectations every time.”oystermen.co.uk"
OFM Awards 2019: Local food hero – Tommy Banks,"The Black Swan chef, chosen for this award by OFM’s panel of judges, tells how he made a family pub ‘in the middle of nowhere’ an inspirational restaurant at the heart of his Yorkshire community",Tony Naylor,2019-10-22T08:01:00+0100,"On the face of it, chef Tommy Banks – the farmer’s son who turned the family’s village pub into a global beacon of grow-your-own self-sufficiency – is a painfully obvious OFM Local Food Hero. Cue: a bucolic tale of regional, seasonal Yorkshire folk, right?Well, not quite. Because, like his food, this 30-year-old’s story is more complicated. Despite his farming background, the Black Swan chef was not born with green fingers. His food is not strictly seasonal. He does not serve Yorkshire on a plate.Instead, like Noma or his early inspiration, Sat Bains, Banks has created a unique restaurant experience, which, while rooted in the local soil, exists as an inspirational example of what is possible beyond Yorkshire puddings and rhubarb crumble. He has done this, moreover, against the odds, personal and financial.Banks’s parents bought the Black Swan in 2006 as a step up from the B&B they ran on their neighbouring farm in Oldstead, a village of 30 houses. They still oversee the inn’s rooms while Tommy’s brother, James, manages the restaurant. Initially, this 16th-century pub ticked over, with Tommy, then a 17-year-old A-level dropout, doing kitchen work.Then the 2008 recession hit. Trade slumped. And after trying every promotion going, the Bankses, boldly, decided to move upmarket. “A pub in the middle of nowhere? It had to be a destination,” says Tommy, sat in the bar.Chef Adam Jackson was recruited and, in 2011, he bagged the Swan a Michelin star. The business was still financially precarious (it would continue to be until Banks won consecutive seasons of Great British Menu and, in 2017, TripAdvisor named the Black Swan the world’s best restaurant), but Michelin put it on the map and paved the way for Banks to hit his stride, albeit in bleak circumstances.Between 2007 and 2010, this sports-mad aspiring cricketer was ill with ulcerative colitis: “I had three major operations and, for a year, I was pretty much bed-ridden. At 19, I had a colostomy bag. I was in a dark place, with no qualifications and the business was struggling.”Growing your own you have the ability to use ingredients in a way other people can’tConvalescing, Banks read cookery books obsessively and, mentored by Jackson, found he was a natural cook. Aged 24 and now head chef, he retained the star. It seemed remarkable to outsiders, but he has said he felt “fraudulent” at the time. “I recreated some recipes. I wasn’t a genius, I just worked hard.”The success persuaded mum and dad to give him full creative control: “Working with family is doubled-edged. It’s support but everyone has an opinion. At first, everyone was paranoid about losing that Michelin star, so the family wanted to taste and debate the dishes before they went on and I was like: ‘Either I’m doing it or I’m not.’ When we retained the star, everyone took a step back.”Banks’s search for his USP took him to Northumberland grower Ken Holland, consultant to the (Michelin) stars, who got him excited about heritage vegetable varieties, and ancient storage techniques such as clamping. Simultaneously, Banks explored preserving methods and his “only real food memories” of foraging.Is the Swan’s food steeped in the romance of the landscape? Banks loves Yorkshire, but no. His smoking Douglas Fir dessert that mimics the smell of hot, wet woodland in summer, is a rarity. His real driver is a desire for complete control over his produce so he can use it creatively, year round – freshly harvested or, often, preserved in radical ways – confident of its consistent quality.Not that growing your own is simple. “We have disasters every year,” he says. “Growing radishes for crudités you might get one in five perfect, if you’re lucky. It’d be way cheaper to buy veg, but growing your own you have the ability to use ingredients in a way other people can’t.”Managing 30 acres of produce on the farm and foraging ingredients in 100kg harvests (elderflowers, rowan berries, wild garlic seeds) is a huge task shared by a 90-strong team which works across the Swan and a newer sister site in York, Roots, which uses the “ugly” produce the Swan cannot. “It’s not a cash cow,” says Banks. “I’ve got as many chefs at Roots as I have here.”This self-contained operation uses only a few local suppliers, mainly for raw milk and meat. But, Banks stresses, the Swan helps fill bedrooms in pubs, taxis from Thirsk and is recruiting young people to live in rural Yorkshire. Economically, it boosts the area.“I’d like to think,” says the star chef who still lives in the family’s Oldstead farmhouse, “we’ve never stopped being part of the community.” blackswanoldstead.co.uk"
"OFM Awards 2019: Best place to drink – 1000 Trades, Birmingham",Craft beer with the atmosphere of a traditional boozer – that’s the winning blend voted for by OFM readers ,Tony Naylor,2019-10-21T08:00:40+0100,"Fittingly, the origin of 1000 Trades lies in a boozy night. “We got drunk,” says John Stapleton, motioning at co-owner Jonathan Todd, “and one thing led to another.”A former political researcher, Stapleton had been trying to “germinate” his vision of the ultimate modern boozer for years. An economist and resident of Birmingham’s historic Jewellery Quarter, Todd was the friend-cum-fixer who, in 2016, finally helped him realise his plans.“I thought we could do this craft beer-slash-pub thing better,” says Stapleton. “Most kids into fashionable craft wouldn’t touch cask beer; there was apartheid between cold, fizzy craft and old-man Camra pubs, but you can bring the two together. Cask is great. The other clash was between a traditional pub feel and the clinical aesthetic of the typical craft beer bar. I hope we smashed the two together.”The result is a “pub” which, across four cask and six keg lines (and 40+ bottles), showcases the best in British and West Midlands beer from breweries such as Burning Soul, Dig and Attic. The house bitter, OTT, travels 200 yards from the Rock & Roll Brewhouse. A similar emphasis on non-mainstream, artisan products runs across the back bar, from locally roasted Quarter Horse coffee to 10 natural wines. A sense of warmth and inclusivity is palpable in how 1000 Trades looks and feels – and even sounds on its DJ nights. “It’s extraordinary how often you go in places and it’s a din,” says Todd. This former light-industrial workshop – one of many listed buildings in the Jewellery Quarter that now house bars, restaurants or office spaces – has hip art on the walls and a “ragged” unfinished look, but it is also a cosy nook on a dark night. In the 19th century Birmingham was known as “the city of a thousand trades” and by hosting jazz and comedy upstairs, a Slow Food grocery distribution point or meet-ups for coders, crafters and homebrewers, Todd and Stapleton hope to turn 1000 Trades into a similar collaborative hub for culture and creativity.Todd talks of 1000 Trades helping to cultivate a healthy civic pride: “Places having a sense of themselves is important in the contemporary world. That’s something we could have a role in.”1000trades.org.uk"
OFM Awards 2019: Best new cookbook – Khazana by Saliha Mahmood Ahmed,"The MasterChef winner on the secrets of her book on Indo-Persian cuisine, voted by OFM readers as their favourite of 2019",Killian Fox,2019-10-21T08:00:26+0100,"It’s not quite what you’d expect a MasterChef winner to do next. After Saliha Mahmood Ahmed won the BBC’s cookery contest in 2017, she could easily have gathered her favourite recipes into a book and published it, with the show as the obvious selling point. “I could have put a picture of myself on the cover, and people would have probablysaid: ‘That’s the girl who was on MasterChef, she cooked nice things,’” she says.Instead, Mahmood Ahmed took a deep dive into the culinary past. Born in Nottingham to Pakistani parents, she used to travel as a child with her family across South and Central Asia and the Middle East. On these trips, she developed a fascination not just with the food of those regions but also the history of the Mughal empire, which rose out of present-day Uzbekistan and dominated South Asia from the early-16th to the mid-19th century.When the opportunity arose to write a cookbook, Mahmood Ahmed, who had been working as a junior doctor while competing in MasterChef, decided to combine her twin hobbies. The result is Khazana, a beautifully realised book that serves up Indo-Persian cuisine with bite-sized chunks of history on the side. The 31-year-old has done her research – the book opens with a quote from the 16th-century emperor Akbar about taking care over food. “But I’m not a historical purist,” she says. “I’m using Mughal concepts and ingredients, but I’m not copying verbatim. Some of those recipes have a kilo of pistachios in them …, and that’s never going to be appropriate today.”I have loads and loads of ideas. I’ve just got to decide which direction I go in nextInstead, she updates old ideas by marrying them with her tastes and experience. “For example, the Mughals were not huge fans of salad,” she says, “but I love salads, so I’ve used their concepts to develop my own Mughal-style salads” – such as guava, peach, black salt and mint. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.”Unusual combinations, such as smoked chicken and basil kebabs with beetroot salad and buttermilk raita, prove irresistible – as does the broad mix of cuisines, neatly tied by the Mughal theme. “When I’ve given the book to people from Iran, they can relate to many of the recipes,” she says. “And when I give it to Pakistani people, they find the recipes both familiar and different, which they seem to like.” Khazana has found favour with British readers too. “At a festival the other day, someone was looking at my book and another girl passed by and said, ‘Don’t think about it, just buy it: it’s great,’” Mahmood Ahmed recalls. “That was so rewarding for me.” To write the book, Mahmood Ahmed went part-time at work and now she has a “50/50 career” as a doctor and food personality. As a gastroenterologist, she deals with food-related ailments and digestive disorders and she would like to write “something unique in that domain, drawing from my understanding of gut health and eating food in ways that are more beneficial than simply dieting and cutting calories”.And then, of course, there are other parts of her heritage to be explored, “whether that’s the Pakistani part, the Kashmiri part – or the huge Anglo-Indian influence in my life. I have loads of ideas.” She takes a breath. “I’ve just got to decide which direction I go in next.”Khazana: A Treasure Trove of Modern Mughal Dishes (Hodder & Stoughton, £25).

OFM Awards 2019: Best Instagram feed – Miguel Barclay,Miguel Barclay’s knack for easy recipes that cost less than a pound made him a social media phenomenon – and our readers’ choice for this award,Killian Fox,2019-10-21T08:00:40+0100,"Before he launched his Instagram account in May 2016, Miguel Barclay was a biochemistry graduate working at an e-commerce company who set himself a regular challenge: meal planning. “It was a game,” he says. “What can I cook for under a pound? I’d calculate it on a spreadsheet at work, then buy the ingredients on the way home.”For a year or so, he did this for his own amusement then tried to persuade others to play along. Initially, he wanted to create an online forum where followers could share their own favourite £1 meals. “But no one else submitted any recipes,” he says. “It was all my dishes, and people just came and cooked them and said, ‘Thank you.’”Three and a half years on, the number of Instagrammers following @miguelbarclay and saying “thank you” is more than 303,000 and rising. Things began to hot up in July 2016, when Barclay posted a video recipe for chicken katsu curry, listing the price of each ingredient (1 chicken thigh 29p; splash of soy 2p; 1 tbsp flour 1p …), totalling just 55p. “It got 30,000 views,” he recalls. “Then someone from [ITV’s] This Morning rang me up and asked, ‘Do you want to cook your chicken katsu curry on the show?’”The first One Pound Meals cookbook followed in January 2017 (a fifth book is due out in December, with two more in the pipeline), and soon afterwards Barclay quit his job to manage his Instagram account full time. Not only does he post recipes for dishes as varied as toad-in-the-hole and artichoke paella, many of them condensed into short, step-by-step videos, he also documents the minutiae of his daily life, addressing his audience from bed in the morning and taking us out on date nights with his wife, Lucey. 🍴 55p KATSU CURRY 🍴 (recipe by Instagram chef @miguel_barclay) ----------------- recipe ------------------- Coat a deboned skinless chicken thigh in seasoned flour, then egg and then seasoned stale breadcrumbs.

It’s not really about the £1 limit. It’s the fact that my recipes are easy, they’re accessible, and people who aren’t used to cooking from scratch at home are suddenly becoming enthusiastic.” “I get the loveliest emails and messages,” he adds. “People say, ‘I never thought I could cook, and now I can because you’ve given me the confidence – and not only has it changed my outlook on what I’m cooking at home, but it’s changed my outlook on life.’ And that,” says Barclay, “makes it all worthwhile.” @miguelbarclay"
"Pilgrim, Liverpool: ‘Order a vermouth and go with the rumpus’ – restaurant review",Lots of swagger and style in evidence at this Spanish restaurant on a mission to take you on an culinary journey,Grace Dent,2019-10-18T10:00:53+0100,"Pilgrim in Liverpool made me smile many months before I’d booked a table. My job, if you’re willing to call it one, is not merely to consume food, but also to spend hours hearing about the concepts behind each restaurant. This is where I earn my money: deciphering the arduous Vogon poetics on websites about seasonal produce, the chef’s old nonna, or complete curveballs such as: “You thought you liked cheese... but have you ever tried it delivered on a sushi conveyor belt?” That’s a real thing, by the way, called Pick & Cheese, in Covent Garden.Anyhow, the men behind Pilgrim take concept to a higher, more godly level, basing their restaurant around the pilgrimage routes towards Santiago de Compostela, where the remains of St James were found in the ninth century. Or, more specifically, the Camino del Norte route, which is 825km of rugged coastline between Irun, outside San Sebastian, turning inland at Ribadeo in the Galician hills to Santiago.Duke Street Market is definitely fun. Noisy fun ....OK, it’s a Spanish restaurant. And some of the stuff is on small plates, so you could even say it’s tapas, but I like Pilgrim’s swagger. Having grown up around Scousers, never knowingly out of six-foot range of a prayer card, a devotional portrait, or just a plan to go somewhere to worship someone, I find this saint-chasing shtick rather comforting. Especially if it involves Cantabrian boquerones, peralzola cheese, allioli, sofrito, live fire hearths and a lot of cold, white, organic xarel·lo.Pilgrim lives on the upper deck of Duke Street Market, which is what we’re loosely calling right now in restaurant-land “a food hall”, although that’s a catch-all term that doesn’t really work, because the hospitality at each different venue works in a slightly different way. For me, 2019 has been a year of loitering confusedly in food halls, gob ajar, trying to decipher where one eats, sits, orders and pays. Duke Street Market is the first set-up with the stark gumption to put an effusive staff member at the front door chivvying the customers for Asian bowl-food kitchen Ginger or vegan counter Indigo Greens over to the communal benches, while directing Pilgrims like me to the more formal restaurant up a flight of stairs, where a mezzanine overlooks the fun.Because Duke Street Market is definitely fun. Noisy fun. This is a 19th-century warehouse with exposed brick walls and a thunderous sound system. I tried three different tables before accepting that this was going to feel like eating gordal olives during a 1995 Dave Morales set at Cream, but at least this time I would be wearing actual clothes, not merely a Morgan De Toi pelmet and body butter.The trick is to order a large red vermouth on ice as a pre-starter and go with the rumpus.We began with good, fresh house bread with smoked butter and a plate of silver-skinned, delicious boquerones, marinated in sweet vinegar. A plate of fresh, green, defiantly al dente runner beans arrived on a puddle of the deepest, oiliest, most garlicky sofrito strewn with small, piquant, smoked cherry tomatoes. Green beans on red sauce shouldn’t taste that good. Sure, I’d have cooked the beans longer. Same, too for chargrilled leeks. I can only guess that the chef came from a family like mine, where Christmas sprouts were put on to simmer some time in late November, and has spent a culinary journey rebelling. We demolished the leeks nevertheless as they arrived, slathered in light-blue-veined cow’s cheese, scattered with delicately candied walnut.I can’t pretend the food at Pilgrim was perfect; a piece of monkfish tail in a vivid orange pimiento glaze was overcooked and slightly bizarre-tasting. But then a txuleton sirloin, served – no ifs or buts – rare, was a huge success on our table, arriving with a pond-green Castilian salsa heaving with thickly sliced melting onions.Pilgrim is a restaurant I want to return to again and again out of sheer curiosity. Their holy, walking-tour concept doesn’t stifle them, but gives them a clear base for a foray into exquisite produce. The St James tart that Pilgrim served at the end – despite being, dare I say it, “deconstructed” – was one of the greatest things I’ve tasted this year. A slice of sticky, caramelised-edged sponge with a stew of burnt apple and fennel was served with soothing, sweet, milky ice-cream. Not the prettiest of puddings. Not the showiest. A cacophony of beige.Probably not worth walking 825km in sandals for; but if I can travel up the M6 on a Megabus, then I’ll make a pilgrimage again this year.• Pilgrim 46 Duke Street, Liverpool, 07388 120098.

"Flor, Borough Market, London: ‘I feel like I’ve been at a tasting session’ – restaurant review","Despite opening to great fanfare, many of the dishes at Flor seem at odds with the hype – and some seem downright weird",Jay Rayner,2019-10-20T07:00:52+0100,"Flor, 1 Bedale Street, London SE1 9AL (020 3319 8144). Small plates £9-£13, bigger plates £18-£29, desserts £5-£8. Wines from £24On the night Flor opened the doors to its sliver of a townhouse by London’s Borough Market, one restaurant writer tweeted indignantly that he hadn’t been able to get a table, despite the website’s claim that they held back space for walk-ins. Well, doh! As Homer might have said in the restaurant critic episode of The Simpsons. Flor wasn’t just any old opening. It wasn’t some witty Peruvian-Greek small plates mashup utilising seasonal produce cooked over logs harvested from Peckham’s Goose Green. It’s the second restaurant from the team behind the high-flying, adored Lyle’s, which has enough awards and citations to make Meryl Streep feel like an underachiever.Chef James Lowe and manager John Ogier may have claimed they were launching an ever so humble bakery-led dining room, for when you feel just a bit peckish. The rest of us were entitled to go, “Whatever, boys.” Accordingly, it has been mobbed by my colleagues who, in fine journalistic tradition, got to the story first. This is me confessing that, while it only opened in July, I am late through the door. It also means I am burdened by high expectations, because so far it has been a chorus of wet-lipped hallelujahs and aerated dribble for the concise menu of idiosyncratic dishes. Where Lyle’s makes a point of Britishness, here they say they are looking deeper into Europe. We can all get behind that, right?The moment you crash through the door it becomes clear this really is an elbows-on-the-table sort of place, not least because there’s nowhere else to put them. On the ground floor there is a high counter around an open kitchen and a few tiny tables at which to sit knee to knee. Waiters are mostly thin. At the back is a corkscrew of black painted metal spiral staircase, which must be a nightmare to negotiate in heels.It leads to another tight space of tiny tables and compact banquettes. The small tables are an issue because it is 2019. Therefore, you will not get something as banal as one plate each at a time. The food comes in whatever order the kitchen deigns, even if there isn’t enough space to place the crockery. It’s a clatter of dishes crammed together, which only adds to the sense of dissonance and discord.Before anybody thinks I’m about to be arsey for the sake of it, be in no doubt: they serve some very good food. I understood some of the attendant noise and hoopla. A tart of sweetly roasted datterini tomatoes, bursting from their skins as if optimistically they bought their clothes a size too small, lies on a rugged purée of violet aubergines. It is dotted with snowy peaks of feta. All of this summery loveliness is encased in a miraculously short, crisp pastry shell. It is a serious looker but, more importantly, eating it quickly justifies the desecration of its beauty.Scarlet prawns come in two parts. The slippery, sticky meat is served raw, dressed with the fragrant citrus and spice kick of orange yuzu kosho. The big fat heads are grilled and served separately for maximum suckage. And then there is the blistered sourdough flatbread laid with garlic and the soft elasticity of Spenwood sheep’s cheese, piled in turn with big fat clams. A clam pizza is a cracking idea, which I would happily meet again.But other things are bizarre or clumsy or, whisper it, just not very nice. Broad salted anchovies laid on toast with a gossamer overcoat of translucent lardo sounds like all the good salty fatty things in one place. But the cured back fat is cut so thickly it’s less a silky shimmer than a duvet. (As ever, you’ll find my picture of this over on Instagram). A heap of salad with a thick brown satay-like dressing of hazelnuts and preserved lemons is simply odd. And then there’s the dish listed as “summer vegetables, sesame”. It turns out to be that old 70s stager crudités. I’ve seen that movie and I know how it so often ends: with a furrowed brow of disappointment.For it to work the vegetables need fire and bite. These are artfully chosen. They are crisp and also exceedingly bland. The bowl of tahini dressing to drag them through is all the silky, deep, lusty tones we expect of tahini. It’s also completely unsuited to the job. This needs acidity, something to make the vegetables more than themselves, but it’s absent. And suddenly the £9 price tag for a plate of veg and a lacklustre dressing feels like the price you pay for eating out in London right now.It simply doesn’t hang together as a meal. It’s a bunch of edible things, corralled together on one piece of paper, with very little to say to one another. A well-written menu should be a matrix that you can plot a route through in any direction, and still come up with something that makes sense. Instead, I feel like I’ve been at a tasting session: here are a few dishes the kitchen is working on. What do you think? Well, I liked the tomato tart and the flatbread, and thank you for having me.It’s the same at dessert. Almond granita with plums and flaked almonds feels like it’s making up the numbers. The brown butter cakes, crisp crust giving way to a sweet syrupy sponge, are a bit of baking with which I could be lifelong friends. And now I’m exhausted and confused. The item that sums it all up is the bread. Lyle’s is famed for its sourdough. The Flor press release proudly announced they’d used the same starter with which they opened Lyle’s five years ago. And yes, the crust is fabulous: both crunchy and tearable. But the crumb is weirdly moist, as if underbaked. I find myself rolling it into a damp ball like I used to do with Mother’s Pride when I was a kid. You should not be able to do that with bread coming out of a kitchen run by James Lowe.Staff are keen, even if they do the “no notebook” thing, which always puts me on edge. Still, it all moves along at a clip. But I leave trying to work out what happened to me. I know this review is what political pollsters call an outlier. It diverges from the consensus. So be it. Sadly, I can’t pretend I think a restaurant made total sense just to be in the popular place on the scatter graph. Like James Lowe of Flor, Lee Tiernan was also the head chef at St John Bread and Wine, though his place, Black Axe Mangal at London’s Highbury Corner, is a very different beast. There’s a graffiti-covered wood-fired oven, and both music and food to rattle your eyeballs. Go for the likes of roasted suckling pig with white beans and sriracha, or their blistered flatbread laid with grilled beef, served rare with a tomato salsa and pickled chilli (blackaxemangal.com).Congratulations to the winners of the Italian Awards, recently announced in Manchester, which recognise Italian restaurants across the country. Entrants are nominated by the public, with winners judged by a panel.

"The Flint House, Brighton: ‘It’s all about satisfying dishes’ – restaurant review","Deceptively modish, Ben McKellar’s new place stays true to his tried and tested formula",Jay Rayner,2019-10-13T06:00:46+0100,"The Flint House, 13 Hanningtons Lane, Brighton BN1 1GS (01273 916333). All dishes £4-£14 (apart from shared steak at £42), desserts £8, wines from £23Being on trend in the restaurant business isn’t difficult, if you’ve got a few miles on the clock: sniff the air to work out which direction the robata grill smoke is blowing from; flick through a few mags with a grizzled “I can do that” frown. It doesn’t matter that you made your name, say, knocking out a massive raviolo or ripping off the Tatin sisters. Why shouldn’t you now do some ersatz take on somewhere called Asia you don’t know much about outside of a sweaty mini break at the Park Hyatt Tokyo? If that’s what the Swarovski-encrusted iPhone crowd want right now, give it to them. Buy in a few trinkets wholesale from that department store in Nihonbashi, stack the fridge with Cristal and offer up a menu full of miso-smeared cod and dishes that punch you in the face repeatedly with gochujang. Yours for £100 a head.Being up to date while remaining true to yourself takes more skill. Chef Ben McKellar and his partner Pamela have it. If you haven’t heard of them, it’s because you don’t live in Brighton, where they have run multiple restaurants for the past 21 years. Their places usually have the word “ginger” in the title. It’s Ben’s way of celebrating his once luscious head of russet hair.I first ate his eminently trustworthy food at the Gingerman inside the mildly formal Drakes Hotel in 2005, and then again in 2008 at a laid-back pub called the Ginger Fox just outside Brighton. Back then, there was a touch of St John to his cooking. I still mutter wistfully about his toast fried in duck fat, laid with horseradish cream and pink folds of roast beef. He might put a mince and onion pie on the menu, but raise the humble to the extravagant, or put a cake of crisped pig’s head alongside slices of fillet. His dishes have always been on the plate what they promise on the menu.And now here’s the shiny Flint House, in a new development within the city’s Lanes. It’s seemingly unlike any other McKellar outpost before, which may explain the absence of “Ginger” in the title. Upstairs is a dining room and cocktail bar looking out over the Brighton rooftops. Downstairs is dominated by a counter around a fully open kitchen for those who like a bit of nerdy cooking theatre. Thrill to the induction hob with its plancha fitting; perv over the Thermomix and the Pacojet, and the prepped ingredients waiting in their plastic pots for their moment.It’s all polished surfaces and sharp angles and yes, of course, small plates because everything is right now. They do not take bookings, because this is meant to be a restlessly modern venture that you fall into and out of at speed. So far so modish. Don’t be distracted. Dig through the unstructured menu, its belt unloosened to the last notch. Take in the nods to Spain and Italy. The bit of the menu headed encouragingly “Fried/toast/snacks”, for example, includes ham croquettes with saffron mayo, which feels like a departure from his overtly British agenda. But you’ll still find the big fat McKellar thumbprint: it’s about solid dishes that don’t sacrifice substance for looks. The béchamel in those croquettes isn’t just flavoured with ham; it’s spun through with ribbons of the stuff, as if determined to make its point.Rock oysters are dressed with an apple and cider-vinegar granita, which makes them brisker than they might already be. We watch a hunk of hispi cabbage being seared on the plancha, until the edges are browned and toffee-like. It comes with a thick, mustardy ravigote sauce below and an autumnal leaf fall of crisped golden onions above. Courgettes are browned and pelted with handfuls of pine nuts and a dollop of confit garlic. A slab of treacly bread is toasted and laid with Ortiz anchovies, the brand name a reassurance. There are rings of lightly pickled onion to send it on its way.As with Ortiz, so with Hannan, the Northern Irish meat producer, who ages his beef in a room lined with the shimmering pink of Himalayan salt. I’m still to work out exactly what the salt does, but I know the beef is exceptionally good. Like some terrible brand fetishist, I relax when I see his name on a menu. A serious cut of that beef is the most expensive dish here at £42 (for sharing). There’s also his ox cheek, cured to a rosy red and given a ride through a sugar pit, to produce something on more than nodding terms with the very best maple-syrup-sweetened bacon. There’s a toasty onion purée beneath. It needs the heavy grating of nose-slapping horseradish to tip it away from cloying. And then there are rings of hugely flavoured lamb’s belly, from an animal with proper time on the hoof, crisped and perched on a pile of the freshest of peas and dressed with more anchovy.For dessert there is muscovado sugar crème brûlée. Apparently, there are blackcurrants in there, too, but all I get are the sultry, caramel tones of the brown sugar. I am rarely convinced that there is much point trying to improve upon a classic vanilla crème brûlée, and this one doesn’t change my mind. Far better is a block of chocolate and pistachio parfaits, pushed together and sandwiched within a biscuit shell alongside a cherry cream. It’s both fun and clever. It’s lunchtime and, to the disgust of many reading this, I’m off the booze. Instead I have a glass of their own rhubarb soda, and feel almost virtuous, even though I surrendered my virtue years ago.My job is to ramble through as much of a menu like this as I can, and I do put my back into it. But sometimes you need to step back from such an experience and work out what it’s for. Over the years the McKellars have run businesses built around the special occasion; restaurants where milestones are marked and devotion is proved. The Flint House is not one of those. It’s about a couple of satisfying dishes, rather than the works. It’s a restaurant that makes its point one dish at a time so that what could seem at first to be just a nice enough lunch or dinner, turns out to have been rather more than that. And every town really could do with a place like that.A little more on McKellar’s thatched pub the Ginger Fox, just outside Hurstpierpoint, 15 minutes from Brighton. It may be chocolate box-pretty but the food is bang up to date. Starters might include a rabbit scotch egg with carrot and chipotle remoulade, followed by venison loin with braised celery and a wild mushroom jus. Sunday lunches, which come fully accessorised, are a highlight (thegingerfox.com).Restaurateur Alan Yau, who launched an entire restaurant sector with Wagamama, before opening Hakkasan and Duck & Rice, has three new ventures in London next year. Two will be in Canary Wharf. Chyna will combine Cantonese and European cookery and boast a ‘water market’ from which customers can choose live seafood. Next to that will be a Japanese place built around counter dining. The third, at Westfield Shopping Centre, will be part of his Turkish street food brand, Yamabahce.Steve Groves, who won Masterchef: The Professionals a decade ago, has another title. He has been named Craft Guilds National Chef of The Year. Groves, who heads the kitchen at Roux at Parliament Square, won with a menu including red mullet with shellfish mousse and bouillabaisse sauce, and suckling pig with Jerusalem artichokes.Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1"
"My Neighbours The Dumplings, London E9: ‘Delicious bedlam’ – restaurant review",The food at this new dumpling joint achieves the same scrumptious heights as at its sister restaurant – but get there early,Grace Dent,2019-10-11T10:00:20+0100,"Restaurant names are important; they lure or repel. My Neighbours The Dumplings sounds like a post-post-punk group featuring Jah Wobble and ex-members of Gang of Four. It also sounds like a disrespectful jibe about the people over the fence post-Christmas.But My Neighbours The Dumplings, which opened in Clapton, east London, some years back, and which has recently opened a second, roomier restaurant in Victoria Park, Hackney, is in fact named after the 1998 cult Japanese anime film My Neighbour Toroto. That has to be the most impudently east-London thing I’ll write in 2019, but there are 11 weeks left.Three years ago, with that brilliant name acting as catnip, I fought my way into Kristian Leontiou and Becky Wharton’s first dumpling and sake bar to find the place in absolute bedlam. Delicious, homespun, sort-of-Chinese, sort-of-Korean, a-little-Vietnamese bedlam. But also the sort of bedlam that sets in when your pop-up events and baskets of crisp, chewy, courgette and wood-ear mushroom potstickers are a sell-out success and Nigella’s been in for a plate of your prawn har gow. It was the sort of bedlam that brings all the cool kids to the melee, like wasps to jam, and turns your waiting area into a 50-minute queue for smacked cucumber and turnip cake. I remember leaving feeling that it was wonderful, and that drinking sake cocktails in its pot-plant jungle was a real coup, but still, I’d eaten dinner with one bum cheek on a stranger’s thigh and my elbow in their peanut salad.I was impressed, but would never go back. We hear lots these days about restaurants withering due to lack of interest, but what do you do when you’re loved to the point that your walls can barely contain you? “So this is what stupid people look like,” Becky Wharton wrote on My Neighbours The Dumplings’ Instagram last April, revealing these new premises. “Two kids and two restaurants in three years!”Cut to a drab, very early Tuesday evening in early October, and we are eating alone in the all-new, bigger and, I think, better My Neighbours The Dumplings. We go at 5pm, managing to miss not only the hip things, but also the parents with toddlers who began to fill up the benches later. This suits me fine: the new residence is a gorgeous expanse of elegant calm. More beautiful, more, dare I say, grown-up than the first. It’s twinkly, inviting and date-nightish. Or, in our case, date-late-afternoonish.On one side, banqueting benches sit under explosions of greenery and a cacophony of lanterns and knick-knacks; on the other, a small dumpling kitchen. Trung Nguyen and master dumpling chef Carol Lee supervise the making of around 14,000 dumplings a week over the two sites. I think they may have nailed the perfect crisp, moist potsticker. You may know them as gyoza. I once heard potstickers called “Peking ravioli” in America. It’s no surprise they’re also nicknamed “the gateway dumpling” by some, because, even if you’re not in the mood for Asian food, they’ll change your mind. Here, the vegetable potstickers are a punchy blend of shiitake, cabbage, chive and sesame.Next up, a thrilling basket of Cantonese crystal shrimp dumplings, or har gow, are the best I’ve had in London. They are firm, satisfying bullets of joy, with stretchy, nigh-translucent skins, masking a buoyant whack of pink prawn, sesame and oyster sauce. We are supposed to be pacing ourselves, but quickly order another basket from the chipper staff.We steer ourselves away from dumplings to the other small plates: a bowl of delightful pickled wood-ear mushrooms with goji berries and matchsticks of apple is fabulous and a great foil for a soothing, unusual cold plate of marinated silken tofu littered with preserved vegetables and pine nuts in a puddle of tamari.Yakitori skewers of line-caught mackerel, grilled with lime and sake, are a delight. Possibly my least favourite dish is the fanciest and most expensive: a tartare of hamachi yellowtail on avocado mush looks charming on the menu photo, but makes little impact on my tastebuds.If you go, which I think you should, order the chocolate dumplings. Yes, it’s only a basket of unglamorous spring rolls filled with dark chocolate goo and served with a salted caramel dipping sauce and a scoop of ice-cream, but winter is coming and we all need extra fat to keep warm. Go early, beat the rush, order the har gow. That’s how good neighbours become good friends.• My Neighbours The Dumplings 178-180 Victoria Park Road, London, E9, 020-3327 0447.

How to make wild mushroom risotto – recipe,"Autumn brings with it earthier flavours, celebrated in this step-by-step wild mushroom risotto",Felicity Cloake,2019-09-25T12:00:24+0100,"Autumn can seem a very meaty time of year in the kitchen, all hearty stews and roast game, but it’s also mushroom season, when fields and markets are full of chanterelles and penny buns, puffballs and hen of the woods … so long as you know where to look and, more importantly, what to look for. This simple risotto, easily doubled, is a good way to make the most of even the most modest of harvests.Prep 10 minCook 30 minServes 220g dried porcini ½ onion or 2 shallots30g parmesan100g fresh chanterelles (or other mushrooms)1.1 litres good chicken or vegetable stock25g butter, plus 2 tbsp extra to finish200g risotto rice – I like carnaroli, but the more widely available arborio or more niche vialone nano will also do120ml white wine 1 garlic cloveA couple of parsley sprigs, to finishThis dish is very versatile. I used chanterelles, but almost any fresh mushrooms will do (in fact, it will be lovely made with just dried porcini alone). If you don’t have stock, soak the porcini in the same amount of hot water instead. You can use dry sherry or vermouth rather than wine. And for a vegan version, replace the butter with olive oil and the cheese with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.Boil 150ml water and use this to soak the dried mushrooms for at least five minutes. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion or shallots, grate the parmesan and trim and gently brush any dirt off the fresh mushrooms with a damp cloth. If you have large mushrooms, cut them into bite-sized pieces.Bring the stock to a simmer, strain in the mushroom soaking water, and set aside the soaked mushrooms. Taste the stock: you’ll be reducing it further, so it shouldn’t be too salty to begin with – dilute with a little more water, if necessary, then leave on a low heat while you get on with the risotto.Melt the butter in a wide saucepan over a medium-low heat, and gently fry the chopped onion until soft – don’t let it colour. Tip in the rice and cook, stirring, until most of the grains are coated and translucent – this will take a few minutes.Turn up the heat under the pan slightly and, once it’s warmed back up, pour in the wine; it should sizzle as it hits the pan. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, then start adding the stock one ladleful at a time, continuing to stir as you do so, and not adding the next ladle of stock until the pan is almost dry.After about 10 minutes, stir in the soaked dried mushrooms. Keep adding stock and stirring until the rice is done to your liking – this should take another eight to 12 minutes, though exactly how long will depend on your tastes. In theory, the rice should still be firm, but not chalky in the middle; if you prefer it softer, however, that’s your prerogative.Once you’re happy with the texture of the rice, correct the consistency of the mixture; risotto shouldn’t sit on the plate like a solid lump, but flow across it like a wave, so add a little more stock, if need be, stirring until the rice is loose and creamy. Stir in most of the grated parmesan and a tablespoon of the extra butter, then cover the pan and leave to sit off the heat for five minutes.While the risotto is resting, finely chop or crush the garlic and melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the garlic for 30 seconds or so, before turning up the heat and adding the fresh mushrooms. Saute for a few minutes until they’re just starting to brown around the edges, then take off the heat.Give the risotto a good stir and season to taste (it probably won’t need any more salt, because the parmesan has a fair bit already). Divide between plates or shallow bowls and top with the fried mushroom mixture. Roughly chop the parsley and sprinkle over the top, then finish with the remaining cheese and eat immediately."
Gin up! Why sales of the coloured and flavoured spirit are booming,"From marshmallow to ‘unicorn tears’, consumption of novelty gin are up 750%. But for many bartenders, the choice is wearisome",Richard Godwin,2019-10-21T17:20:38+0100,"When Sam Galsworthy of Sipsmith gin applied for a distilling licence to make gin in 2009, he was informed that no one had done such a thing in London for nearly 200 years.How times change. There are now at least 24 distilleries in London, predominantly making gin. Sales of the once unfashionable spirit reached £1.9bn in the UK in 2018, according to the Wine and Spirits Trade Association. Production of spirits is booming: the number of distilleries of all types in Britain increased from 170 in 2017 to 205 in 2018, according to a new report by the law firm RPC.Aside from traditional juniper-infused London dry gin, there is now toasted marshmallow gin, parma violet gin, cherry bakewell gin, a Unicorn Tears gin and lavender gin that changes colour on contact with tonic. UK sales of flavoured and coloured gins grew by 751% last year; bar displays look like toy shops.Like many in the industry, Dawn Davies of the online retailer Whisky Exchange doesn’t necessarily see the boom as great news for distillers. “We saw a similar thing when flavoured vodkas became popular a decade ago,” she says. “When flavours start to dominate, it can signal the beginning of a decline. Brands need to be careful not to dilute their ranges with hundreds of flavours.”For consumers, novelty is a key factor. Violet gin stands out on a supermarket shelf, and looks better on Instagram. Rhubarb, strawberry and orange are popular flavours. But it is getting harder for more traditional brands to distinguish themselves. “We are finding that standard gins are in small or flat growth, depending on the brand,” says Davies. “Consumers are loyal to gin, but not necessarily to any particular brand.”There are good flavoured gins on the market: Sacred’s Christmas pudding gin is more subtle than it sounds; Sipsmith’s orange and cacao gin is warm and mellow. But most flavoured gins are actually liqueurs, with varying amounts of sugar, flavours and colours added. That’s no bad thing, necessarily – as long as you treat them like liqueurs. Edinburgh pomegranate and rose liqueur gin is way too sweet to use as a base for a cocktail or a gin and tonic, but 5-10ml added to a regular gin martini is heavenly.Among bartenders, gin often now elicits the same weary reaction that vodka did 10 years ago. Rum is instead seen as the tipple with the greatest potential. You might want to start honing your mai tai recipe.

Chilean wines that excel at every price point,"Always fruity, authentic and dependable, sometimes these South Americans really shine",David Williams,2019-10-20T06:00:51+0100,"Co-op Irresistible Chilean Pinot Noir, Casablanca, Chile 2018 (£8, The Co-op) Few countries can compete with Chile when it comes to making wines under a tenner that are slightly better than they should be. In most shoppers’ minds this makes for a useful if not always exciting prospect: you will get a good dose of fruit, and the wine will taste of the variety printed on the label, and there will be no alarms and no surprises. If I sound like I’m damning with faint praise, I don’t mean to. After tasting literally thousands of supermarket wines in the past couple of weeks, many of them considerably less interesting than their price tag suggests, I can confirm that this ability of Chile’s is not to be sniffed at. And the best supermarket Chileans really do, as the marketers say, overdeliver, among them the Co-op’s alluringly pure and slinky cool-climate pinot noir which is a genuine bargain.Pintao Reserva Carmenère, Colchagua Valley, Chile 2017 (£10, Marks & Spencer) The name behind the Co-op’s pinot is Viña Indomita, a producer that is coming close to cornering the market in the UK’s own-label Chilean supermarket wines. That’s not necessarily a bad thing: Indomita is also responsible for a couple of other of pound-for-pound overperformers at the Co-op (the exuberantly, joyously juicy Co-op Irresistible Bio Bio Valley Malbec 2017), Sainsbury’s (the succulent, polished, cassis-scented Taste the Difference Maipo Cabernet Sauvignon 2018; £9) and Morrisons (the racy, tingly, grassy dry white Zarper Sauvignon Blanc, Casablanca 2019; £8.25). Other producers bringing a bit of extra pizzazz to Chile’s supermarket game are giants Concha y Toro, responsible for the satisfyingly chunky, chewy, dark berry fruited and red-meat-requiring Tesco Finest Cauquenes Carignan 2015 (£10); and Viña Casa Silva, the people behind Marks & Spencer’s nicely balanced take on the country’s speciality variety carmenère, with its rustle of herbal notes, soy and dark curranty fruit.Viñedos de Alcohuaz Grus, Elqui Valley, Chile 2016 (from £23.35, Connollys Wine; Bottle Apostle) The one problem with having a reputation for making good affordable wines: how do you find takers for your so-called fine wines – wines that might be great but can’t be done on the cheap, wines, for example, from remote vineyards produced at a small scale that requires labour- and cost-intensive care and attention? The answer according to many of the wine merchants I speak to is: with great difficulty. And that’s despite the fact that Chilean fine wine has become so much more interesting in the past couple of decades. Producers have explored new sites to the west along the coast and east into the mountains, to the cool of the south and the desert of the north. The result: bottles of the calibre of the vivid, pure, Rhône-like red blend Alcohuaz Grus, from high altitude in the northern Elqui Valley – although even this, while nobody’s idea of cheap, still conforms to the essential Chilean vinous virtue: value for money.Follow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Wines that age well – and ones to drink young,"Some wines – even some whites – age well, while others demand to be drunk right away. Lay in vintage years, buy the good stuff early – and when it’s time to open it, treat it with care",Fiona Beckett,2019-10-18T13:00:56+0100,"Inherited tastes in wines, and, for the lucky few, inherited wines, are not necessarily as gratifying as inherited recipes. That’s because, while you can be swept away on a wave of nostalgia by making your mum’s fish pie or chocolate brownies, wines change as they mature. And, given that many people hang on to them for far too long, there’s a fair chance the bottle will be way over the hill by the time you get round to opening it. Still, on the bright side, you may uncover a gem.You may be surprised to learn that it’s not necessarily reds that show best with age . Whites and sweet wines can also mature well – or not, in the case of white burgundy, which has a well-documented problem with “premox”, or premature oxidation.Crisp whites and rosés, too, benefit from being drunk young, but both riesling and semillon can age spectacularly well, as can Loire chenin blancs, such as vouvray and montlouis, which often take time to get into their stride. Whether you like the more complex, evolved flavours, however, is another matter, because tastes these days run to fresher, fruitier wines. Older vintages often need appropriate food – particularly classic French or Italian dishes – to show at their best.If you like the taste of older wines, it’s worth trying to get hold of them when they’re young, from both the point of view of availability and your bank balance – quality wines are obviously much cheaper when they first hit the market than once they have become scarce. Although vintages are less important than they once were, it also makes sense to lay in wines from a good year: 2016, for example, was good in both the Rhône and Bordeaux.My best advice is to establish what exactly it is that you’ve got stashed away. It’s easy enough to find out online – most merchants give some kind of indication of a “drink by” date, but that will be very much dependent on how the wine has been kept. It’s also worth checking the value of the wine: anything that’s less than £10, say, I’d be inclined to drink up asap, but when it gets to the £30 mark, you might want to invite your wine-loving pals round.If in doubt, just dive in and open it anyway, though always with a back-up just in case it’s corked or otherwise undrinkable. And treat it gently. Fragile old red burgundy probably won’t benefit from decanting, while other wines may have thrown a deposit and will need to be decanted like a port (if you don’t have a decanter, just use a jug). And don’t overchill those old whites.Soraie Veneto Cecilia Beretta 2016 £11.95 Corney & Barrow, 14%. A passito described by the producer as a ‘mini-amarone’. Autumnal, rich, but surprisingly dry. Enjoy with cheese or ragù.Vasse Felix Filius Chardonnay 2016 £9.95 ND John, £13 Booths, 12.5%. Classy, creamy chardonnay from Australia’s Margaret River.

UK queries Facebook decision to exempt political statements from fact-checking,Commons committee demands explanation ‘given constraints it will place on combatting disinformation’,Alex Hern,2019-10-22T15:16:55+0100,"The UK parliament has demanded to know why Facebook has decided to exempt political statements from its fact-checking programme – removing all bars on political candidates lying in paid adverts.In a letter to the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, now Facebook’s vice-president for global affairs and communications, Damian Collins, the chair of the House of Commons’ digital, culture, media and sport select committee, described the change first reported in early October as “particularly concerning”.Collins wrote to Clegg with five questions for Facebook to answer, three of which covered the rule change. “Why was the decision taken to change Facebook’s policy,” the MP asked, “given the heavy constraint this will place on Facebook’s ability to combat online disinformation in the run-up to elections around the world, and a possible UK general election in particular?”Collins also queried the role of Facebook’s global elections integrity operations team in the decision-making process. Citing a Twitter thread Yaël Eisenstat, in which she said she had previously suggested scanning ads for misinformation to “silent” responses from her bosses, Collins asked: “What proposals has [the team] made, to what extent were these proposals determined to be feasible, and on what grounds were they not progressed?” Collins also asked about whether Facebook would be formalising its relationship with its third-party fact checkers “in the long-term”.The committee’s letter comes after Facebook’s vice-president, Richard Allan, announced the company’s plans for a possible UK general election in the next few months. Writing in the Telegraph, Allan promised a “dedicated operations centre” in the UK if an election is declared, to quickly remove content that breaks Facebook’s rules, such as misleading information about the mechanics of the election, or content aimed at encouraging users not to vote at all.Allan also promised a dedicated channel to report harassment for MPs and prospective parliamentary candidates, and a wider selection of adverts contained in the site’s ad library, which will now store adverts about issues including immigration, health and the environment, as well as elections and referenda, as it previously did.Collins’s letter comes on the heels of a major series of announcements by Facebook designed to plan for a US election in 2020, including stricter rules on disclosing who controls a popular page, and new bans on political adverts that attack democracy in general."
OnePlus 7T Pro review: the best kind of deja vu,"Still an absolute beast in every way, even if it’s just a minor update to an already cracking smartphone",Samuel Gibbs,2019-10-22T07:01:16+0100,"The OnePlus 7T Pro is an update to the best phone of the first half of 2019 and the good news is that they haven’t messed up, with tweaks that make it just as good, if not better, than the model it replaces.The bad news is that the updated phone starts at £50 more than its predecessor, at £699, although as it also comes with more storage and RAM; in effect it matches the cost of the earlier mid-range 7 Pro version. It also gains a faster processor, an improved camera and a slightly tweaked paint job.The star of the show is the 6.67in 90Hz QHD+ AMOLED screen, which is just as stunning as it was five months ago. Once you get used to the smoothness of 90Hz display it’s very difficult to go back.The popup selfie camera removes any notch at the top, while the bezels are still thin all round, with curved sides reaching a slim metal band at the sides and a curved glass back. It’s an attractive, incredibly modern-looking design with excellent build quality.The 7T Pro is just as big and heavy as its predecessor: 206g, 162.6mm tall, 75.9mm wide and 8.8mm thick. While much more manageable than Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max (77.8mm wide, 226g) the 7T Pro is still a beast that is right on the limit of usability – those with smaller hands will struggle. The 7T may only be a little bit smaller with its 6.55in screen (74.4mm wide, 190g) but the difference is palpable.Flip the phone over and you’re treated to a slightly lighter but equally gorgeous shade of blue for the glass back. There’s also a new laser focus patch to the left of the vertical camera lump. The USB-C socket in the bottom is the only input for charging or connecting wired headphones.Screen: 6.67in 90Hz QHD AMOLED (516ppi)Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+RAM: 8GB of RAMStorage: 256GB (UFS 3.0)Operating system: OxygenOS 10 based on Android 10Camera: triple rear camera 48MP, 16MP ultra-wide angle, 8MP telephoto, 16MP front-facing cameraConnectivity: LTE, dual sim, Wi-Fiac, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPSDimensions: 162.6 x 75.9 x 8.8mmWeight: 206gThe OnePlus 7T Pro is faster on paper than its predecessor, with Qualcomm’s slightly newer Snapdragon 855+ chip, which has 15% faster graphics and a slightly faster processor.Whether anyone will be able to tell remains to be seen. The OnePlus 7 Pro was already the fastest-feeling phone available, and the 7T Pro is no different, powering through things with an immediacy unrivalled by anything else on the market.There are two versions available. The standard, widely available 7T Pro comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. A McLaren Edition, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, as well as a new black and orange paint job, will also be available in limited quantities.All that speed is backed up by solid battery life of about 32 hours between charges – four hours longer than the OnePlus 7 Pro and enough to last from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two.That was as my primary device, with the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, lots of browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, watching 50 minutes of Into the Badlands on Amazon Prime Video and shooting about 10 photos a day.Despite the glass back, there’s still no wireless charging. Instead, OnePlus has reduced the internal resistance of the battery to make it charge even faster, hitting 70% in 34 minutes and full in just under 70 minutes.The 7T Pro ships out of the box with OxygenOS 10, based on the latest version of Android 10, making it one of the first phones to do so, just like the 7T.OxygenOS continues to set the standard for custom versions of Android from third-party manufacturers, focused on refinement and speed. Full theming support for changing the colour and shape of screens, icons and boxes, including a full dark mode, is new for this version. But it is Google’s new swiping navigation gestures, replacing the custom ones used by OnePlus on previous phones, that are the biggest improvement.Swipe up on a bar at the bottom of the screen to go home, up and hold for recently used apps, or left or right to jump to a previously used app. A swipe in from the left or right side in the lower two-thirds of the screen is now used for going back, which is a vast improvement, making using large-screen phones much easier.The traditional three-button Android navigation bar is available if gestures aren’t your thing. New privacy controls for location data are also welcome.OnePlus offers software support for at least three years from release, including two years of Android version updates and then a further year of security updates on a bi-monthly schedule.The 7T Pro has an even faster version of OnePlus’s excellent in-display optical fingerprint reader, which continues to set the standard for speed and accuracy, matching traditional capacitive sensors and putting everyone else to shame.The 7T Pro has the same triple camera system, combining a 48-megapixel main, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera, as its predecessor and performs similarly.The primary camera is great, capable of capturing some really good, finely detailed and well-exposed shots that aren’t too far away from what you get from the very best on the market. Low-light performance was solid. A revamped version of OnePlus’s Night Scape proved to be more effective and can now be used on the ultra-wide angle camera too.The 3x telephoto camera (which is technically 2.87x rounded up) is also good, but produces noticeably more noise in dull lighting than the main camera. It has optical image stabilisation and 1x more magnification than the cheaper 7T.The 10x digital zoom rivals the best, but isn’t in the same league as Huawei’s 50x zoom. The ultra-wide angle camera was great fun, and the 7T Pro also gains OnePlus’s new super macro mode. Focusing on objects at a minimum of 2.5cm away takes a bit of practice but you can produce some really interesting images, rich in detail the human eye can’t see on its own.Video quality was generally pretty good too, but could be a little yellow in indoor lighting. The popup 16-megapixel fixed-focus selfie camera was also capable of capturing some great, detail-rich images.OnePlus’s excellent alert slider toggles between silent, vibrate and ringThe stereo speakers are some of the bestA screen protector comes pre-applied, while a good clear plastic case is included in the boxThe OnePlus 7T Pro costs £699 in haze blue with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The McLaren Edition with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costs £799.For comparison, the OnePlus 7T costs £549, the Huawei P30 Pro costs £749, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ costs £999 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149.The OnePlus 7T Pro is the best kind of deja vu: an exact copy of arguably the best smartphone of the first half of 2019 with an improved camera, slightly longer battery life and a slightly faster processor.Whether an update was really required is debatable, but OnePlus has made a name for itself with this rapid, six-month refresh schedule.The camera’s new macro mode is great fun and can produce some spectacular images. Android 10’s new gestures have made handling the phone easier, the fingerprint scanner is even faster and having the very latest Snapdragon 855+ processor keeps the 7T Pro at the top of the pile on paper, even if the difference is hard to see.The 7T Pro starts at £50 more than its predecessor, but also comes with more storage and RAM, matching the cost of the mid-range 7 Pro version.It still has the downsides of its predecessor too: there’s no water resistance rating, no wireless charging, no expandable storage or headphone socket, the camera is good, but not quite iPhone 11 Pro standards, and it’s massive and fairly heavy. But that gigantic, gorgeous, fast and notch-free screen is still something to behold and the curved glass and metal band make it just about manageable.Class-leading performance, extremely fast charging and a battery that’ll last 32 hours round out a device that still undercuts rivals and offers a better experience in almost every way. The biggest challenge to the 7T Pro is actually OnePlus’s cheaper (£549), smaller 7T, which offers much the same but is easier to handle.If you want the biggest, best screen, in the fastest, slickest device, that’s the OnePlus 7T Pro. A massive phone still worth stretching for.Pros: stunning screen, superfast performance, fast in-screen fingerprint reader, good battery life, superfast charging, dual sim, good camera, great software, alert sliderCons: glass back but no wireless charging, no IP water resistance rating, no expandable storage, no headphone socket, big and heavyBest smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and rankedSamsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screenSamsung Galaxy Note 10+ review: bigger and now with a magic wandApple iPhone 11 Pro Max review: salvaged by epic battery lifeHuawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery lifeFairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Google to add eye detection to Pixel 4 after privacy concerns,Update will prevent new smartphone being unlocked using owner’s sleeping face,Alex Hern,2019-10-21T13:35:43+0100,"Google has said it will update its new Pixel 4 phones to prevent them being unlocked using the sleeping faces of their owners.The phones, which are not yet in shops, are the first from Google to include a secure face unlock feature, in place of the fingerprint sensor used on previous iterations. The feature is also used to confirm payments and sign in to apps.Unlike the similar feature on iPhones, FaceID, the Pixel face unlock does not require the user to be looking at the phone – or even to have their eyes open.The operating system warns users that “your phone can be unlocked by someone else if it’s held up to your face, even if your eyes are closed”.Google has announced an update that will offer a more secure option. “We’ve been working on an option for users to require their eyes to be open to unlock the phone, which will be delivered in a software update in the coming months,” it told technology website The Verge.“In the meantime, if any Pixel 4 users are concerned that someone may take their phone and try to unlock it while their eyes are closed, they can activate a security feature that requires a pin, pattern or password for the next unlock.”Google’s initial decision was based on a tradeoff between speed and security, with the company focusing more on speed than Apple had when it launched its competing system in 2017 alongside the iPhone X.Apple pointed out that FaceID required user attention to work, preventing what one reporter called the “girlfriend nap” attack, when a suspicious partner could try to unlock the phone of their sleeping partner."
"Tinder boss Elie Seidman: ‘If you behave badly, we want you out’",The dating app has become the go-to tool for singles looking for a ‘hook-up’ rather than a relationship. Its chief executive reckons it can broaden its appeal – but will have to get tough with some users,Alex Hern,2019-10-20T14:00:55+0100,"Swipe right for “would like to meet”, left for “wouldn’t”. Seven years after Tinder made choosing a date as simple as flicking your thumb across a smartphone screen, it is by far the most-used dating app in the UK and the US. Downloaded 300m times and with more than 5 million paying subscribers, it is the highest-grossing app of any kind in the world, according to the analysts App Annie. For Americans, apps and online dating are the most common way to meet a partner. “It’s an amazing responsibility, and an amazing privilege,” says Elie Seidman, Tinder’s 45-year-old chief executive. If he finds it less daunting than others might, that’s because, before he took over Tinder in 2018, he was in charge of OkCupid, the Tinder of the 00s. He has spent much of his working life helping people to find love.“The vast majority of our employees are energised by that very mission,” he says. “We’re not selling plumbing supplies, right? Obviously, plumbing is really important, but ours is a really noble and exciting mission. So, when we’re taking new risks – new challenges, new chances – we know that, if we’re successful, it’s about helping members connect.”At times, though, it has felt as if Tinder has chased that goal with too much passion. Launching on college campuses, before expanding to New York, London and then everywhere, Tinder rapidly gained a reputation as less of a dating app and more of a “hook-up” app: laser-focused at finding users a match as quickly as possible, with minimal fuss between opening the app and getting lucky.In its early days, Tinder leaned into this reputation. Perhaps the most notorious feature was the introduction of a secret “Elo ranking”, a term borrowed from the chess world to describe a way to score people based on their previous matches. With the Tinder version, your score went up a lot if hot people swiped right on you; if ugly people swiped left on you, it went down just as much. Whether or not your matches were hot was based on their own Elo ranking, and so on.Matching hot people to hot people felt like the purest distillation of what Tinder was – and a good summation of the often bro-filled atmosphere in the office in the early days. (This approach continues to shake out in messy legal battles between cofounders, with allegations of sexual harassment blending with claims of share-price manipulation.) In hindsight, Seidman says, this approach was a mistake. Now, rather than how hot a person might be perceived to be, it’s how often they use the app that takes priority – that and location, which, Seidman points out, is hardly an innovation. “My father has a story from when he was growing up in Queens. He was dating a woman who lived on the Upper East Side. She broke up with him because he was ‘geographically undesirable’. So the idea of long commutes being a thing, we see that very clearly. The other one’s age, right? People absolutely filter on age. They also filter on sexual orientation, not surprisingly.”When it comes to the systemic – almost species-level – effects of Tinder, Seidman is happy. “The relationships are much more diverse,” he says, citing a 2017 study from Cornell University which argued that the rise in online dating had resulted in an increase in mixed-race marriages in the US. “For human history, right, we meet people down the street – you know, a mile away, two miles away, church, work, school – and all of a sudden the breadth that you get has been totally changed. That’s a profound shift and a good one.”And, he adds: “The quality of the relationships and the connections that are being made by all accounts is as good or better, according to the University of Chicago.” A 2013 study found that couples who meet online “have happier, longer marriages”.More diverse, happier, longer relationships is certainly a something for the company to boast about. But for many users, these possibilities aren’t worth the stress of using Tinder day-to-day.The app, like most dating services, has many more male users than female users. According to the analytics firm App Ape, more than three-quarters are men – a disparity that is bad for everyone. Men complain about being ignored or mocked when they do get matched with a date. They are the main target of Tinder’s revenue drives, with paid services such as Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold offering users the ability to promote themselves to the top of their likers’ queues and highlight their profiles to others. (Tinder settled a class-action suit this year over age-discriminatory pricing for these features. It had been charging older users more for the same tools.)We’re better at it than we were two or three years ago. It is much harder to misbehave and stay on TinderBut women have it worse. Even putting aside Margaret Atwood’s observation that men worry that women will laugh at them, while women worry that men will kill them, the misogyny on Tinder is the stuff of legend. One 2016 study, from Manchester Metropolitan University, found that straight men who feel “let down” after finding a date was less attractive than her picture saw it as “a licence to use their date as they saw fit”. Meanwhile, dick pics, solicited and otherwise, are so ubiquitous that they are inspiring art. Francesca Harris, a student at the University of Nottingham, used the app to solicit more than 300 (and one headshot of Donald Trump) for her fine-art degree show project, entitled The Modern Male.“We have a really, really, really clear view,” Seidman says, “which is that people who are awful need to be removed from these apps. We have a ton of work in our trust and safety group between tech and people – massive teams of moderators benefiting from AI. We have things in the app to educate people about how to behave. So we’re coming at it from a lot of angles. If you have behaved badly, we want you out – and we want you out as quickly as possible.”Seidman says Tinder’s record has improved. “Without getting into lots of specific details about metrics, which I won’t divulge, we’re much, much, much better at it than we were two or three years ago. It is much harder to misbehave and stay on Tinder.”But if Tinder is getting better at spotting abusive behaviour, and turfing perpetrators off the platform, what about the other side: are people learning to behave better in the first place? “What’s clear is that if you grow up in a world where you are accustomed to digital social – you were on Fortnite with your friends or your friends of friends, or you did FaceTime with your aunt or your grandmother when you were a kid – you don’t think of the digital world as a different world, one where the rules of decorum and the norms of behaviour that we take for granted in a bar or a restaurant just go out the window. It’s not an alternate universe. It’s a part of real life. Every next set of 18- and 19- and 20-year-olds who join Tinder have grown up in a different environment in terms of digital social life.”That generational shift, Seidman says, is crucial to understanding Tinder’s very visual skew, which differentiates it from older services such as OkCupid and has been blamed for the “shallow” nature of the connections it leads to. On OkCupid, when Seidman started, users were asked to fill in enormous questionnaires. An algorithm then purported to match them to those most compatible based on anything from big life choices to opinions on blockbuster movies. On Tinder, by contrast, the basic question is simpler: “Is this person hot?”Seidman argues that this shift is, in part, just a reflection of the changing nature of technology. “The internet has become vastly more visual over the past 20 years, right?” Smartphones played a big part in this because they made it so much easier to upload photos. In fact, if you can remember the net before smartphones, Tinder may well not be for you. Half of the app’s users are under 25 (and, Seidman emphasises, over 18), and signing up for an account as you arrive at university is virtually a rite of passage for Gen Z. With that comes new ambitions.The core of the Tinder interface, with its pictures and swiping, is, Seidman says, designed to replicate the “click” that two people get when they lock eyes for the first time, only in a way that works for a generation that has already used to the idea of socialising online. So what next? The first date. “To what extent can we get the elements, the quality elements of a first date to happen digitally? The thing people are struggling with, is: ‘OK, I’ve got this match. How can I figure out if we’re going to like each other. Do we have anything to talk about? Can we connect and, you know, how’s our chemistry?’ Right? And so can we get more of what you would get and figure out on our first date?”The company’s first exploration into answering those questions is … odd. Swipe Night, running every Sunday in October, is Tinder’s first original video production. As in the Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch, viewers get to pick how the story progresses. Unlike Bandersnatch, they get matched with others on the platform who picked similar outcomes. “We’re saying: ‘Hey, not only is it connections that you make, but we think that the shared experience as a community – of coming together – is a really special one. We think that shared experiences as a community of people is a powerful, important and ancient idea – and it shouldn’t go away.’”As long as those shared experiences don’t involve unwanted dick pics, he may have a point."
What happens if your mind lives for ever on the internet?,"It may be some way off, but mind uploading, the digital duplication of your mental essence, could expand human experience into a virtual afterlife",,2019-10-20T05:30:46+0100,"Imagine that a person’s brain could be scanned in great detail and recreated in a computer simulation. The person’s mind and memories, emotions and personality would be duplicated. In effect, a new and equally valid version of that person would now exist, in a potentially immortal, digital form. This futuristic possibility is called mind uploading. The science of the brain and of consciousness increasingly suggests that mind uploading is possible – there are no laws of physics to prevent it. The technology is likely to be far in our future; it may be centuries before the details are fully worked out – and yet given how much interest and effort is already directed towards that goal, mind uploading seems inevitable. Of course we can’t be certain how it might affect our culture but as the technology of simulation and artificial neural networks shapes up, we can guess what that mind uploading future might be like.Suppose one day you go into an uploading clinic to have your brain scanned. Let’s be generous and pretend the technology works perfectly. It’s been tested and debugged. It captures all your synapses in sufficient detail to recreate your unique mind. It gives that mind a standard-issue, virtual body that’s reasonably comfortable, with your face and voice attached, in a virtual environment like a high-quality video game. Let’s pretend all of this has come true.Who is that second you?The first you, let’s call it the biological you, has paid a fortune for the procedure. And yet you walk out of the clinic just as mortal as when you walked in. You’re still a biological being, and eventually you’ll die. As you drive home, you think: “Well, that was a waste of money.”At the same time, the simulated you wakes up in a virtual apartment and feels like the same old you. It has a continuity of experience. It remembers walking into the clinic, swiping a credit card, signing a waiver, lying on the table. It feels as though it was anaesthetised and then woke up again somewhere else. It has your memories, your personality, your thought patterns and emotional quirks. It sits up in a new bed and says: “I can’t believe it worked! Definitely worth the cost.”I won’t call it an “it” any more, because that mind is a version of you. We’ll call it the simulated you. This “sim” you decides to explore. You step out of your apartment into the sunlight of a perfect day and find a virtual version of New York City. Sounds, smells, sights, people, the feel of the sidewalk underfoot, everything is present – with less garbage though, and the rats are entirely sanitary and put in for local colour. You chat up strangers in a way you would never do in the real New York, where you’d be worried that an impatient pedestrian might punch you in the teeth. Here, you can’t be injured because your virtual body can’t break. You stop at a cafe and sip a latte. It doesn’t taste right. It doesn’t feel like anything is going into your stomach. And nothing is, because it isn’t real food and you don’t have a stomach. It’s all a simulation. The visual detail on the table is imperfect. There’s no grittiness to the rust. Your fingers don’t have fingerprints – they’re smooth, to save memory on fine detail. Breathing doesn’t feel the same. If you hold your breath, you don’t get dizzy, because there is no such thing as oxygen in this virtual world. You find yourself equipped with a complementary simulated smartphone, and you call the number that used to be yours – the phone you had with you, just a few hours ago in your experience, when you walked into the clinic.Culture turns over with each new generation. What happens if the older generations never die?Now the biological you answers the phone.“Yo,” says the sim you. “It’s me. I mean, it’s you. What’s up?”“I’m depressed, that’s what. I’m in my apartment eating ice-cream. I can’t believe I spent all that money for zilch.”“Zilch?! You would not believe what it’s like in here! It’s a fantastic place. Remember Kevin, the guy who died of cancer last week? He’s here too! He’s fine, and he still has the same job. He Skypes with his old yoga studio three times a week, to teach his fitness class. But his girlfriend in the real world has left him for someone who’s not dead yet. Still, lots of new people to date here.”I have to resist getting carried away by the humour of the situation. Underneath the details lies a very real philosophical conundrum that people will eventually have to confront. What is the relationship between bio you and sim you?I prefer a geometric way of thinking about the situation. Imagine that your life is like the rising stalk of the letter Y. You’re born at the base, and as you grow up, your mind is shaped and changed along a trajectory. Then you let yourself be scanned, and from that moment on, the Y has branched. There are now two trajectories, each one equally and legitimately you. Let’s say the left-hand branch is the simulated you and the right-hand branch is the biological you. The part of you that lives indefinitely is represented by both the stem of the Y and the left-hand branch. Just as your childhood self lives on in your adult self, the stem of the Y lives on in the simulated self. Once the scan is over, the two branches of the Y proceed along different life paths, accumulating different experiences. The right-hand branch will die. Everything that happens to it after the branching point fails to achieve immortality – unless it chooses to scan itself again, in which case another branch appears, and the geometry becomes even more complicated.What emerges is not a single you, but a topologically intricate version, a hyper you with two or more branches. One of those branches is always going to be mortal, and the others have an indefinite lifespan depending on how long the computer platform is maintained.You might think that since the bio you lives in the real world, and the sim you lives in a virtual world, the two will never meet and therefore should never encounter any complications from coexisting. But these days, who needs to meet in person? We interact mainly through electronic media anyway. The sim you and the bio you represent two fully functional, interactive, capable instances of you, competing within the same larger, interconnected, social and economic universe. You could easily find yourselves meeting over video conference.At the simplest level, mind uploading would preserve people in an indefinite afterlife. Families could have Christmas dinner with sim Grandma joining in on video conference, the tablet screen propped up at the end of the table – presuming she has time for her bio family any more, given the rich possibilities in the simulated playground. It’s this kind of idealised afterlife that people have in mind, when they think about the benefits of mind uploading. It’s a human-made heaven.But unlike a traditional heaven, it isn’t a separate world. It’s seamlessly connected to the real world. Think of how you interact with the world right now. If you live the typical western lifestyle, then the smallest part of your life involves interacting with people in the physical space around you. Your connection to the larger world is almost entirely through digital means. The news comes to you on a screen or through earbuds. Distant locations are real to you mainly because you learn about them through electronic media. Politicians, celebrities, even some friends and family may exist to you mainly through data. People work in virtual offices where they know their colleagues only through video and text.Each of us might as well already be in a virtual world, with a steady flow of information passing in and out through CNN, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and text. We live in a kind of multiverse, each of us in a different virtual bubble, the bubbles occasionally merging in real space and then separating, but always connected through the global social network. If a virtual afterlife is created, the people in it, with the same personalities and needs that they had in real life, would have no reason to isolate themselves from the rest of us. Very little needs to change for them. Socially, politically, economically, the virtual and the real worlds would connect into one larger and always expanding civilisation. The virtual world might as well be simply another city on Earth, filled with people who have migrated to it.We’ve always lived in a world where culture turns over with each generation. But what happens when the older generations never die, but remain just as active in society? There’s no reason to think that the living will have any political, economic, or intellectual advantage over the simulated.Think of the jobs people have in our world. Many of them require physical action, and those are the jobs that will probably be replaced by automatons. Taxi driver? Publicly shared, self-driving cars are almost here. Street cleaners? Checkout operators? Construction workers? Pilots? All of these jobs are probably for the chopping block in the medium to long term. Robotics and artificial intelligence will take them over. The rest of our jobs, our contributions to the larger world, are done through the mind, and if the mind can be uploaded, it can keep doing the same job. A politician can work from cyberspace just as well as from real space. So can a teacher, or a manager, or a therapist, or a journalist, or the guy in the complaints department.The CEO of a company, a Steve Jobs type who has shaped up a sweet set of neural connections in his brain that makes him exceptional at his work, can manage from a remote, simulated office. If he must shake hands, he can take temporary possession of a humanoid robot, a kind of shared rent-a-bot, and spend a few hours in the real world, meeting and greeting. Even calling it the “real” world sounds prejudicial to me. Both worlds would be equally real. Maybe the better term is the “foundation” world and the “cloud” world.The foundation world would be full of people who are mere youngsters – mainly under the age of 80 – who are still accumulating valuable experience. Their unspoken responsibility would be to gain wisdom and experience before joining the ranks of the cloud world. The balance of power and culture would shift rapidly to the cloud. How could it not? That’s where the knowledge, experience and political connections will accumulate. In that scenario, the foundation world becomes a kind of larval stage for immature minds, and the cloud world is where life really begins. Mind uploading could transform our culture and civilisation more profoundly than anything in our past.Michael SA Graziano is a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Princeton University• Rethinking Consciousness: A Scientific Theory of Subjective Experience by Michael SA Graziano is published by WW Norton & Company (£21).

Campaign to stop 'killer robots' takes peace mascot to UN,Robot Wars survivor David Wreckham has found new purpose as the face of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots,Henry McDonald,2019-10-21T06:00:21+0100,"An international campaign takes its battle to outlaw “killer robots” to the UN this week with a new ally – a “peace robot”.Created by an inventor from the BBC programme Robot Wars, the droid, known as David Wreckham, has been recruited to deliver a message to world leaders in New York on Monday.The robot will drop a letter to UN diplomats demanding that robots not guided by human remote control which could accidentally start wars or cause mass atrocities should be outlawed by the same type of international treaty that bans chemical weapons.Unlike drones, which are controlled by military teams often thousands of miles away from where they are deployed, critics say that autonomous killer robots have the potential to do disastrous things they were not originally programmed for.Wreckham will also visit the Manhattan headquarters of hi-tech corporations, calling on them to desist from developing technologies for autonomous weapons.Ray Tait built the robot out of old saucepans, the motor for an electric wheelchair and a soap dish for a mouth back in 2003.“It has been in retirement in my garage up in Suffolk for years,” he said as he prepared to fly out to New York with a delegation from the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots for their Monday meeting with global leaders.“Wreckham was never built as a fighting robot and was meant to do other things, like play football at the Olympics for Robots on a pilot programme called Techno Games.“They only made the pilot programmes and then the show was cancelled because of cuts at the BBC. So poor old Wreckham went into the garage and looked like he’d never get out of it ever again.”However, a call from Tait’s friend Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield and a prominent campaigner against killer robots, resurrected Wreckham. “Noel asked me if his campaign group could use the robot as a kind of mascot for the campaign, to represent the good side of robots and what they can do for humanity. I agreed instantly, as I entirely support the aims of the campaign,” said Tait.“The capacity for autonomous machines designed to kill to go completely out of control is massive. Even human remote-controlled machines like drones do strange things you don’t expect. I have seen my drone behave oddly and go wrong when I was flying it near pylons. It had gone out of control. But this could be much worse with an autonomous weapon or “killer robot” because there is no one who can press a button with an automatic kill-switch to destroy it if it gets out of control.”Clare Conboy, the communications director for the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, said they had recruited Wreckham to “show that not all robots are going to be as friendly as he is”.Conboy said 26 heads of state and 21 Nobel peace prize laureates have backed their campaign to have killer robots banned in international law.During his trip to New York, Wreckham will also visit Times Square alongside a delegation including the UN under-secretary general and high representative for disarmament, Izumi Nakimitsu, Nobel peace prize laureate Jody Williams, Sharkey, tech worker Liz O’ Sullivan, and youth campaigner Mariana Sanz.In contrast to military AI killing machines, Tait described his android as “the peace robot fighting for a cause I believe in”.As for his invention’s name, he added: “Yes, he is named after David Beckham, because I loved watching him play football. Wreckham wasn’t too bad a player on that programme either, so the name was obvious.”"
OnePlus 7T review: the new cut-price flagship king,"Competition-beating performance, super-smooth experience and new 90Hz screen are a steal at £549",Samuel Gibbs,2019-10-16T07:00:16+0100,"The OnePlus 7T takes the best bits of the brilliant OnePlus 7 Pro and condenses them into a smaller, cheaper package.Released less than four months after the last version hit the shelves, the new £500 7T doesn’t mess much with the winning formula, simply adding a better camera and market-leading 90Hz screen technology.OnePlus launches new phones every six months or so, typically with improved specifications and small tweaks to the design. While the 6T to 7 transition wasn’t a particularly big step other than a new processor and faster fingerprint scanner, the 7T brings the 90Hz screen from the 7 Pro to the smaller, cheaper device.Although you probably couldn’t tell unless put side by side with its predecessors, the 7T is 4mm longer, with a screen that’s slightly taller, and with a smaller widow’s peak notch for the selfie camera. Some 18 months on, the design still feels fresh, particularly compared with some phones with massive notches.The 90Hz 6.55in Fluid AMOLED screen is the star of the show. It’s very bright, smooth and a pleasure to use. At Full HD+, it’s less pixel dense than the QHD+ screen on the 7 Pro, but you’d be hard pressed to tell, and the screen is flat, not curved at the edges, which is less visually arresting, though some might prefer it in use.The front glass meets a polished metal band at at the sides, while the curved glass back and narrow 74.4mm width make the OnePlus 7T one of the easiest large-screen smartphones to hold, particularly when compared with the 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro.The back also has a new large circular lump containing a new triple camera system, which looks fairly attractive, though you can feel it with your fingers in normal use.Screen: 6.55in FHD+ 90Hz Fluid AMOLED (402ppi)Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+RAM: 8GB of RAMStorage: 128 or 256GB (UFS 3.0)Operating system: OxygenOS 10Camera: 48MP + 12MP + 16MP triple rear camera, 16MP selfie cameraConnectivity: USB-C (3.1) LTE, dual sim, wifi ac, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPSDimensions: 160.9 x 74.4 x 8.1mmWeight: 190gNew for the 7T is a bump to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855+ chip, which has 15% faster graphics and a slightly faster CPU, but is otherwise the same as the Snapdragon 855 in the 7, and many other smartphones this year.In the UK, the rest of the specifications have been reduced to one option: 8GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS3.0 storage, with a 256GB version available elsewhere, effectively eliminating the cheapest 6GB RAM configuration from its predecessor.The phone absolutely flies. Every action has a sense of immediacy that’s unrivalled in the smartphone industry. Now with the 90Hz display, everything is even smoother and more enjoyable – even mundane things such as scrolling through web pages or social media posts are pleasurable.Battery life on the 7T is slightly worse than the 34 hours of the 7. The new 7T lasts 31 hours between charges with medium to heavy usage: 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours of browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 90 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and about 15 photos.That means the 7T reliably makes it from 7am on day one until 2pm on day two. There’s no wireless charging, but the improved Warp Charge 30T technology sees the 7T hit full charge in 60 minutes from flat, which is half an hour less than the previous version and one of the fastest available.The OnePlus 7T ships with Oxygen OS10, which is based on the very latest Android 10, making it one of the first smartphones on sale to use it.OxygenOS continues to be one of the best implementations of Android, focusing on speed and customisation. New for version 10 is a complete theming engine, which in addition to the usual wallpaper changes, allows you to customise the colours of buttons, the background, the shape of icons and dialogue boxes, the font, the ambient clock display and even the fingerprint scanner animation.Also new is the integration of Google’s new Android 10 gesture navigation, which eschews the traditional three-button or two-button navigation system for a new gesture bar. Swipe up on the bar to go home, up and hold for recently-used apps, or left or right to jump to a previously-used app. A swipe in from the left or right sides in the lower two-thirds of the screen is now used for going back.Some may hate the new gestures, but the back swipe in from the side makes using a large smartphone a lot easier. You can hide the bar altogether or switch to the old-style three-button navigation bar.OnePlus has made its market-leading in-display optical fingerprint scanner even quicker and more accurate than it was on the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro. Given how many times you unlock your phone or authenticate in an app with your fingerprint, speed and accuracy make a huge difference to the overall experience.The OnePlus 7T matches the performance of traditional capacitive sensors and puts everyone else to shame. This is how it’s done.New for the 7T is the triple camera system on the back. The main 48-megapixel camera has optical image stabilisation, and is joined by a 12-megapixel 2x telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide camera.The combination allows you to shoot photos and video at 0.6, 1 or 2x optical zoom or up to 10x digital zoom.The results are very similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro, with the main camera capable of producing some great photos, full of detail, with solid low-light performance. The Night Scape low-light mode is improved too, although still can’t hold a candle to Google or Apple’s versions.The 2x telephoto camera is noticeably sharper in good lighting than the 7 Pro’s 3x, but still worse than the main camera in less-than-ideal lighting. The 10x digital zoom matches the quality of competitors. The ultrawide angle camera continues to be fun and suffers from less lens distortion at the edges than others.New for the 7T is a class-leading macro mode that can focus at a minimum distance of 2.5cm from the ultrawide angle camera. That’s about a quarter of the distance of most and produces some simply astounding, highly-detailed macro shots with a bit of practice. If you’re at all into macro photography, you will absolutely love this feature.While generally good, the camera can be a bit unpredictable, over-exposing some scenes and often being far brighter indoors than you’d expect. A little manual adjustment is often required to get the photo just right.Portrait mode lags behind competitors, matching the performance of the top phones from a few years ago. The 16-megapixel fixed focus selfie camera is pretty good, capturing a good amount of detail in varying light conditions.Video capture up to 4K at 60 frames per second was good, but not quite up to par with the best, while the 960fps slow motion was fun with bright lighting.The screen comes with a pre-installed screen protector, but it creates a sharp edge over which you have to swipeThe OnePlus alert slider on the side of the phone continues to be wonderful, if a little smaller this time aroundThe included TPU case is one of the best I’ve seen bundled with a phoneThe “shelf” in OxygenOS continues to be not worth using, and would be better replaced by Google’s Discover feedThe first 7T tested had a fault with the screen displaying colour inconsistency manifesting as a green tint to the dark greys used in dark mode in various appsThe OnePlus 7T costs £549 in glacier blue or frosted silver shipping from 17 October.For comparison, the OnePlus 7T Pro costs £699, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs £799, the Samsung S10e costs £669, the Honor 20 Pro costs £550, the Google Pixel 3a XL costs £469, and the iPhone XR costs £629.Simply put, the OnePlus 7T is the cut-price flagship phone to beat. It offers the same super-fast performance and silky smooth 90Hz screen experience as the bar-raising OnePlus 7 Pro, but in a smaller, lighter and cheaper package.At 6.55in the screen is still large, bright and good-looking, squeezed into a more manageable body. The battery life is solid, if not class-leading. The camera is capable of capturing some great-looking photos but can’t match the best in the industry. You get the class-leading in-screen fingerprint scanner, excellent OxygenOS software with at least three years of updates, and seriously fast charging.It doesn’t feel quite as luxurious in the hand as the 7 Pro, nor does it have the wow factor of the its gigantic, notchless screen, but it’s also significantly cheaper, even if it starts at £50 more than its predecessor.At £549 the OnePlus 7T is a bargain, offering an experience that is simply unrivalled by anything remotely near it in price.Pros: the fastest performance, brilliant screen, dual sim, good camera, great macro mode, Bluetooth 5, Android 10, great software, tiny notch, super-fast in-screen fingerprint sensor, alert sliderCons: glass back but no wireless charging, no IP water resistance rating, no expandable storage, no headphone socketBest smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and rankedSamsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper oneOnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every wayHonor 20 Pro review: it’s all about the cameraApple iPhone 11 review: an iPhone XR with a better cameraFairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

"Yawning Face: finally, an emoji that embodies life in 2019","Tired? Bored? Supremely unconcerned? Thanks to the latest rollout of digital icons, soon we’ll all be able to express our lack of enthusiasm in tiny circular form",,2019-10-14T15:20:53+0100,"Name: Yawning Face emoji.Age: Unveiled 224 days ago, as part of Emoji 12.0. Appearance: Whatever.I think you should at least make an effort to describe it. It’s like a smiley face, but yawning. Happy?And it’s new, is it? Honestly, it’s just not that big a deal.I’d just like to know where it comes from, is all. It’s a really boring story.Still. Fine: like all emojis, the yawning emoji was born of a two-year process that starts with a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, an international nonprofit organisation that sets the standard for the representation of characters across various programmes and platforms.You’re kidding. I wish. In its most recent annual update, Unicode announced the introduction of Yawning Face – AKA U+1F971 – along with dozens of other emojis.But who proposes new emojis in the first place? Anyone can submit a proposal, but successful emojis must meet all the criteria.Which criteria? Emojis must be graphically legible when very small, and they have to be useful.What possible communicative uses could there be for a yawning emoji? Actually, now that it’s here, I can’t think of an occasion on which I wouldn’t use it.Because you’re tired all the time? Tired, or bored, or supremely unconcerned, or merely underwhelmed, or peremptorily dismissive of enthusiasm shown by others.I see what you mean. What did we ever do without a yawning emoji? I can’t remember. I think we used to type out the word “yawn”.Every time? How tiresome. Exactly. Yawn.Where is it, though? I can’t find a yawning face among the sea of little round emoting heads on my phone’s menu. That’s probably because you’ve got an iPhone. Each “vendor” is responsible for adding the new batches of emojis and Apple hasn’t done so yet. Yawning Face will be included in the iOS 13.2 update, which is due out imminently; it has been rolled out on Twitter and Facebook, as well as Microsoft, Samsung and Google devices.So, what other fun and useful emojis can we expect this autumn? There are some new hearing aid and wheelchair symbols, while the Holding Hands emoji will be available in 75 permutations of gender and skin tone. Also garlic, a plate of falafel and a five-string banjo.Huh. What if I wanted specifically to reference a four-string banjo? There’s still time to get your proposal in for next year.Do say: “I couldn’t care less about the new Yawning Face emoji [Yawning Face emoji].”Don’t say: “Man, I stayed up so late last night! U+1F971 U+1F971 U+1F971.”"
"Without encryption, we will lose all privacy. This is our new battleground","The US, UK and Australia are taking on Facebook in a bid to undermine the only method that protects our personal information",Edward Snowden,2019-10-15T06:00:40+0100,"In every country of the world, the security of computers keeps the lights on, the shelves stocked, the dams closed, and transportation running. For more than half a decade, the vulnerability of our computers and computer networks has been ranked the number one risk in the US Intelligence Community’s Worldwide Threat Assessment – that’s higher than terrorism, higher than war. Your bank balance, the local hospital’s equipment, and the 2020 US presidential election, among many, many other things, all depend on computer safety.And yet, in the midst of the greatest computer security crisis in history, the US government, along with the governments of the UK and Australia, is attempting to undermine the only method that currently exists for reliably protecting the world’s information: encryption. Should they succeed in their quest to undermine encryption, our public infrastructure and private lives will be rendered permanently unsafe.In the simplest terms, encryption is a method of protecting information, the primary way to keep digital communications safe. Every email you write, every keyword you type into a search box – every embarrassing thing you do online – is transmitted across an increasingly hostile internet. Earlier this month the US, alongside the UK and Australia, called on Facebook to create a “backdoor”, or fatal flaw, into its encrypted messaging apps, which would allow anyone with the key to that backdoor unlimited access to private communications. So far, Facebook has resisted this.If internet traffic is unencrypted, any government, company, or criminal that happens to notice it can – and, in fact, does – steal a copy of it, secretly recording your information for ever. If, however, you encrypt this traffic, your information cannot be read: only those who have a special decryption key can unlock it.I know a little about this, because for a time I operated part of the US National Security Agency’s global system of mass surveillance. In June 2013 I worked with journalists to reveal that system to a scandalised world. Without encryption I could not have written the story of how it all happened – my book Permanent Record – and got the manuscript safely across borders that I myself can’t cross. More importantly, encryption helps everyone from reporters, dissidents, activists, NGO workers and whistleblowers, to doctors, lawyers and politicians, to do their work – not just in the world’s most dangerous and repressive countries, but in every single country.When I came forward in 2013, the US government wasn’t just passively surveilling internet traffic as it crossed the network, but had also found ways to co-opt and, at times, infiltrate the internal networks of major American tech companies. At the time, only a small fraction of web traffic was encrypted: six years later, Facebook, Google and Apple have made encryption-by-default a central part of their products, with the result that today close to 80% of web traffic is encrypted. Even the former director of US national intelligence, James Clapper, credits the revelation of mass surveillance with significantly advancing the commercial adoption of encryption. The internet is more secure as a result. Too secure, in the opinion of some governments.Donald Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, who authorised one of the earliest mass surveillance programmes without reviewing whether it was legal, is now signalling an intention to halt – or even roll back – the progress of the last six years. WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, already uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE): in March the company announced its intention to incorporate E2EE into its other messaging apps – Facebook Messenger and Instagram – as well. Now Barr is launching a public campaign to prevent Facebook from climbing this next rung on the ladder of digital security. This began with an open letter co-signed by Barr, UK home secretary Priti Patel, Australia’s minister for home affairs and the US secretary of homeland security, demanding Facebook abandon its encryption proposals.If Barr’s campaign is successful, the communications of billions will remain frozen in a state of permanent insecurity: users will be vulnerable by design. And those communications will be vulnerable not only to investigators in the US, UK and Australia, but also to the intelligence agencies of China, Russia and Saudi Arabia – not to mention hackers around the world.End-to-end encrypted communication systems are designed so that messages can be read only by the sender and their intended recipients, even if the encrypted – meaning locked – messages themselves are stored by an untrusted third party, for example, a social media company such as Facebook.The central improvement E2EE provides over older security systems is in ensuring the keys that unlock any given message are only ever stored on the specific devices at the end-points of a communication – for example the phones of the sender or receiver of the message – rather than the middlemen who own the various internet platforms enabling it. Since E2EE keys aren’t held by these intermediary service providers, they can no longer be stolen in the event of the massive corporate data breaches that are so common today, providing an essential security benefit. In short, E2EE enables companies such as Facebook, Google or Apple to protect their users from their scrutiny: by ensuring they no longer hold the keys to our most private conversations, these corporations become less of an all-seeing eye than a blindfolded courier.It is striking that when a company as potentially dangerous as Facebook appears to be at least publicly willing to implement technology that makes users safer by limiting its own power, it is the US government that cries foul. This is because the government would suddenly become less able to treat Facebook as a convenient trove of private lives.To justify its opposition to encryption, the US government has, as is traditional, invoked the spectre of the web’s darkest forces. Without total access to the complete history of every person’s activity on Facebook, the government claims it would be unable to investigate terrorists, drug dealers money launderers and the perpetrators of child abuse – bad actors who, in reality, prefer not to plan their crimes on public platforms, especially not on US-based ones that employ some of the most sophisticated automatic filters and reporting methods available.The true explanation for why the US, UK and Australian governments want to do away with end-to-end encryption is less about public safety than it is about power: E2EE gives control to individuals and the devices they use to send, receive and encrypt communications, not to the companies and carriers that route them. This, then, would require government surveillance to become more targeted and methodical, rather than indiscriminate and universal.What this shift jeopardises is strictly nations’ ability to spy on populations at mass scale, at least in a manner that requires little more than paperwork. By limiting the amount of personal records and intensely private communications held by companies, governments are returning to classic methods of investigation that are both effective and rights-respecting, in lieu of total surveillance. In this outcome we remain not only safe, but free.• Edward Snowden is former CIA officer and whistleblower, and author of Permanent Record.

Nir Eyal on how to beat tech addiction: ‘We need a new skill set’,The behavioural scientist has advised tech companies on how to get people hooked – now he’s telling us how to break the habit,Arwa Mahdawi,2019-10-12T12:00:25+0100,"I am 10 minutes late for my interview with behavioural scientist Nir Eyal, and run into the Manhattan cafe where we’re meeting, a dishevelled and apologetic mess. Being late is never ideal, but it’s particularly embarrassing because I’m meeting Eyal to discuss his new book, Indistractable: How To Control Your Attention And Choose Your Life, a guide to staying focused in an age of constant distraction. The hope is that he will teach me, a chronic procrastinator, how to stop wasting my life scrolling through my phone, and finally write that novel. Or, at the very least, be on time for appointments.Dressed in Tech Dad chic – a crisp button-down shirt and jeans – Eyal already has coffee and looks busy when I burst in. He dropped his daughter off at science camp this morning, he explains, which is why he picked this spot; he hopes it wasn’t inconvenient. And I shouldn’t worry about being late: “Maybe you can use it in your article, as your introduction.” Obviously, I will have time to think of a better introduction, but I thank him anyway.Until recently, Eyal was what MIT Technology Review called “Silicon Valley’s most visible advocate of habit-forming technology”. His first book, Hooked: How To Build Habit Forming Products (2013), became a must-read in advertising and tech circles. Eyal has spent the years since helping companies – from small workout apps such as Fitbod, to Microsoft and PayPal – manipulate user behaviour. The “hook model” he developed advocates building a “mind monopoly” by associating a product with internal emotional triggers, such as loneliness or a fear of missing out. The developer’s goal is that people are triggered to use the product “with little conscious thought”. Now that we’re all addicted to our devices, he is bringing out a book that will help us get unhooked.Eyal gets a little defensive when I offer up this analysis. Hooked, he stresses, was about building positive habits; it urged companies to improve people’s lives. He even developed what he called a “manipulation matrix”, a flow-chart that would let companies see if they were using the Hooked model in an ethical way. Further, he says, we need to stop using the word “addicted” when it comes to technology – because most of us aren’t addicted at all; we’re just guilty of overuse. “Addiction, in people’s minds, means mind control,” he says. “When you tell yourself, this is addicting me, this is hijacking my brain… you slough off responsibility. It’s called learned helplessness.” There’s a lot of scare-mongering around technology at the moment, he adds, “particularly from people who want to sell clicks and thrive on the economics of fear”. But the more mundane truth, he says, is that there is “no mind control”. Our brains aren’t being hijacked.“Hijacking is what happened on 9/11,” Eyal scoffs. “It’s not Facebook – give me a break.” It’s amazing, he adds, that people don’t see that the alarm around tech is just a repeat of a very old storyline. “In the 1950s, fearmongers were saying the exact same thing about comic books, literally verbatim: it’s reducing kids’ attention spans; it’s causing them to commit suicide; it’s leading to mental health issues.” Distraction, he stresses, is an age-old problem that is far bigger than technology. He cites a 2014 study led by professors at the University of Virginia and published in the journal Science: when left alone in a room containing nothing but an electric shock device, 67% of men and 25% of women gave themselves painful electric shocks to pass the time. We go to great lengths to avoid sitting alone with our thoughts or dealing with internal discomfort. If we want to avoid distraction, we can’t just throw our phones away or go on a digital detox; we need to deal with the psychological reasons we’re looking for distraction in the first place.And this, really, is the central thesis of Indistractible: stop blaming technology for your personal failings and start blaming yourself. Fair enough, but isn’t this letting today’s tech companies shirk responsibility? The constant urge many of us to have to check our phones is very much by design. Can we really compare today’s technology, which touches every aspect of our lives, to comic books and TV?Look, Eyal says, the fact we’re all carrying smartphones means that “distraction is easier than ever to find”. But he stresses that “This doesn’t mean we’re powerless – it means we need a new skill set.” His book contains lots of tactical tips for dealing with external triggers such as smartphone notifications; but, most importantly, he thinks, it addresses the psychological “internal triggers” that tech companies are exploiting. “The big life lesson here is to look for root causes,” Eyal says. “You need to aim to spend a little time with your feelings.”Everything, from when I start work to walking the dog, is mapped out. I allocate two minutes for a pat on the backI promise Eyal that as soon as I leave our meeting I’m going to spend time with my feelings. In the meantime, what’s the quickest thing I can do to stop being distracted? “Timeboxing,” Eyal says. Instead of relying on to-do lists, I should complete an exercise that involves planning out every minute of my week. And by that, I mean every minute: from what time you start eating breakfast to how long you have to socialise with your significant other in the evening. “You have no right to call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from,” is Eyal’s mantra.Timeboxing could even be the answer to gender equality. Eyal says he spent years fighting with his wife about domestic responsibility. He always thought he pulled his weight, until they both did a timeboxing exercise and he realised that “like most women in heterosexual relationships, she was doing more household admin than I was”.There are various timeboxing apps and templates out there (including Clockify and FocusList) but I start by using Google calendar to schedule a week full of tasks. Everything, from what time I start writing to when I walk the dog, is neatly mapped out. I allocate two minutes to give myself a pat on the back: finally, I am leaving my procrastinating ways behind. But that’s enough work for today; I’ll get to the really hard stuff tomorrow.The new me gets off to a fairly good start. I sit down to work – on schedule – at 9am sharp, and start writing. About 20 minutes in, I get a strong urge to get up and make tea. Eyal has prepared me for this: the first thing to do when distraction hits, he says, is to figure out what’s causing it. “There are only three reasons for a distraction,” he adds. “An internal trigger, an external trigger or a planning problem.”Honestly, my need for another cup of tea is probably the sign of caffeine addiction; but for the purposes of this exercise I classify it as an “internal trigger”. According to Eyal, the first thing to do when you have an intrusive thought is to focus on the emotion that precedes it and write it down. I dutifully write: “Ugh, I can’t be bothered.” The next step is to spend 10 minutes “surfing the urge” to give in to your distraction, and to figure out why you feel like this. If you still want to give in at the end, then you should just do it. There’s no point, Eyal says, in being “militantly abstinent”. This is not a problem I’ve ever suffered from.When Eyal first told me to “surf the urge”, I scoffed. It sounded extremely Californian and a complete waste of time. However, it is a technique psychologists use to help patients with addiction, and has some scientific backing; one study found that smokers who tried it reduced the number of cigarettes consumed. Paradoxical as it may seem, zooming in on your internal discomfort can actually make it go away. My own experiment certainly reduced my personal tea consumption for the day; more importantly, it reminded me that I don’t need to give in to every impulse. I hate to sound like a deodorant advert, but it was sort of empowering.At 10am, a calendar notification pops up. I’ve scheduled 10 minutes to check my email. Eyal calls email the “mother of all habit-forming products”, one of several technologies he refers to in the book as “slot machines”. The uncertainty of what’s in our inbox means we’re constantly checking it, but most email is a complete waste of time. According to a study Eyal cites, by management consultants Bain & Co, 25% of our time spent on email is consumed with reading things that shouldn’t have been sent, and 25% is spent responding to things that don’t need to be answered. Eyal advises checking your messages only at specific times and labelling incoming emails “reply today” or “reply this week”. This, he says, has cut down the time he spends on email by 90%. I am hopeful that it will do the same for me, but it takes me for ever to figure out how to label my emails and I am interrupted in the middle by a calendar notification telling me it’s time to eat the leftovers in the fridge. Obviously, I must stick to my schedule, so email organisation will have to wait.Most of us have times in our day when we’re more likely to slack off, and so need some extra motivation. Eyal recommends using “pre-commitments” to make this sort of unwanted behaviour more difficult. This might mean using an app to prevent you accessing certain websites at specified times, or scheduling focused work sessions with friends or colleagues. If you work from home, there is also a tool called Focusmate (in which Eyal has invested) where you spend 50 minutes virtually co-working with a stranger, keeping an eye on each other via your webcams.In order to avoid my usual afternoon slump, I sign up for a 3pm session and am matched with a regular Focusmate user called Isabelle. At the beginning of the session we tell each other our goals – she’s working on copy for her website – and then we get on with it. Having a stranger watch you work sounds deeply weird, but you quickly get over that, and it does make you feel more accountable. I even found myself sitting up straighter; I didn’t want Isabelle to think that I slouched.The route to a healthier relationship with technology isn’t necessarily going cold turkey; it’s learning moderationI spend the next couple of weeks trying out every one of Eyal’s tips. I make myself a “concentration crown” so that my girlfriend knows when I’m focusing and won’t talk to me. (She talks to me anyway and the crown makes me feel stupid.) I “hack back” my iPhone by adjusting my notification settings, reducing “external triggers” from apps. (This is super easy and makes a big difference.) I keep on surfing my urges.A month later, I have a follow-up call with Eyal to discuss my progress – or lack of it. I regretfully inform him that the thing I have struggled with most is timeboxing. Things kept coming up that would throw my schedule off, and I’d get frustrated and give up. Eyal tells me to be persistent and build buffers into my schedule. Most of all, I shouldn’t make excuses: “We can find reasons why timeboxing doesn’t work even when it does.” I feel like I’m being told off by the headmaster. However, Eyal is persuasive and I think I’ve reached a happy medium; not every minute of my day is planned out, but I’ve got better at scheduling tasks rather than making vague to-do lists.So what’s the verdict: have I become more focused? I filed this article very late, which probably answers that question. But there’s no denying that Eyal’s book is a refreshing antidote to the advice that we should all be buying flip phones and digital detoxing. The route to a healthier relationship with technology isn’t necessarily going cold turkey; it’s learning moderation and good habits. Does Eyal place responsibility too squarely on the individual? There must be some middle ground. While we can’t blame tech companies for everything, we must keep holding them to account for the ways in which they are getting us hooked. Silicon Valley will not change its behaviour by itself. Learning new skills to avoid digital distraction is all very well – but it shouldn’t distract us from the bigger problem.• Nir Eyal is delivering a Guardian Masterclass on how to focus in an age of distraction, on 15 October, at the Guardian, Kings Place, London N1.

"Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra, Beats and Anker compared and ranked",Our updated list of great bluetooth truly wireless earbuds – at the best prices right now ,Samuel Gibbs,2019-09-26T07:01:39+0100,"

It wasn’t long ago that true wireless earbuds, those that don’t need any wires even between the earphones, weren’t very good. Solid connectivity was a challenge, dropouts were infuriatingly common and battery life was woeful.But they all offered that taste of freedom from wires that is like a ratchet – once you’ve experienced tangle-free listening, you’ll never go back.Now there are loads of truly wireless earbuds on the market offering all sorts of features, designs and sound. None of them are bargain basement, and it’s difficult to know which ones are worth buying. So here’s a guide to separate the wheat from the chaff.This Guardian buyer’s guide to true wireless earbuds was last updated on 26 September, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right earbuds for you.Welcome to one of the Guardian’s new buyer’s guides. This article represents hundreds of hours of testing by the author to bring together a succinct list of recommended products or services so you can pick from the best and ignore the rest without having to do hours of your own research.While the Guardian may earn a small commission from items bought through affiliate links, the items featured in this buyer's guide have been tested and included without influence from any advertiser or commercial initiative.RRP: £139 / $130★★★★★Nailing the combination of connectivity, sound, in-ear comfort, controls and case size has proved far more difficult for truly wireless earbuds than you might expect. Thankfully Samsung has managed it on the third try.The Galaxy Buds are small, light and comfortable earbuds, with a traditional silicone tip on one end and a small body that sits within your concha, even if you have fairly small ears, allowing you to completely forget about them. They come with a series of soft stabilising wings if you need them, but stay put perfectly fine without them.A touchpad on the outside takes care of controls. Tap to pause or play, double and triple-tap to skip track. A touch and hold gesture can be switched between turning on or temporarily piping ambient sound into the earbuds, triggering your voice assistant or to change the volume (left to go down, right to turn it up). Take both earbuds out and the music automatically pauses. It all works very well, although I wish you could trigger ambient sound on pause.The Galaxy Buds sound pretty good too, with reasonable sound isolation and a well-rounded tone most will like. They’re fairly balanced, not overly dominated by bass or treble, with good separation and punch where needed. The buds are capable of uncomfortable volume levels when cranked right up and there’s a limited EQ available in the Galaxy Wearable app. Audiophiles might turn their noses up, but they sound good compared with the competition at this price.Bluetooth connectivity between the buds and to the phone is rock solid, regardless of whether you’re using a Samsung or other phone. They can be used as a stereo pair, individually and hot-swapped between left and right in mono without skipping a beat, even when on a call – something only Apple’s AirPods have been capable of until now. The Galaxy Buds support AAC and Samsung’s proprietary scalable codec for high-quality music, with no noticeable lipsync issues even when connected to a non-Samsung device. Call quality is good, but a little distant similar to when you’re on speaker phone.Even the case is really good. It flips open and closed with a satisfying snap, is small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans and provides just over one full charge of the earbuds. Combined that means the Galaxy Buds will last up to six hours of continuous playback with an additional seven hours in the case. In practice that means having to charge them once a week for the commute via the USB-C port or even wireless charging on any Qi-compatible pad or phone.Pairing with an Android phone with Samsung’s Galaxy Wearable app installed is as easy as opening them up and waiting for the prompt. Everything else needs a quick trip into the settings menu like any other Bluetooth device. They worked well with various Android phones, PCs, iPads and iPhones.When paired with an Android phone you can also get the Galaxy Buds to read out notifications, which is far more useful than it sounds; if you limit the number of apps, that can interrupt your music to just a few. There’s no iOS app for changing settings, which means you need at least one Android, PC or Mac in your life to make sure they’re up to date.Why should I buy them?The Galaxy Buds offer the best combination of sound, connectivity, size, comfort case and price, making them the ones to buy for Android unless you don’t like canal-buds.Buy if: you want a simple set of truly wireless earbuds that just workDon’t buy if: you only use iOS or don’t like canal-budsRRP: £220 / $230★★★★★Third time’s the charm for Sony. The WF-1000XM3 finally live up to the Sony heritage with not only effective noise cancelling but truly great sound too.The M3 part of the name aligns them with Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM3 headphones, which have class-leading sound and noise cancelling. The true wireless earbud version inherits the same noise cancelling chip and are almost as effective, reducing or eliminating train, road and plane noise, leaving you free to listen to your music at lower, more comfortable volumes.The sound sparkles with detail, energy and clarity, while punchy bass produces a lovely full sound, just edging out the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless.Bluetooth 5 means connectivity is strong and lipsync issues have been eliminated. While the design is attractive, particularly in the black and copper colour, the earbuds are massive and took a bit of trial and error to get the fit right with the correct earbud tip (seven pairs are included). Controls are good, but lack volume on the earbud. Touch and hold one to activate ambient passthrough to listen out for announcements.Battery life is solid too, lasting up to six hours with noise cancelling active or eight with it off, and up to 32 hours with trips in the case. Like the earbuds the case is also fairly large and difficult to pocket. They’re not cheap, but if you want genuinely great sound, the WF-1000XM3 are the ones to buy.Why should you buy them?Brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid connectivity, complemented by solid battery life and an attractive design, the WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding true wireless earbuds yet.Buy if: you want the best sound and great noise cancellingDon’t but if: you want something smaller and more pocket-friendlyFull review: Sony WF-1000XM3 review: noise-cancelling earbuds sound greatRRP: £159 or £199 / $159 or $199★★★★★If you don’t like blocking out the world, or can’t get on with canal-bud style earphones that enter your ear, look no further than Apple’s AirPods, now in their second generation.They gently rest in your ear with little white stalks sticking down, projecting the sound down your ear holes rather than sitting directly in them. As a consequence you can hear everything happening around you meaning you won’t be able to hear your music on something as loud as the tube in London, and if cranked up to maximum they bleed sound, although not as badly as Apple’s non-wireless EarPods. They sound pretty good considering the lack of isolation, with reasonable bass and clarity.The AirPods work best with Apple gear, automatically syncing pairing across any Apple devices you might have, but can also be paired with Android or other devices. Connectivity is rock solid with an iPhone and recent Android devices and PCs.Where they fall down is on-board controls - there’s basically just one, a double tap. When connected to a non-iPhone it pauses or plays music. Hooked up to an iOS device you have the option to trigger Siri, pause or skip track on each earbud, which means one can summon Siri while the other pauses. There’s no volume control. Take them out and it pauses the music.With the second generation AirPods you can also just say “Hey Siri” at any time without having to tap anything to activate Apple’s voice assistant. After having to re-teach Siri to recognise my voice, it generally worked well, even with music blasting out. But Siri can be a little slow, particularly when you have poor connectivity on your smartphone. You also get odd looks doing so on public transport.The AirPods’ other strengths are that you can use either of the earbuds in mono, call quality is pretty good, and the charging case is the best in the business. The AirPods last about five hours of music and can be fully charged around five times by the case, which itself is charged via a Lightning cable. They are also available with a new wireless charging case (£40/$40 extra) for powering up on Qi-compatible chargers.Why should I buy them?Seamless connectivity with Apple products is key, but they sound pretty good, have an excellent case and are a decent alternative to canal-buds, even for Android usersBuy if: you use Apple products and don’t need sound isolationDon’t buy if: you want to block out the sounds outside worldRRP: £219 / $249★★★★★If you want the smallest, most discreet wireless earbuds available, the Earin M-2 deliver. These tiny earbuds sit within your ear with only a flat touch-sensitive surface visible.Available in black or white, they’re light and easy to forget you’re wearing them. They produce a balanced, relatively flat sound with good treble and fairly crisp highs. Those looking for pumping bass or truly sparkling audio will have to look elsewhere, but they make a good go of most music genres.An Android or iOS app sorts updates, and tweaks transparency settings, but there are no equaliser settings.Noise isolation is good but not great. The M-2s can feed ambient sound in when the music pauses, but it sounds like you’re listening to the world down an old phone line - fine for listening to an announcement but it takes some getting used to.Unusually, there’s no left or right earbud. They can be inserted in either ear with the buds working out which way round they are, and either can be used on its own for mono listening. They support AAC and aptX, and maintain a stable connection to your phone and between the earbuds, which communicate via magnetic induction, not Bluetooth. The result is lag and lipsync issue-free audio. Call quality is good, but a little quiet, meaning you’ll have to speak up, and there’s no sidetone, so it’s difficult to know how loud you’re talking.Tap once to pause, twice to skip track or tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant or Siri on either bud. The controls work well, but there’s no volume control at all, so you’ll have to reach for your phone for that.They last a good three hours of constant playback and charge about three times in the cylindrical aluminium case, which slides open and shut with a satisfying clunk.Why should you buy them?If you want your truly wireless earbuds to be as small as possible, but still have good sound, great connectivity and a good case, the Earin M-2 are it.Buy if: you want the the smallest of truly wireless earbudsDon’t buy if: you want a smaller case or better soundRRP: £219.95 / $249.95★★★★☆If you wish Apple’s AirPods had better isolation and gripped on to your ear like a vice, look no further than the Beats PowerBeats Pro.Like the AirPods the PowerBeats Pro have great connectivity with an iPhone, which courtesy of the Beats app even extends to Android. Rock solid connectivity in all conditions is paired with excellent controls. Both earbuds have proper volume rocker controls, plus a multifunction button for controlling playback, skipping tracks or activating Siri or Google Assistant.The flexible ear hook loops over the back of your ear and with a bit of adjustment holds them firmly in place on your head - no amount of jumping, giggling or pounding the tarmac is going to shake these free. They’re also sweat resistant so will be fine in the rain or hard workout; just don’t run them under a tap.The silicone earbud tip offers some isolation from the world around you. The forward, energetic sound is ideal for powering through a run or gym session, while also doing a good job with most music genres, banishing the all-bass Beats sound profile to the history books.Call quality is excellent too, while battery life is a class-leading eight hours with another 1.5 charges in the case.The enormous case is the worst thing about them. It’s robust and works just fine, but you’re not going to be able to fit it in a pocket. They’re also pricy, so if you just want basic buds for the gym, these aren’t for you.Why should you buy them?You want the AirPod-like convenience of connectivity and features with an iPhone (or Android with app), with class-leading battery, good sound, excellent controls including a real volume rocker, plus an ear hook design that’s unshakeable.Buy if: you want rock-solid all-rounders that won’t come off no matter what you doDon’t but if: you want something smaller and cheaperFull review: Beats PowerBeats Pro review: Apple’s fitness AirPods rockRRP: £69.99 / $79.99★★★★☆Creative, known for PC soundcards and MP3 players from the 90s and 2000s and now gaming headsets and headphones, produces some of the best value true wireless earbuds around.The Creative Outlier Air (also available in a more expensive “gold” variant) manage to tick almost every box. They’re light and comfortable to wear for extended periods, with a kidney shape that keeps most of the hard plastic body away from the fleshy bits of your ears. A traditional silicone earbud tip holds it in place fairly well, but only two sets are included in the box, meaning you might need to buy some extra ones if it doesn’t make a good enough seal.They have excellent connectivity with Bluetooth 5, SBC, AAC and aptX support, can be used independently and best of all last up to 10 hours between trips in the case, which is about double the average battery life of most true wireless earbuds.The case is fairly big, but is light, just about pocketable and holds two full charges of the earbuds, making up to 30 hours before needing to be topped up by USB-C.The Outlier Air sound surprisingly good for the money too, producing well-rounded audio with punch in the bass (once you get a good seal at least) and good clarity in the mids and highs. They won’t touch the best-sounding, but they are a cut above the competition at this price and will even give the likes of the Galaxy Buds and AirPods a run for their money.A button on either bud takes care of playback and volume control, which is a bit stiff, requiring you to grip the bud with your index finger and press the button with your thumb. Press once to pause/play, twice on the left to skip back or on the right to skip forward. Pressing and holding on the left turns the volume down or on the right turns the volume up.Call quality is surprisingly good, with only a little bit of background noise audible by the recipient while speaking. The earbuds are also IPX5 sweat-proof so fine for a run or similar. Small niggles include poor selection of earbud tips, a slight hiss on pause and hints of lipsync issues with Amazon Prime Video and YouTube.Why should you buy them?Great sound, connectivity and long battery life, plus solid controls including volume, combine with an OK case to make some excellent value true wireless earbuds.Buy if: you want great-sounding truly wireless earbuds on a budgetDon’t buy if: you want a small case (buy the Anker Liberty Air instead)There are many different types of wireless Bluetooth headphones, but the newest and neatest are the truly wireless earbuds.Unlike neckband earphones or regular Bluetooth earbuds, truly wireless earbuds have no cables connecting between them, freeing the wearer of all cords and cables.Removing all cables means transmitting audio and data between them through your head, which is not an easy task. Many early versions could not maintain a solid connection and therefore had frequent, annoying dropouts.A codec is the system used to transmit the audio signal over the Bluetooth connection which both the phone and headphones must support. There are a variety of codecs available for Bluetooth headphones, with SBC being the default, which is the lowest quality and supported by all Bluetooth audio devices. AAC is an upgrade that most support, with Sony's LDAC and Qualcomm's aptX, aptX HD, aptX Low Latency and the newest aptX Adaptive supported by some.Apple's iPhone notably does not support Bluetooth codecs higher than AAC, but many Android smartphones and newer Bluetooth headphones support at least aptX.Along with variances in audio quality, different codecs have different latency in their transmission of sound. Latency is the time it takes for a sound to be sent to the earphone and be played, which is important because if it is too high the audio track does not match up with video, leading to irritating lipsync issues.Most headphones that only support SBC will have lipsync issues, while AAC and higher can help negate the problem.Some earbuds have the ability to play sounds from the outside world picked up by microphones through the speakers, providing an awareness of what's happening in the world through the earbuds. Some automatically activate ambient sound on pause, while others can mix it with music or have dedicated modes for listening out for announcements or similar.  Each earbud has to have a battery in it, therefore to squeeze everything into a small enough package to fit in your ear has mean small batteries and fairly short runtimes. But they are not all born equally with some lasting as much as five hours between charges.Short battery life and lack of wires means most truly wireless earbuds come with a charging case with an integrated battery to keep the earbuds safe and topped up. Some charging cases are huge and heavy, others small and light - important to note if you want to carry it in your pocket.Most will have a canal-bud design with an ear tip of varying sizes that enters the ear canal. Alongside the tip many have wings or a body design that is intended to lock into the hollow next to the ear canal called the concha to hold it in place.Here is where the most comfort problems arise, as too much pressure on the soft bits of the ear around the concha will cause pain.These truly wireless earbuds are still worth buying, if the top five don’t fit the bill.Anker Soundcore Liberty AirRRP: £79.99 / $79.99★★★★☆Anker’s AirPod-like true wireless earbuds are second only to the Creative Outlier Air as the best budget option. They have good but not great sound, solid connectivity and AAC support in a light and comfortable earbud design with stalks.Controls are basic, with no volume control, but call quality is excellent and the case is one of the smaller and easier to pocket variety. You’ll get four hours out of the earbuds and an extra three charges in the case.Anker Soundcore Liberty NeoRRP: £59.99 / $49.99★★★★☆Anker’s smaller true wireless earbuds are an excellent budget option, but have a larger case and are bettered on sound and call quality by the Liberty Air. They can be found for slightly cheaper and don’t have the AirPod-like stalk design, so are still worth buying if the price or earbud design suits you better. Not good for phone calls though.B&O E8 2.0RRP: £300 / $350★★★★☆B&O’s second-generation E8 are a solid mix of sound quality and connectivity with a fairly small case. They last just under four hours’ playtime, with two full charges in the case, which itself is charged via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. Touch panels on each earbud take care of controls, including volume, and they have an reasonable transparency mode too. They support AAC, can connect to two devices simultaneously, but can’t be used independently. Call quality is reasonable.The biggest issue is their size: the E8s are massive for earbuds and don’t feel all that stable in your ears unless you use the included Comply foam tips. They’re also expensive and bettered by the Sennheisers on the audio quality front.Bose SoundSport FreeRRP: £179.95 / $199.95★★★★☆If you want more isolation than the AirPods but can’t get on with canal-bud style tips, the Bose SoundSport Free provide a good halfway house. The StayHear+ tips rest in your concha but don’t enter your ear canal, holding themselves in-place with a flexible fin.They sound good, connectivity is rock solid with AAC support, call quality is really good, and they last more than four hours between charges. The large case provides two full charges. The biggest problem is that they’re huge and stick out your ear a mile. At least the call quality is good.Cambridge Audio Melomania 1RRP: £119.95 / $129.95★★★★☆The Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 come very close to delivering on all counts. They have rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with AAC and aptX support, long eight-hour battery, good controls including a way to adjust volume and they even sound good, with balanced, rounded audio.The case is also one of the best available, adding up to 36 hours of playback to the earbuds while still being very pocketable, fitting into the money pocket of a pair of jeans long with only a handful of the best.The problem is, they’re huge. They have a really large aperture making getting the earbud tip to fit without blocking your ear canal a bit of a chore and they stick out a mile, looking like something Nichelle Nichols’s Uhura would use in classic Star Trek. The big trunk is uncomfortable in my ears, meaning any 30-minute-plus listening becomes painful. A real shame.Jabra Elite 65tRRP: £149.99 / $169.99★★★★☆The Jabra Elite 65t are a good alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Buds. They have rock-solid connectivity, support for AAC, no noticeable lipsync issues and sound good, with punchy, controlled bass plus a full equaliser in the Jabra Sound+ app.There are volume/track skip buttons on the left earbud and a pause/play button on the right, which activates ambient sound when double pressed. Call quality is good with clear voice, but background noise bleeds into the mic a little. The case is pretty compact and charges the buds twice totalling to 12 hours’ playback.The Elite 65t twist to lock in place in the ear, but are fairly large and uncomfortable for longer listening sessions for smaller ears.Libratone Track Air+RRP: £179★★★★★Some of the best true wireless earbuds available, the Track Air+ are narrowly beaten by the Samsung Galaxy Buds for general earbuds on price and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 on noise cancelling.The Libratones have it all: attractive design, rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with aptX support, great sound and even reasonably effective noise cancelling. Add to that a tiny case that’ll fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans just like the Galaxy Buds and AirPods, and has wireless charging. Plus battery life of just shy of six hours and three charges in the case. They’re even sweat resistant.The downsides are lack of volume control on the earbuds, lack of AAC support for an iPhone and an easily marked case. Still, if you wish Apple made noise-cancelling AirPods with silicone earbud tips for a better fit, the Libratone Track Air+ are the ones to buy.Full review: Libratone Track Air+ review: the noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won’t give youMaster and Dynamic MW07RRP: £280 / $300★★★★☆If the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless don’t fit the bill but you want great sound, then the Master and Dynamic MW07 are worth a look.They sound good, with pronounced bass and crisp highs, but fall slightly short of the better-sounding Sennheiser. There’s a slight hiss when nothing is playing, but have rock-solid connectivity with AAC and aptX support. The buds are also fairly large and certainly a statement in piano gloss. The wings are a bit uncomfortable, but I didn’t need them.The case is medium sized, and feels good in the hand, but is heavy and the earbuds don’t quite snap into place unless the lid is closed. Physical buttons for controls are great, including volume. Calls sounded echoey.RHA TrueConnectRRP: £149.95 / $169.95★★★★☆Like black Apple AirPods but with a traditional isolating earbud on the end to enter your ear, the RHA TrueConnect sound good with strong bass and solid isolation, but poor call quality.Connectivity is pretty good including AAC support, with only a very occasional blip while suffering only minimal lipsync issues with video. Latency is more of an issue with games. They last four hours per charge, with four full charges in an attractive, medium-sized case.A button on each earbud handles volume, track skip, pause, play and the voice assistant all accessible with multiple clicks. The button felt mushy on one set requiring replacement.Sennheiser Momentum True WirelessRRP: £280 / $300★★★★★Previously ranked as the best-sounding true wireless earbuds, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless are still great. The earbuds are quite large, but are comfortable with a solid set of earbud tips. They last up to four hours between trips in the case, which itself is one of the better ones, although not quite as pocketable as the best.Connectivity is excellent, supporting Bluetooth 5 with AAC, aptX and the new aptX Low Latency codecs, and no hint of latency issues. Call quality was good but a bit distant. Silver touch pads handle playback and volume control.The best bit is how they sound: rich, lively and warm, with produce crisp highs and deep bass, sounding great with most music genres.Tranya T3RRP: £49.99 / $49.99★★★★☆The Tranya T3 are a solid set of budget true wireless earbuds with a reasonably bassy sound, good connectivity and AAC support. A button on each earbud takes care of controls. Isolation is fairly weak and the case is pretty bulky and easily marked. Call quality was abysmal and there was a small lipsync issue with YouTube on an iPhone.CrazyBaby Air Nano – Connectivity and latency issues – £70Jabra Elite Sport – Big, bulky and bettered by the newer Jabra Elite 65t – £200Jaybird Run – Solid for runners, but unacceptable latency issues – £159JBL Free X – Large case and terrible latency issues – £120JLabs JBuds Air – Sound fine, but only SDC support means latency issues – £50Motorola Verve Ones – Connectivity issues are a deal-breaker – £130NuForce BE Free8 – OK sound, but constant hiss and connectivity issues – £200Rowkin Ascent Micro – small, sound OK, but serious latency issues – £125Skullycandy Indy – Sound ok, but get stuck in the case and suffer lag with an iPhone – £70Taotronics BH053 – sound OK, but cheap plastic with questionable durability and lag with YouTube – £38TicPods Free – Good sound and controls, but terrible latency – £120Urbanista Stockholm – AirPod ripoffs with poor fit and weak sound – £89Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, Huawei, Samsung and Google compared and ranked This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

iPhone 11 Pro Max review: salvaged by epic battery life,"A great camera, screen and performance can’t save horrendous ergonomics, but at least it’ll last two days on battery",Samuel Gibbs,2019-10-09T07:00:56+0100,"The biggest, most expensive new smartphone from Apple is the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and you’ll need a small fortune to buy it.The new 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro Max costs from £1,149 and is in effect its smaller 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro sibling put in a photocopier with a 12% magnification applied.It has the exact same aluminium and glass design, the same notched screen with Face ID, the same camera arrangement on the back and the same Lightning port in the bottom. It is the same phone. Except that enlarging everything (apart from thickness) by 10%-12% creates a very different experience.Like the iPhone XS Max it replaces, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is really difficult to use with one hand. At 77.8mm it is hand-stretchingly wide, wider still than the already massive OnePlus 7 Pro (75.9mm) and even the positively gigantic Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (75.9mm), and at 226g it is heavier than competitors by a full 20g. But more than that, the rounded stainless steel sides provide no grip at all, meaning your fingers simply slip off them when you stretch across to reach the other side of the screen or the top left corner, which you frequently need to do in iOS.It’s a combination that either results in hand pain or wallet pain, as it slips out of your fingers and plummets on to the unforgiving floor below. You then stick it in a case, which makes it even bigger. If there was ever a phone to benefit from a grip accessory of some kind, this is it.So unless you have giant hands, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is exclusively a two-handed phone. But I’d argue that there are always times when you need to use a phone one-handed: public transport, carrying a bag, taking a selfie and so on.The 6.5in Super Retina XDR “Pro level” OLED screen is just as wonderful as the one on the smaller iPhone 11 Pro, although it isn’t a massive leap over that fitted to significantly cheaper rivals such as the OnePlus 7 Pro. Flip it over and the frosted, almost metallic-like glass and square camera lump with three lenses poking out is new.Screen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (OLED) (458ppi)Processor: Apple A13 BionicRAM: 4GB of RAMStorage: 64GB, 256GB or 512GBOperating system: iOS 13Camera: Triple 12MP rear cameras with OIS, 12MP front-facing cameraConnectivity: LTE, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning, Ultra Wideband and GPSDimensions: 158 x 77.8 x 8.1 mmWeight: 226gThe iPhone 11 Pro Max has the same A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage as the rest of the iPhone 11 line, and performs similarly. Everything happens promptly, including intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming, and it should be a top performer for years to come.The use of Lightning over the newer, more adaptable and useful USB-C is disappointing, as is the 64GB of starting storage. If you want to use your massive phone screen to watch video or play games, or you shoot any number of photos or 4K videos, you’re going to fill that up in no time.Apple says it has managed to make the iPhone 11 Pro last five hours longer between charges than the iPhone XS Max, which managed 27 hours in my testing.The iPhone 11 Pro Max beats that estimate by some margin, lasting just minutes shy of a full 48 hours between charges. That means the phone lasts from 7am on day one until about 6.50am on day three, propelling the iPhone 11 Pro Max into the two-day battery club previously only populated by a variety of Huawei’s top phones.That was after the iOS 13.1.2 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 100 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The iPhone 11 Pro Max ships with an 18W USB-C fast charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box. A full charge from flat took two hours 20 minutes, but hit 50% in 31 minutes and 70% in 46 minutes, slowing charging to a trickle above 95%.The phone also gets pretty hot when fast charging. It can wirelessly charge too, but can’t charge other devices.It’s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimisation feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity.The iPhone 11 Pro shipped with iOS 13 but was quickly updated three times to iOS 13.1.2, following the same issues suffered with the iPhone 11.Dark mode, swipe typing on the Apple keyboard, improved quick setting access and menstrual cycle tracking are all new highlights of iOS 13.The iPhone 11 Pro Max also has a few additions for the large screen such as a split-screen view in Mail, Calendar, Messages and others that aren’t present on the smaller iPhone 11 Pro. It also supports a few tricks to help with one-handed use such as bringing the top of the screen down or moving the keyboard to one of the sides, which itself is difficult to do with your right hand as the button to activate it is in the bottom left corner of the screen.It’s the back gesture, which is a swipe in from the left edge of the screen, that’s a killer for a right-handed user. Trying to do that with one hand is equal parts frustration and dread.Apple leads the industry in software updates, providing at least five years of support from release, where other manufacturers cap out at about three years, and has recently shown a surprising ability to rapidly push out bug fix updates in quick succession.The iPhone 11 Pro Max has Apple’s new triple 12-megapixel camera setup – the same as the smaller iPhone 11 Pro. The combination of ultrawide, wide and telephoto cameras gives you the ability to shoot at 0.5x, 1x or 2x optical zoom, then up to 10x digital zoom.Overall, it’s a massive step up on previous iPhone cameras, and better still than the cheaper iPhone 11. Apple’s new night mode brings it up to par with the best rivals on very low-light photography, while the new deep fusion technology rolling out with iOS 13.2 is getting closer than ever to the clarity of fine detail of an SLR with a large lens.The photos used for this review were all shot on an iPhone 11 Pro running iOS 13.2 beta.After lagging the ultra-competitive camera competition for some time, Apple is firmly up with the best with the iPhone 11 Pro line.The iPhone 11 Pro Max is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 4m for 30 minutes – which is 2m deeper last year’s iPhone XS MaxBluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphonesFace ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and working at slightly wider anglesThe new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it’s only used for directional AirDrop file sharingThe highly polished stainless steel is easy to mark and dull in even careful general useThe pressure sensitive screen of previous iPhones is gone and with it 3D Touch, so you can’t press harder on things any moreThe iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149 for 64GB of storage, £1,299 for 256GB or £1,499 for 512GB in black, green, silver or gold.For comparison, the iPhone 11 Pro costs £1,049, the iPhone 11 costs £729 and the iPhone XR costs £629.The OnePlus 7 costs £499, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs £799 and the Huawei P30 Pro costs £799.There’s an excellent super-sized smartphone within Apple’s grasp, but unfortunately the iPhone 11 Pro Max isn’t it.A design that works at the much smaller size of the 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro simply doesn’t at the gargantuan 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro Max, meaning Apple’s biggest phone suffers from terrible ergonomics.I get that uniformity is Apple’s schtick, but in this case it actively makes the product worse. Of all the massive phones I’ve used across the years, the heavy, slippery iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone XS Max before it are the only ones to give me serious hand pain. It’s literally a crying shame, because everything else about it – from the camera, the screen and the performance – is great.When it comes down to it, only the genuinely epic Huawei-level battery life salvages the iPhone 11 Pro Max from being a three-star product, and even then this is a four-star phone that is extremely expensive.There are certainly better, easier-to-use big-screen smartphones available that cost significantly less than the jaw-dropping £1,149 and up Apple wants for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.But if you must have an iPhone and the wonderful 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro doesn’t quite cut it, do yourself a favour and save £420 and buy the 6.1in iPhone 11. Only those that genuinely need two-day battery life should buy the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and even then I wouldn’t.Pros: brilliant camera, night mode, water resistant, wireless charging, Face ID, good battery life, good performance, brilliant screen, long software supportCons: hard to hold, heavy, super expensive, no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, no headphones adapter in the box, low starting storageBest smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and rankedSamsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screenSamsung Galaxy Note 10+ review: bigger and now with a magic wandOnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every wayHuawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery lifeFairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

iPhone 11 Pro review: the best small phone available,"A cracking camera, great screen and 32-hour battery life – but at an eye-watering price",Samuel Gibbs,2019-10-07T07:00:43+0100,"Apple’s iPhone has gone “pro” for its 11th iteration, with dramatically improved cameras and longer battery life, which make the smaller iPhone 11 Pro the king of more manageable phones.Costing from £1,049 the iPhone 11 Pro is one of a rare breed: a premium flagship smartphone that doesn’t have a ginormous screen and is therefore small by today’s standards.Everything is relative, of course. The iPhone 11 Pro’s 5.8in screen is considerably larger than the 4in iPhone SE, but compared with the monsters of the modern smartphone era with their 6.5in-plus screens the iPhone 11 Pro is positively pocketable.The iPhone 11 Pro is essentially the same on the outside as the mould-breaking iPhone X from 2017, with a stainless steel and glass body, Face ID notch and 5.8in screen.The new phone is 0.4mm taller, 0.5mm wider, 0.4mm thicker and 11g heavier than the iPhone XS that came before it, but you’d be very hard pressed to tell, even side-by-side. While the 188g weight is fairly heavy compared with rivals, the rest of the dimensions compare favourably, making the iPhone 11 Pro one of the easiest of devices to pocket, hold and use with one hand.Apple’s Super Retina XDR “Pro level” OLED screen is new for this year and is considerably brighter during regular usage and when displaying Dolby Vision or HDR10 content.It’s a gorgeous display. Sharp, bright, colour-rich and full of contrast. At 60Hz it isn’t quite as smooth a screen as the 90Hz display on the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it wins on all other counts against everything else, particularly at this size.Flip the phone over and you will see a new frosted glass back, which is more grippy when the phone and your hands are cold, but less so than the previous glossy coating when both are warm. The camera lump is now a square raised glass section in the top right with three cameras arranged in a triangle. If you suffer from trypophobia (that’s an aversion to clusters of small holes) the iPhone 11 Pro is definitely not for you.Screen: 5.8in Super Retina XDR (OLED) (458ppi)Processor: Apple A13 BionicRAM: 4GB of RAMStorage: 64, 256 or 512GBOperating system: iOS 13Camera: Triple 12MP rear cameras with OIS, 12MP front-facing cameraConnectivity: LTE, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning, Ultra Wideband and GPSDimensions: 144 x 71.4 x 8.1 mmWeight: 188gThe iPhone 11 Pro has the same A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage as the rest of the iPhone 11 line, and performs similarly. Everything happens promptly, including intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming.The iPhone 11 Pro will handle everything you need now, and will likely be a top performer for years to come. There are two small disappointments, however. Despite being “Pro” the new phone still uses the old Lightning connector for charging, not the much more powerful and adaptable USB-C to which Apple switched all its MacBook laptops and the recent iPad Pro.The starting storage of 64GB is also disappointing. For anyone shooting any amount of 4K video you’ll very quickly fill 64GB, and even if you’re not a “pro” creative, then apps, games and movies will make short work of the space.Apple says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 Pro last four hours longer between charges than the iPhone XS, which only just managed 24 hours in my testing – which itself was worse than the iPhone X at 30 hours.I’m pleased to report that the iPhone 11 Pro beats Apple’s estimates and lasts eight hours longer than the iPhone XS, at just shy of 32 hours. It will get me from 7am on day one until almost 4pm on day two. Attaching an Apple Watch Series 5 made negligible difference to the battery life of the iPhone too.That was after the iOS 13.1.2 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The iPhone 11 Pro is the first Apple smartphone to ship with an 18W USB-C fast charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box. A full charge from flat took just over two hours 10 minutes, but a 50% charge was reached in 28 minutes and 70% in 43 minutes. As with the iPhone 11, Apple is clearly slowing charging to a trickle above 95%, meaning that charging much beyond 90% unless you need it probably isn’t worth it.The phone also gets pretty hot when fast charging. It can wirelessly charge too, but can’t charge other devices.It’s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimising feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity.The iPhone 11 Pro shipped with iOS 13 but was quickly updated three times to iOS 13.1.2, following the same issues suffered with the iPhone 11.The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which switches the interface a predominately black or dark background with white text. Dark mode theoretically has a battery benefit for the iPhone 11 Pro thanks to the OLED screen, which only consumes electricity for pixels that aren’t black, making white text on a predominantly black background more power efficient than black on white. But you’ll only see a meaningful benefit if the background is truly black and not a dark shade of grey.Other highlights include the ability to swipe-type on the default keyboard, a long-press on control centre buttons now opens up quick connect menus for Bluetooth or wifi, as well as quickly jumping to the settings app. Photos now has an improved view of all your photos. You can silence unknown and spam callers, while location permissions for apps have been improved and there’s menstrual cycle and headphone audio level tracking in the Health app, which also now has a new more useful summary view.Apple leads the industry in software updates, providing at least five years of support from release, where other manufacturers cap out at about three years, and has recently shown a surprising ability to rapidly push out bug-fix updates in quick succession.The iPhone 11 Pro has Apple’s first triple 12-megapixel camera setup. It has the same normal and 2x telephoto configuration as previous models, but adds the new ultrawide camera from the iPhone 11.The combination gives you the ability to shoot at 0.5x, 1x or 2x optical zoom then up to 10x digital zoom.Apple calls this a “pro camera system” and like the dual-camera system fitted to the iPhone 11, it is a noticeable step up from last year, producing some of the best images I’ve had the pleasure to shoot across a range of different lighting conditions.Apple’s new night mode brings the iPhone 11 Pro up to par with the gold-standard of Google’s Pixel 3 in very low-light photography, but note that it only operates on the main camera not the ultrawide or telephoto.The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you’re shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to up to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots - something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain.Smart HDR has been improved in bright lighting conditions too, producing well controlled highlights with detail in both shadow and bright spots. Images are slightly less flat and more dramatic than the XS last year too, which is a good thing.The deep fusion technology, which will be enabled on the iPhone 11 series with iOS 13.2 (tested in beta for this review), also made a huge difference in fine detail particularly in middling light. For the first time with any smartphone, including the Pixel 3, we’re approaching the level of sharpness and clarity at full crop that only a proper camera with a large lens has managed in the past.Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, arguably the best in the business, including 4K at 60 frames per second. With a third-party app you can also shoot from more than one of the cameras at once, which might be useful for filmmakers, but I can’t ever see myself needing to do that.The selfie camera is also improved, bumped to 12-megapixels and capable of capturing an almost terrifying level of detail in good lighting. The front-facing camera can also do slow motion selfies, which kids and big kids will love.Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 Pro is a big step up, levelling to or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features.The iPhone 11 Pro is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 4 metres for 30 minutes, which is 2 metres deeper than last year’s iPhone XSBluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphonesFace ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and working at slightly wider anglesThe new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it’s used only for directional AirDrop file sharingThe highly polished stainless steel is easy to mark and dull after even careful general useThe pressure sensitive screen of previous iPhones is gone and with it 3D Touch, so you can’t press harder on things anymoreThe iPhone 11 Pro costs £1,049 for 64GB of storage, £1,199 for 256GB or £1,399 for 512GB in black, green, silver or gold.For comparison, the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149, the iPhone 11 costs £729, the iPhone XR costs £629, the OnePlus 7 costs £499, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs £799 and the Huawei P30 Pro costs £799.After a misstep last year, Apple is back on top with what is simply the best smaller phone available. The iPhone 11 Pro has longer battery life, a better screen and excellent performance all round.The camera is also a big improvement in terms of clarity and performance, particularly in fine detail and very low light, with the added night mode now matching rivals. It won’t yet replace a digital SLR for my professional photography, but it’s closer than anything there has been before.The design is still a winner at this size, but is starting to look a little dated three years on from the mould-breaking iPhone X. And there’s no 5G to be seen either, when we’re right on the cusp of it being a key differentiator for 2020.It’s not perfect, but in the sea of ever-larger, hand-stretching phones, it’s refreshing to have a model that’s comparatively easy to pocket, hold and use one-handed that doesn’t compromise on power or features.The biggest issue with the iPhone 11 Pro is its price. The starting cost of £1,049 comes with only 64GB of storage, meaning you will likely have to rely heavily on cloud storage if you shoot a large number of photos, videos or download apps or movies.I won’t pretend the iPhone 11 Pro is even remotely good value, because it’s not. Even if you do get five years of software support. For £1,049 and up you’re buying a product that is unrivalled at this size and paying a hefty premium price for the privilege.Pros: brilliant camera, night mode, water resistant, wireless charging, Face ID, good battery life, good performance, brilliant screen, long software support, manageable sizeCons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, super expensive, no headphones adapter in the box, low starting storageBest smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and rankedSamsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spotOnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every wayHuawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery lifeFairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

iPhone 11 review: an iPhone XR with a better camera,Apple’s lower cost model has latest chips and longer battery life but is identical on outside to predecessor,Samuel Gibbs,2019-10-01T07:00:39+0100,"The iPhone 11 is Apple’s latest lower cost smartphone for 2019 that’s clearly aimed at a broader market, offering most of what its top phones do but for £320 less.Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 is also £20 cheaper than last year’s iPhone XR was on launch – the phone it has now replaced.In fact the iPhone 11 is identical on the outside to the iPhone XR in almost all the ways that matter. It’s the same size and weight. It’s got the same glass and aluminium design, same 6.1in LCD screen with rounded corners, the same large notch at the top and same thick bezels around the sides.Flip it over and it’s got the same glass rear, except that “iPhone” is no longer written on the back and the Apple logo is positioned lower. The biggest difference is the new large, square camera lump in the top left corner, which on the iPhone 11 houses a new dual camera system.The phone is well built, feeling extremely solid and it has the best LCD screen you’re likely to see on a phone although it isn’t as good-looking, colour rich, bright or high contrast as the OLED screens fitted to the iPhone 11 Pro or Apple’s many rivals costing £500 and up.The iPhone 11 also suffers from the same disadvantages as the iPhone XR before it, namely it’s fairly heavy and wide with rounded edges that provide little in the way of grip. Compared to Samsung’s Galaxy S10, which has the same size 6.1in screen, the iPhone 11 is 5.3mm wider and 37g heavier and significantly harder to use one-handed.Screen: 6.1in liquid retina HD (LCD) (326ppi)Processor: Apple A13 BionicRAM: 4GB Storage: 64, 128 or 256GBOperating system: iOS 13Camera: dual 12MP rear cameras with OIS, 12MP front-facing cameraConnectivity: LTE, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, lightning, ultra wideband and GPSDimensions: 150.9mm x 75.7mm x 8.3mmWeight: 194gThe iPhone 11 shares the same core as the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage. It’s the fastest and most efficient of Apple’s chips yet, but the reality is that it’s very difficult to tell. The iPhone 11 doesn’t feel any faster than last year’s iPhone XR/XS, or in fact the iPhone X in day-to-day usage.That’s not surprising as Apple focuses its chips on doing the things you’d normally do more efficiently, with power to do something unusual if you need it. That means the iPhone 11 should still be a top-performer in two, three, maybe four years from now. So really the only thing you need to know is that the iPhone 11 will handle everything you are likely to do, and then some.Apple also says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 last an hour longer than the iPhone XR, which lasted 32 hours between charges in my testing.I’m happy to report that’s a bit of an underestimate. The iPhone 11 lasts closer to 35 hours between charges, which makes it the longest-lasting iPhone to have crossed my test bench, getting me from 7am though until 6pm the following day.That was after the iOS 13.1.1 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.Charging the iPhone 11 with the included 5W charger is glacially slow, taking well over four hours to hit 100% from zero. Why Apple still ships a £729 phone with such a pathetic charger, I don’t know. With the £29 18W USB-C charger and £19 USB-C to Lightning cable that ships in the box with the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone 11 fully charged in just over 100 minutes, reaching 80% in well under and hour, which is more like it. Any USB-C power delivery chargers of 18W or higher will achieve the same results and can be had for one-third less.It’s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimising feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity. Apple is also clearly slowing charging down to a trickle above 95% regardless of charger, meaning that it’s probably not worth trying to charge it much beyond 90% if you don’t need to.The iPhone 11 came out of the box with iOS 13 but was quickly updated to iOS 13.1 and then iOS 13.1.1, which was a good thing, as prior to the updates it was filled with bugs giving me all kinds of issues on three different iPhone 11 series phones.First off, the camera confirmation for restoring it from another iPhone didn’t work. Then I was immediately stuck in a password-demand loop for an email account, which ended up with me having to hit the cancel button and then quickly enter one character of my 35-character password before the password demand popped back up blocking me from entering more. Hit cancel, rinse and repeat. Absolutely infuriating.I had issues with location permissions getting stuck on “ask every time” for some apps. I also had several hard lockups of the phone prompting the three-button combo force restart procedure (up, down, hold power for ages), text in widgets and other areas was compressed and overlapping each other, and sometimes the camera failed to activate when launched.Most of the problems have been solved since the update to iOS 13.1.1, and it even added an extra hour to my battery tests.The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which turns the interface from a predominately black text on white background to white text on a dark background, either manually or on a schedule.You can now also long-press on control centre buttons such as Bluetooth or wifi, first to open a up more detail, then a second time to open up a quick connect menu as well as a button to take you straight to the appropriate place in the settings app for more extensive changes. It is a user-friendly feature that Android has had for years, so it’s good to finally see Apple catch up.A few new privacy options are welcome, including the ability to silence unknown and spam callers and finer-grain location permissions. Menstrual cycle tracking is now integrated into the Health app alongside headphone audio level, and there’s a new summary view, which makes the app more friendly and useful at a glance.It’s worth pointing out that Apple still provides the industry’s longest software support lifecycle of about five years from release where the best rivals cap out at about three years. It means you can safely use the phone for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates.The iPhone 11 has a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back. Oddly you get an ultra-wide camera alongside a standard camera, not the more typical 2x optical zoom camera. That means you’ve effectively got 0.5x and 1x optical zoom then up to 5x digital zoom, which is good, but doesn’t hold a flame to real optical zoom.Apple has significantly upped its game in the camera department this year, particularly in poor lighting conditions. Photos in good lighting conditions are some of the best on a smartphone, producing detail-rich and colour-accurate photos. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with.Other than your typical ultra-wide vistas, you can also use the new camera to photograph more of a building or object you can’t get far enough away from to use the main camera.Portrait mode is good too, and unlike on the XR can be used on more than just people. Apple’s smart HDR mode is also improved, producing images that are closer to class-leading Google Pixel cameras. But the biggest boost is Apple’s new night mode, which finally brings the iPhone’s very low-light performance up to scratch with the very best.It’s not as fast as Huawei’s P30 Pro, which doesn’t need a special night mode to shoot similar photos, nor quite as dramatic as Google’s Pixel 3, but produces images that are often lighter and better controlled.The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you are shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots – something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain.The iPhone still struggles a little with indoor lighting where it’s not quite dark enough to benefit from night mode so produces images that are a little dark and lacking in detail. The selfie camera in particular produces somewhat grainy images here, but shoots great photos in better lighting conditions.Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, and easy to use, arguably better than rivals. The front-facing camera can also offers slow-motion selfies, which kids will love.Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 is a big step up, equalling or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features, although the lack of an optical zoom is disappointing.The iPhone 11 is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 2 metres for 30 seconds, which is 1 metre deeper than last year’s iPhone XRBluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphonesThe volume slider shows you a bespoke icon of the headphones you are wearing – if they are made by AppleYou can swipe to type on Apple’s default keyboard in iOS 13Face ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and works at slightly wider anglesThe new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it’s only used for directional AirDrop file sharing, which will be most useful for narrowing down which iPhone you want to send a file to in a cluster of iPhones – not something I do very oftenThe iPhone 11 costs £729 for 64GB of storage, £779 for 128GB or £879 for 256GB, and is available in white, black, green, yellow, purple or red.For comparison, the iPhone XR costs £629, the OnePlus 7 costs £499, the Samsung S10e costs £669, the Honor 20 Pro costs £550, the iPhone 11 Pro costs £1,049 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149.The iPhone 11 is an excellent but boring smartphone. It’s got a three-year-old design, which Apple broke the mould with in 2017 when it launched the iPhone X but now looks dated against the competition, particularly with the thicker bezels on the LCD screen. Things have moved on in the era of the all-screen smartphone.It’s fairly large, heavy and difficult to grip and use with one hand, but is also extremely well made and feels solid. These are all attributes shared by its predecessor the iPhone XR, as the iPhone 11 is essentially new guts in last year’s design.At £729 the iPhone 11 isn’t exactly cheap, costing the same as the top-of-the-line phones from competitors. But what you get for your £729 is Apple’s latest top-of-the-range processor with performance to match. Battery life that will easily see you into a second day, maybe a third if you’re careful. Camera performance that is up there with the very best, but lacking an optical zoom, replaced instead by a fun ultra-wide angle camera.You also get five years of software updates, which can’t be sniffed at. With a battery swap at some point there’s no reason an iPhone 11 won’t last you five years if you’re careful with it. In some tests the glass appears fairly tough to break, but less so in others, so whether it will survive real-world drops remains to be seen.So the iPhone 11 is the iPhone for people who don’t really care about smartphones and just want a new iPhone. Except that it’s not that simple. Apple still sells the iPhone XR, which is essentially the same phone minus a second camera and one year less of software support, which is still at least four years, for £100 less at £629. And then there’s the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, which have a third camera, a significantly better screen and the cachet of being “the best iPhone”.If your primary driver is to buy the best, cheapest iPhone you can get, that’s the iPhone XR in 2019. If you want the best iPhone you can get, that’s one of the new iPhone 11 Pro line. So where does that leave the iPhone 11?Pros: great camera, night mode water resistant, wireless charging, Face ID, good battery life, good performance, good screen, long software supportCons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, dated design, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the boxBest smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and rankedSamsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spotSamsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper oneOnePlus 7 review: competition-beating performance for lessOnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Samsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper one,"Smallest, cheapest Samsung flagship has most of what makes the S10 line good, but with a flat screen and one camera fewer",Samuel Gibbs,2019-06-18T07:00:51+0100,"The Galaxy S10e is Samsung’s attempt to offer a flagship smartphone experience in a smaller body and at a lower cost, which mostly works.The formula is simple: take the same processor, reduce the memory a little and squeeze it into a smaller, less complicated body.The AMOLED screen is only 5.8in on the diagonal, only FHD+ and only flat, not curved at the edges. Whether any of those are downsides depends on your view of curved screens. The display isn’t visibly worse than the S10, and it still has the hole-punch notch through which the selfie camera pokes.The display is covered in last year’s Corning Gorilla Glass 5, not 6 as fitted to the regular S10, so it might be a little less scratch resistant or prone to smashing on impact.With rounded metal sides and glass front and back, it looks fairly simple in design terms. Get it in prism white or canary yellow and it’ll stand out from the crowd. The S10e is easy to hold onto at only 69.9mm wide and 142.2mm tall, which makes it one of the smallest flagship phones on the market alongside Google’s Pixel 3.In reality it doesn’t feel all that smaller than the S10 because it’s only 0.5mm narrower and 7g lighter.There’s the lesser-spotted headphone socket in the bottom, next to the USB-C port, and the phone is water resistant to IP68 standards: 1.5m depths of up to 30 minutes.Screen: 5.8in FHD+ AMOLED (438ppi)Processor: Samsung Exynos 9820 or Qualcomm Snapdragon 855RAM: 6GB of RAMStorage: 128GBOperating system: One UI based on Android 9 PieCamera: rear dual camera, front 10MP selfie-cameraConnectivity: dual sim, LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5, wireless charging and GPSDimensions: 142.2 x 69.9 x 7.9mmWeight: 150gThe Galaxy S10e has the same processor – the Samsung Exynos 9820 in the EU or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 in the US – as the larger, more expensive Galaxy S10 and S10+.The cheaper phone has only 6GB of memory compared with 8GB, but most will likely not notice, as performance was pretty much the same. Only on occasion would an app have to reload when brought back from the recently used apps list.That means the S10e is as fast and fluid as most of the competition, even if it doesn’t quite manage OnePlus 7 Pro-levels of speed.Battery life on the S10e was a disappointing 25 hours between charges, the same as the regular S10. With the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until 9am on day two, which might be enough to get you into work.That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with plenty of push messages and emails, watching 60 minutes of offline video, shooting about five photos a day and listening to about five hours of Spotify using Bluetooth headphones.You will likely have to charge it before a night out so it’ll get you home the other side. Charging is pretty slow too, taking 95 minutes to fully charge via cable and similar via 15W wireless charging. Wireless powershare works well, but is fairly slow – fine for charging a set of headphones.The Galaxy S10e runs the same new One UI version of Android 9 Pie as the rest of the S10 line, and is a big improvement on previous versions of Samsung’s customised Android experience.Most of the changes have been made to make using a large phone easier, but given the smaller size of the S10e, they’re less of an improvement. Still, everything looks good and works well. The only area where Samsung is clearly behind the curve is the gesture navigation. Its swipe pads work fine but are harder to reach and less fluid than the competition. I ended up sticking to the traditional navigation buttons.You’ll get about three years of software support from Samsung, but Android version updates will be slower than some of the competition, meaning Android Q will likely only arrive in excess of six months after its release.Unlike the rest of the S10 line the Galaxy S10e has a traditional capacitive fingerprint scanner built into the power button. It’s fast, accurate and lines up with roughly where your right thumb rests on the side of the phone where you would normally push the power button.But it’s harder to use in your left hand. I found that it was placed too high up on the right side to comfortably hit it with my left index finger in a natural position taking several attempts to unlock the phone.If you’re left handed and want to use a fingerprint scanner, think twice about the S10e.One of the areas where the S10e is inferior to its more expensive siblings is in the camera. There is only two cameras on the back, not three. Still, the main 12-megapixel camera is joined by the 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera, leaving zoom to pure digital, which is noticeably worse than the S10 or S10+.That means the S10e is capable of capturing some really good standard and wide-angle shots, with good detail and colour range. It certainly isn’t the best camera on the market, but it keeps up with most of the competition short of the zoom.The selfie camera is excellent; so is video capture. And there are plenty of modes, including manual “Pro” mode and a dedicated Instagram camera, to play with.The S10e is really nice to just fiddle with in the hand, more so than the larger S10The phone comes with a screen protector pre-installedThe stereo speakers are pretty goodThere’s a Bixby key on the left side which can safely be ignoredThe Samsung Galaxy S10e costs £669 in white, black, green or yellow.For comparison, the 6.1in Galaxy S10 costs £799, the 6.4in Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the 5.5in Google Pixel 3 costs £739, the 6.1in Apple iPhone XR costs £749 and the OnePlus 7 costs £499.With the Galaxy S10e Samsung has mostly managed to condense what is good about its 2019 flagship S10 line into something smaller and cheaper.It’s full of good, but not quite the best features. The screen is great, the camera is good but has no optical zoom, the fingerprint scanner is fast but awkward for left-handers and while performance is great, battery life is a bit weak.The S10e’s £669 RRP isn’t that cheap either, when companies such as OnePlus offer better specifications in similarly built phones for £169 less. With the regular S10 already available for similar money, but with a better camera and in-display fingerprint, the S10e becomes less palatable.But the Galaxy S10e is a good phone, which will be even better when bought on a deal. If you hate curved screens but want a top-end Samsung, then this is the phone for you.Pros: great screen, hole-punch notch, wireless charging and powershare, good camera, good performance, good software, good haptics, headphone socket, microSD card slot, dual-sim optionCons: battery life could be better, relatively slow charging, low-light performance not as good as rivals This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Libratone Track Air+ review: the noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won’t give you,"Great fit and sound, long battery, attractive design and pocketable case make for an excellent set of buds",Samuel Gibbs,2019-09-20T07:01:11+0100,"Libratone has given us the better fitting AirPods that Apple wouldn’t, with great sound and noise cancelling.The Danish audio firm’s Track Air+ are a set of true wireless earbuds, priced at £179, that follow the familiar design of earbud with stalk but no cable.Unlike the vast majority of AirPod-a-likes the Track Air+ actually look different, with triangular-shaped metallic stalks that almost look like an earring mounted on a pill-shaped lump with an earbud tip sticking out one end. Even in white you’re not going to confuse these with Apple’s earbuds, and that’s a good thing.The simple, attractive design is subtle enough to go fairly unnoticed in your ear, but different enough to be attractive, particularly in black and silver.The lump containing most of the workings fits beautifully in the concha of your ear, with the earbud tip slotted into a secure and comfortable position down your ear canal with a small twist. Even the stalks fit nicely in the gap between your lobe and tragus. At 5.6g each the earbuds are pretty small and light, and not once did they feel like they would fall out.Everyone’s ears are different, but the Track Air+ are some of the most comfortable earbuds of any size or shape I’ve worn.The Track Air+ magnetically slot into a charging case that’s one of the best in the business. It’s small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans, making it one of only a handful of truly wireless earbuds that are that pocketable with the Samsung Galaxy Buds and Apple’s AirPods.The case charges via USB-C or wireless charging, which is handy, and will charge the earbuds up to three times. The Track Air+ lasted just shy of six hours with noise cancelling active, meaning you get about 24 hours of playback with trips in the case.The only slight niggles on the case are that, while the lid shuts securely with magnets, the hinge feels a little flimsy and will need a little bit of care in handling and the plastic body is easily marked.The Track Air+ support Bluetooth 5.0 and can be used individually. They also support the standard Bluetooth audio format SBC and Qualcomm’s high-quality aptX, but strangely not AAC. While that’s not an issue for Android and Windows users, as aptX is built into both, Apple devices do not support aptX, with AAC their highest-quality supported Bluetooth audio codec, meaning the Track Air+ default to SBC.Most will not notice, but SBC has a higher latency, which means the Track Air+ suffered from a more noticeable audio delay with games on iOS than on Android. Lipsync issues were minimal with all major video apps on Android and there was only a minor delay noticeable with YouTube on an iPhone.Connectivity was rock solid with the majority of phones, including a OnePlus 7 Pro and iPhone XS, even in the most challenging of situations. Only once did I notice a momentary blip with a Google Pixel 3XL exiting the London underground at Liverpool Street.One of the weak points of the Libratone are the onboard controls. A double tap on either earbud can do one of the following: play/pause, switch noise cancelling mode, skip track forward or activate your phone’s voice assistant. I set the left bud to skip track and the right bud to pause, but there’s no volume control, meaning it’s a trip to your phone to turn the music up or down.Removing both earbuds pauses the music and it resumes when you put one back in. A button in the case puts the buds into pairing mode, while the Libratone app takes care of settings. You can also check the battery of the earbuds and the case in the app.One of the best bits is how the Track Air+ sound, with a good amount of punchy bass and clarity rivalling some of the better sounding true wireless earbuds, while falling slightly shy of the big Sony WF-1000XM3 as the best. Feed them some aggressive rock or electronica and be richly rewarded, but they manage to do a good job of most genres.A basic EQ allows you to switch between neutral, extra bass or enhanced treble profiles, sounding best left in neutral. The silicone earbud tip, of which you get four sizes in the box, also does a good job of blocking out noise, but the Track Air+ also have noise cancelling built in. While it isn’t anywhere near as effective as that deployed by Sony’s new top earbuds or Bose, it dealt with the drone of plane engines well and managed to make a dent in most commuting noise too.You can adjust the noise cancelling through 30 levels, either manually or automatically based on your environment using the Libratone app on your phone. The earbuds sounded slightly less full in the mid-range with noise cancelling cranked up to maximum, but the trade-off seemed worth it in noisy environments.The Track Air+ struggled with wind noise with noise cancelling active. The ambient monitoring mode is excellent, sounding natural enough to hold a conversation fairly easy. I mainly used it to listen out for announcements.Call quality was pretty good too, with recipients saying I sounded fairly clear with only a little bit of loud background noise audible.The Track Air+ are sweatproof (IPX4), so fine for running or the gym.The angle of the stalks can clash with some larger earrings.The case has an LED on the inside that shows when it’s charging, but you have to have the lid open.If you have Bluetooth 5.0 on your phone then when you pair the left earbud the right one requests automatic pairing immediately afterwards so you can use them independently.You can only connect to one device at a time (but can pair many).The Libratone Track Air+ cost £179 in white or black.For comparison, Apple’s AirPods cost £159, or £199 with wireless charging case, Sony’s WF-1000XM3 cost £220, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost £280, the B&O E8 2.0 cost £300 and the Master & Dynamic MW07 cost £279.The Libratone Track Air+ are some of the best true wireless earbuds available at the moment – very nearly the isolating, noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won’t give us.They have a stalk design but are attractive and don’t look like AirPod clones. They are some of the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn: small and light enough you simply forget they’re in, but stay put and block out noise. The case is one of the best in the business too; truly pocketable with USB-C and wireless charging, and you can check the battery level in an app.Connectivity was rock solid to both phones and tablets, with aptX for Android and Windows. Sound quality was really good, falling just shy of the very best true wireless earbuds available. And they have pretty effective noise cancelling.They are not quite perfect, but the only minus points are lack of volume control on the earbuds and the curious lack of AAC support, which is only a fairly small issue for iOS users.At £179 they’re not cheap, but undercut Apple’s AirPods with wireless charging case by £20 and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 by £40, making them pretty good value by comparison.If you want great-fitting, great-sounding true wireless earbuds that last a long time and fit into an excellently pocketable case then the Libratone Track Air+ tick every box, and have noise cancelling as the cherry on top.Pros: great sound, noise cancelling, super comfortable, brilliant case, aptX and Bluetooth 5, long battery life, solid connectivity, small and attractive.Cons: no AAC support, no volume control on buds, problem with wind noise, noise cancelling not the best.Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and rankedSony WF-1000XM3 review: updated noise-cancelling earbuds sound greatBose Frames review: smart audio sunglasses are a blast This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

"Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review: less business, more modern design","Same Bose magic now sleeker, with better controls, calling and adaptable noise cancelling",Samuel Gibbs,2019-09-16T07:00:48+0100,"Bose’s new top-of-the range 700 noise-cancelling headphones attempt to be the new gold standard, with a new design, new technology and a shift in focus.Launched to sit atop the long-standing kings of noise-cancelling cans, the £300 QuietComfort 35 II, the new £350 Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 look to shift Bose’s rather staid image toward something more modern and fashionable.Out goes the segmented headband and folding arms, and in comes a slimmer, seamless metal band terminating in two arms that slide smoothly through the outside of the ear cups for height adjustment.It’s a sleeker design that removes harsh lines, junctions and breaks. Even the bunching of the ear pads has been smoothed out. The shape of the ear cups forces the headband, which is lined with a soft-touch silicone pad, to sit further back on your head. Wear them too far forward and they’ll slide off.And they no longer fold in half. Instead the ear cups simply rotate, fitting into a wedge-shaped case, which Bose says is thinner at one end than the QC35 II’s and therefore easier to fit into a flight bag. But not folding means they are harder squeeze into an every-day bag without the case. A small step back in my opinion.On the head they feel slightly heavier than the QC35 II. The ear pads are slimmer and the ear cups feel more airy, which helped keep my ears cooler, but they grip the sides of my head noticeably harder. They were comfortable for extended periods, but they didn’t feel as immediately snug and relaxed as the QC35.The controls have been redesigned too. Two buttons on the right take care of power, pairing and voice assistant control – Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri - with advanced Google Assistant or Alexa functionality baked-in if you’d like.A button on the left ear cup controls the noise-cancelling level. Press and hold to activate conversation mode, which pipes in sound from outside so you can talk to someone – although you look exceptionally rude doing so.The new touch controls are the best I’ve used on any headphones, and worked reliably even in inclement weather, but not at all with non touch-enabled gloves. Double tap the Bose logo on the right ear cup to pause or play. Swipe forward or back for track skip, and up and down to adjust volume. Seven full swipes takes you from minimum to maximum volume with a continual progression in between.Connectivity was rock solid to phones and tablets, both Android and iOS. The headphones support Bluetooth 5, but only the SBC and AAC audio codecs. That’s fine for Apple users, because AAC is the highest quality an iPhone or iPad can support, but Android or Windows PC users looking for more advanced formats such as Qualcomm’s aptX series or Sony’s LDAC will have to look elsewhere.Audio latency control was good, with audio and video perfectly in sync with all the major video apps and services, including the often problematic YouTube. Games showed a little bit of audio delay.The Headphones 700 can also connect to two devices at once, which means you can watch a video on an iPad and then take a call on your phone or similar. It worked great with mobile devices, but connecting them to a computer and a phone simultaneously caused audio issues.You can pair lots of devices and hot swap between them using the Bose Music app or you can simply disconnect and reconnect your devices manually using their Bluetooth settings.The original QC35 pushed noise-cancelling technology to the next level and the Headphones 700 match them, competing favourably with Sony’s best, particularly on commutes, handling wind noise better than any other. Turned up to maximum, the noise cancelling is very effective, blocking or diminishing even the most difficult of sudden or loud noises. The difference between the Headphones 700 and even mid-range models is night and day. You get what you pay for.Bose has re-engineered its noise-cancelling system for greater flexibility. Now you can choose from 11 levels from maximum noise blocking to fully open, piping ambient sounds from your environment into the headphones using the microphones on their surface.That means if you want some awareness of what’s happening around you, such as conversations in an office, but without the hum of air conditioning or computers you can adjust the level accordingly. The ambient sound mode is a cut above too, sounding far more natural and open than any other similar technology I’ve used.Press the noise-cancelling button on the left ear cup to switch between three favourite noise-cancelling levels, which default to zero, five and 10. Every time you switch levels or in and out of conversation mode, the noise-cancelling ramps smoothly up and down again like someone turning a big analogue volume knob. It’s a small detail that makes the whole experience feel all the more luxurious.Bose products always have a signature sound that has proven divisive in audiophile circles. The Headphones 700 are no different. If you didn’t like how the QC35 or even the original TriPort headphones sounded, you won’t like these.If you do, then you’ll be treated to well-balanced audio with punch in the low end for a fully rounded sound and clarity in the highs to make tracks sparkle. You’ll also hear an almost clinical separation of tones, which allows individual instruments and notes to stand boldly on their own, not blended into a mush.The Headphones 700 can handle most music genres well, with an easy listening and open sound that’s slightly more spacious than the QC35. Overall they are some of the most consistent and best-sounding headphones you can buy, right up their with Sony’s MX-1000M3.There is no equaliser control yet, but Bose said it was working on the ability to adjust the sound of the headphones as part of its new architecture.Voice calling, as well as voice assistant access, is a new focus for the Bose headphones. Using a series of microphones they perform a similar beam-forming noise cancellation on your voice as smart speakers. The result is clear and loud voice pickup even in the noisiest of environments. If you make a lot of calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri all the time these are for you.The Headphones 700 last just shy of 20 hours between charges when using Bluetooth and noise cancelling turned up to maximum, but longer when used via cable. While not industry leading, given Sony’s MX-1000M3 last in the region of 30 hours. That’s long enough to last a week’s commuting or a transatlantic flight.It takes just under 2.5 hours to charge them via USB-C, which is fairly slow compared to the fast-charging smartphone. A 15-minute quick charge provides over three hours of playback time though, which is handy if you forget to charge them.There’s a strum on a double bass when you turn them on, which I found annoyingly loud in quiet environmentsOccasionally it took several attempts to get the Bose Music app to connect to the headphonesYou can independently adjust the volume on the headphones when using the wired connection, handy for use as a gaming headset or with a headphones splitter sharing a tabletThe case has a small pouch inside that holds the USB-C and analogue headphones cableBose no longer supplies an aeroplane headphones adapter in the box, but you probably don’t need one anymoreThe headphones support Bose AR, the company’s audio-augmented reality platformThe Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 cost £349.95 and are available in black or silver.For comparison, the RRP for the Bose QuietComfort 35 II is £300 (currently £260), Sony’s WH-1000XM3 cost £329, Beats Studio 3 Wireless cost £300, with cheaper models such as Lindy’s BNX-60 starting around £90.The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 mark a shift for the company, attempting to diverge from a perception of being bought by business travellers towards a design-led luxury offering with a £350 price tag to match.They’re certainly sleeker and more expensive-looking. The way they operate is smoother too, whether it’s the fading and in and out of sound modes or the best-in-class swipe touch controls.They are also the best-sounding Bose headphones to date, with a consistent refined performance. Audiophiles may still be put off by the Bose sound signature. Noise cancelling is top notch, but now adaptable with a sliding scale of levels available, and voice calling or voice assistant control is best-in-class. If you make calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri a lot, these are for you.But part of the seamless design is the removal of folding arms. The ear cups still rotate to flat, but the headphones are harder to fit into a general commuting bag than the QC35. The ear cups feel more spacious and cooler when wearing, but the headband squeezes your head noticeably harder than the QC35, and as a result weren’t quite as comfortable. They are still more comfortable for extended periods than key competition though.The Headphones 700 support Bluetooth 5 for better connectivity, can connect to two devices at once, which is extremely handy, but they struggle connecting to both a computer and a smartphone. Hopefully an update can solve those problems, but stick to mobile devices for now and everything works fine.The lack of higher quality or low-latency Bluetooth audio formats beyond SBC and AAC is slightly disappointing for non-Apple users, and while battery life is solid at just shy of 20 hours, it’s not class leading.They’re pricey, but the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are some of the best headphones you can buy. They just don’t quite transform the market in the same way the original QC35s managed in 2016.Pros: brilliant user-adjustable noise cancelling, best-in-class ambient sound, best-in-class voice calling, great sound, excellent controls, good battery life, multi-point connectivity, comfortable, USB-C, enhanced Google Assistant supportCons: expensive, no aptX etc, bugs with PC connectivity, don’t foldFive of the best noise-cancelling headphonesBose QC35 wireless headphones: simply unrivalled noise cancellingBose Frames review: smart audio sunglasses are a blastMicrosoft Surface Headphones review: close but no cigarPlantronics BackBeat Pro 2: Bose-level wireless noise cancelling on a budgetBest true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and ranked This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Beats PowerBeats Pro review: Apple's fitness AirPods rock,"Bluetooth earbuds have long battery life, rock-solid connectivity and stay firmly planted on your ear",Samuel Gibbs,2019-08-19T07:00:39+0100,"The PowerBeats Pro are Apple-owned Beats’ first true wireless Bluetooth earbuds that cut the cable and seek to be the ultimate running and gym earphones.As with Apple’s original AirPods, which looked like a set of the firm’s standard EarPods with the cables cut off, the £220 PowerBeats Pro are basically the firm’s popular PowerBeats 3 neckband Bluetooth earbuds without the cables joining the pair.That includes the signature ear hook, which tucks behind the top of your ear to hold the earbuds in place. As such the PowerBeats Pro are neither small nor subtle. They come in black, but also a series of attractive colours such as a dark green. Still, if you were looking for a discreet set of earbuds you’ll need to look elsewhere.In effect the PowerBeats Pro are the anti-AirPods, with an unshakable attachment to your ear and a traditional silicone earbud (of which there is a choice of four) to fill your ear canal and block out more ambient noise. It’s not obvious, but the ear hook is actually adjustable. With a bit of force you can bend it into a more comfortable position. It took me a while to get it right, but once bent to fit your ear properly you get a light yet sturdy hold for up to an hour, after which they caused pain in my left ear.Due to the ear hook going over your ear, they weren’t comfortable with sunglasses and I expect the same with eyeglasses. It’s also worth noting that despite being marketed as fitness headphones, the PowerBeats Pro do not have any capacity to play music on their own. They are simply Bluetooth earbuds that need to connect to a phone or another device for music.The biggest downside of the PowerBeats Pro is the giant case. Pocketable this thing is not, and that’s a bit of a problem for true wireless earbuds because once you take them out of your ear they’re easy to lose if you don’t return them to the case. Admittedly the large size of the earbuds makes that less likely than some smaller options, but why the case has to be so big I’m not sure.Like most other true wireless earbuds, the case has its own battery that’s charged via Apple’s Lightning cable, which is convenient for iPhone users but not so much for Android or iPad Pro users. There’s no wireless charging.The PowerBeats Pro have class-leading battery life lasting more than eight hours between charges, where most cap out at five. The case will charge the PowerBeats Pro over 1.5 times too, meaning they last for about 24 hours of playback all combined. A quick five-minute trip in the case is worth up to 90 minutes’ playback, which is handy if you forget to charge them.What gives the PowerBeats Pro their longevity is Apple’s H1 chip – the same one found in the second generation AirPods. It handles the simultaneous attachment to your phone, meaning either bud can be used independently, and provides rock-solid connection even in challenging conditions.It also handles the instant pairing you get with an iPhone. Open the case for the first time near an iPhone and up pops a pairing prompt on the screen. Once hooked up to one Apple device they can be connected to any others you own that are signed into your iCloud account without having to re-pair them each time.Pairing with an Android phone is easy too. With the Beats app installed on your phone you can simply open the case near your phone and press and hold the button to pop up a prompt on your phone to pair with one tap. Otherwise simply find them in your standard Bluetooth settings to pair like anything else.The Beats Android app also gives you the same battery information pop-up when you open the case as you get on an iPhone, which is handy. You can connect them to only one device at a time, but switching between devices is easy: simply demand the connection from another device’s Bluetooth settings and the PowerBeats Pro disconnects from one and connects to the other.The earbuds also inherit one of Apple’s other features from the AirPods: Hey Siri support. You can simply say the wakewords “Hey Siri” while wearing them to access Apple’s voice assistant on an iPhone. Otherwise pressing and holding the multifunction “b” button on the earbuds fires up Siri or Google Assistant on an Android device.Buttons are one of the strong points of the PowerBeats Pro. Unlike most other true wireless earbuds they have dedicated volume controls on both earbuds, while the main button takes care of playback controls with single, double and triple presses.You can also set them to pause playback when you take one out and start again when you reinsert it into your ear.Beats has a history of bass-heavy headphones. While the PowerBeats Pro have punch in the low-end they aren’t overly dominated by it, which is a good thing. They sound full of energy, with a very forward and spirited sound, which is most suited to listening while doing activity, whether it’s walking, running or working out.They do fairly well with most music genres. The silicone earbud tips block out some noise, unlike the AirPods, but not a vast amount. It means you have to crank up the volume to hear your music on public transport more than you might with better isolating competitors. Those looking for the best-sounding earbuds might be a little disappointed at this price too – Sony’s WF-1000X or Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless sound better.The PowerBeats Pro are only sweat resistant with an IPX4 rating, not water resistant to IP68 like many smartphones, while the case is not sweat or water resistant.Getting the earbuds to snap into the right place in the case takes a little practice.The lid of the case shuts with a reassuring clunk.Call quality was good, coming across loud and clear to the recipient but with a little background noise.Wind noise is a problem because they stick out of your ears quite far.The Beats PowerBeats Pro come in black, white, navy or green, costing £219.95.For comparison, Apple’s AirPods cost £159, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds cost £139 and Bose SoundSport Free costs £179.95.The PowerBeats Pro are an excellent set of earbuds marred by a few compromises due to the large form and ear attachment.They sound good, last a long time between charges, have rock-solid connectivity and an excellent set of controls. They also have the same Apple magic that makes the AirPods extremely convenient to use with an iPhone or any other Apple device, which is a massive advantage other brands simply don’t have. You even get a little bit of it on Android thanks to the Beats app.But the case is enormous, the fit won’t suit everyone, they don’t isolate that well, and forget wearing them with glasses. They’re also fairly expensive, placing them in a bracket filled with excellent true wireless earbuds. Most fitness-orientated sets are much cheaper than this.So the PowerBeats Pro are for those who wish the AirPods offered a little isolation and held on to their ears better, particularly for exercise. But I still wish Apple just produced a set of AirPods with proper silicone earbud tips.Pros: secure fit, rock-solid connectivity, volume controls, good sound, long battery life, fast pairing with either iOS or Android, sweat resistantCons: Big, massive case, takes a while to get the right fit, not great with glasses, expensiveBest true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and rankedAirPods review: the best non-isolating wireless earbuds, but only for AppleSony WF-1000XM3 review: updated noise-cancelling earbuds sound great This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Sony WF-1000XM3 review: updated noise-cancelling earbuds sound great,"True wireless buds are Sony’s best yet, but where is the volume control?",Samuel Gibbs,2019-08-14T07:00:12+0100,"Sony’s latest true wireless WF-1000XM3 earbuds offer both noise cancelling and top-end sound quality while undercutting premium rivals on price.The replacement for the WF-1000X, which were some of the first noise cancelling true wireless earbuds available, the new “M3” portion of the model number denotes the company’s third generation of active noise cancelling technology and the QN1e chip, which is rivalled only by Bose.Let’s be clear, this is the top end of the market; at £220 they will be out of the range of many buyers, although there are rivals costing more than £300.The WF-1000XM3 pack more technology in them than your standard true wireless earbuds, and are pretty big as a result. They’re attractive and more balanced in the ear than some sets, but have a resemblance to the old-school Bluetooth headsets made popular by taxi drivers everywhere; if you were looking for a set of discreet earbuds, these are not for you.The trunk of the earbuds sticks quite far out of your ear, with the oval-shaped body projected forwards towards your mouth. There’s a circular touchpad on each bud for controls – single, double and triple taps can take care of playback, change the noise reduction mode or activate Google Assistant. Which side does what can be configured in an Android or iOS app.Tapping and holding the left bud activates ambient listening mode, reducing the volume and noise reduction, which is useful for catching public transport announcements. Talking to people using ambient mode is possible too, but I wouldn’t recommend it because people will think you’re being incredibly rude.Taking out one of the buds pauses the music. Popping it back in starts it again. All the controls work very well, but they’re missing the big one: volume. You’ve got to dig out your phone to change the volume, which is a real shame.The attractive flip-top charging case is too big to really pocket, which means it’ll have to go in a bag. It charges in 3.5 hours via USB-C and will charge the earbuds three times. A 10-minute stay in the case charges the earbuds for about 90 minutes of playback time, while a full charge takes 90 minutes.You’ll get between five and six hours of constant playback with noise cancelling on, or eight with it off, for a total of 22 to 32 hours, using the case.Sony ditched the ear hook from its previous true wireless earbuds in favour of a new “high-friction rubber surface” on the outer part that enters your ear.With the correct earbud tip, chosen from the seven pairs included, the fit is pretty secure, despite the size and 8.5g weight, which is on the heavy side for wireless earbuds. I would not recommend them for running, though – they are not water resistant. Generally, they are fairly comfortable in the ear, but I found if I didn’t quite get the right orientation the outer rubber surface caused pain in the fleshy bits of my ear after about 45 minutes.The Sony WF-1000XM3 are the most effective in-ear noise cancelling earphones I have tried, including those with wires and large batteries. Noise across the board is effectively reduced, including train noise, road noise and engine rumble, meaning you can listen to your music, and hear it clearly, at lower volumes.The earbuds are heavily affected by wind noise, however, which appears to be a function of their size and how much they stick out of your ears. The wind noise reduction setting appears to do very little.An ambient sound mode pipes noise in from the outside world, which is good for awareness. There’s an adaptive sound mode too that adjusts the noise cancelling depending on what you’re doing. I found simply leaving the noise cancelling set to maximum to be best.The best thing about the WF-1000XM3 is how they sound. We’re not short of great-sounding, expensive, true wireless earbuds. The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless were the best, but no longer. Sony’s finally cracked it on sound.The WF-1000XM3 produce the sort of sparkling audio that allows you to hear new things in longtime favourite tracks. With great energy and clarity, crisp highs, balanced treble and punchy bass, the earbuds sound brilliant out of the box. Sony’s DSEE HX system also works well at bringing life back to highly compressed tracks, but you can also tweak the equaliser manually or use one of the many presets, such as the classic Bass Boost.The new earbuds only support SBC and AAC Bluetooth audio formats, not the higher-quality aptX or Sony’s own LDAC. But they do support Bluetooth 5.0, with each bud making a connection directly to the phone rather than piggybacking off one another. The result is a rock-solid connection, even in challenging conditions, and reduced latency. Even with the oft-problematic YouTube app, I couldn’t spot any lip-sync issues where the sound and the video appear out of time, and only mild lag with games.You can only have one device connected at a time, and switching between them requires manually disconnecting from one device before connecting to the other, which is a bit of a pain.The voice announcements (telling you what you’ve just changed) delay any mode changes until the full announcement has finished, which can be tediously slow. Turning off voice announcements solved the problem.Google Assistant is built in, for reading notifications and more advanced functions, or you can simply use the standard Google Assistant or Siri functions on your phone.An NFC spot on the case provides one-tap pairing.It’s difficult to tell how much charge is left in the case.Call quality was great, with minimal background noise, but became muffled and distant in louder environments.The Sony WF-1000XM3 cost £220 and are available in black or silver.For comparison, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost £280, the B&O E8 2.0 cost £300 and the Master & Dynamic MW07 cost £279.Sony’s hit a home run with the WF-1000XM3. Terrible name, excellent set of earbuds. Packing genuinely impressive noise cancelling technology, brilliant sound, rock-solid connectivity and even long battery life into wireless earbuds is something of an achievement.All that technology makes the earbuds massive, which causes people to stare at you occasionally – if you want something discreet, these are not it. It can be difficult to get the right fit too, and the case, while attractive, is too large to comfortably fit in a pocket. They also lack a volume control on the earbuds, which is mildly annoying.While a price of £220 doesn’t sound cheap, the WF-1000XM3 actually undercut the best-sounding competition by £60-80.They’re not for everyone, but the Sony WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding, most feature-packed true wireless earbuds you can buy right now.Pros: Brilliant sound, effective noise cancelling, long battery life, solid connectivity, good customisation options, full EQ, attractive design, Google AssistantCons: Big earbuds, expensive, big case, problem with wind noise, no onboard volume controlBest true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and ranked This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

How do I find a laptop that can be upgraded or repaired?,Colin wants a laptop with easily replaceable parts such as memory and hard drives,Jack Schofield,2019-10-17T08:00:42+0100,"I just read last week’s answer about upgrading or replacing a six-year-old ThinkPad laptop. I want a laptop where I can easily replace components such as memory and hard drives. How does one go about finding out which modern laptops are modifiable by users? ColinThe one-sentence answer is that consumer laptops often can’t be modified by users, while business laptops can. There are lots of exceptions, but it’s a reasonable rule-of-thumb.It’s not a complete answer, because you also have to know which laptops are aimed at consumers, and which at business users. This is also a somewhat fuzzy area because businesses can use laptops that are really designed for consumers – Dell’s XPS 13 and Apple’s MacBook are examples – while consumers can and do buy business machines.The corollary is something I hear a lot, though it’s more of a complaint than a question: why do the major PC suppliers sell so many different ranges of laptops? They may offer half a dozen or more laptops with similar or even identical specifications under different brand names at different prices, so it’s easy to be confused.Consumers and business buyers have different uses in mind, which means they have different buying criteria. The big PC manufacturers – mainly Dell, HP and Lenovo – therefore create different ranges to meet these different needs.Most consumers want laptops that are uncomplicated and as cheap as possible. Their desires are met by manufacturing laptops with “standard” specifications in very large volumes, sometimes millions of units per year. Most consumers don’t modify their laptops anyway, so it makes sense to solder and glue everything down. This increases reliability, and avoids some of the support calls that destroy the razor-thin profits made on these machines.It also makes them hard to repair, of course, but laptops have become almost as disposable as smartphones and tablets. Some are so cheap it’s simpler to responsibly recycle a broken laptop and buy a new one. Businesses want laptops that are sturdy, reliable and repairable, and they are willing to pay a bit more for them. As a result, business laptops are tested to provide much higher levels of use in much more variable conditions. Some are tested to meet US military specification standards because they will be used by the police and armed forces, and so on. (There are even more rugged machines designed for field service technicians, oil rigs and battlefield use.)Businesses typically need a wider range of configurations, and many of their users need more than the “standard” specification of the day. Often, they also want to be able to buy and support the same laptops for a very long time. Consumer laptops can change every few months, and the specs can vary if someone gets a bargain deal on a particular component. By contrast, businesses buying fleets of perhaps 10,000 or more machines want to be able to buy identical machines over a long period, perhaps 12-18 months, and parts for up to five years. Sometimes their IT departments repair machines by swapping in parts from broken ones, so it helps if the components are effectively the same. Standardisation reduces the cost of ownership.Business laptops sometimes have extra features such as connections for docking stations, they come with Windows 10 Pro instead of Home, and they get better support. Global businesses also want laptops that can be repaired or replaced anywhere in the world.You can, of course, buy a business laptop even if you don’t have a business. In fact, if your pattern of use is similar, it’s the best option. If it’s just for casual use, it’s overkill.Companies that sell a lot of PCs – both HP and Lenovo shift about 40m a year – can afford to support product ranges that target different sets of buyers. It’s really no different from, say, car manufacturers, where the product line can stretch from a Ford Ka+ to a Transit Minibus, with sportier options such as the Mustang and the Ford GT. PC’s can stretch from mini versions to giant server farms (blade computers), with sportier options such as games PCs.Even the laptop market runs from novel-sized versions with 6in screens to game-playing monsters with 17.3in or even larger screens. It must be admitted that mid-range laptops tend to look much the same, but there are differences, even if consumers are not aware of them.Dell, for example, has a wide range of brands. The Inspiron range provides cheap machines for home users, while XPS started as its luxury consumer range. For business buyers, Latitude is Dell’s laptop range and OptiPlex its upmarket desktop range. Other Dell brands include Alienware for gamers, Vostro for small office/home office (SoHo) users, Prestige for business workstations, and PowerEdge for rack-mounted servers. Dell EMC does supercomputers.So, if you want a laptop that can be repaired and upgraded, you’re more likely to find it in the business ranges. Examples include Dell’s Latitude and Prestige ranges, HP ZBooks, ProBooks and EliteBooks, and Lenovo ThinkPads, which originated with IBM in 1992. However, even business laptops are going with the trend towards thinner and lighter machines that are less flexible and harder to upgrade or repair.If you don’t need much portability, gaming laptops can usually be expanded and upgraded. However, “thin and light” models are somewhat rare, the 13in Razer Blade Stealth (fixed memory) and the 15.6in Gigabyte Aero 15 being the most obvious examples.If you really want a laptop that is relatively easy to upgrade or repair, buy the most configurable one you can find. That will usually be a ThinkPad or similar business laptop, or a machine from one of the suppliers that builds to order in the UK, such as Chillblast and PC Specialist.Lenovo typically offers some ThinkPads pre-configured to meet popular demand, which can be shipped the next day, and some that let you select exactly the configuration you want. This usually includes four or more choices of processor and storage, and in some cases, the choice of four different screens. It won’t ship the next day, but you will get the spec you want.Otherwise, you will have to do a bit of research. The quickest approach is to check Crucial’s local website. The company is owned by a chip manufacturer, Micron, and sells memory sticks and both M.2 and hard drive-replacement SSDs. If you have a PC, Crucial’s software can examine it and show you compatible upgrades. If you don’t, you can search for it (eg crucial uk thinkpad T490s) or go through the menu system to find possible upgrades for whatever you are thinking of buying. Once you know what will fit, you can buy from other sources, though Crucial does guarantee that its upgrades are compatible.When it comes to other parts, download the laptop’s repair manual, which is usually available as a pdf file. This will tell you which parts are FRUs (field replaceable units). If an FRU goes wrong, the manufacturer (or a third-party supplier) will ship you the part so that you can change it yourself. Other parts need expert repairers.Installing an FRU can be fiddly, and sometimes needs special tools or new cables or whatever. The next step is therefore to search for a YouTube video where someone shows how they did the upgrade in question. Many of these videos are badly made, but that doesn’t matter. You only need to see which bits need to be unscrewed and how easily they fit back together.The iFixit website is well known for disassembling devices and giving them a score for repairability, which is great if they’ve covered your potential purchase. They mainly teardown high-profile machines, so they probably haven’t. However, iFixit also has thousands of repair guides written by external contributors, and an answers forum where you can ask for advice. The company also sell tools and repair kits, with iFixit Europe shipping to EU countries from its offices in Stuttgart. It’s a business, but it promotes the Right to Repair as good business.Have you got a question?

Should I fix my six-year-old laptop or replace it?,Pablo asks if it’s worth patching up an old ThinkPad T510 or best to buy a new Windows 10 laptop,Jack Schofield,2019-10-10T08:00:11+0100,"I have a Lenovo ThinkPad T510 purchased about six years ago. I’m perfectly happy with it, except the keyboard needs replacing and batteries seem to lose their ability to charge within a couple of years. The keyboard and battery could be replaced for less than $100. Other than those factors, is there any reason to replace the machine? If I buy a Windows 10 machine, could I or should I continue to run Windows 7 on it? PabloThere is no universal answer to your first question. The time to sell, repurpose or recycle an old PC depends on a large number of factors. Some are technical, such as the specification, the build quality, and whether it will actually run Windows 10. Some are personal, such as what you use it for, how much money you can spare, and whether your time has any value.Circumstances alter cases. It might not be worth replacing a very old PC that’s only used for personal emails, especially if the user is short of cash. On the other hand, it could make sense for a company to replace a high-spec machine that is only a few months old if time is extremely valuable, as it can be in financial organisations.However, your second question is easy. Windows 7 was launched in 2009, and reaches the end of its supported life in January 2020. After that, there will be no more security patches except for the companies able and willing to pay. I understand that Windows 7 Extended Security Updates for Windows Enterprise Edition will cost $25 per device for the first year, $50 for the second year and $100 for the third year. Windows 7 Pro charges are twice that, but still only half the typical charges for extending Windows XP support.Given that Windows 10 Pro can be set up to look and work much like Windows 7 Pro, it makes no sense to pay to extend Windows 7’s life unless your business absolutely depends on it.Even if you disregard the security risk, it’s a bad idea to try to run Windows 7 on hardware designed for Windows 10. Manufacturers don’t test their machines with obsolete operating systems. Even parts on the QVL (Qualified Vendor List) are not guaranteed to work.I am not saying it can’t be done. I am saying you should avoid it as an unnecessary risk.I replaced my previous laptop and desktop PCs when they were six years old, and I think this is a sensible strategy. Old machines may still work, but usually they will have been left behind by technological advances. In your case, the T510 is missing the UEFI system that provides fast start-up, M.2 slots for faster SSD modules, USB-C or Thunderbolt for faster connections, better on-chip graphics with video support, a camera for Windows Hello face-recognition log-on, and so on. You’re also missing out on a touch screen with tablet and pen capabilities.Of course, you can improve the performance of your Lenovo ThinkPad T510 by adding more memory and swapping the original hard drive for a fast SSD. Not everybody can. We’ve all seen the trend towards sealed cases, soldered-in memory and storage chips, glued-in batteries and so on. These make laptops more expensive to repair or upgrade, and therefore more disposable.Old PCs also consume more power, which makes them more expensive to run. Mid-range processors have not become dramatically faster, though having (usually) more cores does mean they work more smoothly. For the past decade, Intel has focused on providing more performance per Watt, rather than more raw performance. A typical laptop processor now runs at a TDP of about 15W, going down to 6W, instead of 35W or 45W. These new processors generate less heat, so they can be used in thinner, lighter and more portable laptops. Lower power consumption also provides longer battery life.Incidentally, I don’t feel bad about retiring laptops after six years, partly because I used to retire them after three years. My laptops do a lot of useful work and generally cost about the same as or less than smartphones that do less useful work and only last half as long.Also, I value my time, especially as I get closer to my own end-of-life recycling point. Some people think they are saving resources by using old machines that can’t cope with dozens (or hundreds) of browser tabs, take ages to download bloated web pages, are slow to load programs or copy files or whatever. That’s a waste of human resources. I won’t waste mine.The 15.6in ThinkPad T510 was a premium product designed for corporate use, and far better made than the average laptop was back then, or is today. It appeared around the end of 2010, so the design is nine years old. Its premium features included a Firewire 400 port, which you probably don’t use. The main problem is that it’s not on Lenovo’s Windows 10-compatible list. However, some people have managed to install the 1903 version, so you could download it and have a go. If it installs, your Windows 7 product code should authenticate it, so you won’t have to pay for it. And if all else fails, you could install Linux.Sadly, even if your ThinkPad T510 runs Windows 10, it has a lot of limitations. These include the screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), slow USB 2 ports, the fairly slow drive speed (SATA 2 is 3Gbps not 6Gbps; no M.2 slot), the lack of memory (8GB is the max), and the slow CPU.The T510 is, as mentioned, upgradeable. You have 6GB of memory so it’s probably not worth replacing a 2GB simm with a 4GB module to raise that to 8GB. However, it would be worth swapping the hard drive for a 250GB or 500GB SSD, costing $49.99 or $66.99 at Crucial’s US site. You may be able to find cheaper alternatives where you live in Mexico. An SSD would make a significant difference to your laptop’s responsiveness.Unfortunately, you cannot do anything about the first generation Core i5-540M, though it has held up pretty well. The i5-540M has a Passmark score of 2,452, which is the bare minimum for running Windows 10 at a usable speed. Basically, it’s as fast as today’s Intel Pentium Silver N5000, which is a cheap, battery-efficient 6W chip. The Core i5-540M has a TDP of 35W.If you were to buy something like the T510 today, you’d probably get a 15W Core i5-8265U or better. I regard the i5-8265U as the starting point for serious laptops, and it has a Passmark score of 8,000. It has four cores and eight threads, where your i5-540M has two cores and four threads. According to the UserBenchmark website, the i5-8265U is 141% faster, and if you’re using all the threads, it’s three times as fast. You would notice the difference.If you don’t want to spend a lot of money, put what you would have spent on your T510 towards a refurbished ThinkPad with a much more recent processor, such as the T440 or the X250.If you want to replace your T510 with today’s equivalent, I’d go for the 14in T490s rather than the 15.6in T590. That would get you a Core i5 or i7 processor, 8GB or 16GB of memory, a choice of SSDs from 128GB to 1TB, a good Full HD (1920 x 1080-pixel) screen and a great selection of ports including USB-C/Thunderbolt 3. It’s 16.7mm thin and weighs 1.35kg, where your T510 is more than twice as thick (35.8mm) and more than twice as heavy (2.8kg).There are, obviously, much sexier options, such as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, and the Yoga C940 with its 10th-generation Core processor.But anyone spending that sort of money could put off purchasing a new laptop for about a year or so, because dual-screen machines look like the coming thing. The Asus ZenBook Pro Duo UX581 is a stunning piece of work, while the 14in ZenBook Duo UX481 is a more portable, and more affordable, alternative. Last week, Microsoft previewed its own dual screen machines, the Surface Neo Windows laptop and the Surface Duo Android phone, due about a year from now.Microsoft and Asus have been messing around with “auxiliary displays” since at least 2005. Asus showed a prototype hinged, dual-screen ebook reader in 2009, and the Microsoft Courier attracted some attention before it was cancelled in 2010. More recently, Lenovo had a go with the Lenovo Book, which transitioned from Windows to Android.I’ve seen a lot of terrible machines, but the Surface Duo looks like the real deal. I expect all the leading manufacturers to launch their own versions, which will establish it as a new form factor, as happened with the Surface Pro. I wouldn’t be shocked to see a dual-screen iPad…Have you got a question?

Can a mini PC and a TV set replace an old laptop?,Anthony wants to replace his mother’s old Windows 7 laptop. Would a mini-PC hooked up to her 32in TV work well enough? ,Jack Schofield,2019-10-03T08:00:46+0100,"My retired mother happily uses her iPhone and iPad for the majority of her digital needs, but she uses an old, low-spec Windows 7 laptop for Microsoft Office documents for various committees she sits on, for her music library and digital photos, some web browsing and other tasks that cannot be easily done on a small device.I have a Mac Mini running through a 42in TV set, and we are interested in the feasibility of using a mini PC hooked up to her 32in TV. Target budget is £300 for PC, keyboard and any adaptors.For the OS evangelists among your readers, I use a Mac and I may well repurpose her laptop with Linux, but Mum wants Windows. AntMini or micro PCs are terrific at what they do, as long as you don’t expect them to do too much. They are also potential space-savers because they can be attached to the back of any monitor or TV set that has a standard VESA mount. Anyone unfamiliar with the form factor can read an answer from November 2018, What is the point of mini PCs?However, mini PCs come in at least three overlapping categories. First, there are entry-level models that cost about £100 to £350, and are essentially television set-top boxes. Second, there are desktop replacement minis that are widely used in large businesses for their convenience and space-saving properties. Prices range from £300 to about £1,500.The third category consists of so-called barebones machines that appeal to computer enthusiasts and other people who want to build their own small-format systems. These could be set-top boxes or desktop replacements depending on the parts used. However, they don’t appeal to home users who want an off-the-shelf set-top box for media streaming, and they don’t appeal to businesses, which buy standardised mini PCs in volume from HP, Lenovo and Dell.Your question is about the feasibility of using a (roughly) £250 mini PC hooked up to a 32in TV for Microsoft Office and some other uses, such as managing music and photo libraries. There are a couple of reasons why I don’t think it’s a good idea.The main problem is that it’s not practical to use programs such as Word and Excel at typical TV viewing distances, especially not with such a small TV set. In the old days, interface designers distinguished between “the 3ft experience” of using a computer monitor and “the 10ft experience” of using a TV set. They needed radically different approaches, and different-sized icons and text.Even if we assume the TV set can display small text sharply enough, your mum will need to be around 3ft/1 metre from the screen to make it usable. Based on my long experience of watching TV in normal-sized living rooms, I’ll be surprised if this is practical. However, you can easily check this by plugging mum’s current Windows laptop into her TV set.The other problem is your budget. There are plenty of very cheap mini PCs, but their specifications generally include an old and slow Intel Atom processor, 2GB or 4GB of memory, and 32GB of eMMC chip storage, which is pretty much on a par with an SD card. Amazingly enough, machines like this will run Microsoft Office with home-sized documents, but they are underpowered for what your mother needs.Worse, any PC with limited storage – 32GB or 64GB – may run into problems updating Windows 10 twice a year, even though it should be able to handle upgrades by using, say, an external hard drive as temporary storage space. (Presumably your mum already has one for backup purposes. If not, install some kind of backup solution as soon as possible.)Unless your mum’s music and photo libraries are very small, even 128GB may not be enough. Fortunately, you can solve this problem by buying something that has an SD card slot. Put all your mum’s music, photos and documents onto a 128GB SanDisk Ultra (£16.98) or similar card, put shortcuts to the three directories on the Windows desktop, and reserve the main eMMC or SSD drive for the operating system and applications.You can still buy a reasonable mini PC on your budget. I’d usually suggest a Beelink J45 with a quad-core Pentium Silver J4205 processor, 8GB of memory, a 128GB SSD and Windows 10 Home for £241.90. Including any cables, you’d probably be under budget with a Logitech K400 wireless keyboard currently going for almost half price (£17.99) on Amazon.co.uk. I’m suggesting the K400 keyboard because it has a touchpad, whereas the Logitech MK270 (£17) is a standard keyboard plus a mouse.Unusually, the same Beelink page at Amazon has some better deals. For example, the same Beelink J45 with a 256GB SSD is currently being discounted by £75 to £193.80, so the version with 256GB of storage is much cheaper than the one with 128GB.Alternatively, you could get a Beelink L55 with a faster, but rather old, Core i3-5005U processor for £218.84. How this differs from the Beelink U55 that has the same specification for £299.90 remains a mystery.Suppliers rarely sell their higher-spec PCs for less than their lower-spec versions, so either I’m missing something or the apparent anomalies won’t last very long.Since the small TV set is likely to be a problem, you could either spend quite a lot of money on a bigger TV set or a smaller amount on a computer monitor. For example, you could get your mother a 21.5in Dell SE2219H IPS screen for £99.95, or the same-sized HP 22w for £79.99. Either of these 1920 x 1080-pixel Full HD screens would work with a mini PC and provide much more comfortable viewing for a pair of ageing eyes.If you buy a mini PC for closer to £200 then you could still come in around your budget price with either of these monitors, as long as your mother can find space for the extra screen.This is well worth considering because mum will get a better screen and keyboard, and an all-round better system by combining a mini PC and a monitor than she would get with a cheap laptop or all-in-one.The package price also compares well against the cost of an iPad or an iPhone, not to mention a Mac Mini (£799 with only 128GB of storage).Under the circumstances, you may want to take the easy way out and replace mum’s old laptop with a new laptop. It’s some time since I looked at cheap laptops, and my most recent answer covered laptops costing up to £500. You can still buy “real” laptops for less, but below £300, the experience gets progressively worse.Yes, you can live with a laptop that has limited screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), a slow Intel Pentium or Celeron processor, only 4GB of memory and a traditional hard drive, but you can do dramatically better for not a lot more money.For example, the 15.6in Asus X540 is an entry-level laptop with that sort of spec (Pentium Silver N5000, 4GB, 1TB HDD) and good value at £249.99 from Argos. But you could get a similar machine such as the HP 255 G7 with a Full HD screen, slightly faster AMD Ryzen 3 2200U with Vega 3 graphics, 8GB of memory (expandable) and a 256GB SSD for £329.98 from eBuyer.Indeed, for preference, go for the version of the HP laptop with an Intel Core i5-8265U processor for £399.99, or the smarter looking Lenovo V155-15API with a Ryzen 5 3500U and Vega 8 graphics for the same price.Low specs are a false economy. Today, 8GB of RAM costs about £30, so fitting 4GB instead of 8GB only saves $20 at retail prices. It must save even less at the wholesale prices that HP and Lenovo pay when they are buying more than 1m memory modules a week. At current prices, it’s crazy to buy PCs with only 4GB, unless you plan to add more memory instantly.Have you got a question?

What do I need to make YouTube videos?,"Ed wonders if you need a computer to make YouTube videos, as he doesn’t own one",Jack Schofield,2019-09-19T08:00:27+0100,"I’m a newbie. When people shoot YouTube videos, do they need a computer or laptop to do so? I don’t have either. EdPeople shoot videos with all kinds of equipment, from simple smartphones to professional movie cameras. Prices range from £50 to more than £40,000. As always, it depends on the job. Some people are taking selfies for Facebook while others are shooting blockbusters for cinemas.Selfies are usually shot with handheld smartphones and uploaded directly with little or no editing. It takes seconds. Blockbuster movies are usually shot with teams operating specialised cameras on dollies. Shoots are followed by extensive editing that may require rooms full of computers to add CGI (computer-generated imagery). It can take months, if not years.A lot of amateur YouTube videos are posted by vloggers (video bloggers) and consist mainly of “talking heads”. People can make vlogs with minimal equipment, and a decade or so ago, that was good enough. Since then, quality standards have risen dramatically, along with the potential returns. Today, YouTube channels can generate millions of dollars a year in revenues. People competing at that level are willing and able to spend the money needed to produce professional-looking results.We love to say that “content is king”, and quality content can transcend technical flaws. With unique footage of terrorist attacks, floods, major fires and other disasters, terrible technical quality implies authenticity. But few of the millions of YouTube posters have unique content, so quality matters.You don’t have to be Stanley Kubrick. You just need a stable horizontal camera, good lighting, a sharp image and clear sound, in that order.Vloggers’ attempts to make better quality movies is now driving a large market for add-ons and accessories. These include tripods, gimbals and specialised grips for smartphones; softboxes and LED lighting arrays; boom microphones, lapel mics and separate digital recorders.Cheap webcams have largely been replaced by standalone digital cameras, especially the mirrorless and DSLR varieties that deliver high quality video.Vloggers have also needed to develop their editing skills, and buy computers with enough power to do post-production work. Many vloggers used to post what were in effect live shows, unedited except for “topping and tailing”. In other words, they would add an introductory title sequence and some credits – or “calls to action” (subscribe to my channel, go to my blog, follow me on Twitter, sign up for my email list) – at the end. Today, they start with scripts and storyboards, and do retakes to replace sections where they misspoke or made bloopers.A vlogger with something original to say and enough charisma to break the rules can still get away with waving a smartphone around, but only because it stands out against the new normal. Similarly, the Blair Witch Project worked partly because its technical quality was so different from standard Hollywood production values. But nobody would try to make Gone with the Wind, Gosford Park or Gravity using Blair Witch techniques.Most smartphones can now shoot video. In fact, some can shoot good-quality 4K video, though 1080p is still good enough for YouTube. Smartphones are very portable and almost always handy, which makes them very useful for travel and “roving reporter” applications. This is why media corporations like the BBC are interested. However, they should still be used on a tripod, whenever possible, or with a gimbal to stabilise movement.Buy a two-handed Zeadio Smartphone Video Rig, Grip Stabiliser Cellphone Tripod Holder – cheap at £10.99 – or similar and you can attach a microphone, lights etc and get much better results. Unfortunately, you’ve lost the popular idea of pocketable smartphone video and you might as well use a proper camera.Smartphones also have some disadvantages for “talking heads” vlogging. The main ones are the lower quality of the front-facing selfie lens – which lets you see yourself on the screen – and limited sound quality. The mics built into smartphones are designed to produce good results when close to your mouth, not when you are 3m metres away. The best solution is usually a lapel mic with a long lead that plugs into a phone’s microphone socket or USB-C port. A lapel mic helps keep the audio level constant when subjects move around.You will also need some sort of grip to hold the phone, or a tripod mount adapter so that you can use it on a tripod. As mentioned above, you might also need softbox lighting or an LED array, because window lighting is very variable. Smartphones become less convenient when you compensate for these problems.You can use an app such as Filmic Pro to get manual control of your smartphone’s video settings, but Android users should check to see if their phone is supported.It can be quite hard to edit videos on a smartphone because of their small screens and, in some cases, lack of processor power. Happily, the quality of smartphone video editing apps has been growing along with the increases in power and memory of high-end phones. It’s not ideal, but if you are committed enough, it’s doable.Anyone who has used Skype knows that the vast majority of built-in webcams do not produce high quality video. They are also in the wrong place. For vlogging, the camera should be at eyebrow height or slightly higher. No one wants to look up your nose, and a slight downward angle is more flattering.When I answered a similar question three years ago, I suggested that Logitech’s C920 HD Pro webcam was a good solution. At £54.99, it still is, though there is a new C920s at £84.99. Both devices make it very easy to produce good quality Full HD (1080p) “talking head” videos for YouTube, especially if you put the webcam on a tripod and add lights.The laptop’s main advantage is that it’s a much better platform for video editing, though that does benefit enormously from having a powerful processor and 8GB or even more memory.Its obvious drawback is that it’s pretty much limited to “talking head” videos and video conferencing. You’re not going to carry a laptop and webcam around to do selfies, interviews or on-street action videos.Most YouTube vloggers use digital cameras to capture their videos. The most useful camera features are an articulated screen and a microphone port. The screen should flip around so that you can see that you’re in frame. The mic port lets you use an external microphone, which is important because camera microphones can be even worse than smartphone microphones.Sadly, very few cameras – and no cheap compacts – have both features. However, many mirrorless cameras and DSLRs have microphone ports, if you can afford one.The vloggerpro website has a list of the six best options, headed by the Canon EOS M50 (£594.98), which targets vloggers with kits. I agree that “the Panasonic G85 is probably the best choice for most vloggers”, but it’s sold as the DMC-G80MEB-K (£599) in the UK. Of course, the Panasonic GH5 (aka DC-GH5MEB-K) is the one you really want, but it’s £1,481.56 or more. The Canon EOS 700D / Rebel T5i is a good DSLR to look for second hand.Canon’s G7 X compact camera has also been popular with vloggers, to the point where Canon has added a microphone jack to the latest Mark III version and done a vlogger kit for it.Otherwise, users will need to record sound separately and add it at the editing stage. This is extra work and means remembering to extemporise a clapperboard for synchronisation purposes. You can pretend to be Cecil B DeMille, but it doesn’t increase spontaneity.This is the most expensive way to make YouTube videos because you need both a camera (plus the usual tripods, microphones and lights) and a computer for editing. However, both the camera and computer have many other, more general uses, and they do produce the best results for the money.Have you got a question?

Can I still use my Chromebook now it is no longer supported?,Bill’s Acer Chromebook C720 will not receive further updates. It works well so can he still use it?,Jack Schofield,2019-09-12T08:00:42+0100,"I have recently got the message that my Acer Chromebook C720 will not be receiving any further updates as Google no longer supports Chromebooks older than six years. I use mine for surfing the internet, email and creating documents, which I send as email attachments. The machine still works as well as when I first bought it, and I’m reluctant to dump it for a new one.I understand that I can install a new operating system myself but I really can’t be bothered. The reason I bought a Chromebook in the first place was because of ease of use, simplicity and reliability. What are the risks if I just continue to use it without receiving any more updates? BillThere is no way to assess the risk because it depends partly on what you use your Chromebook for, and how careful you are. Nowadays, most attacks require some kind of user assistance. This can mean, among other things, installing fake Android apps with hidden features, installing bogus Chrome extensions, visiting malicious websites, falling for phishing attacks, falling for man-in-the-middle attacks and failing to install essential security updates.You will inevitably miss essential security updates to the Chrome browser. However, we can’t know in advance what sort of holes might appear in Chrome, or whether they might be exploited in unpatched Chromebooks, though Chrome OS’s security record is very good indeed.We also can’t know how long it will be before your obsolete version of Chrome is unable to cope with new web technologies or when websites will refuse to work with it.For schools and companies that use Chromebooks, Google spells out further potential problems. “Business and education customers using devices that have passed their AUE [Auto Update Expiration] date should not expect that they can manage their devices as expected using the Google Admin console or leverage new management features released,” it says.Either way, simple web browsing may not be much riskier than usual, and there are ways to make it safer. But I’d have second thoughts if you use your machine for financial operations without two-factor authentication, or if your email is full of private medical and financial information, passwords, and so on. The risks might be low but the stakes would be higher.A new Chromebook is cheaper than getting £50,000 siphoned from your bank account.Google launched Chromebooks in 2011 but the early models were pretty dire, few people bought them, and their relatively short life (about four years) didn’t matter very much. Chromebooks have changed a lot since then, getting a more Windowsy look-and-feel, touchscreen support and access to Google Play with the ability to run Android apps. I assume this means Google has to test all the old Chromebooks and Chromeboxes – probably about 150 devices – to make sure they run new versions of Chrome OS. It would be time-consuming, expensive and ultimately impossible for Google to support all Chrome OS devices forever.In 2016, Google introduced an End Of Life (EOL) policy that offered support for five years. About a year later, it changed the name to something that didn’t imply planned obsolescence – Auto Update Expiration (AUE) – and extended support for new Chromebooks to 6.5 years.This is a reasonable lifespan compared to laptops running Windows or macOS. Some people run their laptops for longer, but usually they are paying more in wasted time than it would cost them to buy a new machine. (Of course, that’s assuming they have the money available.)The key point is that the AUE period starts when the manufacturer launches a Chromebook platform, not when you buy it. You can buy a brand new Chromebook for a knock-down price, but if it’s based on a three-year-old platform, it will only be supported for three and a half, not for six and a half years.In theory, Chromebook manufacturers could keep shipping the same platform for five or more years. Their outdated specifications ought to warn off potential buyers but typical Chromebook users probably aren’t following industry hardware trends. Every buyer should therefore check Google’s AUE page for end-of-support dates.In fact, the AUE date should be shown prominently in Chromebook adverts. If I was going to spend £1,699.99 on a Google Pixelbook or £1,738 on a Google Pixel Slate, I’d certainly want to know that they go out of support in June 2024, according to Google’s AUE page.Most Chromebooks are cheap and relatively underpowered so I’d expect them to be slow after six and a half years. JavaScript-bloated webpages keep getting bigger, while Chrome batters low-end chips and guzzles memory by spawning more processes than you have tabs open.However, your Acer Chromebook C720 probably has a dual-core 1.4GHz Celeron 2955U laptop processor, which is a Core design rather than a cheap Atom-based or ARM chip. It’s probably not far behind a Celeron N4000, though it will run hotter and use about twice as much electricity. You could repurpose it to run Neverware’s CloudReady, a Linux such as GalliumOS, or possibly even Microsoft Windows. I know you don’t want to do this but other users might.CloudReady works much like a Chromebook but it is really intended to rescue old Windows and Mac laptops. Neverware’s compatibility list does not include any Chromebooks, that I can see. However, you can get it to run by opening the case, removing the Chromebook’s “write protect” screw and flashing the firmware.Brian, an Ask Jack reader, said he used MrChromebox’s Firmware Utility Script to convert his unsupported Acer C710 Chromebook to UEFI. After booting from a USB thumb drive, he said: “I installed Cloudware and there appears to be no difference to the Chrome OS. Google transferred all my bookmarks and automatically installed apps and extensions, by my use of the same account details.”The C720 is on the list of supported Chromebooks but readers should check first.Warning: this kind of thing can “brick” your Chromebook. You may be able to rescue it but you do this stuff entirely at your own risk.Chromebooks were originally designed to do everything online so you should have very little personal information on your device. The C720 has a full-sized SD card slot so you should already be storing backups of your essential files on this easily removable form of storage. If you only plug the card in when you need it, you should have very little to lose.You can minimise the amount of information stored on your Chromebook by using the privacy settings and turning off features such as saving web passwords and auto-filling web forms. You could even browse in guest mode, which basically means starting as a new user every time. The drawback is that you will have to log in to each website every time and it will not save your settings.Chrome OS has had more than 50 security vulnerabilities. However, Google has a standing offer of $150,000 (£120,000) for anyone who can “compromise a Chromebook or Chromebox with device persistence in guest mode (ie guest to guest persistence with interim reboot, delivered via a webpage)”. No one has collected it so that approach should be relatively safe.If you do pick up some form of malware, you can reset your Chromebook to factory condition by using the Powerwash feature at the bottom of the “show advanced settings …” page. Of course, this removes all your files and settings so you may not want to do it very often but it’s nice to have the option.Have you got a question?
