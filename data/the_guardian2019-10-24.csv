Sri Lanka spy chief blamed for failures over Easter bombings,Parliamentary report says Nilantha Jayawardena had information on attacks 17 days before they happened,,2019-10-24T01:47:50+0100,"A Sri Lankan parliamentary committee that investigated the Easter suicide bombings has concluded the country’s spy chief was primarily responsible for the intelligence failure that led to the deaths of 269 people in the attacks.In a report released on Wednesday the committee said Nilantha Jayawardena received information on possible attacks as early as 4 April – 17 days before the suicide bombings took place – but there were delays on his part in sharing the intelligence with other agencies.The report said Jayawardena’s responsibility was compounded by the fact that he had asked higher-level officials nearly a year earlier to bring investigations into the ringleader of the 21 April attacks, Mohamed Zahran, under his sole purview.Sri Lanka’s national security council met on 9 April, with the defence ministry secretary asking Jayawardena for a briefing on Zahran, to which he responded that he would send a note later, the report said.“If the matter was discussed, steps may have been taken to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks,” it said.Zahran, leader of a local Muslim group, was among the suicide bombers who participated in the attacks on three churches and three hotels. Five of the six attacks took place in and around Colombo, the capital. A total of seven suicide bombers died in the attacks, while another blew himself up later, after his explosives failed in a fourth Colombo hotel.The committee also said an open spat between the president, Maithripala Sirisena, and the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the ensuing political crisis contributed to the security failures.The report said that Sirisena failed on “numerous occasions to give leadership and also actively undermined government and systems including having ad hoc national security council meetings and leaving out key individuals from meetings”.Sirisena and Wickremesinghe are from different parties and formed a cohabitation government in 2015. They fell out and their spat broke into the open in October 2018 when Sirisena dismissed Wickremesinghe as prime minister. A court decision that restored Wickremesinghe as prime minister ended a 52-day government standstill. But from that point on Sirisena did not involve Wickremesinghe in security council meetings.The report said the intelligence service did not report to the military on possible attacks until 19 April. The next day Jayawardena called the national police chief to say there was a high probability that an attack would occur on 21 April.On Easter morning Jayawardena called the police chief again to say that “something dangerous would happen on that day”, the report said. He also called the secretary to the defence ministry, Hemasiri Fernando.Fernando was quoted in the report as saying that “within a few minutes” of speaking to Jayawardena, “I heard that there had been a bomb explosion at one of the hotels.”The committee recommended reforms in the security and intelligence sectors, improved monitoring of financial transactions, and the monitoring and controlling of religious extremism.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/sri-lanka-spy-chief-blamed-for-failures-over-easter-bombings
"Thai king sacks six royal officials over 'evil actions', days after removing consort",Royal household bureau members including a nurse and vet sacked for breaching ‘disciplinary conduct’ ,,2019-10-24T00:38:13+0100,"Thailand’s king has fired six senior palace officials for their “evil actions”, the palace announced Wednesday, days after the monarch stripped his consort of all her titles for “disloyalty”.In a week of palace intrigue which has gripped the country, King Maha Vajiralongkorn fired six high-ranking officials from the royal household bureau, including “a nurse at the bedroom guard service” and a veterinarian, according to two separate announcements released by palace mouthpiece the Royal Gazette.“They have severely breached disciplinary conduct for their evil actions by exploiting their official positions for their own or other people’s gain,” said the gazette.It follows his removal of the King’s consort, 34-year-old former royal bodyguard Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, of her noble title and military ranks.Her public fall from grace comes just three months after he bestowed on her the title, the first in nearly a century by a Thai monarch.Nicknamed “Koi”, Sineenat was condemned Monday in a royal command aired on national television for “acting against the appointment of the queen”.Thailand’s royal family is protected by a draconian defamation law that makes scrutiny of it, or debate over its role, almost impossible inside the kingdom.The public is often able to glean clues to the inner workings of the palace through its use of symbolic imagery and the fates of royal aides.Sineenat, who has not been seen in public since Monday, has been trending on Thai social media with the hashtag SaveKoi.Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne in 2016 following the death of his beloved father, who was regarded by Thais as a figure of moral authority.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/thai-king-sacks-six-royal-officials-over-evil-actions-days-after-removing-consort
Superyachts and private jets: spending of corrupt super-rich revealed,Groundbreaking analysis finds £300bn of suspect funds funnelled through the UK ,Rupert Neate,2019-10-24T00:01:50+0100,"The multimillion pound spending habits of corrupt members of the global super-rich – including 421 luxury homes, three superyachts, seven private jets as well as elite private school fees and even hovercraft – have been revealed in a groundbreaking analysis of more than 400 money laundering and corruption cases.Research by Transparency International, an anti-corruption campaign group, found more than £300bn of suspect funds have been funnelled through the UK banks, law firms and accountants before being spent on a £1m Cartier diamond ring, masterpiece art works from Sotheby’s, and a £50,000 Tom Ford crocodile-skin jacket with matching crocodile-skin handbag from Harrods.The suspect cash – which often comes from corrupt officials’ embezzlement of hundreds of millions of pounds from poor countries’ state coffers – was also found to have been spent on a £200,000 Bentley Bentayga driven by the 22-year-old son of the former prime minister of Moldova. His father, Vlad Filat, had been sentenced to nine years in prison for his role in the “theft of the century”.In its forensic analysis of more than 400 global bribery, corruption and money laundering cases in 116 countries, Transparency International’s At Your Service report found 582 UK firms or individuals had helped rich people bring suspect funds into the country.The money was paid through some 17,000 shell companies, 1,455 of which were registered to at the same serviced office above a wine bar in Birmingham.“We’ve known for a long time that the UK’s world-class services have attracted a range of clients, including those who have money and pasts to hide,” said Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK. “Now, for the first time, we have shed light on who these companies are and how they have become entangled in some of the biggest corruption scandals of our time. This should act as a wake-up call for government and regulators, and deliver much-needed reforms to the UK’s defences against dirty money.”One case revealed that a shell company called Airship Universal was used to buy a corporate box at Chelsea FC’s Stamford Bridge for £126,000. In another case £34,827 was paid to a now-defunct hovercraft company in Kent.Almost £3m was funnelled to private schools, including Charterhouse, Harrow and Lancing College. In 2010 alone Charterhouse, in Surrey, which describes itself as “one of the great historic schools of England” received £300,000 of funds linked to the Troika Laundromat scheme to move £3.5bn out of Russia, according to the report.British universities, including the London School of Economics, the University of York, the University of St Andrews and University College London, were paid more than £500,000. The payments all came from shell companies with bank accounts at institutions that have since closed owing to mismanagement and money laundering failings, the report said.Earlier this year the National Crime Agency (NCA) seized £25,000 of suspect cash from a niece of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, who had been studying design at the University of the Arts London. Several members of her family are subject to international sanctions. Anisseh Chawkat, whose mother is al-Assad’s sister and whose father had been the head of Syria’s military intelligence, was living in a £60,000-a-year rented flat in Knightsbridge.In another case, Vlad Luca Filat, the son of Vlad Filat, the former prime minister of Moldova, was studying business at City University in London. An NCA investigation found that the son’s extravagant lifestyle in the city, which included a £1,000-per-day Chelsea penthouse and £200,000 Bentley Bentayga, was funded by large deposits from overseas companies, including in the Cayman Islands and Turkey. Large cash sums were paid into three HSBC bank accounts, including £98,000 in one three-day period. Facebook posts showed the 22-year-old drinking Dom Pérignon through a straw at beach parties in St Tropez.For offspring that may not have been clever enough to get into top schools or universities on their academic merit, the researchers found that more than £300,000 was spent on “educational consultants helping to secure places at the most prestigious institutions”.Large fees were paid to an educational consultant from funds linked to the Troika Laundromat scheme, which helps parents gain places for their children in top private schools. Daniel Bruce, chief executive of Transparency International UK, said: “Government and law enforcement agencies have made real progress in recent years to reduce the places for corrupt individuals to hide, yet our findings confirm it is still far too easy for criminals and the corrupt to seek impunity with the assistance of UK businesses.“Despite the dedication of many committed professionals in the fight against corruption, there remains too much poor practice to be able to assume bad behaviour is confined to a few rotten apples. Businesses and government should redouble their efforts, through resource and will, to remove the helping hand for those who have abused positions of power and stolen from their people.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/superyachts-and-private-jets-spending-of-corrupt-super-rich-revealed
Presidential apology and reform pledge fail to quell Chile protests,Thousands take to streets of Santiago for sixth day running after Piñera scraps fare hike and raises pensions and minimum wage,,2019-10-23T23:33:58+0100,"Tens of thousands of protesters have flooded Chile’s capital, setting up flaming barricades and clashing with riot police after an apology and promises of economic reforms from President Sebastián Piñera failed to quell unrest and rioting has led to at least 18 deaths.Trade unionists in the world’s top copper-producing country joined demonstrators with a general strike in a movement that started with anger at a small rise in subway fares, but expanded into protests against inequality and to demand improvements in education, healthcare and wages in one of Latin America’s wealthiest, but most unequal nations.Many protesters in Santiago waved the national flag and shouted: “Chile has woken up!”Police responded by spraying water cannons and firing rubber bullets and teargas. Similar scenes were repeated in towns and cities all along the long, narrow South American country of 18 million people.Millions of students were still unable to attend classes, several subway stations were shut and long lines continued to form outside gas stations and supermarkets after many were torched or destroyed.The unrest erupted last week when students began to jump subway station turnstiles to protest against a four-cent subway fare rise that the Chilean government said was needed to cope with rising oil prices and a weaker currency.Most of the protests have been peaceful, with demonstrators of all ages banging pots to demand reforms. But the unrest also involved riots, arson and looting that have racked Chile for six days, nearly paralyzing a country long seen as an oasis of stability.Human rights groups have expressed concerns about how security forces have handled the protests after the government ordered a military curfew. It was the first such curfew – other than for natural disasters – imposed since the country returned to democracy in 1990 following a bloody 17-year military dictatorship.“We’re worried,” José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, told the Associated Press. “The images that we’ve received from credible sources, trustworthy sources, show that there has been an excess of force both by police as well as some soldiers.”About 20,000 soldiers are patrolling the streets, nearly 200 people have been injured and about 5,000 have been arrested.On Tuesday night, Piñera announced economic reforms including an increase in the state pension and a minimum wage hike. But many say the 69-year-old billionaire businessman reacted late and the announcement failed to calm anger in the streets.The protests divided Chileans.“You don’t know what can happen to you,” said retiree Magaly Muñoz. “I understand that people are dissatisfied, but they can’t break into your home and loot businesses. I can’t support that.”After the protests erupted, Piñera reversed the subway hike while also declaring a state of emergency. He said this week that Chile is “at war”.He then took a more conciliatory tone, apologizing and announcing an agenda calling for increasing the lowest monthly pensions from $151 to $181, raising the monthly minimum wage from $413 to $481 and rescinding a 92% rise in electricity rates scheduled to take effect next month. It would also include a tax increase for anyone earning more than $11,000 a month.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/chile-protests-sebastian-pinera-apology-reform
Evo Morales alleges coup attempt as Bolivia opposition claims 'giant fraud',President said in a televised speech the right ‘prepared the coup’ with foreign powers amid growing tensions over the election,Mat Youkee,2019-10-23T23:08:39+0100,"Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, has accused opposition leaders and foreign powers of attempting a “coup” against him amid growing tensions over the result of Sunday’s desperately tight election.In an angry televised speech on Wednesday, Morales said: “A coup d’etat is under way. The right wing prepared the coup with international support.”Morales went into elections needing 40% of votes and a 10-point margin of victory to avoid a second-round runner against the main opposition candidate, Carlos Mesa. By Wednesday afternoon 97% of the official results had been processed, giving him 46.49% and a 9.5-point lead.With most outstanding votes from remote rural areas expected to go in his favour, Morales repeated his declaration of a first-round victory, which he had made prematurely on Sunday night.But on Wednesday the Organization of American States (OAS) said that a runoff should be held even if Morales breached the 10-point margin.“In the case that … the margin of difference exceeds 10%, it is statistically reasonable to conclude that it will be by negligible margin,” said Manuel González, the head of the OAS election observation team in Bolivia. “Given the context and the problematic issues in this electoral process the best option continues to be the convening of a second round.”International observers have expressed concern over an unexplained daylong gap in the reporting of results which was followed by a surge in Morales votes when the count resumed on Monday. “Why did the government shut down the reporting of results?” asked Carlos Trujillo, US ambassador to the OAS, at a special session convened to discuss the Bolivian situation. “The government allowed a somewhat fair election because they did not realise their own popularity and thought they could win under their system. When they realised they could not win in the first round they shut down the results so that they could steal the election.”The vice-president of Bolivia’s electoral board resigned on Tuesday, saying that the decision of the board’s six-member panel to suspend reporting results had discredited “the entire electoral process, causing unnecessary social convulsion”.Mesa has accused Morales of trying to conduct “a giant fraud” and vowed that his party “will not recognize a fraudulent result”.In a video statement on Wednesday, Mesa called for “permanent protests” until a second-round vote was confirmed, and said he would present evidence of electoral fraud.Allegations of electoral fraud have already sparked street violence, in which anti-government protesters clashed with police, and set fire to electoral offices in eight of Bolivia’s regional capital cities. On Tuesday the OAS said it would conduct an analysis of the election, focusing on the results reporting systems and the chain of custody of ballot boxes. However, the results of such an analysis are unlikely to please either side as the positions become increasingly entrenched.Civil society groups in eight of the country’s nine departments called for a general strike that could bring the country to a standstill. “Not even an ant will move in Santa Cruz,” declared Luis Fernando Camacho, the leader of the civil society group for Santa Cruz, the country’s largest and richest city.Morales has overseen relative stability and growth, but angered many by running for a fourth consecutive term despite a 2016 referendum which ruled against lifting term limits.The results reflect the split between Bolivia’s urban population – which broadly backed the opposition – and the rural Andean populations that remain loyal to Morales, a former coca farmer.“I don’t think Evo will accept the OAS’s calls for a second round,” says Jorge Derpic, a Bolivia specialist and assistant professor at the University of Georgia. “This is the first time we have seen protests by the middle classes in all the country’s major cities against Morales. Evo has called to mobilize his base – the coca growers, the miners and the campesinos [the rural poor] – and we could see further partisan violent clashes between rural and urban areas.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/bolivia-evo-morales-coup-accusation-opposition-foreign-powers
Warrior Women With Lupita Nyong’o review – a kick-ass tale worthy of an Oscar,"The Black Panther star uncovers the astounding true story of the Agoji, Benin’s female army – then finds the last warrior left alive",Ellen E Jones,2019-10-23T23:05:50+0100,"Channel 4’s Black History season continues with this reminder that when television ignores African history, it deprives us of some astounding stories. The story told by the Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o in this one-off documentary is like something out of a blockbuster Hollywood movie. Specifically, the 2018 blockbuster Black Panther, in which Nyong’o starred as Nakia, a spy for Wakanda’s Afro-futurist, all-female army the Dora Milaje.It seems that between the 17th and 19th centuries, the Dora Milaje had a real-life equivalent: the Agoji, from the Kingdom of Dahomey in present-day Benin. Armies of eroticised, exoticised and “unnaturally” aggressive women are a common trope in the victor-written history of colonial expansion, but the Dahomey Amazons are also familiar for other reasons. Soon after Nyong’o’s arrival in Benin, she was taken to the palace in Abomey where a centuries-old frieze depicted panthers and crossed swords. “All the kings of Dahomey are the children of the Panther King,” said the palace guide, to Nyong’o’s amazement. The question of where Marvel should send the royalties cheque was not addressed.This is news to Nyong’o because, while she may be the most prominent African in Hollywood (Djimon Hounsou? Charlize Theron?) she is not from round here. Did you know Africa is a hugely diverse continent, home to more than 3,000 ethnic groups speaking some 2,000 languages? Yep, and sadly, that still needs saying, so Nyong’o said it: “I just get frustrated when other people assume we’re all the same!”Indeed, according to Ancestry DNA, your 19% Benin-by-way-of-Jamaica reviewer has as good a chance as Nyong’o of being descended from a fearsome Agoji warrior. When Nyong’o pronounced the Dahomey emblem’s similarity to the “Wakanda Forever” salute “so dope … SO DOPE”, it was a reminder that this Mexico-born, Kenyan national is also pretty darn American. (One of the documentary’s incidental joys is the opportunity to hear an actor often cast in hauntingly taciturn roles be so effusive and chatty.)Yet Nyong’o wasn’t content to simply admire dusty artefacts; she wanted to feel a living link to the past. Or, considering the last Agoji is said to have died in the 1970s, get as close as possible. Fifteen princesses with machetes performing Agoji battle anthems felt pretty special, but that was soon topped by a mysterious encounter with an elderly woman sporting a Wakanda-esque tattoo on her forearm. Vodun beliefs about ancestor reincarnation made it difficult to discern her identity at first, but she was eventually established as the last Agoji, trained as a child by warriors and kept secret within the palace compound for decades. Told you it was a good story.This all sounds pretty ass-kicking, but of course the real Agoji weren’t actually comic-book heroes. That is reflected in their recruitment practice which, according to one oral historian, wasn’t always voluntary. “Girls who did not want to get married could choose to join the army,” he told Nyong’o. But also: “Married women who committed adultery were forced into the army by their husbands.” So, an expression of female power that also functioned as the patriarchy’s dustbin for troublesome women.We got a further hint at this, when an interviewee felt it necessary to emphasise his Agoji ancestor’s sexual appeal, saying: “She had huge buttocks and was a real woman … a woman must have big buttocks for men to desire her.” Which, well … even if she did have an arse for the ages, still seems an oddly disrespectful way to talk about one’s grandmother.This matters because, while the efforts of David Olusoga, Gus Casely-Hayford and others have brought a postcolonial perspective on Africa to the screen, the voices of African women are still relatively few. Nyong’o isn’t a historian, though, and it sometimes showed in unasked questions: what was the day-to-day life of the Agoji like? What was their status in wider Benin society?Other obstacles would have challenged any presenter, such as the fleetingly observed fact that “many of their treasures were seized in the 19th century by Europeans”. Plus, your average historian probably wouldn’t have had the Oscar-commended empathy required to conduct Nyong’o’s most moving interview. In it, the mother of her guide recounts a family story of kidnap and exposes the darkness of the Agoji trade links to European slavers. As Nyong’o concluded, looking out over the Atlantic Ocean, perhaps it isn’t quite like the movies, after all: “People are complicated … That’s why we have things like Black Panther.”",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/23/warrior-women-with-lupita-nyongo-review-a-kick-ass-tale-worthy-of-an-oscar
Chaos erupts as Republicans barge into Trump impeachment inquiry hearing,Group chanting ‘Let us in’ enter closed-door meeting where top Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy was to testify,Lauren Gambino,2019-10-23T21:37:11+0100,"Political tensions over an intensifying impeachment inquiry reached fever pitch on Wednesday as Republicans “stormed” a closed-door committee hearing on Capitol Hill disrupting a crucial deposition related to the Ukraine controversy was appearing – a day after devastating testimony from a key diplomat.A group of Republican members of the House of Representatives, chanting “Let us in”, barged into a secure office suite in the bowels of the US capitol where Laura Cooper, a top Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy, was preparing to testify.The chaos and confusion temporarily shut down the proceedings before the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry as Republicans tweeted updates of the disruption from their cellphones, which are not typically permitted in classified areas. Their presence in the chamber reportedly erupted into yelling matches with committee members.WATCH: here's the video of when 2 dozen GOP members, led by @mattgaetz entered the secure hearing room (SCIF) to interrupt witness testimony in the #ImpeachmentInquiry as they demand access, despite not being committee members. They're complaining it's a ""Soviet-style process"". pic.twitter.com/8KddYz3r9D“BREAKING: I led over 30 of my colleagues into the SCIF where Adam Schiff is holding secret impeachment depositions. Still inside – more details to come,” tweeted Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican congressman and one of Donald Trump’s closest allies on Capitol Hill, referring to secured areas of the Capitol known as Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, or SCIFs, and Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee leading the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry.The Republicans who led the protest do not sit on the committees involved in the impeachment inquiry – Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs – and are not permitted to attend. Members of those committees already include Republican members of Congress, as well as Democrats, and both parties attend and ask questions at the hearings, whether public or, as in this case, closed to the public and the press.But the members who staged protest on Wednesday have sought to attack the inquiry on procedural grounds, objecting to the private nature of the hearings and demanding access to the full breadth of the testimony that has rattled Washington in recent weeks.Much of the testimony that has been made public, however, and news reports confirm key elements of a whistleblower complaint that set in motion the impeachment inquiry. The investigation centers on reports of Donald Trump withholding military aid and dangling a meeting at the White House for Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in return for favors that would benefit him in domestic US politics.The invading Republicans remained in the hearing room into the early afternoon and even ordered pizza and fast food.“Reporting from Adam Schiff’s secret chamber,” Republican congressman Andy Biggs began, in a series of tweets from inside the room. Biggs has accused Democrats of conducting a “Soviet-style” impeachment inquiry and demanded the testimony be made available to all lawmakers.“When Republican members were in the SCIF, Chairman Schiff immediately left with the witness,” he tweeted. Biggs later clarified that he had “transmitted” to aides for publication, as the use of electronic devices in the secure area violates security protocols.More than five hours after the standoff began, committee members were recalled to the room and Cooper’s deposition began.Democrats were furious and, suggested the timing – days after Trump called on Republicans to “get tougher and fight” the impeachment inquiry amid mounting evidence of misconduct – was no coincidence.“This is a stunt that corresponded very specifically to the president’s complaint that they weren’t fighting hard enough for him, and in direct response to devastating testimony yesterday from Ambassador Taylor,” Democratic congressman David Cicilline, a member of the House foreign affairs committee, said. “Republicans are playing to an audience of one, and the president’s proud of them, but we’re going to continue to do all the work.”It was unclear if Republicans would attempt to disrupt future hearings.“Their frustration was boiling over,” said Republican congressman Lee Zeldin, also on the foreign affairs committee, one of the three panels leading the inquiry. “I would imagine things would get worse not better if the process doesn’t improve.”The dramatic escalation by Republicans on Capitol Hill came after Bill Taylor, the most senior US diplomat in Kyiv, testified for hours before House investigators on Tuesday, delivering an account that was so shocking to some lawmakers freshman Democrat Andy Levin described it as “my most disturbing day in Congress so far – very troubling”.In a lengthy opening statement, Taylor said Trump wanted “everything”, including military aid to Ukraine, tied to a commitment by Ukrainian leaders to investigate Democrats and the 2016 election plus a company linked to the family of Trump’s leading 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden.Taylor said Trump “wanted President Zelenskiy ‘in a public box’ by making a public statement about ordering such investigations”.Trump emerged briefly on Wednesday to declare victory in enforcing what he called a “permanent” ceasefire along the northern Syrian border, after his abrupt withdrawal of US troops effectively opened the door for a Turkish offensive against Kurdish-led forces in that region, leaving scores of civilians and fighters dead and hundreds of thousands of people displaced.Trump, who has denied wrongdoing in the impeachment inquiry, spent the morning on Twitter downplaying the investigation’s findings, including Taylor’s explosive testimony. He did not address the impeachment issues or take any questions after delivering his statement on Syria.Later, leaving the White House for Pittsburgh to speak at a fracking conference, Trump was unusually quiet when heading to the Marine One helicopter on the lawn.Meanwhile a report emerged noting that as early as 7 May the newly elected Zelenskiy told senior aides he was already worried about pressure from the Trump to investigate his Democratic rivals.Zelenskiy’s group of advisers spent most of a three-hour meeting talking about how to navigate the insistence from Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, for such an investigation, and how to avoid becoming entangled in the American elections, according to three people familiar with the details of the meeting.Among the many defenses the White House has offered is that Ukraine had not been aware that Trump was withholding military aid that Congress approved unless it launched two investigations.The Associated Press contributed to this report",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/chaos-erupts-as-republicans-barge-into-trump-impeachment-inquiry-hearing
Happy-go-lucky: Ribble Valley officially named UK's happiest place,Residents and business owners of rural Lancashire district unsurprised by ONS findings,Richard Partington,2019-10-23T20:08:28+0100,"Ask the residents of the Ribble Valley whether they would swap their rural lives for a busy city one, and the answer is straightforward: “Definitely not. The thought of it horrifies me,” said Jonathan Gledhill, the landlord of the Red Pump Inn, a village dining pub in this quiet part of mid-Lancashire.Just north of the former mill towns of south Lancashire, this green and pleasant part of the north-west – which includes the vast and unspoilt Forest of Bowland – is officially the happiest place in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. On a scale of 0 to 10, Ribble Valley residents scored an average of 8.30 when asked by government surveyors about how happy they felt. This compared with an average of 7.56 for the country at large.“It’s not surprising. People here derive a great pleasure from living their lives, as opposed to gathering material possessions. They might have bit of money and a nice house, but they’re not on a city centre treadmill,” said Gledhill, who moved to the tiny parish of Bashall Eaves five years ago with his wife, Fran, to run the Red Pump.The quiet lanes of the Ribble Valley – with the old market town of Clitheroe at its heart - may seem far from city stresses, but here a rural life for city workers is within easy reach. Manchester is only a short train ride away, while the west coast mainline and motorway networks snake around the Trough of Bowland to bring in piles of visitors, supporting an economy shifting away from agriculture to tourism.Once best known for its small Norman castle and countryside surrounds, Clitheroe and the Ribble Valley has developed a reputation as a gastronomic hotspot in recent years, with a cluster of award-winning inns. It attracts clientele from across the north and further afield, and won welcome exposure when Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon visited the Inn at Whitewell for their TV series The Trip.“People don’t realise how accessible it is,” said Steven Smith, the chef-proprietor of the award-winning Freemasons at Wiswell, who frequently visits London on business via a two-hour train ride from Preston.“My customers work in Manchester, London and so forth. Here you can get that little step out and that ‘breathe’ factor. Its beautiful, but not a million miles from anywhere,” he said.The former head of the Professional Footballers Association Gordon Taylor, who plied his trade as a winger at nearby Bolton Wanderers, lives in the quiet village. Smith said executives from firms across the north-west called the area home – including those from BAE Systems, one of the biggest employers in the county, with several factories near Preston.Earnings are above average, and people are more likely to be homeowners. Ribble Valley has among the top rates of owner occupation in Lancashire, ranking well ahead of towns such as Blackburn, Burnley and Preston.Young people, however, can find it hard to get on the housing ladder, while cuts to the public bus services have made life harder for those without transport. Residents number about 60,000, and are widely dispersed and rapidly ageing. About a quarter of the population are over 65, above the national average of about 18%, in an area popular with retirees from across the country.But Rachel McQueen, chief executive of Marketing Lancashire, said: “It’s a place where families enjoy a great work-life balance, an active outdoor life in commutable distance to work, good schools and some of the country’s finest universities, so we’re not surprised that residents of Lancashire’s Ribble Valley are amongst the happiest in the UK.”Against a backdrop of immense political stress and uncertainty, Britain as a whole has got steadily happier in the six years since the government’s statisticians began to assess the wellbeing of the nation, but the north-west has recorded the largest improvement.The surveys show that money and power aren’t everything. London boroughs, such as Islington and Camden, are on paper among the most prosperous places in the country, with wages well above average. But their residents are consistently less happy than the national average.Allan Knox, leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on the Tory-controlled Ribble Valley borough council, said: “We are a fairly prosperous borough, there’s no doubt about that. That prosperity can bring the ability to ride out some of the economic challenges that might be a bit more detrimental to other areas.”But he said he would have given a gloomier answer than most of his neighbours if the ONS surveyors had questioned him yesterday.

European leaders expected to grant Brexit delay,Donald Tusk tells Boris Johnson he has recommended that the EU27 accept request for extension,Daniel Boffey,2019-10-23T19:42:41+0100,"Boris Johnson will be left waiting for the EU’s terms for a further Brexit extension until Friday, with signs of momentum building behind Donald Tusk’s plan for a delay up to 31 January.The French government has privately voiced its concerns about taking the pressure off MPs to vote for the deal, which they believe could be ratified in 15 days, but EU sources said the bloc was seeking a “solution that works for all” and avoids a no deal exit. Tusk, the president of the European council, told Johnson in a phone call on Wednesday his reasons for “recommending the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension”.The debate among the EU27 is whether to follow Tusk’s lead and offer a three-month delay that could be terminated following ratification of the deal, or seek to put pressure on MPs with a shorter extension, an idea raised by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron.Tusk has suggested leaders can avoid convening for a summit if they agree to the three months sought in the prime minister’s letter of request through a “written procedure”.After a 90-minute meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday evening, there appeared to be momentum behind Tusk’s strategy. “All agreed on the need for an extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit”, an EU source said. “The duration of an extension is still being discussed. There was a strong preference to use a written procedure to take the final decision.”One EU diplomat said: “It felt like we were all going in one direction – towards a flextension to 31 January – but nothing is decided. It needs to work for everyone.”The French ambassador is understood to have insisted that the EU avoid getting dragged in “domestic politics” in Britain, and questioned whether that would be a consequence of a longer extension. “If we give it, are we making an election happen?” said a source.Johnson has threatened to push for a general election if the EU agrees to the delay of up to three months that he was instructed to seek on Saturday under the Benn act.France’s ambassador had told the EU27 that any delay needed “to be associated with a justification”. “It needs to be proportionate,” he told the room. He added that there was no “automaticity” between the request tabled and the EU agreeing to it.Macron has consistently been one the hawks among the EU27 who is wary of giving MPs more time for prevarication. He believes he was right in April when he pushed for a shorter, one-off delay to focus minds in the British parliament on the need to ratify the deal.But the EU source said none of the ambassadors had spoken stridently against a delay to 31 January. “We need a mechanism to link the length of the delay with a justification. No one spoke about a 15-day extension, as we have heard before from France. It was all very reasonable.”A source said: “A large number were perfectly happy with the Tusk proposal, others needed some time to reflect. Germany is among those but has been clear that it is fine with the plan.”Monday has been pencilled in as a summit day if the leaders cannot agree and feel the need to debate the issue in person. “But no one wants that,” a diplomatic source said.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Brussels was seeking “clarification” from London.If Johnson is able to agree with Jeremy Corbyn on a new timetable for passing the withdrawal agreement bill, and makes a public request, a delay to 1 December could still be on offer.The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and the European parliament’s president, David Sassoli, backed Tusk on Wednesday.Varadkar told reporters: “There is no extension agreed. The European Union has not agreed an extension for the UK as yet. President Tusk is currently in the process of consulting the 27 heads of state and government. We spoke this morning. He is recommending that we accept an extension until January 31 that could be terminated early if the House of Commons and House of Lords ratifies an agreement.“I agreed to that but that’s not yet agreed by the 27 and we may have to have an emergency European council over the course of the next few days to discuss it if he can’t get consensus. My bags are always packed for Brussels and packed they are again.”Sassoli pointed out there was only one request “on the table” and he said it deserved the EU27’s support.He said: “I think it is advisable, as requested by Donald Tusk, that the European council should accept this extension. This extension will allow the United Kingdom to clarify its position and the European parliament to exercise its role.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/brexit-european-leaders-back-call-for-delay-end-january-extension
Californians face second round of power shutoffs in two weeks,Pacific Gas & Electric says the latest shutoffs will affect nearly half a million people across the state,,2019-10-23T19:39:46+0100,"California’s largest utility has begun widespread blackouts affecting nearly half a million people as dangerous fire weather returned to the state.The Pacific Gas & Electric Company said on Wednesday the shutoffs would begin around 2pm in the Sierra foothills, followed soon after by blackouts north of the San Francisco Bay Area. In all, the power will be cut to portions of 17 counties. The outages will last about 48 hours, the utility said.The Santa Rosa fire department tweeted that shutoffs had started in the city and it was getting multiple reports of outages.Meanwhile, Southern California Edison said it could cut power on Thursday to more than 308,000 customers in seven counties and San Diego Gas & Electric is warning of power shutoffs to about 24,000 customers.The utilities said they were concerned that winds forecast to top 60mph (97km/h) could throw branches and debris into power lines or topple them, sparking wildfires.PG&E cut power to more than 2 million people across California in rolling blackouts earlier this month, the largest deliberate blackout to prevent wildfires in state history. The shutoffs caused schools to close and many businesses to shutter. Residents complained PG&E communicated late and ineffectively, even failing to keep its website running smoothly during the outages.The utility – the largest in the United States - declared bankruptcy in January, in part because of potential liabilities from its role in some of the 2017 northern California fires and the 2018 Camp fire.Experts and authorities are warning that shutoffs may be the new normal in the state amid a deepening climate crisis. “There were bad fires in the 20th century, but more or less, there was a power system that worked,” Michael Wara, the director of the Climate and Energy Policy program at Stanford University, told the Guardian last month. “I think what’s different is the weather extremes are much more extreme and that’s a predictable effect of climate change.”“I think it’s not panic per se, just, ‘Eh, we gotta do this again?’” said Kim Schefer, the manager of Village True Value Hardware in Santa Rosa.Schefer directed customers to gas cans and batteries as they prepared for what many see as a costly, frustrating new routine.The California governor, Gavin Newsom, sent a sharply worded letter on Tuesday to Bill Johnson, PG&E CEO, blaming the unprecedented mass outage earlier this month on the company’s failure to maintain and upgrade its equipment. State rules leave utilities to control when they will shut down the power, and how they will choose to do it.PG&E says the shutdowns are not about money.The only goal “is to prevent a catastrophic wildfire”, Johnson said in a Tuesday briefing.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/pge-power-shutoffs-red-flag-california
The Guardian view on the Trump impeachment inquiry: he isn’t the only one lowering standards,Editorial: Testimony on the US president’s dealings with Ukraine reminds us that his enablers are just as culpable for the diminishment of the highest office in the land,Editorial,2019-10-23T18:30:39+0100,"Republicans push the bar ever lower. This president still cannot clear it. Even a month ago, Democrats were at pains to stress that a request for foreign interference in domestic politics was impeachable in and of itself, whether or not Donald Trump had offered a quid pro quo to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. There was a principled reason for this. Mr Trump and his supporters should not be allowed to present the manipulation of US diplomacy for private interests as normal practice. A country like Ukraine is hardly in a position to antagonise the American president; no explicit threat or inducement need be added to the scales. But in any case, the bargaining simply makes a terrible act much worse.Of course, the Democrats had a pragmatic reason for drawing the line: the knowledge that it might be hard to prove the attempted trading of interests. This is why Tuesday’s testimony to impeachment inquiry hearings by Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Kyiv, drew gasps. It is not a surprise to anyone that the president should pursue such a course. But Mr Taylor, a veteran diplomat, laid out clearly, precisely and damningly how Mr Trump sought to make a summit meeting and military aid to Ukraine conditional on its government launching two investigations: one into his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and another into the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine (not Russia) that interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Hillary Clinton (rather than Mr Trump).The ambassador’s evidence, building on testimony from the former top Russia adviser Fiona Hill, and his ousted predecessor Marie Yovanovitch, laid out the way this administration created a foreign policy back channel for this purpose, undermining its conventional diplomacy. It was run by the president through his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and figures including the ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, a donor to Trump’s inauguration with no former diplomatic experience.Mr Taylor says Mr Sondland told him there was no quid pro quo – before spelling out an arrangement that is the very definition of a quid pro quo. Last week the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney agreed that there was, but that it only related to 2016 – so “get over it”. (He subsequently walked back his remarks.) The White House continues to insist that there was no quid pro quo. To claim that no quid pro quo existed is like the rest of us claiming that Mr Trump is not the president. Life would be better if it were true, but wishful thinking does not make inconvenient facts disappear.The past cannot be undone, and things can be improved only if there is the will to do so. The Democrats’ will was galvanised when they launched impeachment proceedings. Republicans are still floundering. Most managed to criticise Mr Trump’s claim that he was facing a “lynching”, a deliberately offensive and ridiculous attempt to distract from Mr Taylor’s evidence and to rally his base with racialised imagery. But they continue to balk at taking him on for fear that they will be politically punished. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, refused to back Mr Trump’s claims that he had described the president’s call with Mr Zelenskiy as “innocent”.That is as far as he has gone. Like his colleagues, he seeks to avoid the taint of Mr Trump without actually cutting him loose. They have no will to protect the standards of office – just the hope that all this will go away if they keep lowering very basic expectations for the highest office in the land.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-trump-impeachment-inquiry-he-isnt-the-only-one-lowering-standards
"Trump, the whistleblower and the comic: key players in the Ukraine scandal",Trump’s request that Ukraine help find dirt on Joe Biden has led to an impeachment inquiry – and drawn in multiple people ,Adam Gabbatt,2019-10-23T18:29:33+0100,"Democrats announced an official impeachment inquiry into Trump on 24 September following a whistleblower’s complaint about Trump’s interactions with the president of Ukraine. A White House summary of a 25 July call shows Trump pressed Volodymyr Zelenskiy to work with the US attorney general and Rudy Giuliani, to investigate his political rival Joe Biden in the run-up the 2020 US election. Trump told Zelenskiy to look into unfounded and debunked allegations that Biden helped remove a Ukrainian prosecutor who had investigated a company tied to his son Hunter.Ukraine’s new president was a wildcard candidate who had no experience of politics save for playing the president in a television comedy. In a remarkable plot twist, he’s now been thrust into the centre of an American political scandal. “I don’t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,” Zelenskiy said in September, visibly embarrassed after the release of the summary. “We had a good phone call. It was normal. You read it. Nobody pushed me.”Currently a strong candidate in the 2020 race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Biden was the vice-president in 2016, when the Obama administration pressured Ukraine to remove Viktor Shokin, the country’s top prosecutor; the US and other western countries said Shokin was corrupt. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden. “This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a national security issue,” Biden said.Joe Biden’s second son served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas producer, from 2014 to 2019. Burisma had been investigated by Shokin for alleged corruption, but the investigation had been dropped by the time the US government urged Ukraine to fire Shokin.The former Ukrainian prosecutor general was widely seen as having blocked the prosecutions of corrupt oligarchs. Reform-minded Ukrainian politicians and international partners pressured the Ukrainian government to remove him for some time, and he was finally dismissed in 2016. He was later reinvented as a kind of heroic victim by Giuliani, who claimed – without evidence – that Shokin was fired on Biden’s orders.The former mayor of New York is Trump’s personal attorney, most strident TV defender and, it seems, occasional diplomat. The rough transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call shows Trump telling the Ukraine president to work with Giuliani in investigating Joe Biden. According to the whistleblower’s complaint, US officials were concerned about Giuliani’s role in communications with Kyiv.The attorney general is named by Trump in the call with Zelenskiy, the president saying Zelenskiy should work with Barr – and Giuliani – to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. The Department of Justice, which Barr oversees, said Trump had not asked Barr to work with Ukraine. The DoJ examined the Trump-Zelenskiy call but decided not to open an investigation – a decision which has been criticized by legal analysts.Little is known about the identity of the person who ignited the firestorm engulfing Trump. Testifying on Thursday before Congress, the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, said he did not know who the whistleblower was; Trump has said the same. The whistleblower has retained a lawyer and is said to be willing to testify before Congress. The New York Times reported the whistleblower is a CIA officer.The former US special envoy to Ukraine, Volker resigned from the state department and met with congressional investigators, turning over records of WhatsApp chats in which he and other US diplomats worked to arrange a deal between Zelenskiy and Trump in which Trump would invite Zelenskiy to the White House and Zelenskiy would make a public statement that Ukraine had opened investigations of Burisma and election tampering. “I think Potus really wants the deliverable,” Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, said on the chats.A wealthy hotelier, Trump mega-donor and now US ambassador to the European Union. In the chats turned over by Volker, Sondland, whose usual portfolio does not include Ukraine, pushed Volker and a third diplomat, Bill Taylor, to get what Trump wants from Zelenskiy. When Taylor chatted, “Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?” Sondland replied: “Call me.” Sondland agreed to testify before Congress but superiors at the state department blocked his testimony. “Ambassador Sondland is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today,” his lawyer said. “He stands ready to testify on short notice, whenever he is permitted to appear.”A public servant for 50 years, the former military officer was appointed ambassador to Ukraine by George W Bush and asked by Trump to take charge of the embassy in Kyiv. Taylor delivered testimony in October seen as devastating. He described how diplomats and Giuliani pursued Trump’s demand that Zelenskiy go on CNN and announce of investigation of Biden. Taylor said Sondland told him that both military aid and a White House visit – “everything” – hinged on Zelenskiy’s willingness to announce the investigation. In the chats, Taylor repeatedly expressed alarm about the deal Sondland was trying to put together. “As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” Taylor wrote.The acting director of national intelligence only took on the role on 16 August. Maguire has been criticized for not sharing the whistleblower’s complaint with Congress – as is normal procedure. The acting director said he thought issues raised in the complaint might be covered by executive privilege, and he said he consulted with officials at the justice department and White House lawyers over whether to pass the complaint to Congress. The White House eventually published the complaint.After receiving the complaint, Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, recommended it be shared with Congress. This put Atkinson at odds with his superior, Maguire, who blocked it from being shared. While the complaint was being withheld, Atkinson alerted lawmakers to its existence, saying it raised issues of “urgent concern”.The speaker of the House, and the most powerful woman in Congress, Pelosi decided to initiate an impeachment inquiry after the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy call was published on Wednesday. In doing so, Pelosi succumbed to long-mounting pressure from Democratic members of Congress, some of whom had been pushing for an impeachment inquiry to begin for more than a year.A veteran on the political scene, Lutsenko replaced Shokin as Ukraine’s prosecutor general but was also viewed with suspicion by reformers. Lutsenko met Giuliani and appears to have been amenable to opening an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election on behalf of the Democrats. Ukrainian officials have denied any effort to help Hillary Clinton in the election.Yovanovitch was the US ambassador to Ukraine for almost three years before being unexpectedly recalled by Trump in May this year. Trump criticized Yovanovitch in his call with Zelenskiy, describing her as “bad news”. In March, Yovanovitch called on Ukraine to do more to address corruption. Then Lutsenko accused Yovanovitch of giving Ukraine “a list of people whom we should not prosecute”. Lutsenko has since said Yovanovitch did not give him such a list.One of the new brand of politicians who entered the scene after Ukraine’s Maidan revolution, Leshchenko was a leading political journalist who wrote widely on corruption and became an MP. In May 2016, he published information from a so-called “black ledger” that showed under-the-table payments from the pro-Russian former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych’s regime to various figures including Trump’s former 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort. This led to Manafort’s resignation from the campaign. Leshchenko later became an adviser to Zelenskiy and has said that before this week, it was “a clear fact that Trump wants to meet [Ukrainian officials] only if Biden case will be included”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/trump-ukraine-scandal-zelenskiy-biden-hunter

Despite countless publications and studies related to the 2008 financial crisis and its effect on the whole economic system, politicians, central banks and economic institutions seem to keep using the same logic that they used 10 years ago.The decrease in interest rates caused by central banks’ policies provoked the boom of private debt held by companies. Together with the constant diminution of companies’ abilities to repay their debts, this presents a clear underlying problem and a terrible outlook of a new global economic crisis. By favouring short-term decisions and policies in order to maintain growth at an acceptable rate as the recent IMF report proves, central banks keep committing the same errors. Will the world economic system be able to avoid another crisis if we continue to accumulate more and more risk factors?Milan Bollecker Paris, France• Larry Elliott, in his analysis (A King’s sad lament shows the lessons of 2008 were not learned, 21 October), gives a frightening picture of the confused economic thinking coming from the IMF’s annual meeting, and this does not include the ideas of its own Global Housing Watch “that there is abundant evidence that housing cycles can be a threat to financial and macroeconomic stability” so that that “the era of benign neglect of house price booms is over”.As a long-time adherent of Henry George, via the Labour Land Campaign, I wonder how the neglect of house prices can ever be benign, since it ends up with people priced out of housing by high rents and mortgages, so using up the spending power provided to workers by capitalists to buy their products and services.David ReedNorthampton• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Syrian regime inflicts 72 forms of torture on prisoners, report finds","More than 14,000 people thought to have been tortured to death by regime during war",Michael Safi,2019-10-23T18:10:53+0100,"The Syrian regime inflicts at least 72 kinds of torture on prisoners in its detention facilities, according a report that estimates the methods that have resulted in the deaths of at least 185 people this year and more than 14,000 over the course of the civil war.The forms of torture documented in the report range from scalding with boiling hot water and slicing off body parts to rape and other sexual violence, and medical neglect including allowing junior doctors to use prisoners for surgical training.Another practice involves leaving detainees who are slipping into delirium in cells with healthier captives. Several torture survivors told the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), which produced the report, that sharing a cell with such prisoners – who would often be hallucinating or crying hysterically – was “worse than the physical torture inflicted on them by the Syrian regime”.The organisation established the torture methods from interviews with survivors and witnesses and estimated the death toll partly by examining more than 6,000 pictures of murdered Syrians exposed by a former regime photographer known by the alias “Caesar”.It noted that Caesar’s photos, which were smuggled from Syria on thumb drives hidden in his shoes, and the interviews gave only a glimpse of the true number of torture methods employed by the regime, which it said, like the death toll, was “likely to be far higher”.One witness account claimed prison officers used the back of a grenade to smash the teeth of a detained 15-year-old boy. “One one occasion they sprayed insecticide all over [the boy’s] body, set him on fire then wrapped his body with gauze, and from time to time they peeled the gauze [and] lifted his skin with a blade,” says the witness, himself a torture survivor.The Syrian government has consistently denied allegations that it systematically tortures prisoners. The regime ratified the international convention against torture in 2004 as part of a wave of purported liberalisation enacted by the president, Bashar al-Assad, in the early years of his tenure.The SNHR also documented 57 deaths from torture at the hands of extremist Islamist groups, 43 caused by the armed opposition to the Assad regime and 47 by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.It said 14,131 people had been tortured to death so far by the government. “No month in all the years since 2011 has passed without us documenting dozens of deaths due to torture in the Syrian regime’s centres, which is still continuing to the current date,” it said.About 1.2 million Syrians, or one in 18 of the population, are estimated to have been arrested or detained at some point in the country’s nearly nine-year-old civil war. At least 127,000 people are presumed to either be dead or still in custody, according to an SNHR database.The existence of Caesar’s cache of more than 55,000 photographs was revealed by the Guardian in January 2014. The former military police photographer documented the killings of about 11,000 detainees before he defected and fled the country.His images, taken between March 2011 and August 2013, shocked the world and are regarded as crucial possible evidence for any future war crimes proceedings against Assad regime officials.Groups including the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), a US- and EU-funded NGO, have been working for years to collect and store evidence that may be used in future international court proceedings against Syrian officials.Last year international arrest warrants were issued for Ali Mamlouk, a former national security head, and Jamil Hassan, a former leader of the Air Force Intelligence Directorate.German police arrested two former Syrian secret service officers in February on suspicion of involvement in torture and crimes against humanity, the first time western criminal prosecutors have arrested alleged torturers working for Assad.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/syrian-regime-inflicts-72-forms-of-torture-on-prisoners-report-finds
Donald Trump declares Syria ceasefire permanent and lifts Turkey sanctions,US special envoy reports Turkish ‘war crimes’ to Congress as Trump says: ‘Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand’,Bethan McKernan,2019-10-23T17:49:09+0100,"Donald Trump has announced that the US will lift sanctions on Turkey, taking credit for a ceasefire deal that should end Ankara’s attack on Kurdish-led forces – at the price of ending the Kurds’ dream of local autonomy.The US president, who has come under withering criticism for abruptly withdrawing US troops – and paving the way for a deadly Turkish offensive against the Kurds – said on Wednesday that a “small number” of US troops would remain in Syria’s oilfields.In a televised address on Wednesday, Trump emphasized that US troops were “safe” and said America would leave other powers to fight each other in the region.He added: “Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand.Wednesday’s announcement came as Russian troops expanded their presence across north-eastern Syria, the result of an agreement between Ankara and Moscow.Just a week ago, Trump announced a series of financial punishments on Ankara – including the reimposition of 50% tariffs on Turkish steel – after Turkey launched its attack on Kurdish-led forces in north-eastern Syria.That offensive began hours after a phone call between Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in which the Turkish president, informed Trump of his plans, and understood the US president to give a green light.“The government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria, and making the ceasefire permanent,” Trump said.“I have, therefore, instructed the secretary of the Treasury to lift all sanctions imposed October 14,” he added.“How many Americans must die in the Middle East in the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts?” Trump said. “I am committed to pursuing a different course, one that leads to victory for America.”Until Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish. Since the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.On 17 October Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara’s operation for  five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdoğan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish “safe zone” in Syria.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province. In late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s recent announcement that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.Michael SafiSome troops would remain in Syria’s oilfields, Trump said. “We have secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil.”As Trump was speaking, his special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, told the US Congress that American forces had seen “several incidents of what we consider war crimes” by Turkish forces, during the recent attack on the Kurds.Jeffrey also said that “over 100” Islamic State prisoners had escaped during the Turkish offensive and “we do not know where they are.”Earlier on Wednesday, Syrian and Russian media showed footage of Russian military police vehicles on the outskirts of the important towns of Manbij and Kobani, one day after Erdoğan, met Vladimir Putin in Sochi.A statement carried on Russia’s Interfax agency said Russian patrols had already begun inside Manbij, a town that until two weeks ago was a key US base in the region.The deal was hailed as a “big success” by Trump, although his critics say it cements Russia’s role as prime powerbroker in the Middle East.In an earlier tweet, the US president claimed the Kurds were safe and Isis prisoners secured.Big success on the Turkey/Syria Border. Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured. I will be making a statement at 11:00 A.M. from the White House. Thank you!Turkish troops, allied Syrian rebel proxies, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and soldiers belonging to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, are now all present in the border zone, with Russia the only negotiating force between them.The talks on Tuesday between Erdoğan and the Russian president defined the contours of Turkey’s long-proposed border “safe zone”: Turkish troops in the area seized since the offensive began on 9 October will remain in situ, and Russian soldiers and the Syrian army will control the rest of the frontier.Moscow and Damascus will supervise the removal of Kurdish fighters and weaponry to the depth of 18 miles (29km) from their current positions on the border before 26 October, after which joint Russian-Turkish patrols will begin across the entire border area to a depth of six miles, with the exception of the de facto Kurdish capital, Qamishli.On Wednesday, the Russian ministry of defence published a map showing 15 planned border observation posts that will be manned by the Syrian regime.The deal in effect redraws the map of northern Syria and ends five years of semi-autonomy carved out by the local Kurdish administration and its military forces, after Kurdish officials reached an agreement with Assad, their former enemy, for military reinforcements to fend off the Turkish attack.However, the fate of local military councils set up by the SDF in border towns previously under their control and what happens to the SDF’s non-Kurdish units remains unclear. The SDF and Kurdish politicians are yet to comment on the Sochi deal.It is believed they will retain control of the approximately 90,000 men, women and children with links to Islamic State being held in Kurdish-run prisons and detention camps.Turkish officials including Erdoğan threatened on Wednesday that Ankara would resume the offensive if neither Russia nor the US guaranteed the total withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the border region.Ankara says the YPG is indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades.

Russia steps up its presence in north-east Syria after Turkey deal,More Russian troops arrive in border region as Donald Trump hails situation as a ‘big success’,Bethan McKernan,2019-10-23T17:46:58+0100,"Russian troops have expanded their presence across north-eastern Syria, the result of an agreement between Ankara and Moscow that should end Turkey’s attack on Kurdish-led forces at the price of ending the Kurds’ dreams of local autonomy.Syrian and Russian media showed footage of Russian military police vehicles on the outskirts of the important towns of Manbij and Kobani on Wednesday, one day after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, met Vladimir Putin in Sochi.A statement carried on Russia’s Interfax agency said Russian patrols had already begun inside Manbij, a town that until two weeks ago was a key US base in the region.The deal was hailed as a “big success” by Donald Trump, although his critics say it cements Russia’s role as prime power broker in the Middle East after the US president’s announcement that American special forces would withdraw from the area.Until Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish. Since the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.On 17 October Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara’s operation for  five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdoğan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish “safe zone” in Syria.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province. In late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s recent announcement that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.Michael SafiThe US president was planning to make a fresh statement on the issue on Wednesday morning. In an earlier tweet he claimed the Kurds were safe and Isis prisoners secured.Big success on the Turkey/Syria Border. Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured. I will be making a statement at 11:00 A.M. from the White House.

Boeing profits fall by more than half as 737 Max scandal swirls,"Aircraft company, which saw 737 Max grounded after fatal crashes, says it will also cut production of 787 Dreamliner jet",Edward Helmore,2019-10-23T17:39:26+0100,"Boeing’s profits more than halved in the last three months as the company struggled to recover from two fatal crashes of its top-selling 737 Max aircraft and current trade disputes took their toll.The company, which still expects the troubled 737 Max jet to return to service by the end of the year, also said it plans to cut production of its wide-bodied 787 Dreamliner, a move that reflects the effect of global trade tensions.The company said slowed production of the Max will cost an additional $900m on top of $2.7bn loss of income already anticipated. Overall revenue for the quarter dropped 20% – less than investors feared. Boeing shares, which have dropped 20% since the Max was grounded in March, rose 3%.The drop in profits comes as Boeing announced that Kevin McAllister, head of its commercial jetliner division, is leaving the company after just three years at the job.McAllister’s exit comes less than two weeks after chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is scheduled to testify before Congress next week, was stripped of the company’s chairmanship.Muilenburg’s demotion followed a further hit to Boeing’s reputation for safety last week when published messages between two test pilots showed that Boeing knew about problems with the 737 Max’s MCAS anti-stall system three years before the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killing 189 and 157 respectively.The exchanges contradict Boeing’s previous position that it had no idea the system was unsafe. In the messages from 2016, simulator pilot Mark Forkner complained MCAS was acting unpredictably. “It’s running rampant,” he said.Separately, aviation authorities in Indonesia have briefed family members on their findings about the crash of Lion Air flight 610 before the release of the final accident report on Friday.Investigators from the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee in Jakarta said systemic design flaws in the 737 Max were compounded by errors by the plane’s pilots, who had not been sufficiently instructed on how to handle MCAS malfunctions.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/boeing-profits-737-max-mcas-scandal
Amazon rainforest 'close to irreversible tipping point',Forecast suggests rainforest could stop producing enough rain to sustain itself by 2021,Dom Phillips,2019-10-23T17:13:18+0100,"Soaring deforestation coupled with the destructive policies of Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, could push the Amazon rainforest dangerously to an irreversible “tipping point” within two years, a prominent economist has said.After this point the rainforest would stop producing enough rain to sustain itself and start slowly degrading into a drier savannah, releasing billions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, which would exacerbate global heating and disrupt weather across South America.The warning came in a policy brief published this week by Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington DC.The report sparked controversy among climate scientists. Some believe the tipping point is still 15 to 20 years away, while others say the warning accurately reflects the danger that Bolsonaro and global heating pose to the Amazon’s survival.“It’s a stock, so like any stock you run it down, run it down – then suddenly you don’t have any more of it,” said de Bolle, whose brief also recommended solutions to the current crisis.Bolsonaro has vowed to develop the Amazon, and his government plans to allow mining on protected indigenous reserves. Amazon farmers support his attacks on environmental protection agencies. His business-friendly environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has met loggers and wildcat miners, while deforestation and Amazon fires have soared since he assumed office in January.The policy brief noted that Brazil’s space research institute, INPE, reported that deforestation in August was 222% higher than in August 2018. Maintaining the current rate of increase INPE reported between January and August this year would bring the Amazon “dangerously close to the estimated tipping point as soon as 2021 … beyond which the rainforest can no longer generate enough rain to sustain itself”, de Bolle wrote.De Bolle is also head of the Latin American studies programme at Johns Hopkins University and last month addressed a US Congress committee on preserving the Amazon. She called her prediction a “provocation”.“If Bolsonaro is serious about developing the Amazon without paying any attention to sustainability or maintaining the forest’s standing, these rates would happen within his mandate,” she said.Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil’s leading climate scientists and a senior researcher at the University of São Paulo’s Institute for Advanced Studies, questioned her calculation that estimated deforestation would quadruple from an estimate of nearly 18,000 km2 this year to nearly 70,000 km2 by 2021.“It seems very improbable to me – the projected deforestation increase is more an economic calculation than ecological,” he said. However, he added: “We are seeing an increase in deforestation, I am not questioning this.”Last year, Nobre argued in an article written with celebrated American conservation biologist Thomas Lovejoy that the Amazon tipping point could happen in eastern, southern and central Amazonia when 20% to 25% of the rainforest has been felled – not expected for 20 to 25 years. He has since brought forward his prediction by about five years.“The Amazon is already 17% deforested, so when you calculate at the current rate of deforestation, this 20% to 25% is reached in 15 to 20 years,” he said. “I hope she is wrong. If she is right, it is the end of the world.”But Lovejoy, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said that de Bolle’s projection could come true because global heating, soaring deforestation and an increase in Amazon fires have created a “negative synergy” that is accelerating its destruction – citing droughts in recent years as a warning sign.“We are seeing the first flickering of that tipping,” he said. “It’s sort of like a seal trying to balance a rubber ball on its nose … the only sensible thing to do is to do some reforestation and build back that margin of safety.”Among other commitments under the Paris climate deal, signed by leftist former president Dilma Rousseff, Brazil agreed to reforest 12m hectares and end illegal deforestation by 2030.Mongabay reported last month that Brazil looks increasingly unlikely to meet its Paris targets. Deforestation began rising under Rousseff in 2013 after nine years of decline and has accelerated under Bolsonaro.Claudio Angelo of the Climate Observatory – an umbrella of non-profit environmental groups – said he thought de Bolle’s calculations were too pessimistic, but praised her brief’s other recommendations.These included expanding the Amazon fund, which finances sustainable rainforest projects to include the United States and other countries so that Brazil is not expected to fund rainforest protection virtually on its own. The Amazon Fund is currently financed by Norway and Germany, but both countries suspended payments in August.De Bolle said Brazil should revive a resolution that made rural credit financed by public banks dependent on lenders proving that they complied with environmental and other laws. “That’s a big stick,” she said.Angelo said “the points [de Bolle] made are quite real”. “For all the madness, Bolsonaro did manage to make people talk about the Amazon,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/23/amazon-rainforest-close-to-irreversible-tipping-point
Relief for Windrush sisters as removal threat overturned,"Bumi Thomas, whose sister got citizenship, wins appeal against removal from UK",Diane Taylor,2019-10-23T17:09:36+0100,"Two Windrush sisters who describe themselves as inseparable are celebrating after a judge ruled that one of them should not be sent back to Nigeria.Bumi Thomas, 36, was at risk of removal from the UK and at one point was given 14 days to leave, while her sister Kemi, 38, was not because of their different dates of birth.Bumi took her case to an immigration tribunal hearing last week, and a judge ruled on Wednesday that her removal was not in the public interest.“I am of the view that the appellant’s life is in this country where she has made a valuable contribution,” the judge said.Bumi shares a flat with Kemi in south-east London and is a prominent singer on the UK jazz scene.Kemi was born in December 1981 and qualified for British citizenship as a child born in the UK to parents from a former British colony. Bumi was born in June 1983, just a few months after the introduction of the British Nationality Act. This stipulated that a person born in the UK on or after 1 January of that year became a British citizen automatically only if one of their parents was settled, held indefinite leave to remain or right of abode or was British at the time of their birth.The family’s roots are in Nigeria. The sisters’ grandfather arrived in the UK from Nigeria in the 1950s to work and study. Their parents, Lizzy and Segun Thomas, settled in Glasgow in 1974 and Kemi and Bumi were born there.Lizzy and Segun set up the first black hairdressing salon in the area, called Hairlinks. It became a social and cultural hub for Commonwealth citizens. Kemi and Bumi’s parents moved back to Nigeria with their children when Bumi was three. Bumi returned to the UK when she was 18.It was not until 2009, when Bumi wanted to travel abroad for a holiday and could not get a British passport, that she realised there was a problem. After various battles with the Home Office, she was granted two periods of discretionary leave to remain.Last November she applied for settlement in the UK. She had had a British partner but her relationship with him ended. The Home Office rejected her application in June and told her she no longer had the right to remain in the UK as she no longer has a British partner.Bumi’s appeal hearing last week was told that she had left her British partner because he was abusive towards her. Had she remained in that relationship, she may have been granted the right to remain in the UK.During the hearing Bumi, told the judge: “This is my life, this is my home, this is my country.”Kemi said: “Bumi is my biggest source of happiness and joy. I can’t imagine what it would be like to have a life where she’s not in it.”Bumi said on Wednesday: “Kemi and I are both so happy about this decision. I’m laughing then crying then laughing again. Now I can begin to plan my future.”Bumi’s solicitor, Jamie Bell, from Duncan Lewis solicitors, said: “We are so happy that Bumi’s exceptional life and contribution to the United Kingdom has been acknowledged in the appeal determination. As the judge acknowledged, Bumi’s music has impacted and inspired a large section of the community and we are delighted that she will be able to continue her work in peace.”Steve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrant rights programme director at Amnesty International, said: “One matter emphasised by Bumi Thomas’s case is how crucially important it is to promote better understanding of British nationality law. Many people still do not know that merely being born in the UK does not in itself make someone a British citizen, and many children grow up in this country without its citizenship – even when the law makes clear they are entitled to register as British.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/23/relief-for-windrush-sisters-as-removal-threat-overturned
Will loyalists turn against Trump after Bill Taylor’s game-changing testimony?,Diplomat added significant ballast to the allegation Trump was trying to extort Ukraine into ginning up bad news about Biden,Tom McCarthy,2019-10-23T16:46:51+0100,"The impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump has heard some extraordinary testimony over the last month. From the first mention of Trump’s desired “deliverable” from Ukraine, successive layers of witnesses and documents have added to an indictment of the president’s conduct that only gets heavier, as Trump howls his defenses to the wind.On Tuesday, things got even worse for Trump – much worse, as many saw it.For almost 10 hours, William Taylor, a former military officer and career diplomat with the rank of ambassador under the last four presidents, spoke with congressional investigators about how the Trump administration has been conducting a two-track foreign policy in Ukraine, where Taylor is in charge of the US embassy.We don’t yet know most of what was said. The current public record of the closed-door testimony comprises only a copy of Taylor’s 15-page opening statement – and the spectacle of the ashen faces of members of Congress as they filed out from the hearing.“This testimony is a sea change,” congressman Stephen Lynch told reporters.In his testimony, Taylor explained his discovery of an “irregular, informal policy channel” by which the Trump administration was pursuing objectives in Ukraine “running contrary to the goals of longstanding US policy”. What the “informal channel” wanted – and briefly obtained, Taylor said – was for the Ukrainian president to agree to go on CNN to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, whom Trump sees, perhaps mistakenly, as a top 2020 threat.The Trump administration held up “much-needed military assistance” to Ukraine in an effort to extract the Ukrainian statement, Taylor said. “More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the US assistance,” he noted.In a process scrambled so far by misleading Trump tweets and relying in part on anonymous witnesses, the testimony of Taylor, a Vietnam veteran respected in both parties with 50 years of public service behind him, landed as a potential game-changer. It was just the kind of testimony that seemed to answer even the most stubborn demands of Trump loyalists such as Senator Lindsey Graham for additional, definitive proof that Trump was turning the broad power of his office to his own narrow devices.“If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,” Graham said at the weekend.The senator denied in a Fox News appearance Tuesday that Taylor had delivered such evidence. But Taylor added significant ballast to the allegation that Trump was attempting to extort Ukraine into ginning up bad news about Biden.What Taylor added was a careful stitchwork of detail, describing who was working to extort the Ukrainians, how they were going about it, how their aims clashed with stated US policy, how the Ukrainians responded, and what people said to him about it at the time.Taylor made clear he has the memos and other records to back up his story. And he exposed the slapstick clumsiness of the Trump flunkies working the “informal channel” – notably Gordon Sondland, the hotelier and Trump mega-donor turned ambassador.“Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman,” Taylor testified. “When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.”But “the explanation made no sense”, Taylor argued. “The Ukrainians did not ‘owe’ President Trump anything, and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was ‘crazy’.”Reaction to Taylor’s testimony generally fell between shock and dumbfoundedness. “I cannot overstate how damaging this Ambassador Taylor testimony is to Trump,” tweeted Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general.“Taylor’s statement is a completely devastating document,” wrote Susan Hennessey, the executive director of the Lawfare site. “I know they will find a way but it’s just impossible to imagine how Republicans in Congress will be able to defend this. It is well beyond what most assumed was the worst-case scenario.”The White House issued a statement Tuesday night impugning Taylor, a Trump appointee, as part of a cadre of “radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the constitution”. But the taller the evidence against him, the smaller Trump’s protests seemed.Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, a presidential candidate, challenged Republicans to take a stand. “After Diplomat Taylor’s testimony you can no longer question whether this happened,” she tweeted. “The question is if you choose to follow the law or be part of the cover-up.”Trump huddled Tuesday night with members of his legal team, the Wall Street Journal reported, and he urged congressional Republicans to do more to rebut the impeachment inquiry. But there were reportedly no talking points, and no one knew quite what they were supposed to say, or whom to take that direction from.Notably absent from the meeting of Trump’s advisors was Rudy Giuliani, whom Taylor describes as running the shadow operation in Ukraine. “The official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr Giuliani,” Taylor said. He described a seemingly free hand for Giuliani, whose foreign clients include or have included Ukraine-based antagonists of current and former US officials, to open and close diplomatic channels and to direct US policy as he pleased.One of the weightiest impacts of Taylor’s testimony might have to do with the senior US officials it names. Taylor took his concerns about Trump’s alleged attempt to extort Ukraine, he said, to both national security adviser John Bolton and to secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Bolton, who has since resigned, reacted with outrage and frustration.Pompeo, who is eyeing a US Senate bid in his home state of Kansas, apparently greeted Taylor’s warning with silence.“This is not the story of corruption in Ukraine,” tweeted the political strategist David Axelrod. “It’s the story of corruption at the highest levels of the US government. It’s the story of extortion, with US military aid to a besieged ally held hostage to the president’s personal political project.”Trump’s critics say the story is plain: that the president twisted the immense powers of his office to personal ends, in betrayal of constitution and country. When it comes time to prove it, Taylor’s testimony is likely to be front and center.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/trump-bill-taylor-testimony-republicans-impeachment-inquiry
The Essex lorry deaths throw up so many questions. It’s vital we ask the right ones,"This horrific event was not caused by lax border controls but by governments that force the most vulnerable to risk their lives, writes author Daniel Trilling",Daniel Trilling,2019-10-23T16:45:51+0100,"There are several ways a person who doesn’t want to be found can conceal themselves in a lorry. If you are able-bodied and strong enough, you can crawl between the wheel-axles and the base, and hang on for as long as your arms hold out. If not, you can try to cram yourself into the tiny storage box that sits between the wheels, a feat of contortion as well as endurance. Or, if you have the means, you can unlock and climb inside the main container, which may or may not be airtight. You do these things because you want to cross an international border you do not have permission to cross.Every so often, as with today’s news that 39 people have been found dead in a lorry in Essex, the risks of this mode of transport become impossible to ignore. I have met people who have travelled by all these means, and all of them were taking a leap into the unknown. Jamal, a young man from Sudan who spent time in Calais, kept hiding underneath lorries he thought were bound for Britain then having to jump off on the motorways of France and Belgium when they turned out to be heading elsewhere. A Kurdish man I know who made his way from Iran to Europe a decade ago had to watch the smugglers who offered him safe passage beat up other travellers, and wonder if they would do the same to him. Zainab, an Iraqi mother of three, climbed into a refrigerated lorry with her children one night in France in the autumn of 2014, expecting the driver to set off for the Channel. Instead, he remained parked and switched off the ventilation. The police arrived just as other passengers began to suffocate.The 38 adults and one teenager whose bodies were discovered today have yet to be identified and concrete details of their journey are still emerging, though it appears that the lorry came from Bulgaria. It echoes other similar incidents: the 58 men and women found dead in a lorry at Dover in 2000; the 71 decomposing bodies abandoned in a lorry at the side of a motorway in Austria in 2015; or the 35 men, women and children discovered in a shipping container at Tilbury Docks in 2014, suffering from hypothermia and severe dehydration.Our immediate reaction is usually shock, and a desire to prevent things like this from happening again. A kneejerk response is to demand tougher controls: more security infrastructure at the borders; tougher punishments for the people who try to make these journeys and those who facilitate them. Yet such disasters do not happen because of a lack of border control – they are the price of it. The illusion our politicians perpetuate, or buy into, is that migration can be switched on and off like a tap, according to the wishes of voters or the demands of the economy. It can be shaped, for sure: states can offer people incentives to move, or they can put bureaucratic or physical obstacles in people’s way to make it less likely. But, as is painfully apparent in so many parts of the world right now, there will always be people who feel compelled to travel even when the risks are deadly. Tougher controls push people to more dangerous routes, and to place their lives in the hands of smugglers who may be indifferent to their safety or actively looking to exploit them.If these people were refugees, why were they unable to access their rights elsewhere in Europe?The situation at Calais, now two decades old, is a case in point. As debates over the Brexit referendum in 2016 reached fever pitch, images of people gathered at the French port were used as evidence of lax border control. In fact they were evidence of the opposite: it’s precisely because the UK has made it so tough to cross the Channel that people get trapped elsewhere – or, as has recently become more common, attempting their own perilous boat journeys from the French coast. Britain did not experience a “refugee crisis” in the way that other parts of Europe did: in 2015, as asylum applications rose across Europe as a whole, the UK’s share of applications actually fell. This is why it’s crucial not to let shock and panic lead us into making decisions that will make life harder for the very people we may wish to protect.Important questions are being asked about the deaths of the people discovered in Essex: who is responsible, and how could this be prevented in future? Essex police have opened a murder investigation and arrested the driver of the lorry. The National Crime Agency has said it is working to identify any organised criminal groups that may be involved. But there are a series of other questions we should also be asking. The first is why people would want to travel in that manner at all: what was pushing them to leave their homes, and why were they unwilling to stop elsewhere? If there were refugees among the dead, why were they unable to access their rights elsewhere in Europe? Were there people among them who had the right to be in the UK, but could not get here via legal routes because the British government was dragging its feet – as it has done with hundreds of lone children stranded in Europe?And if they weren’t refugees, what motivated them to travel this way in search of work? A major new study by the United Nations development programme illustrates how complex the answers can be: in interviews with nearly 2,000 people from Africa who travelled to Europe for work, via some of the world’s deadliest migration routes, more than 90% said they would do it again. In the most part, they were not suffering abject poverty, but had experienced inequality and injustice, and wanted more from their lives.By asking these questions, we recognise that the people who suffer at our borders are not simply passive victims, but individuals making decisions and trying to retain control of their lives. Only then will we stop treating this issue as a problem to be ignored or suppressed, and start to talk about how we might reorganise our system around people’s needs.• Daniel Trilling is editor of the New Humanist and author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/essex-lorry-borders-governments

They have nearly a half-millennium between them, and no end of war stories to share, tales of pressing the buttons and pulling the levers behind some of major conflicts of modern times.The dean of the bunch is sitting low in his seat on the right: Henry Kissinger, the 96-year-old living embodiment of cold war realpolitik with a wealth of foreign policy knowledge and major wars to his name, including the undeclared, illegal mass bombing of Cambodia.Standing in the rear are three of the leading minds behind the 2003 Iraq invasion. With his trademark tan and grin, the former British prime minister Tony Blair is at the left, next to Condoleezza Rice, who was George Bush’s national security adviser at the time. Over to their right is John Howard who, as Australian leader at the time, sent his country’s troops into the fray.The latter-day crusade in pursuit of Saddam Hussein’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction was one of the most disastrous mistakes in history, unleashing a cascade of violence that killed well over half a million people and ushered in an era of extreme violence in the Middle East that continues today.The fact they are still feted as foreign policy sages suggests that once you reach a certain level in global diplomacy, you can only fail upwards.In among the trio is Robert Gates, former CIA director and defence secretary, who sat the Iraq war out but as deputy director of the CIA did advocate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua.Moments with Mr. Kissinger, former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and John Howard, Ms. Condoleezza Rice and Mr. Robert Gates. Excellent discussions with these global thought leaders. pic.twitter.com/OPBheNkpPeAt the centre and focal point of the little group is its newest member, Narendra Modi. The Indian prime minister is the only one among them still doing the day job, but may be being inducted early for moving troops into Kashmir, revoking its autonomous status and rounding up Muslims, even at the risk of nuclear war with Pakistan.In the photo, Modi is the benign host, grasping hands with Blair and Howard, while gazing amicably at Kissinger, apparently forgiving the elder statesman for his determined support for the Pakistani dictatorship even though its army killed at least 300,000 mostly Hindu Bengalis in what is now Bangladesh and forced 10 million to flee to India. On the notorious Nixon tapes, Kissinger can be heard referring the Indians as “such bastards” and calling Indira Gandhi a “bitch”.“If Modi wanted to get huffy, he would have material,” said Gary Bass, author of Blood Telegram, a book on the genocide and Nixon and Kissinger’s role in it.There is no sign of huffiness at the JP Morgan bash. The fact that when Blair and Rice were in office, their governments imposed travel bans on Modi after anti-Muslim rioting killed a thousand people under his watch has also been consigned to the past.It may be that once you rise to the top level of such grand strategy, it no longer matters what side you were on or who you killed. They all add to the mileage on your platinum card. To have taken part and come out the other side, prosperous and smiling, is enough.",https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/architects-major-modern-conflicts-kissinger-blair
Albanian police say Iranian 'terror cell' planned to attack exiles,Paramilitary network allegedly targeted members of MEK in Albania,,2019-10-23T16:31:48+0100,"Albanian police say they have discovered an Iranian paramilitary network that allegedly planned attacks in Albania against exiled members of an Iranian group that is seeking to overthrow the government in Tehran.The country’s police chief, Ardi Veliu, said the foreign wing of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards operated an “active terrorist cell” targeting members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK, in Albania.He did not say what the alleged plot involved or whether any arrests were made.A police statement alleged that two Iranian security officials led the cell from Tehran. It said the network was allegedly linked to organised crime groups in Turkey and used a former MEK member to collect information in Albania.Veliu said a planned attack on the group in Albania by Iranian government agents was foiled in March.Last year Albania expelled Iran’s ambassador and another Iranian diplomat over alleged illegal activities threatening Albania’s security.MEK is outlawed in Iran and was listed as a terrorist organisation by the US state department until 2012.

The Pilgrim’s Progress review – tiring trudge to the Celestial City,This animated adaptation of Bunyan’s 17th-century religious allegory features some scary demons but the rest is pretty tame,Cath Clarke,2019-10-23T16:00:37+0100,"Pity the poor year-nine students who henceforth will be plonked in front of this plodding, sanctimonious animation of John Bunyan’s 1678 religious allegory as “a treat” in RE class. The film’s animation is reminiscent of an aircraft safety video, with characters moving stiffly while delivering the dialogue in awkward, am-dram style.It begins promisingly in the City of Destruction, a vividly animated inferno where citizens toil at backbreaking work. After one of them goes missing, leaving behind a house full of visionary sketches and a book about the Celestial City, Christian Pilgrim (voiced by Ben Price) follows him into the unknown, abandoning his family. First stop on his journey is the Swamp of Despair. At Vanity Fair he must resist the temptations of the flesh – painted ladies, cakes galore – while at points along the road he is visited by the kindly Evangelist, who looks like Jesus with a Kate Middleton blow dry.If not much else, The Pilgrim’s Progress has got some cracking, genuinely nightmare-inducing demons. Christian goes sword to sword with the devil’s henchman, a winged creature with horns and the pecs of champion bodybuilder. Less interesting is the characterisation of the female giant Diffidence as a battle-axe wife – the kind of pinny-wearing, rolling-pin wielding stereotype that belongs in the 17th century. It also doesn’t help that there is also virtually zero humour, though I did have to suppress a giggle at the road sign for “Passion Passage”.• The Pilgrim’s Progress is released in the UK on 25 October.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/23/the-pilgrims-progress-review-animation-john-bunyan
"Russia has been playing a canny game in the Middle East, but can it continue?","Russia’s deal with Turkey is the latest in a smart power-broking strategy that will soon be tested to its limits, writes Olga Oliker of the International Crisis Group",Olga Oliker,2019-10-23T15:47:09+0100,"Recent events in Syria suggest that Russia isn’t just taking Washington’s place as the Middle East’s power broker – it seems to be doing a more effective job of it, too.The latest evidence came yesterday, when Vladimir Putin held a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. As a US-brokered ceasefire in Syria’s north-east expired, they struck a deal to evacuate the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish-led militia, from a buffer zone near Turkey’s border. Russian and Turkish troops will begin patrols of that area, giving them joint control. But while Russian diplomatic skill is to be commended, America’s loss may yet prove Russia’s headache.Few expected such a turn of events in 2015, when Russia launched a military operation in support of Bashar al-Assad. At the time, the Syrian president was at significant risk of losing control of his country to a disparate assortment of forces: US-backed groups including the YPG; Turkish-backed forces; Islamic State; al-Qaida; and others. Russia had several reasons to back Assad. He was a friend to Moscow, as his father had been before him. The Kremlin was concerned that if he fell, chaos would ensue – or Isis would fill the void. From a geo-strategic perspective, Russia had long opposed US-backed “regime change” interventions and was disinclined to let one more succeed. It was also keen to build influence in the Middle East and show itself to be a reliable partner. And while its involvement was in direct opposition to US efforts, Moscow likely believed that once it had proven itself a force to be reckoned with, it could establish its relevance to the US and cut some kind of arrangement with the Americans on the future of Syria and fight against Isis, thereby further cementing its great-power status and helping rebuild the two countries’ relationship.Russia’s military intervention in Syria had a decisive effect, reversing Assad’s slide. Cooperation with the Americans, however, proved elusive. But while Washington didn’t want to carve up influence and share it, a different dynamic nonetheless emerged. Erratic and shrinking US involvement, together with Moscow’s diplomatic skill, has now left Russia in what might seem an enviable position in Syria and in the region as a whole.All of this has been on display over the past fortnight, since Donald Trump announced the US withdrawal from Syria for the third time in 18 months – this time combined with a tacit green light for Turkey to move into territory in Syria’s north-east controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in which the YPG plays a leading role. Russia, for its part, has brokered a tactical arrangement between the YPG and Assad, supported Assad’s troops as they moved toward the border, kept them and Turkish forces at a distance from one another and,now, struck a deal with Ankara.As Assad consolidates power, his desire to follow Moscow’s lead will likely diminish furtherMaintaining good relations with all sides has been at the centre of Moscow’s Middle East strategy. Unlike the US, which has historically divided the region into friends and enemies, Russia has taken a pragmatic approach. Where it has common interests with a country, it pursues them in cooperation. Where it disagrees, it accepts that each party will do what it can to get what it wants, even as they continue to coordinate on other matters. A lack of interest in criticising other countries for human rights violations (Russia itself is credibly accused of targeting civilians in Syria) rounds out a package bound to appeal to many Middle Eastern governments.As partner to all and ally to few, Moscow has been able to simultaneously protect the Syrian regime, turn a blind eye to Israeli strikes against Iranian assets, and help Israel and Iran avoid accidental clashes. It is also steadily improving its relationship with Saudi Arabia.But while Moscow’s current position in the Middle East appears advantageous, it presents challenges. As Assad consolidates power, his desire to follow Moscow’s lead, already tenuous, will likely diminish further. Russia’s relationship with Ankara does offer some continued leverage over Damascus. So, to an extent, does its pledge to protect the interests and security of the Kurdish community. However, neither Damascus nor Ankara is likely to make any real concessions to the YPG, raising questions of just what Moscow can deliver – and how long it can maintain good relations with all three parties.Looking ahead, Russia’s goals are unchanged. It still desires Assad’s control of a stabilised Syria and global acceptance of his continued rule, as well as guaranteeing its own long-term influence in the region. At the same time, it does not want to maintain a substantial military commitment in Syria, although it will likely seek a base or two.Assad seems well on the way to re-establishing control. But despite the deal with Ankara, stability, and thus Russian withdrawal, will be harder to achieve. Not only is resolution in the north-east far from assured, the northwest, where Idlib remains in jihadist hands, presents an equally complicated Gordian knot. Moreover, the reconstruction that would make peace sustainable requires resources beyond the means of Syria and Russia. International help and support might be more forthcoming if the YPG get a better deal and Idlib is resolved without a bloodbath, but Assad and Moscow will balk at demands for a political transition.Russia’s impressive juggling act in the Middle East, and in Syria in particular, has left it in a powerful position. But by filling the vacuum left by the US, it has had to take on far more responsibility than it may have expected or sought. To date it has managed well, but with few easy choices ahead and Syria in its current state, this may not be an enviable prize.• Olga Oliker directs the Europe and Central Asia programme at International Crisis Group",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/putin-middle-east-russia-turkey-syria
Google claims it has achieved 'quantum supremacy' – but IBM disagrees,"Task that would take most powerful supercomputer 10,000 years ‘completed by quantum machine in minutes’",Ian Sample,2019-10-23T15:29:57+0100,"For Google, it was a historic announcement: a declaration that it had won the race to achieve “quantum supremacy” – the moment that a sophisticated quantum computer performed a task that stumped even the most powerful standard computer in the world.But for all the fanfare, which saw Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, compare the feat to building the first rocket to reach space, the claim has sparked a bunfight. The tech firm’s rival, IBM, was swift to dismiss the excitement. Google has not, it asserts, achieved the highly prized goal of quantum supremacy.Google published its claim in the journal Nature on Wednesday after an earlier report on the work appeared briefly on a Nasa website last month. The paper describes how a team led by John Martinis, leader of the research team working on quantum supremacy, built a superconducting quantum processor named Sycamore that harnesses the weirdness of quantum physics to crunch through thorny problems.To demonstrate the device’s computational prowess, the scientists set it the deeply contrived task of checking the randomness of a sequence of numbers. What the quantum computer rattled through in three minutes and 20 seconds would keep the world’s most powerful supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee busy for 10,000 years, they claim.“This experiment was kind of hard to do,” said Martinis. “When we proposed it in the group, people took a while to understand and get this to work.”But get it to work they did. Writing in the journal, the authors state: “To our knowledge, this experiment marks the first computation that can be performed only on a quantum processor. Quantum processors have thus reached the regime of quantum supremacy.”Not so, say the IBM researchers. In a blogpost written in response to the work, they argue that the Oak Ridge supercomputer could solve the randomness problem in 2.5 days, perhaps less, depending on how it was programmed. They add that because “quantum supremacy” requires a quantum computer to solve a problem that is beyond a classical computer, Google’s claim does not hold up.“Google’s experiment is an excellent demonstration of the progress in superconducting-based quantum computing,” the IBM scientists argue. “But it should not be viewed as proof that quantum computers are ‘supreme’ over classical computers.”Standard computers and quantum computers are radically different. While standard computers perform calculations with “bits”, which must be either 0 or 1, quantum computers have “qubits” that can take any value between 0 and 1. Another quirk of quantum physics allows qubits to be “entangled” such that the value of one is tied to the values of those around it. Make a quantum computer that is stable enough – a tough enough feat in itself – and it can, in principle, explore multiple solutions to a problem at once.Since the advent of the first experimental qubits, tech firms have been racing to demonstrate what the US physicist John Preskill dubbed “quantum supremacy”. Preskill coined the phrase to define the turning point in computing history when quantum computers showed their true potential by trouncing standard machines.Google’s Sycamore processor used 53 qubits to plough through the arcane task its masters gave it. According to Pichai, the breakthrough is a step towards using quantum computers to solve real-world problems, such as creating new drugs, designing more efficient batteries, and making fertilisers with less energy. “We’ve already peeled away from classical computers, on to a totally different trajectory,” a Google spokesperson said.Asked about IBM’s reaction to the achievement, Sergio Boixo on the Google team said: “It’s very important to test the proposals on real supercomputers, because things don’t always work as expected.” Martinis added: “We’re looking forward to having them look at our data and validate our results some more.”Christopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland and co-founder of the quantum computing startup IonQ, said Google’s paper might be a milestone in quantum computing, but it was an academic one. “The problem is not likely to be useful for anything, except showing something that appears to be really hard using normal computers,” he said.But work towards useful quantum computers was “marching along”, Monroe added, saying the devices were likely to help solve a raft of problems, from logistics to understanding the structures of large molecules. “Problems like this can only be solved on a quantum computer,” he said.Steve Brierley, CEO of the Cambridge-based quantum software company Riverlane, said: “It’s clearly an amazing achievement. I think this is going to be one of those moments when people look back and say, ‘That was the time that really changed this field of quantum computing.’ It is also a great moment in time to stop talking about quantum supremacy, which has unfortunate historical connotations, and move on to talking about quantum advantage, which has a useful application.”In an accompanying article in Nature, William Oliver, a physicist at MIT, compares Google’s achievement to the first flights of the Wright brothers. The Wright Flyer was not the first airborne vehicle to fly, nor did it solve any pressing problem, but it demonstrated a radical new possibility, the implications of which became clear only decades later. “It is what the event represented, rather than what it practically accomplished, that was paramount. And so it is with this first report of quantum computational supremacy,” Oliver said.Computer scientists have some formidable hurdles to overcome to make quantum computers useful and commonplace. But with tech firms investing heavily – about $1bn (£780m) to date, with more in the pipeline – many researchers are now confident that rudimentary devices will be put to good use, in combination with standard computers, in the next decade or so.Quantum computers lend themselves to problems that are essentially too demanding for classical computers to take on. One area where scientists expect them to make an impact is in drug discovery. In the search for new medicines, pharmaceutical companies call on computers to trawl through the structures of scores of molecules to see which might bind to biological molecules and have some useful action in the body. Quantum computers should run these searches much faster by analysing whole libraries of molecules at a time and identifying the most promising drug candidates.Several startups see quantum computers as a means to design radically new materials, including better batteries, by modelling the quantum behaviour of the subatomic particles inside them.Another area where the processing capability of quantum computers could prove itself is weather forecasting. The science and art of forecasting have steadily improved with greater computing power, but quantum computers could mean a step change in accuracy. The problem with the weather is that it is so complex that in the time it takes a standard computer to produce an accurate forecast, the weather has already happened.Inevitably, quantum computers will also be used for financial modelling, where a huge number of variables dictate the movements of markets.The arrival of quantum computers might not please everyone. Sophisticated devices could in principle crack encryption that is invulnerable to standard computers. But that would take machines with 100m qubits, nearly two million times as many as Google’s processor.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/google-claims-it-has-achieved-quantum-supremacy-but-ibm-disagrees
Republicans are finally realising Trump is his own worst enemy – and theirs,The president’s increasingly risible attempts to paint himself as a victim are alienating even his most loyal supporters,Richard Wolffe,2019-10-23T14:10:50+0100,"There was a time, not so long ago, when it was widely considered suicidal for an American politician to pay hush money to porn stars, cosy up to Russian leaders, or use national security dollars to buy foreign interference at election time.In those quaint days of yore, an experienced politician might have steered well clear of anything that smacked of being on the wrong side of civil rights.At some point over the last generation, even the conservatives who hate today’s civil rights came to love yesterday’s civil rights. Martin Luther King Jr was no longer a Commie revolutionary but a beloved national icon. Segregation and the Klan’s reign of terror was as obviously, stunningly immoral as Nazism.Until today, and until Donald Trump. You may not have known this, but Trump is himself a victim, no different from the poor souls who were publicly tortured and murdered by the Klan and its mobs. Despite his German roots, and his family’s business history of race discrimination, Trump thinks he’s suffering just as much.“So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,” tweeted the president who has no recollection of a predecessor called Bill Clinton.“All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here – a lynching. But we will WIN!”Trump is strange, but he’s not a strange fruit. And so it came to pass that the only people who can stop Trump’s conviction at his forthcoming impeachment trial were forced to spend the day talking about lynching.To do so, you need to suspend a little reality and a lot of self-respect. You need to become a human shell that blurts out words with no meaning, that sparks thoughts with no intelligence. To wit: one Hogan Gidley, who holds the hallucinatory role of deputy press secretary in Trump’s West Wing.“The president’s not comparing what’s happened to him with one of our darkest moments in American history. He’s just not,” Gidley told reporters, ignoring Exhibit A in the day’s proceedings: the president’s tweet that did just that.“I understand there are many people in the media who don’t agree with his language. He has used many words to describe the way he has been relentlessly attacked.”He has indeed used so many words, to such remarkable effect. Much like the hapless Hogan himself. They flow like endless rain into a paper cup.As a defence of the president’s position, Hogan’s explanation is the equivalent of going back to bed to pull the covers over your head. There’s a reason why there are no White House press briefings any more: because you literally can’t make sense of the boss without getting fired, indicted, or shamed into permanent unemployment.Other Republicans not employed by the White House found it easier to express what they thought. Both Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, said they disagreed with Trump’s choice of words.Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, went even further by saying that Trump should retract his comments immediately. “May God help us return to a better way,” he tweeted.The almighty ought to be busy in Syria right now, so this unusually orange challenge rightly falls into the lap of Republicans like Kinzinger himself.Like a fatberg blocking the sewers of Capitol Hill, Trump’s sense of victimhood and love of lying is creating unbearable pressure in a system designed to flush away an extraordinary volume of political waste material.So Republicans were talking about Trump’s self-styled lynching instead of defending Trump from the blockbuster impeachment evidence of his current ambassador to Ukraine.Until now, Trump has drawn what he might call a “red line in the sand” around the notion that there was no quid pro quo in Ukraine – no withholding of military aid in exchange for political dirt on the Biden family.But ambassador William Taylor flatly contradicted Trump’s defence, much like his chief of staff Mick Mulvaney did last week – before Mulvaney was forced to swallow his words and regurgitate them back into the public square in an unspeakable puddle.Never mind all that quidding and quoing now. It’s time to run for the vomitorium.How did the party that gave the world freedom fries find itself locked in this Trump-shaped prison? The simple answer is that they built it themselves. Trump didn’t invent it; he’s not nearly enough of a very stable genius.In the days after the 9/11 attacks, Republicans looked at the world and decided to see its enemies: an amorphous group of freedom-haters. Only Republicans could protect America from such global threats.But in the absence of a torrent of al-Qaida insurgents at America’s borders, the party rapidly switched to protecting America from Latinos. Once you unleash the politics of fear, you create the space for your own fear-peddling president.Where you once pretended to be strong on terrorism, you now follow a president who just conspired with Turkey and Russia to revive Isis from near-death in Syria.Where you once claimed Obamacare was an abuse of the constitution, you now support a president who claims that some part of the same founding document is phony.Where you once claimed to defend freedom, you no longer have the freedom to speak your mind or your values. Unless you call yourself Pierre and join the cheese-eating surrender monkeys on Twitter.Until now, Trump has assumed he can get away with murder because Republican senators will acquit him in an impeachment trial. That may be a reasonable assumption, even for someone as smart as Trump.But there’s one thing that Republican senators value, and it’s not Trump’s leadership or his personal charm. It’s survival.At some point, Mitch McConnell will look at the polls and his projected losses in the Senate and realise that there’s something even worse than Trump unleashing his tweetbots in a Republican primary.For now, the GOP is clinging on to a half-baked Trumpian deal: supporting their leader in exchange for him holding his fire and fury. But nobody seriously believes that Trump can stop the projectiles that barrel out of every orifice. Never mind the quid pro quo: this status quo is untenable.• Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/republicans-are-finally-realising-that-trump-is-his-own-worst-enemy-and-theirs
MEPs block move to weaken EU rules on bee-harming pesticides,Sixteen states and European commission had lobbied against planned guidance,Daniel Boffey,2019-10-23T14:05:36+0100,"The European parliament has vetoed a move by member states and the European commission to weaken EU rules protecting bee colonies from toxic pesticides.MEPs blocked revised legislation that was said to ignore the risk to bee larvae from long-term exposure to chemicals, known as chronic toxicity.The MEPs instead argued a guidance document (pdf) produced by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2013 should be fully implemented.The guidance seeks both to protect bees from adverse effects from a single exposure or multiple exposures over a short period of time, known as acute toxicity, and also long-term exposure.Sixteen member states, which have not been publicly named, lobbied against the full implementation of the guidance before the new rules are brought to a vote in the European parliament.Green MEPs who led the way on the parliamentary veto claimed the new generation of systemic pesticides, which are applied via seed treatment rather than spraying, made chronic exposure particularly relevant.Bee populations have collapsed around the world and the use of pesticides is said to be the main cause.A 2019 analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species in the UK found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places in which they were found in 1980.Butterflies and mothsThere has been a “severe reduction” in butterflies and moths in the Kullaberg Nature Reserve in Sweden compared with 50 years ago. Scientists found over a quarter of the 600 species once found had been lost. Butterflies were hardest hit, losing almost a half of species, including the large tortoiseshell and scarce copper. In England, two-thirds of 340 moth species declined from 1968-2003.BumblebeesMuseum records enabled scientists to assess the fate of 16 species of bumblebees in the US midwest from 1900 to 2007. They found four had completely died out, while eight were declining in number, and blamed intensive agriculture and pesticides.DragonfliesRed dragonfly populations have fallen sharply in Japan since the mid-1990s, which scientists link to insecticides in rice paddies that stop the water-living nymphs emerging into adults. In the US, recent surveys across California and Nevada found 65% of dragonflies and damselflies had declined in the 100 years since 1914.LeafhoppersLeafhoppers and planthoppers often make up a large proportion of the flying insects in European grasslands. But scientists found their abundance in Germany plunged by 66% in the 50 years to 2010. Soil acidification, partly due to heavy fertiliser use, was the main cause.Ground beetlesIn the UK, dramatic declines in ground beetles have been seen in almost three-quarters of the 68 carabid species studied from 1994-2008. A few species increased, but overall one in six of all the beetles was lost in that time.The parliamentary veto was passed by 533 MEPs, with 67 voting against and 100 abstentions.Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green party MEP, said: “The parliament’s objection is sending a strong signal to the commission not to bow to the pressure of member states and the agrochemical industry.“The parliament is demanding a new text that fully implements existing scientific guidelines. Bee populations are suffering everywhere, largely due to the use of pesticides, with major consequences for our ecosystems and food supplies.“Bees come into contact with small quantities of a pesticide over a long period of time and this is where the real problem lies; that’s why chronic toxicity needs to be fully included in the assessment of pesticides.”Eickhout claimed pesticide producers had gone to great lengths to maintain their “toxic business model” and that the commission had been complicit in weakening protections.“This change of legislation has received relatively little attention so far because it has been discussed behind closed doors at the technical level. It’s time for the European commission to present a proper proposal at the political level so that member states can be held accountable for this issue and then many EU countries might change their tune,” he said.Bees pollinate more than 80% of crops and wild plants in Europe. Last year, the EU banned the world’s most widely used insecticides, neonicotinoids, from all fields.The chemicals were found to cause a wide range of harms including memory damage and a reduction in queen numbers. But the ban included an exemption for greenhouses, raising fears the chemical could still wash out into watercourses.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/23/meps-block-move-weaken-eu-rules-bee-harming-pesticides
Woman in Northern Ireland abortion pills case formally acquitted,Judge instructs jury to find woman not guilty after legal changes come into force,Rory Carroll,2019-10-23T13:22:45+0100,"A court in Northern Ireland has acquitted a woman who was prosecuted for buying online abortion pills for her daughter, after the decriminalisation of abortion in the region.The judge, David McFarland, directed a jury at Belfast crown court on Wednesday to find the woman not guilty a day after Northern Ireland’s Victorian-era abortion laws were liberalised. The prosecution offered no evidence.“My emotions are all over the place. I find it hard to put into words how I am feeling,” the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said after the verdict. “For the first time in six years I can go back to being the mother I was without the weight of this hanging over me every minute of every day. I am so thankful that the change in the law will allow other women and girls to deal with matters like this privately in their own family circle.”She added: “I can finally move on with my life.”The woman bought and supplied abortion pills in 2013 to her then 15-year-old daughter, who terminated the pregnancy.After her GP alerted police the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland levelled two charges of unlawfully procuring and supplying abortion pills with the intent to procure a miscarriage contrary to the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. The decision to subject her to a criminal trial and the prospect of five years in prison provoked an outcry and intensified campaigners’ efforts to align Northern Ireland’s abortion laws with the rest of the UK.The campaign led to a vote by MPs in July to extend abortion rights to the region. The legislation – along with legalisation of same-sex marriage – took effect on Tuesday. It put a moratorium on criminal prosecutions, halting police investigations into abortion cases. The law also obliges the UK to ensure regulations for free, legal and local abortion services are in place by 31 March 2020.The woman’s solicitor, Jemma Conlon, said her client was immensely relieved that a six-year legal ordeal had ended. “It is a day that she will forever remember and a day that allows her to finally move on with her life privately without anguish and criminalisation,” she said.Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland campaign manager, said no other women would be hauled through the courts and face criminal prosecution in the manner the acquitted woman had been. “This is the beginning of a more caring and compassionate Northern Ireland,” she said.The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and other anti-abortion parties attempted to recall the mothballed assembly at Stormont on Monday to avert decriminalisation.

Two-thirds of British people see overseas aid as 'a major priority',Survey of EU citizens reveals overwhelming belief in importance of helping people in poorer countries,Lucy Lamble,2019-10-23T13:15:19+0100,"The British public remains firmly behind efforts to support people in poorer countries, with almost two-thirds of people canvassed in a survey of EU citizens believing that maintaining overseas aid at its current level should be “a major priority”.The results from Eurobarometer, the EU’s polling organisation, also found that almost 90% of people thought helping people in developing countries should be a priority of the EU and national governments.Romilly Greenhill, UK director of the advocacy group the One Campaign, said it was “heartening” that the vast majority of British people believe that helping people in developing countries is the right thing to do.“Despite the gloomy picture often painted, British people support building a more peaceful, progressive and prosperous world for all,” she said.Greenhill was encouraged by the finding that showed almost two-thirds of the British public think tackling poverty in developing countries should be “a major priority” for the UK government. “While Britain’s relationship with the world is changing, this shows we are still an outward looking country,” Greenhill said.The annual poll, which was conducted face to face in June 2019 among 26,464 Europeans, canvassed views on migration, the private sector and gender. It also asked what people thought should be the role of national governments and the EU in development.Claire Godfrey, interim director of policy, advocacy and research at Bond, the British network for organisations working in international development, said the survey was “incredibly timely” as the UK government begins to redefine its role in a post-Brexit world.British respondents were among the most positive about helping people in developing countries, but more sceptical than last year about development as a means to tackle migration.In line with the EU average, British citizens think that the EU should strengthen its partnership with African countries and increase financial investment in the continent.“Politicians in Westminster should heed this news,” said Greenhill. “Whatever the problems they grapple with today, British people are focusing on tomorrow, and believe that helping people in developing countries contributes to a more peaceful and fairer world.”Across the 28 member countries, the poll revealed broad consensus among European citizens on the significance of cross-border cooperation and development. Just as in the UK, almost 90% of EU citizens said that it is important to support people in developing countries, confirming a trend established over recent years.Development emerged as one of the most positively perceived EU policies.The European commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica, said he was “very happy” to see that Europeans continue their “strong support” for development and key priorities like “strengthening partnerships with Africa; deepening our engagement to create jobs; and bringing in more private investments”.Mimica said this support was a “solid basis for the union to maintain its leading global role and address the significant challenges that remain”.Bond has been working with its members on continuity in funding and service following Brexit.Godfrey said it was reassuring to see that, “despite the loud voices shouting down the importance and public support behind UK aid, in fact seven out of 10 people think our aid contribution doesn’t need changing or even should be increased, while over 60% of those interviewed think tackling poverty in developing countries should be a main priority of government”.The British public understood that “fairer trade, tax, ethical investments, transparency and tackling climate change are good for reducing poverty, inequality and combating environmental harm,” she said.Looking ahead, Godfrey said: “The government, and any future government, should take note of these results when thinking about what our development and aid priorities should be following Brexit.”In 2013, the UK joined the leading group of donors that have met the UN-target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on aid, laid down in 1970. Despite backbench opposition, this commitment was then enshrined in law in 2015.This year’s survey follows closer scrutiny of the rules that mean refugee costs can formally be counted as “official development assistance” – the convention agreed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development for what is eligible as part of 0.7% commitment.Funding for detention centres, border security and patrols, and the costs of returning failed asylum-seekers are now clearly excluded. Spending on asylum seekers once their application is rejected, or on refugees considered as “in transit” to other countries where they intend to resettle, is also ruled out.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/two-thirds-of-british-people-see-overseas-aid-as-a-major-priority-eurobarometer
Benny Gantz tasked with forming Israeli government,Ex-military chief has 28 days to forge coalition and avoid third election in year,Oliver Holmes,2019-10-23T13:14:44+0100,"Israel’s president has tasked the former military chief Benny Gantz with forming a government after Benjamin Netanyahu failed to do so following an inconclusive election last month.Neither Gantz’s Blue and White coalition nor the incumbent prime minister’s Likud party came out with a clear win, and few expect the opposition leader to form a coalition through deals with disparate political parties with ease.“I promised that I would establish a liberal unity government and that is what I intend to do,” said Gantz at a formal ceremony at the president’s official residence on Wednesday evening. “The government that I will establish will serve all citizens of Israel.”Gantz will have 28 days to try, after which parliament can nominate a third candidate, although that appears extremely unlikely given the divided makeup of Israel’s legislature, the Knesset.If no contender can end the political crisis, the country will face an unprecedented third election in a year.“These are fateful days,” said the president, Reuven Rivlin, after Wednesday’s event. “The urgency of the hour and the challenges that we are facing obligate us to form a government as soon as possible.”The ceremony marked the first time in more than a decade that anyone but Netanyahu be given a chance to head the Israeli government.An end to the Netanyahu era would be an extraordinary moment in Israeli politics, as he has led the country for a record-breaking total of more than 13 years. The move does not necessarily conclude  his political career or his chances of leading the country’s next administration.However, the stalemate has wounded the prime minister, especially as he has become more deeply embroiled in three potential corruption cases. Israel’s attorney general is expected to announce in the coming weeks if he plans to indict.The charges add pressure on Netanyahu to remain in high office. If he retains the role of prime minister, he will not be required to step down, even if indicted. Netanyahu has denied all allegations.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000 is an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000 is examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000 is an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle. Case 4000, the most serious, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.To block Gantz’s chances, Netanyahu reportedly planned to meet smaller rightwing and religious parties to get them to agree not to ally with the opposition leader.One route for Gantz to form a government would be to make a deal with Avigdor Lieberman, whose eight seats afford him kingmaker status, and gain support from Arab parties. However, Lieberman, a staunch ultranationalist regularly accused of racism, has described Arab politicians as “enemies”.Lieberman, Rivlin, Netanyahu and Gantz all say they want a unity government, possibly with a rotating premiership, but they are divided on how to achieve it.Blue and White argues Gantz should be prime minister first under any arrangement as his party won the most seats, finishing with 33 compared with Likud’s 32 in the 120-seat Knesset.Gantz also says Blue and White cannot serve in a government with a prime minister facing serious indictment.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/israeli-opposition-leader-benny-gantz-to-be-asked-to-form-government
Spanish state repression in Catalonia may be shocking – but it’s nothing new,"As we learned in the Basque country, true democracy requires there to be peace on both sides, says Basque leader Arnaldo Otegi",Arnaldo Otegi,2019-10-23T13:06:43+0100,"The Spanish supreme court’s deeply unjust verdict, handing out harsh prison sentences to nine Catalan government and civil society leaders for organising a peaceful referendum on self-determination in Catalonia, is for many the sign of a country slipping towards authoritarianism and away from western European-style democracy. But truth be told, for us Basques, this kind of behaviour is nothing new.For years Spain was able to disguise its undemocratic essence under the cloak of the “fight against Basque terrorism”. Denial and rejection of the political nature of the armed conflict in the Basque country became quite easy for them, especially after 9/11. The line was that there was not a political problem in Spain, just a criminal one. “Spain is a democracy,” they used to tell us. “Everything is possible without violence” was the repeated mantra. We still remember the words of Spanish home secretary Alfredo P Rubalcaba: “They must decide: bombs or votes.”The truth is Basque violence was ended not thanks to the government's efforts but despite its persistent obstructionsYet when some of us in the pro-independence Basque movement began to convince those who still believed in violence to continue our struggle for self-determination by peaceful and democratic means, we were arrested and sentenced to lengthy jail terms.The truth is that Basque violence ended –not thanks to Spanish government efforts – but in spite of its persistent obstructions. (It is probably important here to clarify my position: many wrongs were done by the Basque side, many things happened that should not have done. We have acknowledged our share of the blame for the violence that was committed by both sides during years of conflict). My arrest – along with others – happened 10 years before the Catalan politicians were convicted of sedition, and it was only after we had served our prison term that the European court of human rights ruled our trial had been unfair (the second time the ECHR had ruled against Spain). The same could easily happen to the Catalans. The fact that the Spanish state still holds more than 240 Basque political prisoners in jail despite ETA ending its armed campaign in 2011 shows its lack of interest in a lasting peace.The verdict against the Catalan pro-independence leadership for organising a democratic and peaceful referendum, and the subsequent violence the Spanish police used against peaceful Catalan demonstrations, shows us what we always knew: the Spanish state is not interested in democracy and will use violence to conceal its undemocratic nature.This is why the state plays up, and at times instigates, violence in the region. The Spanish media and courts have even started talking about “terrorism” in the Catalan case. Spain will not hesitate to use this lie. Its government would love to transform Catalans’ legitimate and peaceful demand for self-determination into violence. That is what the police and military forces have been trying to do the last few days with their violent tactics.Fortunately, the Catalan nationalist movement is committed to peace. As we are in the Basque country. We know that our “force of reason” is stronger than their “reason of force”. At the same time we both are committed to achieving our fundamental democratic rights – Catalan and Basque demands for democracy will now only get louder. It is time to complete the unfinished business of Spain’s phoney transition to democracy – and there will not be real democracy in Spain until its plurinational character is recognised, just as in the UK or Canada.Rather predictably, Spain is going in the opposite direction: the direction of authoritarianism, counter-reform, the recentralisation of powers and responding to democratic demands with an iron fist. All this gives wings to the fascist extreme right. History shows us where this leads in the end.Repression, imprisonment and centralisation will not work. Like in most similar cases around the world there is no lasting solution to this kind of conflict without dialogue. Like in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Quebec, the only way to solve these tensions is through democracy. And anyone with a bit of political sense knows that the state needs to engage with legitimate Catalan representatives. A policy of repression with no talks and no negotiation is unacceptable.All the while, European institutions and states look the other way. Other European governments should be encouraging Spain to change track. Yet at the moment a desire to maintain internal stability within the bloc trumps all, and that means blind loyalty to Spain. This conflict can only be resolved internationally – European institutions and states should raise their voices in favour of a negotiated solution, before it is too late.• Arnaldo Otegi is the leader of the Basque independence party EH Bildu",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/spanish-state-repression-catalonia-democracy-basque
What Bill Taylor’s impeachment inquiry testimony tells us,The Ukraine diplomat said Trump put pressure on Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and gave the most detailed account so far,Luke Harding,2019-10-23T12:56:24+0100,"The US’s top diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, gave damning evidence on Tuesday to congressional committees in Washington investigating Donald Trump. Taylor told impeachment inquiry hearings that Trump had explicitly put pressure on Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden – Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2020 election – and to pursue the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US election on the side of Hillary Clinton. Taylor released his version of events in a 15-page document, in the most detailed account of the scandal so far.Taylor, a veteran diplomat, said that in May he was offered the job of US ambassador to Ukraine. He had served as ambassador there before, between 2006-2009. Taylor said he had reservations about taking up the role because his predecessor, Marie Yovanovitch, had been “poorly treated” and caught up “in a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and Washington”. Taylor said he agreed on condition the US’s policy of strong military and political support for Ukraine continued, at a time when it was under Russian attack. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, confirmed this. Taylor arrived in Kyiv in June. He took with him a letter from Trump inviting Ukraine’s new president Zelenskiy to the White House.Two foreign policies. In Kyiv, Taylor said he found a “confusing” and “ultimately alarming” situation. On the plus side, the new Zelenskiy government did appear to be making progress in tackling the country’s corruption. But Taylor said he discovered two distinct channels of “US policymaking”. One was regular. It included diplomatic support for reform. The other was “highly irregular” and run by some of Trump’s closest aides. They included special envoy Kurt Volker; the EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland; and the energy secretary, Rick Perry. Taylor said he later learned Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was involved. In late June Taylor said he “sensed something odd” about a planned call with Zelenskiy. Sondland told him that “regular interagency participants” would be excluded. And that he would pass on a demand from Trump to “get to the bottom of things”.Taylor said in mid-July it was clear that Trump wanted Zelenskiy to “investigate” two things. One was the conspiracy theory that Ukraine colluded with Hillary Clinton in 2016 to help her win the presidential election. The other was Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden – son of Joe Biden – had served on the board. The allegation, subsequently found to be untrue, was that Joe Biden had put pressure on the previous government of Petro Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma, in order to help his son. Taylor said Giuliani was behind the “irregular policy channel” and that Trump would only meet with Zelenskiy if the Ukrainian president carried out these investigations. There was an explicit quid pro quo, Taylor suggested.The White House put on hold almost $400m of military assistance promised to Ukraine. Taylor said he was astonished to learn of this, during a July conference call. The secretaries of defense and state, the CIA director and national security adviser all tried to get this overturned – without success. Taylor told Washington that Ukrainians in the east of the country would die without the assistance. Meanwhile, senior figures were furious that Trump was insisting on “investigations” before a meeting with Zelenskiy could take place. John Bolton called this “a drug deal” and told Fiona Hill, Trump’s senior Russia expert, to “brief the lawyers”. Taylor began keeping notes. Understandably, the Ukrainians were “confused” about US policy, he said.The notorious phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy took place on 25 July. Before the call, Sondland reportedly told Zelenskiy to tell Trump he would “leave no stone unturned” in investigating Biden. Taylor said he wasn’t given a readout of the conversation, which was “strange”. The ambassador became increasingly concerned by the lack of military aid to Ukraine. He asked Tim Morrison, Hill’s replacement on the National Security Council, about this and was told bluntly: “The president doesn’t want to provide any assistance at all.” Taylor said he wrote a cable to Pompeo setting out his concerns and saying it would be “folly” to deny the Ukrainians help when they were under attack.According to Taylor, Trump insisted that Zelenskiy make a public statement before he would meet with him. The Ukrainian president should appear on CNN and announce that he was opening an investigation into Biden and Ukraine’s 2016 election interference. Trump – according to Taylor – said that Zelenskiy had to “clear things up” and if he didn’t there would be “stalemate”. Taylor took that to mean no American weapons would be delivered. Zelenskiy was on the brink of caving in to Trump’s request but wanted the White House to announce a Trump-Zelenskiy meeting first. This sequence didn’t happen and so Zelenskiy didn’t appear on CNN, to Taylor’s great relief. The ambassador finally learned about the contents of the Zelenskiy-Trump phone call on 25 September, when the White House declassified it. The Ukrainians were “livid”, he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/trump-impeachment-inquiry-bill-taylor-ukraine-testimony
Mohamed Ali: Egyptian exile who sparked protests in shock at mass arrests,"In interview in Spain, businessman says he is in fear of contract killing and that he has new plan to topple President Sisi",Patrick Wintour,2019-10-23T12:29:18+0100,"The Egyptian whistleblower who prompted rare street protests against President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi from exile in Spain has said he is in a “state of shock” and feels a deep sense of personal responsibility for those jailed for answering his call to demonstrate. But he insisted his fight to topple Sisi will enter a new phase, claiming many junior officers in the army support his call for an end to corruption.In an interview with the Guardian in Barcelona, where he says he lives in fear of a contract killing, Mohamed Ali, called for the US Congress to investigate how decades of US economic and military aid amounting to more than $70bn had been spent by the Egyptian state. “Trump has let Sisi steal as much of America’s money as he wants,” Ali said. “It is like a comedy film.”Ali’s unscripted handheld viral videos tormenting and ridiculing Sisi sparked an unusual outbreak of dissent last month in Egypt, where the regime has imposed strict economic austerity measures and 32.5% of people live below the poverty line. Small protests that took place over a number of evenings from 20 September were followed by a widespread crackdown in which more than 4,321 people have been arrested, according to rights group the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms.A specific call from Ali for a million people to march on 27 September was stifled by authorities, who made clear they would use force to quell further demonstrations. He said he has stopped posting the videos for now – a tacit admission that his ability to bring people out onto the streets had died away.He said he is now playing a role in uniting opposition groups, including liberals and the Muslim Brotherhood, into a new force ready to topple Sisi, who came to power in a coup in 2013 and has overseen a wholesale crackdown on freedom of speech and public dissent considered by observers to be the worst in Egypt’s modern history.Ali said he had rejected calls by other opposition groups to join them in exile in Istanbul or Qatar, insisting he wants to stay in Spain.Chain smoking and sometimes agitated as he prowls around the room in which he filmed his video monologues, Ali acknowledged that he is an accidental revolutionary.The head of a large construction firm built up over 15 years, Ali raked in substantial profits from army contracts, building an ornate presidential palace for Sisi, intelligence headquarters, and unopened hotels owned by regime members. It was a shady world of patronage, bribes and open ended budgets. “With the army if you want a contract, you pay commission. If you do not pay a bribe under the table you do not get to do the jobs,” he said.“Often there were open budgets. They did not mind how much you spent as long as it looked right.”He also partnered with Egypt’s ministry of immigration to produce and star in the 2016 film The Other Land, a drama intended to dissuade Egyptians from attempting risky naval migration routes.Eventually he fell out with key military figures in the regime that disliked him and tried to block him from further business. The falling out, he claimed, left him being owed as much as 200m Egyptian pounds. He said that after ensuring his estranged wife and five children were out of the country, he was determined to expose the scams and waste.A form of revenge by social media ensued. His regular Facebook denunciations of Sisi’s personal corruption have been shared millions of times, prompting street protests that momentarily appeared to shake the repressive regime.The regime have described him as a drug addict, a traitor, a womaniser and member of the Muslim Brotherhood – the Sunni Islamist grouping that briefly ruled Egypt after the revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak in 2011 – all of which he denies.Many of Ali’s precise claims are unverifiable since he says he has no papers to prove the corruption. But Sisi himself has inadvertently given his tormentor credibility by clumsily confirming that he did indeed order palaces to be built, but that they were for the nation.The son of a body builder with no university education, Ali does not pretend to be a political sophisticate. “I am in a state of shock. I do not understand anything. I did not expect this,” he said. “I had a few people following me on Facebook, thought a few people would watch, but it has gone viral and people in Egypt message me saying ‘you are our hope’.“It is a load on me. There are people in prison and tortured. There are people in jail simply for possessing a phone that shows they watched one of my videos.”After his call for further protests failed to meet a popular response, Ali said he was forced to change course. “Before I used to think I could do this alone. Now I speak to opposition politicians and I have more minds with me. No one can succeed by himself.” He claimed he had a secret plan that he will shortly unveil that “will surprise the whole world”.Ali said Egypt’s beleaguered opposition has pressed him to explain what his vision for the country might be.“I said: ‘I want Egypt to be like Europe, If you want to pray, you pray, if you want to go to the club, you go to the club. Be free. Do you have any problem with that ?’ They said no. The first rule of the constitution must be that the people decide through elections.”Egypt’s presidential office did not respond to a request for comment, but Sisi has previously denied all allegations of wrongdoing and said he was “honest and faithful” to his people and the military.Ali said he was neither a hypocrite nor motivated solely by revenge. “If I wanted my money I could have found a way to keep working for them and I would be one of the most important businessmen in Egypt.” He said he acted out of anger at the contrast between Sisi’s calls for austerity and his lavish lifestyle. “The country is on fire, and they are discussing the size of their kitchen,” he said.“I do not take any decision without thinking very carefully and I planned my departure for many years, carefully taking my money out of the country.”But for the moment he faces all the dilemmas of a political exile. “They have taken my nationality from me. My passport expires in a year and if I claim political asylum, I must stay here for a long time and not travel.” Regime loyalists in Egypt, he said, have put a price on his head, or threatened to sue him.Ali claimed the Egyptian embassy in Madrid has invited him there with a promise that he will be repaid the money he says he is owed if he agrees to go quiet.“I do not think they would kill me,” he said. “It would be catastrophic for them if they kill me in Europe, but I am scared of someone being paid to murder me”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/mohamed-ali-egyptian-exile-in-shock-over-street-protest-arrests
Franco's remains to finally leave Spain's Valley of the Fallen,Dictator’s tomb to be opened and coffin taken to cemetery near Madrid on Thursday,Sam Jones,2019-10-23T12:04:36+0100,"Spain’s socialist government is finally to fulfil one of its key promises when the remains of General Franco are exhumed from the austere splendour of the Valley of the Fallen and transferred to his family mausoleum outside Madrid.If all goes to plan, the 1.5-tonne slab that has covered the dictator’s tomb will be lifted at 10.30am on Thursday and the coffin removed and flown by helicopter or taken by road to Mingorrubio-El Pardo municipal cemetery.Franco’s remains have had pride of place in the basilica, which is 40 miles (64km) north-west of Madrid, since his death in 1975.Although the Valley of the Fallen and its 150-metre (490ft) cross ostensibly commemorate all those killed in the Spanish civil war, for many people, it serves only to glorify Franco and his four-decade dictatorship.The government said the dictator’s remains needed to be moved as they could no longer “remain in a public mausoleum that exalts his figure”, adding that the removal would “symbolically close the circle of Spanish democracy”.The move has been bitterly opposed by the Franco family, the foundation that bears his name, and the Benedictine abbot who presides over the basilica.But after months of appeals and legal arguments, Spain’s supreme court gave permission for the exhumation at the end of September.On Thursday morning, 22 members of the Franco family will gather in the basilica, along with Spain’s justice minister, Dolores Delgado, in her role as first notary of the kingdom.A canopy has been erected to cover the grave and guard against any attempts to film the exhumation. Those present will be checked for electronic devices to make sure there are no images or sound recordings of the exhumation.Last Saturday, a journalist dressed as a monk and equipped with a climbing harness was arrested at the valley, allegedly while trying to gain access to the site to set up cameras.Once the heavy slab has been lifted using hydraulic jacks, the wooden coffin will be inspected to see how well it has endured 44 years of burial and checked for possible water damage. The coffin was surrounded with lead and concrete to protect it against underground streams.Franco’s body is further protected by a zinc box within the coffin, which is expected to be in good condition. If necessary, the zinc box containing the remains will be placed in a new coffin.The exhumation phase could take between one and three hours, after which the remains will be blessed by the prior, Santiago Cantera, and the coffin carried out of the basilica by family members.If flying conditions are suitable, an air force helicopter will transport the body, Delgado and one Franco family member to Mingorrubio-El Pardo cemetery, a 15-minute flight from the valley. Airspace over the route will be closed to traffic and drones.If it is too foggy or windy, the coffin will be driven in a hearse, which could take 40 minutes.A private family service will be held inside the Franco mausoleum, where the dictator’s widow, Carmen Polo, was buried after her death in 1988. At the family’s request, mass will be said by Ramón Tejero.The priest is the son of Antonio Tejero, the Guardia Civil lieutenant colonel who led the failed 1981 military coup that sought to seize control of the country after its return to democracy following Franco’s death.According to the government, the exhumation and reinterment will cost about €63,000 (£54,000).Twelve years ago, the previous socialist government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero introduced the historical memory law, which sought to help the country come to terms with its past and assist people in finding and exhuming the bodies of relatives killed in the civil war.About 100,000 victims of the conflict are thought to lie in the unmarked graves where they were buried during the conflict. Spain is believed to have more mass graves than any country except Cambodia.The Valley of the Fallen, partly built by the forced labour of political prisoners, is Spain’s largest mass grave and holds the bodies of more than 33,000 people from both sides of the civil war.In July last year, the Spanish government announced plans to establish a truth commission to investigate crimes against humanity committed by the Franco regime.The government, led by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said it would compile a census of the victims of the civil war and the ensuing dictatorship, and also open an estimated 1,200 mass graves.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/francos-remains-to-finally-leave-spains-valley-of-the-fallen
The future of Durban: is this South Africa's most inclusive public space?,"The Indian Ocean beachfront, the restaurant strip of Florida Road and the market at Warwick offer three very different models for the future of South Africa’s third largest city",,2019-10-23T12:00:40+0100,"It’s an early start on Durban’s beachfront Golden Mile. By 6am the surfers have arrived, followed by the runners and their dogs, then executives-cum-cyclists, speed walkers and yoga instructors. By 7am the cafes are open for breakfast and children, on holiday from inland schools, are already in the water.Where fellow oceanside metropolis Cape Town has marketed itself to the world, Durban has positioned itself as South Africa’s playground. Beachfront theme parks and twirling public waterslides attract families from around the country, and all walks of life. This accessibility and affordability have made this eight-kilometre strip arguably one of South Africa’s most inclusive public spaces.When the end of apartheid saw white flight from the city centre to the northern suburbs, the beach fell on hard timesBeyond the narrow strip of beach and promenade, though, South Africa’s third largest city struggles with the same problems as the rest of the country: 25 years after the fall of apartheid the city which was divided by race remains divided by economics.But it is setting out to address those issues with several new models of growth – the waterfront, a privately funded development of restaurants and retail along Florida Road, and the redesign of the traditional market at Warwick Triangle.Each embodies a different theory of how Durban can best become a more inclusive city – and each has its defenders and detractors.Beaches were once contested spaces in South Africa. During apartheid, white South Africans, who made up 22% of Durban’s population, had exclusive access to more than two kilometres of prime coastline, whereas black South Africans, who made up 46% of the urban population, were limited to just 650m.“Clearly the beach in Durban was seen as the playground for white South Africans,” says former city manager Michael Sutcliffe. As a member of the United Democratic Front, Sutcliffe led protests to integrate Durban’s beaches in the late 1980s.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope. Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town's spectacular beaches and trendy cafes.Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the ""other Soweto"", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.Nick Van MeadBut when the end of apartheid saw white flight from the city centre to the northern suburbs, the beach fell on hard times. Prime real estate overlooking the port was abandoned and illegally occupied, the city’s pastel-coloured art-deco buildings became derelict as landlords neglected them and bylaws were trampled on. The beach, particularly popular South Beach, became a crime hotspot and few dared to be caught there before sunrise or after dark.The real turnaround came in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup, when as a host city Durban had to rethink its image. Along with the repaved promenade and formalised flea markets, came the Moses Mabhida stadium, within walking distance of the beachfront.Durban officials were accused of exacerbating inequality by prioritising entertainment over basic necessities like running water and safe housing in the townships miles away from the tourist hotspots. Still, despite being briefly embroiled in a spending scandal and with a “Mike-is-right” style of leadership that antagonised some fellow councillors, Sutcliffe is credited with revitalising the promenade.Except for one sign that eluded post-apartheid painters, Durban’s beachfront now resembles an idyllic melting pot of South African cultures. On Christmas Day and New Year’s Day, in particular, the beach is so crowded with people who a generation ago were not allowed on the sand that it could be read as an annual defiance to the country’s old laws.The project is still ongoing. A decade ago, the Point Road area near Durban’s docks was known for derelict buildings and illegal prostitution. Now, artists impressions of what the area could look like in the next 10 years imagine glistening skyscrapers reflecting the Indian Ocean, alongside a mixed development of luxury apartments, retail, business zones and tourist hotspots.The development will link the promenade to the port, extending the Golden Mile into a project that hopes to rival Cape Town’s V&A Waterfront. A joint venture between the eThekwini Municipality and Malaysian developers UEM Sunrise, the project is reported to cost R35bn (£1.8bn) and will be overseen by the national government, in part to avoid corruption scandals that have overshadowed Durban.As a model for inclusivity, it has one major downside: the beaches along the northern suburbs are now an enclave for middle class and wealthier Durbanites, particularly moneyed black tourists who prefer the warmer Indian Ocean to Cape Town’s icy Atlantic. What’s more, despite its plans for mixed-income development, the new Point Road project looks likely to exclude the largely black, working class communities who have kept Durban’s city centre alive.A second approach is taking place at what is arguably Durban’s most successful regeneration project, Florida Road, a trendy thoroughfare just over a mile from the beachfront. A project by London-based developer Urban Lime hopes tourists and especially locals will linger in the courtyards that mix the Victorian and Edwardian facades of this historic neighbourhood with trendy boutiques and restaurants of the so-called new South Africa.Previously a street of churches, retirement homes and an unassuming supermarket, the Florida Road turnaround began when Urban Lime bought a parking lot, and transformed it into a retail and outdoor entertainment space. Unusual in a city traumatised by crime, the strip is designed to encourage walking, and by day a row of dessert spots welcome a family-conscious community, many of them devout Muslims. It offers mixed price options: a taco spot and Afro’s Chicken Shop, a local favourite, are affordable easy dining, with more fine-dining restaurants further along the street.The developer works with local residents’ associations to employ a private security company that patrols the privately owned public spaces, and Urban Lime has expanded aggressively, accumulating around 200,000 sq m of retail space since 2014 and spending R1.2bn.Recognising the inner-city’s cash-driven economy, Urban Lime has moved into the city centre, where it has subdivided retail space to allow small traders to rent for as little as R1,500 a month for several square metres. They’ve taken over the iconic Durban Club Chambers, a downtown high-rise that houses the city’s legal fraternity and was once the offices of one of the country’s first black lawyers and founding member of the ANC Pixley ka Isaka Seme. They plan to turn part of the block into a pedestrian zone in an attempt to coax the advocates who work in the city to spend more time in central Durban.The company’s managing director, Nad Shahid, explains a grand plan of 16 nodes that will reconnect the suburbs to the inner-city and eventually back to the beach. Centred on a refurbished building or district, these nodes revitalise the area block by block with small to medium-sized retail, restaurants and office space, bringing traffic back to abandoned spaces and helping Durban combine the commercial drive of Johannesburg with the oceanside lifestyle of Cape Town.“It has potential to be a huge business city and it also has the potential to be a huge lifestyle-stroke-tourist city as well,” says Urban Lime CEO Jonny Friedman. “But the city needs to do things. In my opinion it’s the psychological and physical links between north and south.”But, this sort of development is also synonymous with gentrification around the world. On Florida Road, it has meant higher rents and some angry tenants, most notably the owner of the restaurant Spiga, Marco Santoniccolo, who closed down his family eatery after nearly 17 years on Florida Road after rents climbed. Since reopening around the corner on Innes road, though, Santoniccolo has made peace with the changes and even welcomes the developments.Durban city centre may have been abandoned by some landlords and starved of services in the 1990s and 2000s but is neither a ghost town nor a crime-ridden chaos. It is home to many working-class black South Africans who have moved from townships and villages around the province of KwaZulu-Natal.Built over a transit hub that links minibus taxis and trains, Warwick Market offers everything from fresh vegetables to dried medicinal herbs. Among rows of wild spinach and sweet potatoes is a butchery that sells fresh offal and fish. There are stalls specialising in the uniform of the Zionist Christian Church, and others that will type a CV for R7. One sells DVDs of popular mbaqanga music artists; a herbalist offers a mixture that will “help you find love”.It represents a third option: a more natural, bottom-up development that embraces all Durbanites, not just those who can afford to eat in the fancier restaurants of Florida Road or tourists paying for expensive beachfront hotels. The market largely caters to the residents who were willing to put up with Durban’s inner-city decay because they had no better option.Warwick market’s survival is testament to a moment of euphoria in post-apartheid South Africa in which officials, corporates and informal traders were willing to reconfigure the segregated city in the 1990s, explains Richard Dobson of Asiye eTafuleni (meaning ‘let’s go to the table’), a non-profit that represents the voices of informal traders in urban planning.This model was put to the test during Durban’s revamp as a so-called “world class city” fit for the World Cup, when the historic market faced demolition to make space for a shopping mall. It was ultimately saved by mass demonstrations, when thousands of vendors rallied together, forcing the city to rethink its development plan and improve the junction for people who already lived there.Dobson says the market functions well, with a turnover in the order of millions of pounds. It is vendors who keep the area safe and clean, not police or city workers.In many ways Warwick represents the kind of community buy-in and local participation that is only now beginning to occur on the beachfront, and has yet to occur in the city that lies right behind it. So, will Durban ever become a fully inclusive city?“You don’t do it by thinking that by putting black people living next to white people suddenly the white people are going to change,” says Sutcliffe, the former city manager. “That’s not going to happen. And it hasn’t happened. I think that all the evidence shows that kind of integration will take generations.”Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

"Cyntoia Brown: trafficked, enslaved, jailed for life at 16 – and fighting back",She was still a teenager when she was sold into sexual slavery and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. Now Cyntoia Brown-Long hopes her new memoir will highlight the flaws in the US justice system that failed her so badly,Kate Hodal,2019-10-23T11:30:17+0100,"Cyntoia Brown-Long was just 16 when she was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a man she claims bought her for sex. The homeless runaway had been in and out of the juvenile justice system, survived multiple rapes and assaults and was forced into sex slavery by her then-boyfriend, a pimp known as Kut Throat, who regularly sold her for drug money.Yet few details of Brown-Long’s troubled childhood were heard by the Tennessee court in 2004, which instead repeatedly described her as a “teen prostitute” and tried her as an adult. Today, 15 years on and just months after her life sentence was commuted by the state governor, Brown-Long has rewritten the narrative behind her incarceration – and her past – in a memoir she began while still in prison.“I want it to put a face to the justice system,” says Brown-Long by phone from Nashville of her book, Free Cyntoia: My Search for Redemption in the American Prison System, published last week.“I hope it will make people see things from my point of view and help them open their eyes about what really goes on behind the news stories and the court cases. A lot of people in the system get lost behind case numbers – and some of their sentences are completely outrageous.”Brown-Long knows that her case was unique. After more than a decade in prison, where she would eventually obtain two university degrees, find God and get married (she tied the knot with Christian hip-hop artist Jamie Long over the phone while still incarcerated), she appealed for clemency. The petition went viral after celebrities including Rihanna, LeBron James and Kim Kardashian West took to social media to condemn her life sentence.The outcry helped spark a national debate about child trafficking and the failure of the US juvenile justice system to identify and support at-risk youth. It also prompted Tennessee to re-examine its own unusually harsh juvenile sentencing laws, which require under-18s convicted of first-degree murder to face 51 years behind bars before a chance of parole. Before her petition for clemency was granted, Brown-Long would not have been eligible for parole until she was 69.Now that she is free, Brown-Long is setting up a non-profit, the Foundation for Justice, Freedom and Mercy, to help speak on behalf of “all the other Cyntoias who are still locked up”. Her goal is to advocate for legislation that would change, in particular, how juveniles are sentenced.“It’s important for me that I speak in a way that gives them back their voices. All of a sudden, they’re known for the worst thing that they’ve ever done – and that seems to be all that anybody can see,” she says.“The biggest issue right now with prison reform is convincing people that there needs to be reform. They think this whole ‘tough on crime’ thing is the way to go. But I see it different. What does it mean if we show mercy to people and cultivate that in the prison system instead?”Brown-Long goes into detail in her memoir about the circumstances leading up to her own incarceration: born to a mother who drank throughout her pregnancy; a childhood spent in and out of juvenile facilities; years racked by drug and sex abuse.I never got to apologise to my victim’s mother. She would die before I had the chance.At 16, she met 24-year-old Garion McGlothen, who went by the name Kut Throat, with whom she was living in motels around Nashville and snorting cocaine every day. He would send her out to have sex with men and would beat and rape her if she didn’t come back with cash, she claims.“He would explain to me that some people were born whores, and that I was one, and I was a slut, and nobody’d want me but him, and the best thing I could do was just learn to be a good whore,” Brown-Long said at a parole hearing.It was within this context that she was picked up at a fast-food restaurant in August 2004 by 43-year-old estate agent Johnny Allen, who Brown-Long claims offered to buy her snacks and pay $150 (£117) for sex. Back at his house, Allen began showing her his gun collection, which made her fear for her life, Brown-Long says. She claims she later shot him in self-defence. However, police found Allen nude in bed with a gunshot wound to the back of his head, his hands underneath his head as if he were sleeping.Police charged Brown-Long with first-degree murder and robbery – as evidence later showed that she stole his truck, wallet and guns – but Brown-Long has always maintained that she didn’t shoot him to rob him.It was while studying for her degree in prison that Brown-Long came across a term she’d never heard of – sex trafficking – which made her rethink her own experiences.“I thought to myself, why am I only just now finding out that there’s no such thing as a teen prostitute? Why are teenagers who are trafficked like [I was] being exploited and taken advantage of, but society has just been telling us we’re bad, that we’re promiscuous?“That was when I really realised we need to start educating one another about what’s happening to young girls, not talking about waist trainers and contouring and how to be desirable to men. That was one of the direct reasons why I found myself in a hotel room with a man who trained me to do just that. It took me 10 years to come to grips with the fact I was actually a victim of trafficking.”Brown-Long now spends her days doing community service and mentoring at-risk girls on the importance of boundaries and the real dangers of social media.“I speak to them about what led up to me being in that [trafficking] situation and how it’s not about some guy picking you up off the street corner and holding a gun to your head and making you do certain things,” says Brown-Long.“Being young, caring and so impressionable can make us more vulnerable. And social media is so dangerous now in the way that it commodifies women and glamorises breaking your back to appear beautiful to people and killing yourself for likes and follows. We have to have conversations about how that can make us vulnerable and how to protect ourselves from that as women through healthier thinking patterns.”Brown-Long has publicly apologised since her release from prison to the family of the man she killed, and describes in her memoir the guilt she felt at not telling his mother she was sorry at the time – advice that she was given by her lawyer out of fear it would “tank her case”.“I realised [then] how truly messed up the system was,” Brown-Long wrote.“Don’t we want people to feel remorse, to swallow their pride and reach out to the person they hurt? There’s no room in the criminal justice system, not the way it’s set up today. I never got to apologise to my victim’s mother. She would die before I had the chance.”Free Cyntoia: My Search for Redemption in the American Prison System, by Cyntoia Brown-Long, is published by Simon & Schuster, £18.99",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/cyntoia-brown-long-trafficked-enslaved-jailed-for-life-at-16-and-fighting-back
Will loyalists turn against Trump after Bill Taylor’s game-changing testimony?,Diplomat added significant ballast to the allegation Trump was trying to extort Ukraine into ginning up bad news about Biden,Tom McCarthy,2019-10-23T16:46:51+0100,"The impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump has heard some extraordinary testimony over the last month. From the first mention of Trump’s desired “deliverable” from Ukraine, successive layers of witnesses and documents have added to an indictment of the president’s conduct that only gets heavier, as Trump howls his defenses to the wind.On Tuesday, things got even worse for Trump – much worse, as many saw it.For almost 10 hours, William Taylor, a former military officer and career diplomat with the rank of ambassador under the last four presidents, spoke with congressional investigators about how the Trump administration has been conducting a two-track foreign policy in Ukraine, where Taylor is in charge of the US embassy.We don’t yet know most of what was said. The current public record of the closed-door testimony comprises only a copy of Taylor’s 15-page opening statement – and the spectacle of the ashen faces of members of Congress as they filed out from the hearing.“This testimony is a sea change,” congressman Stephen Lynch told reporters.In his testimony, Taylor explained his discovery of an “irregular, informal policy channel” by which the Trump administration was pursuing objectives in Ukraine “running contrary to the goals of longstanding US policy”. What the “informal channel” wanted – and briefly obtained, Taylor said – was for the Ukrainian president to agree to go on CNN to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, whom Trump sees, perhaps mistakenly, as a top 2020 threat.The Trump administration held up “much-needed military assistance” to Ukraine in an effort to extract the Ukrainian statement, Taylor said. “More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the US assistance,” he noted.In a process scrambled so far by misleading Trump tweets and relying in part on anonymous witnesses, the testimony of Taylor, a Vietnam veteran respected in both parties with 50 years of public service behind him, landed as a potential game-changer. It was just the kind of testimony that seemed to answer even the most stubborn demands of Trump loyalists such as Senator Lindsey Graham for additional, definitive proof that Trump was turning the broad power of his office to his own narrow devices.“If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,” Graham said at the weekend.The senator denied in a Fox News appearance Tuesday that Taylor had delivered such evidence. But Taylor added significant ballast to the allegation that Trump was attempting to extort Ukraine into ginning up bad news about Biden.What Taylor added was a careful stitchwork of detail, describing who was working to extort the Ukrainians, how they were going about it, how their aims clashed with stated US policy, how the Ukrainians responded, and what people said to him about it at the time.Taylor made clear he has the memos and other records to back up his story. And he exposed the slapstick clumsiness of the Trump flunkies working the “informal channel” – notably Gordon Sondland, the hotelier and Trump mega-donor turned ambassador.“Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman,” Taylor testified. “When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.”But “the explanation made no sense”, Taylor argued. “The Ukrainians did not ‘owe’ President Trump anything, and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was ‘crazy’.”Reaction to Taylor’s testimony generally fell between shock and dumbfoundedness. “I cannot overstate how damaging this Ambassador Taylor testimony is to Trump,” tweeted Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general.“Taylor’s statement is a completely devastating document,” wrote Susan Hennessey, the executive director of the Lawfare site. “I know they will find a way but it’s just impossible to imagine how Republicans in Congress will be able to defend this. It is well beyond what most assumed was the worst-case scenario.”The White House issued a statement Tuesday night impugning Taylor, a Trump appointee, as part of a cadre of “radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the constitution”. But the taller the evidence against him, the smaller Trump’s protests seemed.Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, a presidential candidate, challenged Republicans to take a stand. “After Diplomat Taylor’s testimony you can no longer question whether this happened,” she tweeted. “The question is if you choose to follow the law or be part of the cover-up.”Trump huddled Tuesday night with members of his legal team, the Wall Street Journal reported, and he urged congressional Republicans to do more to rebut the impeachment inquiry. But there were reportedly no talking points, and no one knew quite what they were supposed to say, or whom to take that direction from.Notably absent from the meeting of Trump’s advisors was Rudy Giuliani, whom Taylor describes as running the shadow operation in Ukraine. “The official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr Giuliani,” Taylor said. He described a seemingly free hand for Giuliani, whose foreign clients include or have included Ukraine-based antagonists of current and former US officials, to open and close diplomatic channels and to direct US policy as he pleased.One of the weightiest impacts of Taylor’s testimony might have to do with the senior US officials it names. Taylor took his concerns about Trump’s alleged attempt to extort Ukraine, he said, to both national security adviser John Bolton and to secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Bolton, who has since resigned, reacted with outrage and frustration.Pompeo, who is eyeing a US Senate bid in his home state of Kansas, apparently greeted Taylor’s warning with silence.“This is not the story of corruption in Ukraine,” tweeted the political strategist David Axelrod. “It’s the story of corruption at the highest levels of the US government. It’s the story of extortion, with US military aid to a besieged ally held hostage to the president’s personal political project.”Trump’s critics say the story is plain: that the president twisted the immense powers of his office to personal ends, in betrayal of constitution and country. When it comes time to prove it, Taylor’s testimony is likely to be front and center.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/trump-bill-taylor-testimony-republicans-impeachment-inquiry
The Essex lorry deaths throw up so many questions. It’s vital we ask the right ones,"This horrific event was not caused by lax border controls but by governments that force the most vulnerable to risk their lives, writes author Daniel Trilling",Daniel Trilling,2019-10-23T16:45:51+0100,"There are several ways a person who doesn’t want to be found can conceal themselves in a lorry. If you are able-bodied and strong enough, you can crawl between the wheel-axles and the base, and hang on for as long as your arms hold out. If not, you can try to cram yourself into the tiny storage box that sits between the wheels, a feat of contortion as well as endurance. Or, if you have the means, you can unlock and climb inside the main container, which may or may not be airtight. You do these things because you want to cross an international border you do not have permission to cross.Every so often, as with today’s news that 39 people have been found dead in a lorry in Essex, the risks of this mode of transport become impossible to ignore. I have met people who have travelled by all these means, and all of them were taking a leap into the unknown. Jamal, a young man from Sudan who spent time in Calais, kept hiding underneath lorries he thought were bound for Britain then having to jump off on the motorways of France and Belgium when they turned out to be heading elsewhere. A Kurdish man I know who made his way from Iran to Europe a decade ago had to watch the smugglers who offered him safe passage beat up other travellers, and wonder if they would do the same to him. Zainab, an Iraqi mother of three, climbed into a refrigerated lorry with her children one night in France in the autumn of 2014, expecting the driver to set off for the Channel. Instead, he remained parked and switched off the ventilation. The police arrived just as other passengers began to suffocate.The 38 adults and one teenager whose bodies were discovered today have yet to be identified and concrete details of their journey are still emerging, though it appears that the lorry came from Bulgaria. It echoes other similar incidents: the 58 men and women found dead in a lorry at Dover in 2000; the 71 decomposing bodies abandoned in a lorry at the side of a motorway in Austria in 2015; or the 35 men, women and children discovered in a shipping container at Tilbury Docks in 2014, suffering from hypothermia and severe dehydration.Our immediate reaction is usually shock, and a desire to prevent things like this from happening again. A kneejerk response is to demand tougher controls: more security infrastructure at the borders; tougher punishments for the people who try to make these journeys and those who facilitate them. Yet such disasters do not happen because of a lack of border control – they are the price of it. The illusion our politicians perpetuate, or buy into, is that migration can be switched on and off like a tap, according to the wishes of voters or the demands of the economy. It can be shaped, for sure: states can offer people incentives to move, or they can put bureaucratic or physical obstacles in people’s way to make it less likely. But, as is painfully apparent in so many parts of the world right now, there will always be people who feel compelled to travel even when the risks are deadly. Tougher controls push people to more dangerous routes, and to place their lives in the hands of smugglers who may be indifferent to their safety or actively looking to exploit them.If these people were refugees, why were they unable to access their rights elsewhere in Europe?The situation at Calais, now two decades old, is a case in point. As debates over the Brexit referendum in 2016 reached fever pitch, images of people gathered at the French port were used as evidence of lax border control. In fact they were evidence of the opposite: it’s precisely because the UK has made it so tough to cross the Channel that people get trapped elsewhere – or, as has recently become more common, attempting their own perilous boat journeys from the French coast. Britain did not experience a “refugee crisis” in the way that other parts of Europe did: in 2015, as asylum applications rose across Europe as a whole, the UK’s share of applications actually fell. This is why it’s crucial not to let shock and panic lead us into making decisions that will make life harder for the very people we may wish to protect.Important questions are being asked about the deaths of the people discovered in Essex: who is responsible, and how could this be prevented in future? Essex police have opened a murder investigation and arrested the driver of the lorry. The National Crime Agency has said it is working to identify any organised criminal groups that may be involved. But there are a series of other questions we should also be asking. The first is why people would want to travel in that manner at all: what was pushing them to leave their homes, and why were they unwilling to stop elsewhere? If there were refugees among the dead, why were they unable to access their rights elsewhere in Europe? Were there people among them who had the right to be in the UK, but could not get here via legal routes because the British government was dragging its feet – as it has done with hundreds of lone children stranded in Europe?And if they weren’t refugees, what motivated them to travel this way in search of work? A major new study by the United Nations development programme illustrates how complex the answers can be: in interviews with nearly 2,000 people from Africa who travelled to Europe for work, via some of the world’s deadliest migration routes, more than 90% said they would do it again. In the most part, they were not suffering abject poverty, but had experienced inequality and injustice, and wanted more from their lives.By asking these questions, we recognise that the people who suffer at our borders are not simply passive victims, but individuals making decisions and trying to retain control of their lives. Only then will we stop treating this issue as a problem to be ignored or suppressed, and start to talk about how we might reorganise our system around people’s needs.• Daniel Trilling is editor of the New Humanist and author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/essex-lorry-borders-governments
Masters of war: architects of modern conflicts say cheese for the camera,"Image captures warm moment between Henry Kissinger, Tony Blair, Narendra Modi, Condoleezza Rice, Robert Gates and John Howard",Julian Borger,2019-10-23T16:41:14+0100,"If the horsemen of the apocalypse ever hung up their riding boots, this could be a photo of the retirement party. Five men and a woman of very different backgrounds and different continents, brought together by an investment bank and shared history of mayhem.The smiles and hand-holding in the group photo at the JP Morgan International Council in New Delhi are redolent of fond memories and fellow feeling. They have nearly a half-millennium between them, and no end of war stories to share, tales of pressing the buttons and pulling the levers behind some of major conflicts of modern times.The dean of the bunch is sitting low in his seat on the right: Henry Kissinger, the 96-year-old living embodiment of cold war realpolitik with a wealth of foreign policy knowledge and major wars to his name, including the undeclared, illegal mass bombing of Cambodia.Standing in the rear are three of the leading minds behind the 2003 Iraq invasion. With his trademark tan and grin, the former British prime minister Tony Blair is at the left, next to Condoleezza Rice, who was George Bush’s national security adviser at the time. Over to their right is John Howard who, as Australian leader at the time, sent his country’s troops into the fray.The latter-day crusade in pursuit of Saddam Hussein’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction was one of the most disastrous mistakes in history, unleashing a cascade of violence that killed well over half a million people and ushered in an era of extreme violence in the Middle East that continues today.The fact they are still feted as foreign policy sages suggests that once you reach a certain level in global diplomacy, you can only fail upwards.In among the trio is Robert Gates, former CIA director and defence secretary, who sat the Iraq war out but as deputy director of the CIA did advocate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua.Moments with Mr. Kissinger, former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and John Howard, Ms. Condoleezza Rice and Mr. Robert Gates. Excellent discussions with these global thought leaders. pic.twitter.com/OPBheNkpPeAt the centre and focal point of the little group is its newest member, Narendra Modi. The Indian prime minister is the only one among them still doing the day job, but may be being inducted early for moving troops into Kashmir, revoking its autonomous status and rounding up Muslims, even at the risk of nuclear war with Pakistan.In the photo, Modi is the benign host, grasping hands with Blair and Howard, while gazing amicably at Kissinger, apparently forgiving the elder statesman for his determined support for the Pakistani dictatorship even though its army killed at least 300,000 mostly Hindu Bengalis in what is now Bangladesh and forced 10 million to flee to India. On the notorious Nixon tapes, Kissinger can be heard referring the Indians as “such bastards” and calling Indira Gandhi a “bitch”.“If Modi wanted to get huffy, he would have material,” said Gary Bass, author of Blood Telegram, a book on the genocide and Nixon and Kissinger’s role in it.There is no sign of huffiness at the JP Morgan bash. The fact that when Blair and Rice were in office, their governments imposed travel bans on Modi after anti-Muslim rioting killed a thousand people under his watch has also been consigned to the past.It may be that once you rise to the top level of such grand strategy, it no longer matters what side you were on or who you killed. They all add to the mileage on your platinum card.

Albanian police say Iranian 'terror cell' planned to attack exiles,Paramilitary network allegedly targeted members of MEK in Albania,,2019-10-23T16:31:48+0100,"Albanian police say they have discovered an Iranian paramilitary network that allegedly planned attacks in Albania against exiled members of an Iranian group that is seeking to overthrow the government in Tehran.The country’s police chief, Ardi Veliu, said the foreign wing of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards operated an “active terrorist cell” targeting members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK, in Albania.He did not say what the alleged plot involved or whether any arrests were made.A police statement alleged that two Iranian security officials led the cell from Tehran. It said the network was allegedly linked to organised crime groups in Turkey and used a former MEK member to collect information in Albania.Veliu said a planned attack on the group in Albania by Iranian government agents was foiled in March.Last year Albania expelled Iran’s ambassador and another Iranian diplomat over alleged illegal activities threatening Albania’s security.MEK is outlawed in Iran and was listed as a terrorist organisation by the US state department until 2012.

The Pilgrim’s Progress review – tiring trudge to the Celestial City,This animated adaptation of Bunyan’s 17th-century religious allegory features some scary demons but the rest is pretty tame,Cath Clarke,2019-10-23T16:00:37+0100,"Pity the poor year-nine students who henceforth will be plonked in front of this plodding, sanctimonious animation of John Bunyan’s 1678 religious allegory as “a treat” in RE class. The film’s animation is reminiscent of an aircraft safety video, with characters moving stiffly while delivering the dialogue in awkward, am-dram style.It begins promisingly in the City of Destruction, a vividly animated inferno where citizens toil at backbreaking work. After one of them goes missing, leaving behind a house full of visionary sketches and a book about the Celestial City, Christian Pilgrim (voiced by Ben Price) follows him into the unknown, abandoning his family. First stop on his journey is the Swamp of Despair. At Vanity Fair he must resist the temptations of the flesh – painted ladies, cakes galore – while at points along the road he is visited by the kindly Evangelist, who looks like Jesus with a Kate Middleton blow dry.If not much else, The Pilgrim’s Progress has got some cracking, genuinely nightmare-inducing demons. Christian goes sword to sword with the devil’s henchman, a winged creature with horns and the pecs of champion bodybuilder. Less interesting is the characterisation of the female giant Diffidence as a battle-axe wife – the kind of pinny-wearing, rolling-pin wielding stereotype that belongs in the 17th century. It also doesn’t help that there is also virtually zero humour, though I did have to suppress a giggle at the road sign for “Passion Passage”.• The Pilgrim’s Progress is released in the UK on 25 October.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/23/the-pilgrims-progress-review-animation-john-bunyan
"Russia has been playing a canny game in the Middle East, but can it continue?","Russia’s deal with Turkey is the latest in a smart power-broking strategy that will soon be tested to its limits, writes Olga Oliker of the International Crisis Group",Olga Oliker,2019-10-23T15:47:09+0100,"Recent events in Syria suggest that Russia isn’t just taking Washington’s place as the Middle East’s power broker – it seems to be doing a more effective job of it, too.The latest evidence came yesterday, when Vladimir Putin held a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. As a US-brokered ceasefire in Syria’s north-east expired, they struck a deal to evacuate the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish-led militia, from a buffer zone near Turkey’s border. Russian and Turkish troops will begin patrols of that area, giving them joint control. But while Russian diplomatic skill is to be commended, America’s loss may yet prove Russia’s headache.Few expected such a turn of events in 2015, when Russia launched a military operation in support of Bashar al-Assad. At the time, the Syrian president was at significant risk of losing control of his country to a disparate assortment of forces: US-backed groups including the YPG; Turkish-backed forces; Islamic State; al-Qaida; and others. Russia had several reasons to back Assad. He was a friend to Moscow, as his father had been before him. The Kremlin was concerned that if he fell, chaos would ensue – or Isis would fill the void. From a geo-strategic perspective, Russia had long opposed US-backed “regime change” interventions and was disinclined to let one more succeed. It was also keen to build influence in the Middle East and show itself to be a reliable partner. And while its involvement was in direct opposition to US efforts, Moscow likely believed that once it had proven itself a force to be reckoned with, it could establish its relevance to the US and cut some kind of arrangement with the Americans on the future of Syria and fight against Isis, thereby further cementing its great-power status and helping rebuild the two countries’ relationship.Russia’s military intervention in Syria had a decisive effect, reversing Assad’s slide. Cooperation with the Americans, however, proved elusive. But while Washington didn’t want to carve up influence and share it, a different dynamic nonetheless emerged. Erratic and shrinking US involvement, together with Moscow’s diplomatic skill, has now left Russia in what might seem an enviable position in Syria and in the region as a whole.All of this has been on display over the past fortnight, since Donald Trump announced the US withdrawal from Syria for the third time in 18 months – this time combined with a tacit green light for Turkey to move into territory in Syria’s north-east controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in which the YPG plays a leading role. Russia, for its part, has brokered a tactical arrangement between the YPG and Assad, supported Assad’s troops as they moved toward the border, kept them and Turkish forces at a distance from one another and,now, struck a deal with Ankara.As Assad consolidates power, his desire to follow Moscow’s lead will likely diminish furtherMaintaining good relations with all sides has been at the centre of Moscow’s Middle East strategy. Unlike the US, which has historically divided the region into friends and enemies, Russia has taken a pragmatic approach. Where it has common interests with a country, it pursues them in cooperation. Where it disagrees, it accepts that each party will do what it can to get what it wants, even as they continue to coordinate on other matters. A lack of interest in criticising other countries for human rights violations (Russia itself is credibly accused of targeting civilians in Syria) rounds out a package bound to appeal to many Middle Eastern governments.As partner to all and ally to few, Moscow has been able to simultaneously protect the Syrian regime, turn a blind eye to Israeli strikes against Iranian assets, and help Israel and Iran avoid accidental clashes. It is also steadily improving its relationship with Saudi Arabia.But while Moscow’s current position in the Middle East appears advantageous, it presents challenges. As Assad consolidates power, his desire to follow Moscow’s lead, already tenuous, will likely diminish further. Russia’s relationship with Ankara does offer some continued leverage over Damascus. So, to an extent, does its pledge to protect the interests and security of the Kurdish community. However, neither Damascus nor Ankara is likely to make any real concessions to the YPG, raising questions of just what Moscow can deliver – and how long it can maintain good relations with all three parties.Looking ahead, Russia’s goals are unchanged. It still desires Assad’s control of a stabilised Syria and global acceptance of his continued rule, as well as guaranteeing its own long-term influence in the region. At the same time, it does not want to maintain a substantial military commitment in Syria, although it will likely seek a base or two.Assad seems well on the way to re-establishing control. But despite the deal with Ankara, stability, and thus Russian withdrawal, will be harder to achieve. Not only is resolution in the north-east far from assured, the northwest, where Idlib remains in jihadist hands, presents an equally complicated Gordian knot. Moreover, the reconstruction that would make peace sustainable requires resources beyond the means of Syria and Russia. International help and support might be more forthcoming if the YPG get a better deal and Idlib is resolved without a bloodbath, but Assad and Moscow will balk at demands for a political transition.Russia’s impressive juggling act in the Middle East, and in Syria in particular, has left it in a powerful position. But by filling the vacuum left by the US, it has had to take on far more responsibility than it may have expected or sought. To date it has managed well, but with few easy choices ahead and Syria in its current state, this may not be an enviable prize.• Olga Oliker directs the Europe and Central Asia programme at International Crisis Group",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/putin-middle-east-russia-turkey-syria
Google claims it has achieved 'quantum supremacy' – but IBM disagrees,"Task that would take most powerful supercomputer 10,000 years ‘completed by quantum machine in minutes’",Ian Sample,2019-10-23T15:29:57+0100,"For Google, it was a historic announcement: a declaration that it had won the race to achieve “quantum supremacy” – the moment that a sophisticated quantum computer performed a task that stumped even the most powerful standard computer in the world.But for all the fanfare, which saw Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, compare the feat to building the first rocket to reach space, the claim has sparked a bunfight. The tech firm’s rival, IBM, was swift to dismiss the excitement. Google has not, it asserts, achieved the highly prized goal of quantum supremacy.Google published its claim in the journal Nature on Wednesday after an earlier report on the work appeared briefly on a Nasa website last month. The paper describes how a team led by John Martinis, leader of the research team working on quantum supremacy, built a superconducting quantum processor named Sycamore that harnesses the weirdness of quantum physics to crunch through thorny problems.To demonstrate the device’s computational prowess, the scientists set it the deeply contrived task of checking the randomness of a sequence of numbers. What the quantum computer rattled through in three minutes and 20 seconds would keep the world’s most powerful supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee busy for 10,000 years, they claim.“This experiment was kind of hard to do,” said Martinis. “When we proposed it in the group, people took a while to understand and get this to work.”But get it to work they did. Writing in the journal, the authors state: “To our knowledge, this experiment marks the first computation that can be performed only on a quantum processor. Quantum processors have thus reached the regime of quantum supremacy.”Not so, say the IBM researchers. In a blogpost written in response to the work, they argue that the Oak Ridge supercomputer could solve the randomness problem in 2.5 days, perhaps less, depending on how it was programmed. They add that because “quantum supremacy” requires a quantum computer to solve a problem that is beyond a classical computer, Google’s claim does not hold up.“Google’s experiment is an excellent demonstration of the progress in superconducting-based quantum computing,” the IBM scientists argue. “But it should not be viewed as proof that quantum computers are ‘supreme’ over classical computers.”Standard computers and quantum computers are radically different. While standard computers perform calculations with “bits”, which must be either 0 or 1, quantum computers have “qubits” that can take any value between 0 and 1. Another quirk of quantum physics allows qubits to be “entangled” such that the value of one is tied to the values of those around it. Make a quantum computer that is stable enough – a tough enough feat in itself – and it can, in principle, explore multiple solutions to a problem at once.Since the advent of the first experimental qubits, tech firms have been racing to demonstrate what the US physicist John Preskill dubbed “quantum supremacy”. Preskill coined the phrase to define the turning point in computing history when quantum computers showed their true potential by trouncing standard machines.Google’s Sycamore processor used 53 qubits to plough through the arcane task its masters gave it. According to Pichai, the breakthrough is a step towards using quantum computers to solve real-world problems, such as creating new drugs, designing more efficient batteries, and making fertilisers with less energy. “We’ve already peeled away from classical computers, on to a totally different trajectory,” a Google spokesperson said.Asked about IBM’s reaction to the achievement, Sergio Boixo on the Google team said: “It’s very important to test the proposals on real supercomputers, because things don’t always work as expected.” Martinis added: “We’re looking forward to having them look at our data and validate our results some more.”Christopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland and co-founder of the quantum computing startup IonQ, said Google’s paper might be a milestone in quantum computing, but it was an academic one. “The problem is not likely to be useful for anything, except showing something that appears to be really hard using normal computers,” he said.But work towards useful quantum computers was “marching along”, Monroe added, saying the devices were likely to help solve a raft of problems, from logistics to understanding the structures of large molecules. “Problems like this can only be solved on a quantum computer,” he said.Steve Brierley, CEO of the Cambridge-based quantum software company Riverlane, said: “It’s clearly an amazing achievement. I think this is going to be one of those moments when people look back and say, ‘That was the time that really changed this field of quantum computing.’ It is also a great moment in time to stop talking about quantum supremacy, which has unfortunate historical connotations, and move on to talking about quantum advantage, which has a useful application.”In an accompanying article in Nature, William Oliver, a physicist at MIT, compares Google’s achievement to the first flights of the Wright brothers. The Wright Flyer was not the first airborne vehicle to fly, nor did it solve any pressing problem, but it demonstrated a radical new possibility, the implications of which became clear only decades later. “It is what the event represented, rather than what it practically accomplished, that was paramount. And so it is with this first report of quantum computational supremacy,” Oliver said.Computer scientists have some formidable hurdles to overcome to make quantum computers useful and commonplace. But with tech firms investing heavily – about $1bn (£780m) to date, with more in the pipeline – many researchers are now confident that rudimentary devices will be put to good use, in combination with standard computers, in the next decade or so.Quantum computers lend themselves to problems that are essentially too demanding for classical computers to take on. One area where scientists expect them to make an impact is in drug discovery. In the search for new medicines, pharmaceutical companies call on computers to trawl through the structures of scores of molecules to see which might bind to biological molecules and have some useful action in the body. Quantum computers should run these searches much faster by analysing whole libraries of molecules at a time and identifying the most promising drug candidates.Several startups see quantum computers as a means to design radically new materials, including better batteries, by modelling the quantum behaviour of the subatomic particles inside them.Another area where the processing capability of quantum computers could prove itself is weather forecasting. The science and art of forecasting have steadily improved with greater computing power, but quantum computers could mean a step change in accuracy. The problem with the weather is that it is so complex that in the time it takes a standard computer to produce an accurate forecast, the weather has already happened.Inevitably, quantum computers will also be used for financial modelling, where a huge number of variables dictate the movements of markets.The arrival of quantum computers might not please everyone. Sophisticated devices could in principle crack encryption that is invulnerable to standard computers. But that would take machines with 100m qubits, nearly two million times as many as Google’s processor.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/google-claims-it-has-achieved-quantum-supremacy-but-ibm-disagrees
Republicans are finally realising Trump is his own worst enemy – and theirs,The president’s increasingly risible attempts to paint himself as a victim are alienating even his most loyal supporters,Richard Wolffe,2019-10-23T14:10:50+0100,"There was a time, not so long ago, when it was widely considered suicidal for an American politician to pay hush money to porn stars, cosy up to Russian leaders, or use national security dollars to buy foreign interference at election time.In those quaint days of yore, an experienced politician might have steered well clear of anything that smacked of being on the wrong side of civil rights.At some point over the last generation, even the conservatives who hate today’s civil rights came to love yesterday’s civil rights. Martin Luther King Jr was no longer a Commie revolutionary but a beloved national icon. Segregation and the Klan’s reign of terror was as obviously, stunningly immoral as Nazism.Until today, and until Donald Trump. You may not have known this, but Trump is himself a victim, no different from the poor souls who were publicly tortured and murdered by the Klan and its mobs. Despite his German roots, and his family’s business history of race discrimination, Trump thinks he’s suffering just as much.“So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,” tweeted the president who has no recollection of a predecessor called Bill Clinton.“All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here – a lynching. But we will WIN!”Trump is strange, but he’s not a strange fruit. And so it came to pass that the only people who can stop Trump’s conviction at his forthcoming impeachment trial were forced to spend the day talking about lynching.To do so, you need to suspend a little reality and a lot of self-respect. You need to become a human shell that blurts out words with no meaning, that sparks thoughts with no intelligence. To wit: one Hogan Gidley, who holds the hallucinatory role of deputy press secretary in Trump’s West Wing.“The president’s not comparing what’s happened to him with one of our darkest moments in American history. He’s just not,” Gidley told reporters, ignoring Exhibit A in the day’s proceedings: the president’s tweet that did just that.“I understand there are many people in the media who don’t agree with his language. He has used many words to describe the way he has been relentlessly attacked.”He has indeed used so many words, to such remarkable effect. Much like the hapless Hogan himself. They flow like endless rain into a paper cup.As a defence of the president’s position, Hogan’s explanation is the equivalent of going back to bed to pull the covers over your head. There’s a reason why there are no White House press briefings any more: because you literally can’t make sense of the boss without getting fired, indicted, or shamed into permanent unemployment.Other Republicans not employed by the White House found it easier to express what they thought. Both Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, said they disagreed with Trump’s choice of words.Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, went even further by saying that Trump should retract his comments immediately. “May God help us return to a better way,” he tweeted.The almighty ought to be busy in Syria right now, so this unusually orange challenge rightly falls into the lap of Republicans like Kinzinger himself.Like a fatberg blocking the sewers of Capitol Hill, Trump’s sense of victimhood and love of lying is creating unbearable pressure in a system designed to flush away an extraordinary volume of political waste material.So Republicans were talking about Trump’s self-styled lynching instead of defending Trump from the blockbuster impeachment evidence of his current ambassador to Ukraine.Until now, Trump has drawn what he might call a “red line in the sand” around the notion that there was no quid pro quo in Ukraine – no withholding of military aid in exchange for political dirt on the Biden family.But ambassador William Taylor flatly contradicted Trump’s defence, much like his chief of staff Mick Mulvaney did last week – before Mulvaney was forced to swallow his words and regurgitate them back into the public square in an unspeakable puddle.Never mind all that quidding and quoing now. It’s time to run for the vomitorium.How did the party that gave the world freedom fries find itself locked in this Trump-shaped prison? The simple answer is that they built it themselves. Trump didn’t invent it; he’s not nearly enough of a very stable genius.In the days after the 9/11 attacks, Republicans looked at the world and decided to see its enemies: an amorphous group of freedom-haters. Only Republicans could protect America from such global threats.But in the absence of a torrent of al-Qaida insurgents at America’s borders, the party rapidly switched to protecting America from Latinos. Once you unleash the politics of fear, you create the space for your own fear-peddling president.Where you once pretended to be strong on terrorism, you now follow a president who just conspired with Turkey and Russia to revive Isis from near-death in Syria.Where you once claimed Obamacare was an abuse of the constitution, you now support a president who claims that some part of the same founding document is phony.Where you once claimed to defend freedom, you no longer have the freedom to speak your mind or your values. Unless you call yourself Pierre and join the cheese-eating surrender monkeys on Twitter.Until now, Trump has assumed he can get away with murder because Republican senators will acquit him in an impeachment trial. That may be a reasonable assumption, even for someone as smart as Trump.But there’s one thing that Republican senators value, and it’s not Trump’s leadership or his personal charm. It’s survival.At some point, Mitch McConnell will look at the polls and his projected losses in the Senate and realise that there’s something even worse than Trump unleashing his tweetbots in a Republican primary.For now, the GOP is clinging on to a half-baked Trumpian deal: supporting their leader in exchange for him holding his fire and fury. But nobody seriously believes that Trump can stop the projectiles that barrel out of every orifice. Never mind the quid pro quo: this status quo is untenable.• Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/republicans-are-finally-realising-that-trump-is-his-own-worst-enemy-and-theirs
MEPs block move to weaken EU rules on bee-harming pesticides,Sixteen states and European commission had lobbied against planned guidance,Daniel Boffey,2019-10-23T14:05:36+0100,"The European parliament has vetoed a move by member states and the European commission to weaken EU rules protecting bee colonies from toxic pesticides.MEPs blocked revised legislation that was said to ignore the risk to bee larvae from long-term exposure to chemicals, known as chronic toxicity.The MEPs instead argued a guidance document (pdf) produced by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2013 should be fully implemented.The guidance seeks both to protect bees from adverse effects from a single exposure or multiple exposures over a short period of time, known as acute toxicity, and also long-term exposure.Sixteen member states, which have not been publicly named, lobbied against the full implementation of the guidance before the new rules are brought to a vote in the European parliament.Green MEPs who led the way on the parliamentary veto claimed the new generation of systemic pesticides, which are applied via seed treatment rather than spraying, made chronic exposure particularly relevant.Bee populations have collapsed around the world and the use of pesticides is said to be the main cause.A 2019 analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species in the UK found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places in which they were found in 1980.Butterflies and mothsThere has been a “severe reduction” in butterflies and moths in the Kullaberg Nature Reserve in Sweden compared with 50 years ago. Scientists found over a quarter of the 600 species once found had been lost. Butterflies were hardest hit, losing almost a half of species, including the large tortoiseshell and scarce copper. In England, two-thirds of 340 moth species declined from 1968-2003.BumblebeesMuseum records enabled scientists to assess the fate of 16 species of bumblebees in the US midwest from 1900 to 2007. They found four had completely died out, while eight were declining in number, and blamed intensive agriculture and pesticides.DragonfliesRed dragonfly populations have fallen sharply in Japan since the mid-1990s, which scientists link to insecticides in rice paddies that stop the water-living nymphs emerging into adults. In the US, recent surveys across California and Nevada found 65% of dragonflies and damselflies had declined in the 100 years since 1914.LeafhoppersLeafhoppers and planthoppers often make up a large proportion of the flying insects in European grasslands. But scientists found their abundance in Germany plunged by 66% in the 50 years to 2010. Soil acidification, partly due to heavy fertiliser use, was the main cause.Ground beetlesIn the UK, dramatic declines in ground beetles have been seen in almost three-quarters of the 68 carabid species studied from 1994-2008. A few species increased, but overall one in six of all the beetles was lost in that time.The parliamentary veto was passed by 533 MEPs, with 67 voting against and 100 abstentions.Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green party MEP, said: “The parliament’s objection is sending a strong signal to the commission not to bow to the pressure of member states and the agrochemical industry.“The parliament is demanding a new text that fully implements existing scientific guidelines. Bee populations are suffering everywhere, largely due to the use of pesticides, with major consequences for our ecosystems and food supplies.“Bees come into contact with small quantities of a pesticide over a long period of time and this is where the real problem lies; that’s why chronic toxicity needs to be fully included in the assessment of pesticides.”Eickhout claimed pesticide producers had gone to great lengths to maintain their “toxic business model” and that the commission had been complicit in weakening protections.“This change of legislation has received relatively little attention so far because it has been discussed behind closed doors at the technical level. It’s time for the European commission to present a proper proposal at the political level so that member states can be held accountable for this issue and then many EU countries might change their tune,” he said.Bees pollinate more than 80% of crops and wild plants in Europe. Last year, the EU banned the world’s most widely used insecticides, neonicotinoids, from all fields.The chemicals were found to cause a wide range of harms including memory damage and a reduction in queen numbers. But the ban included an exemption for greenhouses, raising fears the chemical could still wash out into watercourses.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/23/meps-block-move-weaken-eu-rules-bee-harming-pesticides
Woman in Northern Ireland abortion pills case formally acquitted,Judge instructs jury to find woman not guilty after legal changes come into force,Rory Carroll,2019-10-23T13:22:45+0100,"A court in Northern Ireland has acquitted a woman who was prosecuted for buying online abortion pills for her daughter, after the decriminalisation of abortion in the region.The judge, David McFarland, directed a jury at Belfast crown court on Wednesday to find the woman not guilty a day after Northern Ireland’s Victorian-era abortion laws were liberalised. The prosecution offered no evidence.“My emotions are all over the place. I find it hard to put into words how I am feeling,” the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said after the verdict. “For the first time in six years I can go back to being the mother I was without the weight of this hanging over me every minute of every day. I am so thankful that the change in the law will allow other women and girls to deal with matters like this privately in their own family circle.”She added: “I can finally move on with my life.”The woman bought and supplied abortion pills in 2013 to her then 15-year-old daughter, who terminated the pregnancy.After her GP alerted police the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland levelled two charges of unlawfully procuring and supplying abortion pills with the intent to procure a miscarriage contrary to the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. The decision to subject her to a criminal trial and the prospect of five years in prison provoked an outcry and intensified campaigners’ efforts to align Northern Ireland’s abortion laws with the rest of the UK.The campaign led to a vote by MPs in July to extend abortion rights to the region. The legislation – along with legalisation of same-sex marriage – took effect on Tuesday. It put a moratorium on criminal prosecutions, halting police investigations into abortion cases. The law also obliges the UK to ensure regulations for free, legal and local abortion services are in place by 31 March 2020.The woman’s solicitor, Jemma Conlon, said her client was immensely relieved that a six-year legal ordeal had ended. “It is a day that she will forever remember and a day that allows her to finally move on with her life privately without anguish and criminalisation,” she said.Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland campaign manager, said no other women would be hauled through the courts and face criminal prosecution in the manner the acquitted woman had been. “This is the beginning of a more caring and compassionate Northern Ireland,” she said.The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and other anti-abortion parties attempted to recall the mothballed assembly at Stormont on Monday to avert decriminalisation. The gathering – the first at Stormont in almost three years – collapsed in acrimony and the legislation went ahead. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said her party would examine ways to repeal it. “We will do everything in our conscience to protect the lives of the unborn,” she said.The breakdown of relations between the DUP and Sinn Féin, which favours abortion rights, has stymied efforts to restore the power-sharing assembly.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/23/woman-northern-ireland-abortion-pills-case-formally-acquitted-legal-reforms
Two-thirds of British people see overseas aid as 'a major priority',Survey of EU citizens reveals overwhelming belief in importance of helping people in poorer countries,Lucy Lamble,2019-10-23T13:15:19+0100,"The British public remains firmly behind efforts to support people in poorer countries, with almost two-thirds of people canvassed in a survey of EU citizens believing that maintaining overseas aid at its current level should be “a major priority”.The results from Eurobarometer, the EU’s polling organisation, also found that almost 90% of people thought helping people in developing countries should be a priority of the EU and national governments.Romilly Greenhill, UK director of the advocacy group the One Campaign, said it was “heartening” that the vast majority of British people believe that helping people in developing countries is the right thing to do.“Despite the gloomy picture often painted, British people support building a more peaceful, progressive and prosperous world for all,” she said.Greenhill was encouraged by the finding that showed almost two-thirds of the British public think tackling poverty in developing countries should be “a major priority” for the UK government. “While Britain’s relationship with the world is changing, this shows we are still an outward looking country,” Greenhill said.The annual poll, which was conducted face to face in June 2019 among 26,464 Europeans, canvassed views on migration, the private sector and gender. It also asked what people thought should be the role of national governments and the EU in development.Claire Godfrey, interim director of policy, advocacy and research at Bond, the British network for organisations working in international development, said the survey was “incredibly timely” as the UK government begins to redefine its role in a post-Brexit world.British respondents were among the most positive about helping people in developing countries, but more sceptical than last year about development as a means to tackle migration.In line with the EU average, British citizens think that the EU should strengthen its partnership with African countries and increase financial investment in the continent.“Politicians in Westminster should heed this news,” said Greenhill. “Whatever the problems they grapple with today, British people are focusing on tomorrow, and believe that helping people in developing countries contributes to a more peaceful and fairer world.”Across the 28 member countries, the poll revealed broad consensus among European citizens on the significance of cross-border cooperation and development. Just as in the UK, almost 90% of EU citizens said that it is important to support people in developing countries, confirming a trend established over recent years.Development emerged as one of the most positively perceived EU policies.The European commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica, said he was “very happy” to see that Europeans continue their “strong support” for development and key priorities like “strengthening partnerships with Africa; deepening our engagement to create jobs; and bringing in more private investments”.Mimica said this support was a “solid basis for the union to maintain its leading global role and address the significant challenges that remain”.Bond has been working with its members on continuity in funding and service following Brexit.Godfrey said it was reassuring to see that, “despite the loud voices shouting down the importance and public support behind UK aid, in fact seven out of 10 people think our aid contribution doesn’t need changing or even should be increased, while over 60% of those interviewed think tackling poverty in developing countries should be a main priority of government”.The British public understood that “fairer trade, tax, ethical investments, transparency and tackling climate change are good for reducing poverty, inequality and combating environmental harm,” she said.Looking ahead, Godfrey said: “The government, and any future government, should take note of these results when thinking about what our development and aid priorities should be following Brexit.”In 2013, the UK joined the leading group of donors that have met the UN-target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on aid, laid down in 1970. Despite backbench opposition, this commitment was then enshrined in law in 2015.This year’s survey follows closer scrutiny of the rules that mean refugee costs can formally be counted as “official development assistance” – the convention agreed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development for what is eligible as part of 0.7% commitment.Funding for detention centres, border security and patrols, and the costs of returning failed asylum-seekers are now clearly excluded. Spending on asylum seekers once their application is rejected, or on refugees considered as “in transit” to other countries where they intend to resettle, is also ruled out.",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/two-thirds-of-british-people-see-overseas-aid-as-a-major-priority-eurobarometer
Benny Gantz tasked with forming Israeli government,Ex-military chief has 28 days to forge coalition and avoid third election in year,Oliver Holmes,2019-10-23T13:14:44+0100,"Israel’s president has tasked the former military chief Benny Gantz with forming a government after Benjamin Netanyahu failed to do so following an inconclusive election last month.Neither Gantz’s Blue and White coalition nor the incumbent prime minister’s Likud party came out with a clear win, and few expect the opposition leader to form a coalition through deals with disparate political parties with ease.“I promised that I would establish a liberal unity government and that is what I intend to do,” said Gantz at a formal ceremony at the president’s official residence on Wednesday evening. “The government that I will establish will serve all citizens of Israel.”Gantz will have 28 days to try, after which parliament can nominate a third candidate, although that appears extremely unlikely given the divided makeup of Israel’s legislature, the Knesset.If no contender can end the political crisis, the country will face an unprecedented third election in a year.“These are fateful days,” said the president, Reuven Rivlin, after Wednesday’s event. “The urgency of the hour and the challenges that we are facing obligate us to form a government as soon as possible.”The ceremony marked the first time in more than a decade that anyone but Netanyahu be given a chance to head the Israeli government.An end to the Netanyahu era would be an extraordinary moment in Israeli politics, as he has led the country for a record-breaking total of more than 13 years. The move does not necessarily conclude  his political career or his chances of leading the country’s next administration.However, the stalemate has wounded the prime minister, especially as he has become more deeply embroiled in three potential corruption cases. Israel’s attorney general is expected to announce in the coming weeks if he plans to indict.The charges add pressure on Netanyahu to remain in high office. If he retains the role of prime minister, he will not be required to step down, even if indicted. Netanyahu has denied all allegations.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000 is an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000 is examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000 is an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle. Case 4000, the most serious, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.To block Gantz’s chances, Netanyahu reportedly planned to meet smaller rightwing and religious parties to get them to agree not to ally with the opposition leader.One route for Gantz to form a government would be to make a deal with Avigdor Lieberman, whose eight seats afford him kingmaker status, and gain support from Arab parties. However, Lieberman, a staunch ultranationalist regularly accused of racism, has described Arab politicians as “enemies”.Lieberman, Rivlin, Netanyahu and Gantz all say they want a unity government, possibly with a rotating premiership, but they are divided on how to achieve it.Blue and White argues Gantz should be prime minister first under any arrangement as his party won the most seats, finishing with 33 compared with Likud’s 32 in the 120-seat Knesset.Gantz also says Blue and White cannot serve in a government with a prime minister facing serious indictment.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/israeli-opposition-leader-benny-gantz-to-be-asked-to-form-government
Spanish state repression in Catalonia may be shocking – but it’s nothing new,"As we learned in the Basque country, true democracy requires there to be peace on both sides, says Basque leader Arnaldo Otegi",Arnaldo Otegi,2019-10-23T13:06:43+0100,"The Spanish supreme court’s deeply unjust verdict, handing out harsh prison sentences to nine Catalan government and civil society leaders for organising a peaceful referendum on self-determination in Catalonia, is for many the sign of a country slipping towards authoritarianism and away from western European-style democracy. But truth be told, for us Basques, this kind of behaviour is nothing new.For years Spain was able to disguise its undemocratic essence under the cloak of the “fight against Basque terrorism”. Denial and rejection of the political nature of the armed conflict in the Basque country became quite easy for them, especially after 9/11. The line was that there was not a political problem in Spain, just a criminal one. “Spain is a democracy,” they used to tell us. “Everything is possible without violence” was the repeated mantra. We still remember the words of Spanish home secretary Alfredo P Rubalcaba: “They must decide: bombs or votes.”The truth is Basque violence was ended not thanks to the government's efforts but despite its persistent obstructionsYet when some of us in the pro-independence Basque movement began to convince those who still believed in violence to continue our struggle for self-determination by peaceful and democratic means, we were arrested and sentenced to lengthy jail terms.The truth is that Basque violence ended –not thanks to Spanish government efforts – but in spite of its persistent obstructions. (It is probably important here to clarify my position: many wrongs were done by the Basque side, many things happened that should not have done. We have acknowledged our share of the blame for the violence that was committed by both sides during years of conflict). My arrest – along with others – happened 10 years before the Catalan politicians were convicted of sedition, and it was only after we had served our prison term that the European court of human rights ruled our trial had been unfair (the second time the ECHR had ruled against Spain). The same could easily happen to the Catalans. The fact that the Spanish state still holds more than 240 Basque political prisoners in jail despite ETA ending its armed campaign in 2011 shows its lack of interest in a lasting peace.The verdict against the Catalan pro-independence leadership for organising a democratic and peaceful referendum, and the subsequent violence the Spanish police used against peaceful Catalan demonstrations, shows us what we always knew: the Spanish state is not interested in democracy and will use violence to conceal its undemocratic nature.This is why the state plays up, and at times instigates, violence in the region. The Spanish media and courts have even started talking about “terrorism” in the Catalan case. Spain will not hesitate to use this lie. Its government would love to transform Catalans’ legitimate and peaceful demand for self-determination into violence. That is what the police and military forces have been trying to do the last few days with their violent tactics.Fortunately, the Catalan nationalist movement is committed to peace. As we are in the Basque country. We know that our “force of reason” is stronger than their “reason of force”. At the same time we both are committed to achieving our fundamental democratic rights – Catalan and Basque demands for democracy will now only get louder. It is time to complete the unfinished business of Spain’s phoney transition to democracy – and there will not be real democracy in Spain until its plurinational character is recognised, just as in the UK or Canada.Rather predictably, Spain is going in the opposite direction: the direction of authoritarianism, counter-reform, the recentralisation of powers and responding to democratic demands with an iron fist. All this gives wings to the fascist extreme right. History shows us where this leads in the end.Repression, imprisonment and centralisation will not work. Like in most similar cases around the world there is no lasting solution to this kind of conflict without dialogue. Like in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Quebec, the only way to solve these tensions is through democracy. And anyone with a bit of political sense knows that the state needs to engage with legitimate Catalan representatives. A policy of repression with no talks and no negotiation is unacceptable.All the while, European institutions and states look the other way. Other European governments should be encouraging Spain to change track. Yet at the moment a desire to maintain internal stability within the bloc trumps all, and that means blind loyalty to Spain. This conflict can only be resolved internationally – European institutions and states should raise their voices in favour of a negotiated solution, before it is too late.• Arnaldo Otegi is the leader of the Basque independence party EH Bildu",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/spanish-state-repression-catalonia-democracy-basque
What Bill Taylor’s impeachment inquiry testimony tells us,The Ukraine diplomat said Trump put pressure on Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and gave the most detailed account so far,Luke Harding,2019-10-23T12:56:24+0100,"The US’s top diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, gave damning evidence on Tuesday to congressional committees in Washington investigating Donald Trump. Taylor told impeachment inquiry hearings that Trump had explicitly put pressure on Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden – Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2020 election – and to pursue the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US election on the side of Hillary Clinton. Taylor released his version of events in a 15-page document, in the most detailed account of the scandal so far.Taylor, a veteran diplomat, said that in May he was offered the job of US ambassador to Ukraine. He had served as ambassador there before, between 2006-2009. Taylor said he had reservations about taking up the role because his predecessor, Marie Yovanovitch, had been “poorly treated” and caught up “in a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and Washington”. Taylor said he agreed on condition the US’s policy of strong military and political support for Ukraine continued, at a time when it was under Russian attack. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, confirmed this. Taylor arrived in Kyiv in June. He took with him a letter from Trump inviting Ukraine’s new president Zelenskiy to the White House.Two foreign policies. In Kyiv, Taylor said he found a “confusing” and “ultimately alarming” situation. On the plus side, the new Zelenskiy government did appear to be making progress in tackling the country’s corruption. But Taylor said he discovered two distinct channels of “US policymaking”. One was regular. It included diplomatic support for reform. The other was “highly irregular” and run by some of Trump’s closest aides. They included special envoy Kurt Volker; the EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland; and the energy secretary, Rick Perry. Taylor said he later learned Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was involved. In late June Taylor said he “sensed something odd” about a planned call with Zelenskiy. Sondland told him that “regular interagency participants” would be excluded. And that he would pass on a demand from Trump to “get to the bottom of things”.Taylor said in mid-July it was clear that Trump wanted Zelenskiy to “investigate” two things. One was the conspiracy theory that Ukraine colluded with Hillary Clinton in 2016 to help her win the presidential election. The other was Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden – son of Joe Biden – had served on the board. The allegation, subsequently found to be untrue, was that Joe Biden had put pressure on the previous government of Petro Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma, in order to help his son. Taylor said Giuliani was behind the “irregular policy channel” and that Trump would only meet with Zelenskiy if the Ukrainian president carried out these investigations. There was an explicit quid pro quo, Taylor suggested.The White House put on hold almost $400m of military assistance promised to Ukraine. Taylor said he was astonished to learn of this, during a July conference call. The secretaries of defense and state, the CIA director and national security adviser all tried to get this overturned – without success. Taylor told Washington that Ukrainians in the east of the country would die without the assistance. Meanwhile, senior figures were furious that Trump was insisting on “investigations” before a meeting with Zelenskiy could take place. John Bolton called this “a drug deal” and told Fiona Hill, Trump’s senior Russia expert, to “brief the lawyers”. Taylor began keeping notes. Understandably, the Ukrainians were “confused” about US policy, he said.The notorious phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy took place on 25 July. Before the call, Sondland reportedly told Zelenskiy to tell Trump he would “leave no stone unturned” in investigating Biden. Taylor said he wasn’t given a readout of the conversation, which was “strange”. The ambassador became increasingly concerned by the lack of military aid to Ukraine. He asked Tim Morrison, Hill’s replacement on the National Security Council, about this and was told bluntly: “The president doesn’t want to provide any assistance at all.” Taylor said he wrote a cable to Pompeo setting out his concerns and saying it would be “folly” to deny the Ukrainians help when they were under attack.According to Taylor, Trump insisted that Zelenskiy make a public statement before he would meet with him. The Ukrainian president should appear on CNN and announce that he was opening an investigation into Biden and Ukraine’s 2016 election interference. Trump – according to Taylor – said that Zelenskiy had to “clear things up” and if he didn’t there would be “stalemate”. Taylor took that to mean no American weapons would be delivered. Zelenskiy was on the brink of caving in to Trump’s request but wanted the White House to announce a Trump-Zelenskiy meeting first. This sequence didn’t happen and so Zelenskiy didn’t appear on CNN, to Taylor’s great relief. The ambassador finally learned about the contents of the Zelenskiy-Trump phone call on 25 September, when the White House declassified it. The Ukrainians were “livid”, he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/trump-impeachment-inquiry-bill-taylor-ukraine-testimony
Mohamed Ali: Egyptian exile who sparked protests in shock at mass arrests,"In interview in Spain, businessman says he is in fear of contract killing and that he has new plan to topple President Sisi",Patrick Wintour,2019-10-23T12:29:18+0100,"The Egyptian whistleblower who prompted rare street protests against President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi from exile in Spain has said he is in a “state of shock” and feels a deep sense of personal responsibility for those jailed for answering his call to demonstrate. But he insisted his fight to topple Sisi will enter a new phase, claiming many junior officers in the army support his call for an end to corruption.In an interview with the Guardian in Barcelona, where he says he lives in fear of a contract killing, Mohamed Ali, called for the US Congress to investigate how decades of US economic and military aid amounting to more than $70bn had been spent by the Egyptian state. “Trump has let Sisi steal as much of America’s money as he wants,” Ali said. “It is like a comedy film.”Ali’s unscripted handheld viral videos tormenting and ridiculing Sisi sparked an unusual outbreak of dissent last month in Egypt, where the regime has imposed strict economic austerity measures and 32.5% of people live below the poverty line. Small protests that took place over a number of evenings from 20 September were followed by a widespread crackdown in which more than 4,321 people have been arrested, according to rights group the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms.A specific call from Ali for a million people to march on 27 September was stifled by authorities, who made clear they would use force to quell further demonstrations. He said he has stopped posting the videos for now – a tacit admission that his ability to bring people out onto the streets had died away.He said he is now playing a role in uniting opposition groups, including liberals and the Muslim Brotherhood, into a new force ready to topple Sisi, who came to power in a coup in 2013 and has overseen a wholesale crackdown on freedom of speech and public dissent considered by observers to be the worst in Egypt’s modern history.Ali said he had rejected calls by other opposition groups to join them in exile in Istanbul or Qatar, insisting he wants to stay in Spain.Chain smoking and sometimes agitated as he prowls around the room in which he filmed his video monologues, Ali acknowledged that he is an accidental revolutionary.The head of a large construction firm built up over 15 years, Ali raked in substantial profits from army contracts, building an ornate presidential palace for Sisi, intelligence headquarters, and unopened hotels owned by regime members. It was a shady world of patronage, bribes and open ended budgets. “With the army if you want a contract, you pay commission. If you do not pay a bribe under the table you do not get to do the jobs,” he said.“Often there were open budgets. They did not mind how much you spent as long as it looked right.”He also partnered with Egypt’s ministry of immigration to produce and star in the 2016 film The Other Land, a drama intended to dissuade Egyptians from attempting risky naval migration routes.Eventually he fell out with key military figures in the regime that disliked him and tried to block him from further business. The falling out, he claimed, left him being owed as much as 200m Egyptian pounds. He said that after ensuring his estranged wife and five children were out of the country, he was determined to expose the scams and waste.A form of revenge by social media ensued. His regular Facebook denunciations of Sisi’s personal corruption have been shared millions of times, prompting street protests that momentarily appeared to shake the repressive regime.The regime have described him as a drug addict, a traitor, a womaniser and member of the Muslim Brotherhood – the Sunni Islamist grouping that briefly ruled Egypt after the revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak in 2011 – all of which he denies.Many of Ali’s precise claims are unverifiable since he says he has no papers to prove the corruption. But Sisi himself has inadvertently given his tormentor credibility by clumsily confirming that he did indeed order palaces to be built, but that they were for the nation.The son of a body builder with no university education, Ali does not pretend to be a political sophisticate. “I am in a state of shock. I do not understand anything. I did not expect this,” he said. “I had a few people following me on Facebook, thought a few people would watch, but it has gone viral and people in Egypt message me saying ‘you are our hope’.“It is a load on me. There are people in prison and tortured. There are people in jail simply for possessing a phone that shows they watched one of my videos.”After his call for further protests failed to meet a popular response, Ali said he was forced to change course. “Before I used to think I could do this alone. Now I speak to opposition politicians and I have more minds with me. No one can succeed by himself.” He claimed he had a secret plan that he will shortly unveil that “will surprise the whole world”.Ali said Egypt’s beleaguered opposition has pressed him to explain what his vision for the country might be.“I said: ‘I want Egypt to be like Europe, If you want to pray, you pray, if you want to go to the club, you go to the club. Be free. Do you have any problem with that ?’ They said no. The first rule of the constitution must be that the people decide through elections.”Egypt’s presidential office did not respond to a request for comment, but Sisi has previously denied all allegations of wrongdoing and said he was “honest and faithful” to his people and the military.Ali said he was neither a hypocrite nor motivated solely by revenge. “If I wanted my money I could have found a way to keep working for them and I would be one of the most important businessmen in Egypt.” He said he acted out of anger at the contrast between Sisi’s calls for austerity and his lavish lifestyle. “The country is on fire, and they are discussing the size of their kitchen,” he said.“I do not take any decision without thinking very carefully and I planned my departure for many years, carefully taking my money out of the country.”But for the moment he faces all the dilemmas of a political exile. “They have taken my nationality from me. My passport expires in a year and if I claim political asylum, I must stay here for a long time and not travel.” Regime loyalists in Egypt, he said, have put a price on his head, or threatened to sue him.Ali claimed the Egyptian embassy in Madrid has invited him there with a promise that he will be repaid the money he says he is owed if he agrees to go quiet.“I do not think they would kill me,” he said. “It would be catastrophic for them if they kill me in Europe, but I am scared of someone being paid to murder me”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/mohamed-ali-egyptian-exile-in-shock-over-street-protest-arrests
Franco's remains to finally leave Spain's Valley of the Fallen,Dictator’s tomb to be opened and coffin taken to cemetery near Madrid on Thursday,Sam Jones,2019-10-23T12:04:36+0100,"Spain’s socialist government is finally to fulfil one of its key promises when the remains of General Franco are exhumed from the austere splendour of the Valley of the Fallen and transferred to his family mausoleum outside Madrid.If all goes to plan, the 1.5-tonne slab that has covered the dictator’s tomb will be lifted at 10.30am on Thursday and the coffin removed and flown by helicopter or taken by road to Mingorrubio-El Pardo municipal cemetery.Franco’s remains have had pride of place in the basilica, which is 40 miles (64km) north-west of Madrid, since his death in 1975.Although the Valley of the Fallen and its 150-metre (490ft) cross ostensibly commemorate all those killed in the Spanish civil war, for many people, it serves only to glorify Franco and his four-decade dictatorship.The government said the dictator’s remains needed to be moved as they could no longer “remain in a public mausoleum that exalts his figure”, adding that the removal would “symbolically close the circle of Spanish democracy”.The move has been bitterly opposed by the Franco family, the foundation that bears his name, and the Benedictine abbot who presides over the basilica.But after months of appeals and legal arguments, Spain’s supreme court gave permission for the exhumation at the end of September.On Thursday morning, 22 members of the Franco family will gather in the basilica, along with Spain’s justice minister, Dolores Delgado, in her role as first notary of the kingdom.A canopy has been erected to cover the grave and guard against any attempts to film the exhumation. Those present will be checked for electronic devices to make sure there are no images or sound recordings of the exhumation.Last Saturday, a journalist dressed as a monk and equipped with a climbing harness was arrested at the valley, allegedly while trying to gain access to the site to set up cameras.Once the heavy slab has been lifted using hydraulic jacks, the wooden coffin will be inspected to see how well it has endured 44 years of burial and checked for possible water damage. The coffin was surrounded with lead and concrete to protect it against underground streams.Franco’s body is further protected by a zinc box within the coffin, which is expected to be in good condition. If necessary, the zinc box containing the remains will be placed in a new coffin.The exhumation phase could take between one and three hours, after which the remains will be blessed by the prior, Santiago Cantera, and the coffin carried out of the basilica by family members.If flying conditions are suitable, an air force helicopter will transport the body, Delgado and one Franco family member to Mingorrubio-El Pardo cemetery, a 15-minute flight from the valley. Airspace over the route will be closed to traffic and drones.If it is too foggy or windy, the coffin will be driven in a hearse, which could take 40 minutes.A private family service will be held inside the Franco mausoleum, where the dictator’s widow, Carmen Polo, was buried after her death in 1988. At the family’s request, mass will be said by Ramón Tejero.The priest is the son of Antonio Tejero, the Guardia Civil lieutenant colonel who led the failed 1981 military coup that sought to seize control of the country after its return to democracy following Franco’s death.According to the government, the exhumation and reinterment will cost about €63,000 (£54,000).Twelve years ago, the previous socialist government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero introduced the historical memory law, which sought to help the country come to terms with its past and assist people in finding and exhuming the bodies of relatives killed in the civil war.About 100,000 victims of the conflict are thought to lie in the unmarked graves where they were buried during the conflict. Spain is believed to have more mass graves than any country except Cambodia.The Valley of the Fallen, partly built by the forced labour of political prisoners, is Spain’s largest mass grave and holds the bodies of more than 33,000 people from both sides of the civil war.In July last year, the Spanish government announced plans to establish a truth commission to investigate crimes against humanity committed by the Franco regime.The government, led by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said it would compile a census of the victims of the civil war and the ensuing dictatorship, and also open an estimated 1,200 mass graves.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/francos-remains-to-finally-leave-spains-valley-of-the-fallen
The future of Durban: is this South Africa's most inclusive public space?,"The Indian Ocean beachfront, the restaurant strip of Florida Road and the market at Warwick offer three very different models for the future of South Africa’s third largest city",,2019-10-23T12:00:40+0100,"It’s an early start on Durban’s beachfront Golden Mile. By 6am the surfers have arrived, followed by the runners and their dogs, then executives-cum-cyclists, speed walkers and yoga instructors. By 7am the cafes are open for breakfast and children, on holiday from inland schools, are already in the water.Where fellow oceanside metropolis Cape Town has marketed itself to the world, Durban has positioned itself as South Africa’s playground. Beachfront theme parks and twirling public waterslides attract families from around the country, and all walks of life. This accessibility and affordability have made this eight-kilometre strip arguably one of South Africa’s most inclusive public spaces.When the end of apartheid saw white flight from the city centre to the northern suburbs, the beach fell on hard timesBeyond the narrow strip of beach and promenade, though, South Africa’s third largest city struggles with the same problems as the rest of the country: 25 years after the fall of apartheid the city which was divided by race remains divided by economics.But it is setting out to address those issues with several new models of growth – the waterfront, a privately funded development of restaurants and retail along Florida Road, and the redesign of the traditional market at Warwick Triangle.Each embodies a different theory of how Durban can best become a more inclusive city – and each has its defenders and detractors.Beaches were once contested spaces in South Africa. During apartheid, white South Africans, who made up 22% of Durban’s population, had exclusive access to more than two kilometres of prime coastline, whereas black South Africans, who made up 46% of the urban population, were limited to just 650m.“Clearly the beach in Durban was seen as the playground for white South Africans,” says former city manager Michael Sutcliffe. As a member of the United Democratic Front, Sutcliffe led protests to integrate Durban’s beaches in the late 1980s.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope. Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town's spectacular beaches and trendy cafes.Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the ""other Soweto"", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.Nick Van MeadBut when the end of apartheid saw white flight from the city centre to the northern suburbs, the beach fell on hard times. Prime real estate overlooking the port was abandoned and illegally occupied, the city’s pastel-coloured art-deco buildings became derelict as landlords neglected them and bylaws were trampled on. The beach, particularly popular South Beach, became a crime hotspot and few dared to be caught there before sunrise or after dark.The real turnaround came in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup, when as a host city Durban had to rethink its image. Along with the repaved promenade and formalised flea markets, came the Moses Mabhida stadium, within walking distance of the beachfront.Durban officials were accused of exacerbating inequality by prioritising entertainment over basic necessities like running water and safe housing in the townships miles away from the tourist hotspots. Still, despite being briefly embroiled in a spending scandal and with a “Mike-is-right” style of leadership that antagonised some fellow councillors, Sutcliffe is credited with revitalising the promenade.Except for one sign that eluded post-apartheid painters, Durban’s beachfront now resembles an idyllic melting pot of South African cultures. On Christmas Day and New Year’s Day, in particular, the beach is so crowded with people who a generation ago were not allowed on the sand that it could be read as an annual defiance to the country’s old laws.The project is still ongoing. A decade ago, the Point Road area near Durban’s docks was known for derelict buildings and illegal prostitution. Now, artists impressions of what the area could look like in the next 10 years imagine glistening skyscrapers reflecting the Indian Ocean, alongside a mixed development of luxury apartments, retail, business zones and tourist hotspots.The development will link the promenade to the port, extending the Golden Mile into a project that hopes to rival Cape Town’s V&A Waterfront. A joint venture between the eThekwini Municipality and Malaysian developers UEM Sunrise, the project is reported to cost R35bn (£1.8bn) and will be overseen by the national government, in part to avoid corruption scandals that have overshadowed Durban.As a model for inclusivity, it has one major downside: the beaches along the northern suburbs are now an enclave for middle class and wealthier Durbanites, particularly moneyed black tourists who prefer the warmer Indian Ocean to Cape Town’s icy Atlantic. What’s more, despite its plans for mixed-income development, the new Point Road project looks likely to exclude the largely black, working class communities who have kept Durban’s city centre alive.A second approach is taking place at what is arguably Durban’s most successful regeneration project, Florida Road, a trendy thoroughfare just over a mile from the beachfront. A project by London-based developer Urban Lime hopes tourists and especially locals will linger in the courtyards that mix the Victorian and Edwardian facades of this historic neighbourhood with trendy boutiques and restaurants of the so-called new South Africa.Previously a street of churches, retirement homes and an unassuming supermarket, the Florida Road turnaround began when Urban Lime bought a parking lot, and transformed it into a retail and outdoor entertainment space. Unusual in a city traumatised by crime, the strip is designed to encourage walking, and by day a row of dessert spots welcome a family-conscious community, many of them devout Muslims. It offers mixed price options: a taco spot and Afro’s Chicken Shop, a local favourite, are affordable easy dining, with more fine-dining restaurants further along the street.The developer works with local residents’ associations to employ a private security company that patrols the privately owned public spaces, and Urban Lime has expanded aggressively, accumulating around 200,000 sq m of retail space since 2014 and spending R1.2bn.Recognising the inner-city’s cash-driven economy, Urban Lime has moved into the city centre, where it has subdivided retail space to allow small traders to rent for as little as R1,500 a month for several square metres. They’ve taken over the iconic Durban Club Chambers, a downtown high-rise that houses the city’s legal fraternity and was once the offices of one of the country’s first black lawyers and founding member of the ANC Pixley ka Isaka Seme. They plan to turn part of the block into a pedestrian zone in an attempt to coax the advocates who work in the city to spend more time in central Durban.The company’s managing director, Nad Shahid, explains a grand plan of 16 nodes that will reconnect the suburbs to the inner-city and eventually back to the beach. Centred on a refurbished building or district, these nodes revitalise the area block by block with small to medium-sized retail, restaurants and office space, bringing traffic back to abandoned spaces and helping Durban combine the commercial drive of Johannesburg with the oceanside lifestyle of Cape Town.“It has potential to be a huge business city and it also has the potential to be a huge lifestyle-stroke-tourist city as well,” says Urban Lime CEO Jonny Friedman. “But the city needs to do things. In my opinion it’s the psychological and physical links between north and south.”But, this sort of development is also synonymous with gentrification around the world. On Florida Road, it has meant higher rents and some angry tenants, most notably the owner of the restaurant Spiga, Marco Santoniccolo, who closed down his family eatery after nearly 17 years on Florida Road after rents climbed. Since reopening around the corner on Innes road, though, Santoniccolo has made peace with the changes and even welcomes the developments.Durban city centre may have been abandoned by some landlords and starved of services in the 1990s and 2000s but is neither a ghost town nor a crime-ridden chaos. It is home to many working-class black South Africans who have moved from townships and villages around the province of KwaZulu-Natal.Built over a transit hub that links minibus taxis and trains, Warwick Market offers everything from fresh vegetables to dried medicinal herbs. Among rows of wild spinach and sweet potatoes is a butchery that sells fresh offal and fish. There are stalls specialising in the uniform of the Zionist Christian Church, and others that will type a CV for R7. One sells DVDs of popular mbaqanga music artists; a herbalist offers a mixture that will “help you find love”.It represents a third option: a more natural, bottom-up development that embraces all Durbanites, not just those who can afford to eat in the fancier restaurants of Florida Road or tourists paying for expensive beachfront hotels. The market largely caters to the residents who were willing to put up with Durban’s inner-city decay because they had no better option.Warwick market’s survival is testament to a moment of euphoria in post-apartheid South Africa in which officials, corporates and informal traders were willing to reconfigure the segregated city in the 1990s, explains Richard Dobson of Asiye eTafuleni (meaning ‘let’s go to the table’), a non-profit that represents the voices of informal traders in urban planning.This model was put to the test during Durban’s revamp as a so-called “world class city” fit for the World Cup, when the historic market faced demolition to make space for a shopping mall. It was ultimately saved by mass demonstrations, when thousands of vendors rallied together, forcing the city to rethink its development plan and improve the junction for people who already lived there.Dobson says the market functions well, with a turnover in the order of millions of pounds. It is vendors who keep the area safe and clean, not police or city workers.In many ways Warwick represents the kind of community buy-in and local participation that is only now beginning to occur on the beachfront, and has yet to occur in the city that lies right behind it. So, will Durban ever become a fully inclusive city?“You don’t do it by thinking that by putting black people living next to white people suddenly the white people are going to change,” says Sutcliffe, the former city manager. “That’s not going to happen. And it hasn’t happened. I think that all the evidence shows that kind of integration will take generations.”Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

"Cyntoia Brown: trafficked, enslaved, jailed for life at 16 – and fighting back",She was still a teenager when she was sold into sexual slavery and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. Now Cyntoia Brown-Long hopes her new memoir will highlight the flaws in the US justice system that failed her so badly,Kate Hodal,2019-10-23T11:30:17+0100,"Cyntoia Brown-Long was just 16 when she was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a man she claims bought her for sex. The homeless runaway had been in and out of the juvenile justice system, survived multiple rapes and assaults and was forced into sex slavery by her then-boyfriend, a pimp known as Kut Throat, who regularly sold her for drug money.Yet few details of Brown-Long’s troubled childhood were heard by the Tennessee court in 2004, which instead repeatedly described her as a “teen prostitute” and tried her as an adult. Today, 15 years on and just months after her life sentence was commuted by the state governor, Brown-Long has rewritten the narrative behind her incarceration – and her past – in a memoir she began while still in prison.“I want it to put a face to the justice system,” says Brown-Long by phone from Nashville of her book, Free Cyntoia: My Search for Redemption in the American Prison System, published last week.“I hope it will make people see things from my point of view and help them open their eyes about what really goes on behind the news stories and the court cases. A lot of people in the system get lost behind case numbers – and some of their sentences are completely outrageous.”Brown-Long knows that her case was unique. After more than a decade in prison, where she would eventually obtain two university degrees, find God and get married (she tied the knot with Christian hip-hop artist Jamie Long over the phone while still incarcerated), she appealed for clemency. The petition went viral after celebrities including Rihanna, LeBron James and Kim Kardashian West took to social media to condemn her life sentence.The outcry helped spark a national debate about child trafficking and the failure of the US juvenile justice system to identify and support at-risk youth. It also prompted Tennessee to re-examine its own unusually harsh juvenile sentencing laws, which require under-18s convicted of first-degree murder to face 51 years behind bars before a chance of parole. Before her petition for clemency was granted, Brown-Long would not have been eligible for parole until she was 69.Now that she is free, Brown-Long is setting up a non-profit, the Foundation for Justice, Freedom and Mercy, to help speak on behalf of “all the other Cyntoias who are still locked up”. Her goal is to advocate for legislation that would change, in particular, how juveniles are sentenced.“It’s important for me that I speak in a way that gives them back their voices. All of a sudden, they’re known for the worst thing that they’ve ever done – and that seems to be all that anybody can see,” she says.“The biggest issue right now with prison reform is convincing people that there needs to be reform. They think this whole ‘tough on crime’ thing is the way to go. But I see it different. What does it mean if we show mercy to people and cultivate that in the prison system instead?”Brown-Long goes into detail in her memoir about the circumstances leading up to her own incarceration: born to a mother who drank throughout her pregnancy; a childhood spent in and out of juvenile facilities; years racked by drug and sex abuse.I never got to apologise to my victim’s mother. She would die before I had the chance.At 16, she met 24-year-old Garion McGlothen, who went by the name Kut Throat, with whom she was living in motels around Nashville and snorting cocaine every day. He would send her out to have sex with men and would beat and rape her if she didn’t come back with cash, she claims.“He would explain to me that some people were born whores, and that I was one, and I was a slut, and nobody’d want me but him, and the best thing I could do was just learn to be a good whore,” Brown-Long said at a parole hearing.It was within this context that she was picked up at a fast-food restaurant in August 2004 by 43-year-old estate agent Johnny Allen, who Brown-Long claims offered to buy her snacks and pay $150 (£117) for sex. Back at his house, Allen began showing her his gun collection, which made her fear for her life, Brown-Long says. She claims she later shot him in self-defence. However, police found Allen nude in bed with a gunshot wound to the back of his head, his hands underneath his head as if he were sleeping.Police charged Brown-Long with first-degree murder and robbery – as evidence later showed that she stole his truck, wallet and guns – but Brown-Long has always maintained that she didn’t shoot him to rob him.It was while studying for her degree in prison that Brown-Long came across a term she’d never heard of – sex trafficking – which made her rethink her own experiences.“I thought to myself, why am I only just now finding out that there’s no such thing as a teen prostitute? Why are teenagers who are trafficked like [I was] being exploited and taken advantage of, but society has just been telling us we’re bad, that we’re promiscuous?“That was when I really realised we need to start educating one another about what’s happening to young girls, not talking about waist trainers and contouring and how to be desirable to men. That was one of the direct reasons why I found myself in a hotel room with a man who trained me to do just that. It took me 10 years to come to grips with the fact I was actually a victim of trafficking.”Brown-Long now spends her days doing community service and mentoring at-risk girls on the importance of boundaries and the real dangers of social media.“I speak to them about what led up to me being in that [trafficking] situation and how it’s not about some guy picking you up off the street corner and holding a gun to your head and making you do certain things,” says Brown-Long.“Being young, caring and so impressionable can make us more vulnerable. And social media is so dangerous now in the way that it commodifies women and glamorises breaking your back to appear beautiful to people and killing yourself for likes and follows. We have to have conversations about how that can make us vulnerable and how to protect ourselves from that as women through healthier thinking patterns.”Brown-Long has publicly apologised since her release from prison to the family of the man she killed, and describes in her memoir the guilt she felt at not telling his mother she was sorry at the time – advice that she was given by her lawyer out of fear it would “tank her case”.“I realised [then] how truly messed up the system was,” Brown-Long wrote.“Don’t we want people to feel remorse, to swallow their pride and reach out to the person they hurt? There’s no room in the criminal justice system, not the way it’s set up today. I never got to apologise to my victim’s mother. She would die before I had the chance.”Free Cyntoia: My Search for Redemption in the American Prison System, by Cyntoia Brown-Long, is published by Simon & Schuster, £18.99",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/cyntoia-brown-long-trafficked-enslaved-jailed-for-life-at-16-and-fighting-back
