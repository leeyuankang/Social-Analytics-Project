Struggling with The Golden Notebook? The hard work is worth it,"For every moment of high drama, there are also sections of intense tedium. But Doris Lessing’s masterpiece delivers a big payoff",Sam Jordison,2019-10-22T13:08:09+0100,"In my edition of Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook, the text that forms the titular volume arrives on page 531. These climactic thoughts, supposedly recorded by the novel’s central character, Anna Wulf, take up only 26 pages. That’s not to say Lessing’s title is a misnomer. The story builds towards these 26 pages and finds a kind of resolution within them.Lessing’s decision to divide her novel into many sections is crucial to the book’s power. She very deliberately split her novel across different aspects of Anna’s personal story and her fractured psychology. The result still seems unique in fiction – it makes for a strange, troubling and difficult reading experience.The black, red, yellow and blue notebooks of the novel are Anna’s different approaches to making sense of herself. In the black one, she reflects on her writing life. In the red, she tracks her political development. Yellow contains her attempts to write (highly autobiographical) fiction, while blue is a diary of her daily life. Meanwhile, the Free Women sections describe Anna in the third person, taking us outside her head in an attempt to record her scattered thoughts.It would be impossible to discuss everything in these sections in a single article. The book features hilarious pastiches about mid-20th-century literary London and bitter satires of film and television producers. There are agonised accounts about the end of the communist dream, and frank commentaries on sex, male impotence and female desire. There are shocking descriptions of the racist politics of white colonialists in Africa. There are insights into both inequality and the privileged bohemian lives of Anna and her friends. (It’s bewildering to read the book in 2019, and encounter all those young artists who have spurned regular employment but live in huge houses in London – that they own!)Sections from each notebook are interspersed throughout the novel, providing numerous cliffhangers and sometimes keeping readers waiting for dozens, even hundreds, of pages before there is a resolution. At the end of the second section, comes one of the biggest shocks I’ve encountered in fiction for a long time. We learn, via a frantic, confusing phone call, that something dreadful has happened. Then we’re cut off, and because of the way the book is set out, if feels only natural that we should have to wait before we get answers. But this just gives Lessing another opportunity to set up more surprises.Alongside this high drama, there are also sections of intense tedium. Even once I was fully invested in the story it could be hard work. Reading the section entitled The Golden Notebook often felt like chewing concrete.But this book is meant to be hard work. There would be something wrong with an entirely enjoyable account of a nervous breakdown. The novel’s longueurs are also partly why it works: Lessing makes us slowly climb this mountain of a story so we can better appreciate the view from the top. Sometimes, I needed to be reminded that there’s a real person writing this story. As we watch Anna writing about her fictional character, Ella, we are reminded of Lessing writing about Anna (and, I suppose, Ella). How much of Lessing’s life feeds into Anna’s, in the same way that Anna’s life feeds into Ella’s’?We can’t know. It seems prurient to demand the exact correspondences between events in Lessing’s life and scenes in her novel. But it would be equally wrong to ignore the importance of the actual world to this fiction. And that isn’t interesting only because of the natural curiosity we have about the author’s life. It is because it raises the stakes, and makes the politics, the madness, the emotion, all more feel more real. Anna’s suffering is not confined only to this novel. It also happens out in the world, to people like Ella, Anna, Lessing – or you and me."
'What are the chances?' Woman reunited with childhood book in museum,Zoe Andrews found her copy of The Secret Garden in Reading’s Museum of English Rural Life,Alison Flood,2019-10-22T11:52:08+0100,"A woman has been reunited with a copy of The Secret Garden she owned as a child, serendipitously discovering it for sale on the shelves of the Museum of English Rural Life shop.The MERL, which made news last year for sending an 18th-century schoolboy’s doodles of a chicken in trousers viral, acquired the Ladybird Children’s Classics edition from a charity shop in Wallingford for its collection of second-hand books. On Friday, it was picked up by its former owner, Zoe Andrews, who looked inside and saw it had her sister’s name in the front cover, written in characters that she’d dreamed up as a child.The MERL’s digital editor Joe Vaughan tweeted about the discovery. “Today, the past sent something back, in our museum, in our strange house of time, like a letter returned to sender,” he wrote. “It’s not every day that you pick up a book, open it, and, in the inside cover, find your sister’s name, in hieroglyphics … the ones you wrote when you were kids.”Andrews “couldn’t believe it when I found this book … Had to repurchase it. What are the chances?!” She couldn’t remember any details about the secret language her and her sister had written on the book. “I had a grid on a sheet of paper with a ‘key’ as to what symbols meant what. This is going back many years, probably 1993/94.”MERL director Kate Arnold-Forster said: “One of the most unexpected yet fascinating aspects of libraries is discovering books that bear traces of their readers’ lives, moving us to speculate about how they were read and enjoyed. That it’s The Secret Garden – a novel that has survived generations and provided a magical escape for so many readers – makes this story all the more wonderful.”The discovery prompted other readers to share on social media stories of unexpectedly discovering their former books. One person wrote that their “father-in-law unpacked a box of books one day and found a hardcover Biggles given to him by auntie Eva – 60 years before, 11th birthday in a totally different part of the country. Awesome roundtrip. His most treasured book now.”Of her Secret Garden find, Andrews said: “When things work their way back to you, they were never meant to leave you in the first place.” She added on Twitter that “it feels right to have the book back”, and after all, it was “only a quid”."
'It's something new': how Mongolian rock band the Hu went viral,"Combining ‘a blend of the east and west’, the Hu have found their way to 45m YouTube views, a smash hit debut album and the admiration of Elton John",Jim Farber,2019-10-22T06:00:54+0100,"The chant started long before the band took the stage.“HU!! HU!! HU!!,” yelled the crowd, at escalating volume, for a full 20 minutes before the Hu kicked off their recent concert at the Brooklyn venue, Warsaw. The fans who packed the place, many of whom were decked out in de rigueur heavy metal gear of black T-shirts and leather, thrust their fists into the air in rhythm to their chants, which grew to a roar the moment the band appeared.The imposing-looking members of the Hu sported leather too, only theirs bore the elaborate patterns and symbols of their homeland, Mongolia. And instead of singing in English, they sang exclusively in their native tongue, delivered in the ancient art of khoomei, or throat singing. In the same vein, their instruments mixed the slashing electric guitars and pounding drums of the west with the richness of the morin khuur (a two-stringed, horse-head fiddle), the tinniness of the tuvshuur (a Mongolian guitar) and the quaver of the tumor khuur (a jaw harp). The beat they kept didn’t so much punch, a la western metal, as gallop, a reference to the horses prized by the nomadic tribes of the band’s ancestors. With so bracing a combination of sights and sounds, the Hu have been forging a highly improbable connection between the complexities of traditional Mongolian music and the 10-ton force of western metal. Think: Genghis Khan ransacking Judas Priest.“Our music is a blend of east and west, old and new,” said Galbadrakh Tsendbaatar, AKA Gala, the band’s lead singer, through a translator. “We’re building on a history and a sound that has been around for thousands of years.”Never before, however, has that sound had the impact in the west it’s currently enjoying, courtesy of the Hu. Their first two videos, for Wolf Totem, and Yuve Yuve Yu (or How Strange, How Strange) have amassed more than 45m views on YouTube over the last year, while their debut album, The Gereg, opened at No 1 on Billboard’s Top New Artist chart and No 2 on the magazine’s Indie Label chart. Likewise, it hit No 2 on the UK’s Rock & Metal Album chart and No 4 on the Album Downloads list, while in Australia it broke the top five in overall digital sales. The Hu’s Facebook page has more than 300,000 followers.Though the band only formed in 2016, their members have been playing their instruments and practicing the tricky rituals of throat singing for most of their lives. The four core members – who also include Enkush (Enkhsaikhan Batjargal), Jaya (Nyamjantsan Galsanjamts) and Temka (Temuulen Naranbaatar) – received formal training at the Mongolian State Music and Dance Conservatory in their country’s capital city, Ulaanbaatar. There, they absorbed a wide variety of music. “Everything from western classical music to jazz to rock and, of course, a lot of traditional Mongolian music,” said Gala.Along the way, the musicians enjoyed a steady diet of metal, via Metallica, System of a Down and Rammstein. Such music from the west had been banned during the communist era of Mongolia, which ended in 1992. Though the band members were just children then, they remember the cultural upheaval well. “We had to go through hardship,” said Jaya. “The country fell into a financial crisis. But it was something we had to do and, because of that change, we are all able to play rock music.”In fact, over the last two and a half decades, a significant contemporary music scene has developed in Ulaanbaatar, fleshed out by lots of local pop groups, (such as boy band Camerton), rock acts (like Altan Urag, whose music was featured in the Netflix series Marco Polo), and hip-hop artists (such as breakout star Mrs M, who will soon record in English). Even so, no one had the notion to translate credible, metallic rock to traditional Mongolian styles before B Dashdondog (AKA Dashka), the producer who formed the Hu. After years of working with local pop and rock groups who simply imitated western sounds, Dashka wanted to forge something fresher. So, he hand-picked the members of the Hu from the Conservatory to fulfill his vision. The band say they didn’t choose their name as a play on the Who’s, but because “hu” is the root word for human being in Mongolian. “We took the name because of the inclusive nature,” Temka said. “It’s not about being Mongolian. It’s about being human.”At the same time, Mongolian themes dominate the band’s lyrics. Many salute their ancestors. “As Mongolians, we are raised to have a great respect for our elders and our history,” said Jaya. “We didn’t come here by ourselves. There are generations of people who paved the way.”Important, too, in the band’s lyrics is a sensitivity to nature. “Human beings and nature are connected,” said Jaya. “And, as nomadic people, we have cattle and we have to move all around so we don’t destroy the land. We respect it.”As Jaya explained, there’s an essential connection between nature and the intent of throat singing. “What we’re trying to do is imitate the sound of the water, and the sound of the wind,” he said. “Nature is right in our voices.”While all the members long ago mastered the art of throat singing, it remains a difficult skill to learn. With khoomei, a single vocalist can produce two, or even three, notes at once by forcing air through a tightened throat. The guttural sound that the technique produces can remind western listeners of the dark cries of thrash singers. “Both put a lot of force on your throat,” said Jaya. “It creates a very energetic sound.”The band’s video for Yuve Yuve Yu likewise stresses the connection between modernity and tradition. It opens with various band members in contemporary settings – an upscale coffee shop in Ulaanbaatar, or at home playing a video game – before Gala opens the door of his urban apartment to enter a vast expanse of mountains and lakes in Mongolia’s remote western region. The images that occupy the rest of the video are so stunning, they could double as a travelogue for the Mongolian tourist board. The band’s second video, for Wolf Totem, unites traditional Mongolian horse riders with leather-clad men on Harleys, suggesting an eastern take on Easy Rider. That connection underscores a bad-ass image that has made the band a natural for metal heads. The smash success of their two videos inspired a rash of labels to woo the band before they even completed their first album. They settled on Eleven Seven Music, home of metal acts from Mötley Crüe to Five Finger Death Punch.“It wasn’t the amount of views of their videos that attracted us,” said Steve Kline, chief operating officer of Eleven Seven. “It was the fact that their sound is completely unique. We couldn’t even put a label on what they do. We just found ourselves saying, ‘we’re not exactly sure what this is. But it’s really good.”The Hu’s debut, which the label released last month, took its name from something the Mongol Empire introduced to the world, the first diplomatic passport, which dates from the 1200s. “People think of the Mongol Empire as just warlords and warriors,” said Jaya. “But there are so many positive things the empire brought to the world, like the first postal system, the first international trading on the Silk Road and the diplomatic pass.”The Hu’s music has become its own passport. Their current American tour has sold out more than half of its dates, and they’ll take their show to Europe at the end of the year and the UK at the start of 2020. For the live dates, they add four auxiliary members to the core foursome, making their sound even more forceful. For another lure, Eleven Seven has begun marketing remixes of their songs featuring cameos from a rash of American rockers, singing in English. The first, for Yuve Yuve Yu, boasts a guest vocal from Danny Case of the rock band From Ashes to New. All the exposure has even helped the Hu attract kudos from some big-name stars. “The other day, Elton John told me he’s a big fan of ours,” Gala said. “He told us it’s been many years since he has heard something this fresh in music.”That’s good news for rock itself, given the fact that the genre is now often considered an old sound that’s past its peak. “We love rock,” Gala insisted. “But people have never heard it sound like this before. That’s why it’s connecting. It’s something new.”"

Bitter-sweet memories: Rachel Roddy's recipe for marmalade cake,Hand-me-down recipes come inseparably steeped in memories – such as this recipe for marmalade cake from an old friend that became etched into the family biography,Rachel Roddy,2019-10-21T12:00:28+0100,"The other day I opened a book to find a sentence, and a bit of paper fell out. As the square piece of block pad glided to the floor like a dead moth, I recognised it as a recipe for a ring cake written out for me not long after coming to Italy, about 14 years ago. I remember making the recipe several times, before using it as a bookmark that was left at page 76. What I don’t remember or recognise is whose neat writing it is.My memory lapse is frustrating. Sharing a recipe is an open-handed act, one made even more tangible if the person sharing has taken the time physically to write it out, maybe with notes, which is a small labour in these copy-and-photograph times.Even if the recipe given is never made, I want to remember where the Post-It lemon pudding or back-of-envelope braised chicken came from. And if the recipe becomes part of my cooking life, it is no different from a recipe from a book or famous chef: it absolutely must have that person attached to it, like a name tag sewn into a collar. Then, every time the recipe is made, the person and your relationship to them, whatever it was, is remembered. Even if it means you have to relive a tired exchange about authenticity, or be reminded that Mario subsequently left his wife for his secretary, recipes have names: Mario’s red-wine risotto; my elegant neighbour Vera’s creme caramel; Lise from Bavaria’s liver and apple.Shared name-tagged recipes are also a way of marking time. Years ago, I organised my mum’s loose recipes, gluing the loose-leaf pages and lips of envelopes into a book and noting where and who they came from. The book is now a sort of collective biography of our family – a strained one.Freda Coleman was a neighbour in the late 1970s, and her marmalade cake marks the margarine years. It was, and is, an ideal cake for a family with congenital marmalade dependency: a rich pound batter into which you stir orange marmalade, which bakes into a bitter-sweet cake. The icing is as good as the cake, which you zig- zag over the top where it then sets into a hard lattice that can be pulled off, although hopefully not from the entire cake as once happened.Part of the pleasure of a cake is the smell as it bakes: marmalade bakes into an almost toffee-like sweetness, and hopefully a bit of peel at the bottom of the cake catches and the smell of that, like dark treacle, assaults your senses.Recipes are only recipes, but they can become fixed points in our lives around which other things move: with them, we can measure time, places, people. Freda’s cake – now our family cake – is one such recipe. If I could only remember the name of the person who gave me the recipe that fell out of the book, that would have a name tag too. Until then, it is just a ring cake. Both cakes are good, but the marmalade triumphs for its amber chunks of peel and icing which, because cake is 50% pleasure, 50% habit, I still want to pull off before eating a slice.This is a cake of four equal parts, plus marmalade (thick-cut or thin, you decide). It is a preference based on habit, but a loaf tin (lined with parchment) seems the best tin for this cake.Prep 10 minCook 40 minMakes 1 loaf110g margarine or butter, at room temp110g sugar2 medium eggs110g self-raising flour4 heaped tbsp marmalade50g icing sugarHot waterBeat together the butter and sugar until soft and creamy. Beat in the eggs, followed by the flour, before stirring in three tablespoons of marmalade.Scape the mixture into a loaf tin lined with parchment. Bake at 170C (150C)/335F/gas 3 for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is puffed up and cracked, and a strand of spaghetti comes out clean.Leave to cool for 30 minutes, then lift the cake from the tin.To make the glaze, loosen the remaining tablespoon of marmalade with a little hot water, then brush the cake.Make a thick icing by mixing the icing sugar with just a little water, and zig-zag it over the cake, letting it dribble down the sides."
A South African shepherd's pie: Thomasina Miers' family recipe for bobotie,"An intriguing recipe handed down by Tommi’s mischievous nanna Mimi – a sort of South African, spicy version of shepherd’s pie called bobotie ",Thomasina Miers,2019-10-21T12:00:25+0100,"My maternal grandmother was known for being a tiddlywinks demon, having the naughtiest twinkle in her eye and, whenever she went home to South Africa, for disappearing into the bush to hang out with Zulu tribespeople – the people with whom she seemed to feel most at home. Her stories of her time there were always captivating, and of the recipes she made that were both homely and exotic, this was one of the best.Don’t be put off by the long list of ingredients – this is essentially a South African shepherd’s pie, only easier, with some lovely spicing thrown in.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 6-8Butter, for greasing4 tbsp olive oil3 onions, peeled and choppedSalt and black pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped2 bay leaves1½ tsp mustard seeds2 tsp curry powder½ tsp chilli flakes1 tsp turmeric1 ½ tsp garam masala1kg beef or lamb mince100ml red-wine or cider vinegar100g flaked almonds120g raisins50g fresh breadcrumbs75g fruit chutney (I like Tracklements’ Country Garden Chutney)For the topping3 eggs500ml whole milk3 bay leavesGrease a large baking dish and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. Warm a large, wide casserole pot over a medium heat and, when hot, add three tablespoons of oil.Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and sweat for 10 minutes, until soft. Stir in the garlic, bay leaves and spices and cook for another three to four minutes, until fragrant. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. When hot, season the meat with salt and pepper, and brown in the pan in two or three batches, breaking up the meat with a spoon and cooking until caramelised and dark. Once all the meat is browned, return the onion mixture to the pan and add the vinegar, almonds and raisins.Turn the heat down to low and simmer for five minutes, to allow the flavours to mingle. Take off the heat, stir in the breadcrumbs and chutney and check the seasoning. Transfer to the baking dish, smooth over with the back of a spoon and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes.To make the topping, beat together the eggs and milk and pour over the meat. Scatter over the bay leaves, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden and the custard just set. This is delicious served with brown rice and some greens.Leftover flaked almonds make the best biscuits. I love florentines, or you could mix them with honey and a little butter for a crunchy topping for shortbread. Leftover bobotie makes a killer filling for a jacket potato, so don’t eat it all at once."
Julie Taymor: how we made The Lion King musical,"‘The sheer idea of having a stampede on stage was exciting – the bigger the risk, the bigger the payoff’",Chris Wiegand,2019-10-22T06:01:14+0100,"It was a surprise to get the call from Disney. Their world wasn’t my aesthetic, but The Lion King’s story aligned with the myths, folktales and Shakespearean stories I had done. I’d never seen the film before and was totally taken with it. The sheer idea of staging a stampede was exciting. They gave me a lot of freedom. I was told: “The bigger the risk, the bigger the payoff.”Everybody acknowledged that the film’s story should be fleshed out. There were no good female roles. The Circle of Life – the first song – is sung by an anonymous woman in the movie. In a musical you see the singers, so we needed to ask which character is singing that song. I had just been working with the fantastic South African actor Thuli Dumakude and asked her if she could gather together South African singers for a reading. “Sadly, there are no good characters in it for people like you,” I said. “It’s always the case!” she replied. I asked her about shamans in South Africa and she told me they’re mostly women. Then I knew that Rafiki, the storyteller, should be female. She would be first on stage, bringing the animals together.The soul of this musical is South African choral singing and we mostly have South Africans playing Rafiki. For the wicked uncle Scar you need a Shakespearean actor because the singing is secondary to the acting. With the other characters you’re looking for people who can move really well and inhabit the puppets – that takes time and practice.The actors wear masks above their faces because I wanted to present the animal and the human simultaneously. When an animal attacks, the mask can be taken off and pushed forward in an aggressive manner. One of the first animals I designed was the giraffe. I wanted to use stilts but also show how they were attached to the arms of the dancers. We didn’t want to hide the strings or the rods [on any of the puppets] but rather expose the mechanics and let the art of making theatre become part of the experience. We put the whole thing together in five or six weeks of rehearsals and a three-week tech. The first performance was in Minneapolis and, two seconds in, the audience was on their feet screaming. We all burst into tears. You couldn’t hear the song! More than 100 million people have seen The Lion King now. It’s been on every continent apart from Antarctica. It changed my life. It was amazing to have a company like Disney take a chance on me – and on a kind of theatre that no one had seen before.I’d already been to Africa several times with my dance company, so we were comfortable with what these animals look like in the wild. When I saw the movie all my visions of Africa came back. Going over to Julie’s home and looking at her costume sketches was exciting. The biggest challenge was to get the dancers to try to be animal-like. As dancers, we love our bodies. Then here comes Julie with these fabulous designs that cover a lot of our bodies. I told them: “Trust me, it’s going to be magical.”There is a lot of dancing in The Lion King. Everybody dances … sooner or later! In lots of Broadway shows, the dancing is just the women coming out and shaking their you-know-what and smiling, and the men are just macho idiots. We wanted to get away from that stereotype and be broad, enriching, enticing human animals.I'm in my late 70s and I still bawl like a baby at the opening numberI had to be sure the movement was exciting and fresh and would grab the audience. People have paid for babysitters, tickets and transportation – I want them to come out of the theatre uplifted. There is so much to see in the show that you can miss something. Here I am in my late 70s and I still bawl like a baby at the opening number. I know every step, every turn and every feather that’s going to fly.The antelopes are my favourites. The dancers have an antelope puppet on each arm and one on their back and they can still leap. The hyenas might be the bad guys, but I wanted to be sure that they didn’t become stereotypical gangster types – they are also very witty creatures who get in and out of every situation imaginable. The show opens with a procession of all the animals and when I saw the antelopes leaping across the stage I said: “Oh lord, yes!” • The Lion King is at the Bristol Hippodrome until 23 November and continues at the Lyceum theatre in London."
"David Baddiel on God, gags and being trolled – 'It hurts and then I think: material!'","The comedian has written his first play – on whether science can prove that the Almighty exists. But first, there are some hecklers to deal with ... ",Brian Logan,2019-10-22T12:11:28+0100,"Schrödinger’s cat can be both alive and dead – so surely David Baddiel can be both a comedian and a playwright? When, in 2014, he launched his first solo comedy venture in 15 years, Fame: Not the Musical, he reports: “I had a constant struggle. People were saying ‘I’m coming to your play’, ‘I’ve heard great things about your play.’” Maybe it was because he’d chosen a theatre venue (the Menier Chocolate Factory in London) to premiere the show, but “ I would constantly have to say, ‘It’s not a play – it’s a one-man show.’” Baddiel is a comedian, to his fingertips. “I found it threatening to my identity,” he says now.He pauses, draws breath, and then: “But now I have written a play.” That’s why we’re back at the Menier, where God’s Dice is being prepped for its stage debut. The show is the 55-year-old’s first proper play: it’s not a one-man show, and he’s not performing in it. The droll fiftysomething role has been offered to fellow standup Alan Davies, of Jonathan Creek fame – now cast as a physics lecturer who co-authors a book with his Christian student, proving the Bible’s miracles to be scientifically possible. For a religious readership, it’s manna from heaven. Henry is hailed as the new messiah – to the chagrin of his Dawkins-alike celebrity atheist wife.Baddiel is in the rehearsal room today, at the shoulder of director James Grieve, who is staging Henry’s book launch, at which wife and student come to ideological blows. Afterwards, I ask Baddiel if he enjoys hearing his words brought to life. “I find it difficult,” he says, “particularly with the comedy. Give a director a dramatic scene and they can direct it in 20 different ways that might all be equally valid. If you give them a reveal gag and they direct it wrongly, it’s like playing the wrong notes, and it won’t get a laugh.”Baddiel’s experience of writing for others was on the musical – then the movie – The Infidel, to whose director, Josh Appignanesi, he made himself “a fucking pain in the arse on set”, demanding retakes when his gags weren’t delivered just right. The thing is, Baddiel explains – and he has discussed this with his wife, and fellow comedy writer, Morwenna Banks – “it feels like you’re getting cancer, like some terrible tumour is growing inside of you, when you see your lines being done wrong.” Pause. “I apologise to everyone who might be offended by that metaphor.”So he’s on his best behaviour in rehearsals for God’s Dice, straining to trust Grieve (who is “fucking brilliant”) and keep his mouth shut. Not easy, of course, when jokes are your currency – and when even the play’s more substantial material is personal. “I’ve been reading a lot about physics,” says Baddiel. “I think it’s to do with my dad” – who worked as a research chemist for Unilever and brought up his family “heavily under the influence of science”. Baddiel pere, who now has dementia, formed 50% of the subject of My Family: Not the Sitcom, Baddiel’s tender and flabbergasting 2016 show about his parents and their eccentric relationships. Following on from Fame, it situated mid-career Baddiel in a creative purple patch, far removed from the laddish comedy for which, in the 90s, he made his name.They say don't feed the trolls. But as a comedian, you don’t ignore hecklers, you work with them“I think there’s been a return of the repressed, or something,” he says, because, “in my 50s, I’ve become obsessed with physics.” Deeply submerged in that obsession, he noticed something. “Essentially, quantum physics is a leap of faith. Its truths are not exactly unprovable but they’re certainly unseeable. You have to believe in them. So there’s a parallel between believing in quantum physics and believing in God.”Baddiel began to wonder: what if a physicist experienced a crisis of the faith required to pursue his subject? Might one arrive at religious belief, not out of ignorance, but out of high intelligence? Behind that inquiry is Baddiel’s memories of his old mucker – and Fantasy Football League sidekick – Frank Skinner. “Before I met Frank,” he recalls, “I’d never met a very, very intelligent person who deeply believed in God, and that was really challenging to me as an atheist.”The play’s other source was a Brian Cox lecture that Baddiel had attended, at which the physicist proposed the possibility of a diamond leaping by itself out of a velvet bag and reappearing elsewhere in the theatre. Admittedly, says Baddiel, it was “a very unlikely possibility. But in a multi-world universe, it doesn’t matter how unlikely something is. If it’s possible, it must be happening somewhere. And that’s a miracle isn’t it – a diamond leaping suddenly out of a velvet bag? A scientifically possible miracle.”All of these revelations might challenge what Baddiel, who is culturally Jewish, describes as his “fundamental atheism”. It’s a point of pride with him, certainly, that God’s Dice is not an atheist play. “Believers have read it, scientists have read it” (including the physicist Jim Al-Khalili), and everyone credits its open-mindedness on the overlaps between faith and science. Baddiel himself remains a sceptic, albeit one who admits the play is borne of a spiritual crisis of sorts. “As I get older and nearer death, I really want to understand the world before I die. And I don’t believe in God, so maybe this – physics – is the way to understand it.“But [theoretical physicist] Richard Feynman said, ‘If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics.’ And I don’t understand it. Sometimes when I read these books, I feel like I understand it for a minute – and then, ‘Oh no, I don’t understand it again.’ Intellectually, it’s very frustrating.” There is consolation, though, in fashioning that near-miss incomprehension into stories – which Baddiel now sees as his stock in trade. “I genuinely do not recognise borders between different kinds of storytelling,” says the novelist, screenwriter, and writer of hit children’s books. “If you’re good at storytelling, you should be able to apply the idea to whatever genre fits it best.”As if to prove the point, he’s drafting a new standup show – or at least as close as he gets to standup, now that “theatrical one-man show” is more his bag. Trolls: Not the Dolls will tour in 2020, and addresses Baddiel’s self-confessed dependence on social media. (“I would say it’s got a bit out of hand for me…”) It was born of the moment when, faced with a “don’t feed the trolls” campaign by fellow celebs, he thought: “That’s not right for me. To me they’re hecklers. They’re people calling me a cunt, or telling me I’m shit. And as a comedian, you don’t ignore hecklers, you work with them.”As his 624,000 Twitter followers will know, Baddiel devotes time to outsmarting his online tormentors. The new show will trace these relationships through his 10 years on the platform, and will ask: “Why is everybody so angry? What is anger doing for people? Why is everything so polarised? Social media involves people not imagining how the other person feels while raging at them. So the battle is to restore empathy to this empathy-less world.” But isn’t it painful to walk towards all of this hostility? “If someone slags me off on social media,” says Baddiel, “I definitely still feel a stab of hurt and vulnerability. And then I think: material!”Trolls will be, he says, his most political show, and one that stakes out the kinds of dark territory into which a prominent Jewish person online can easily be lured. Baddiel is also making a BBC documentary about Holocaust denial – and conjuring with a second play, about #MeToo. He eye-rolls with trepidation at that possibility, mindful that not everyone wants to hear the well-off, middle-aged straight man’s take on gender politics. But he resists the suggestion that comedy is under threat from a new censoriousness.Unpleasant and awful things sometimes need to be said in comedy – and how you get there is the art“I’ve a problem with the polarisation of that conversation,” says the man whose Radio 4 show Don’t Make Me Laugh was cancelled after broadcasting a supposedly off-colour remark about the Queen. “The idea that, ‘Oh, we’re over here with the free speech and offensiveness, and you’re over there with the woke comedy.’ I don’t think it should be seen like that.”Baddiel chooses to stake out a space for independent thinking. “More and more, I don’t map any received political viewpoint on to what I say in my work. I’d rather ask myself, ‘What do I actually think about this thing?’” And he craves nuance. “Unpleasant and awful things sometimes need to be said in comedy – and how you get there is the art. Fewer people seem to be able to understand this, but someone can be a brilliant comedian and say stuff that is unacceptable. Those things are entirely compatible.”It’s a quantum physics way of thinking from a comic committed to keeping contradictory possibilities alive. Comedy/theatre, science/religion, brilliant/unacceptable – and emotional/meaningless. “Something about religion will always be immensely powerful, aesthetically and emotionally,” he says, while his new play comes to life in the room next door. “But I do believe that life is meaningless finally. It’s fucking brilliant. But then it’s gone and that’s it.”That’s not a cheerless conclusion. “I say, accept the meaninglessness – and enjoy yourself in whatever way you can.”God’s Dice is at Soho theatre, London, from 24 October to 30 November. Trolls: Not the Dolls tours from 24 January."
Vassa review – revolutionary attack on moribund politics,"Almeida, LondonSiobhan Redmond is impressive as a tyrannical mother trying to rescue her debt-ridden family in Tinuke Craig’s strangely rootless production",Michael Billington,2019-10-22T00:01:45+0100,"This production of Maxim Gorky’s play suffered a setback when Samantha Bond had to withdraw from the title role but Siobhan Redmond has stepped into the breach with great elan. She gives a highly impressive performance as Gorky’s domineering matriarch but, although Mike Bartlett’s version begins with a caption telling us “the play is set before a revolution – capitalism is showing its age,” it seems, like Tinuke Craig’s production, strangely rootless.The first issue is which text to use. They opt for Gorky’s 1911 version rather than his 1935 revision, which is a more explicit attack on a moribund political system. What we get is a robust drama about a merchant-class family struggling to survive. Vassa, the tyrannical mother trying to rescue a debt-ridden business, despises her weakling sons, regards her daughter with wary suspicion, seeks to poison her voracious brother-in-law and forges a will to ensure future control. Even when she describes her dying husband as “promiscuous, violent, overbearing” you feel it is less in tones of moral condemnation than grudging admiration.Gorky’s play is clearly a portrait of insidious corruption in pre-revolutionary Russia. Bartlett and Craig, however, strip it of any historical context to give us a blackly comic account of the destructive nature of the profit-driven family. Even Fly Davis’s set, with its multiple upstage doors, suggests we are close to farce. The result is that we lose the play’s sense of particularity and, in her 21st-century diverse casting, Craig reinforces the sense that we are in a time-free zone.Individual performances are good. Redmond fearlessly shows the cost to Vassa of her merciless manipulation: left alone, she crumbles into despair or hides under a desk. Amber James as her equally strong-willed daughter, Danny Kirrane and Arthur Hughes as her neurotically insecure sons and Michael Gould as her lecherous brother-in-law – typically described as “a randy old shit” – all make a positive impression. But, if the intention is to suggest the play’s relevance to our own wayward times, I would rather be allowed to draw my own conclusions from Gorky’s damning historical evidence.At the Almeida, London, until 23 November."
Fierce festival review – a daring whirl of theatrical thrills,"Various venues, BirminghamAided by hula hoops, raw chicken and animatronic dogs, the performers in this six-day series of shows embarked on a quest for emotional connections",Gareth Llŷr Evans,2019-10-21T11:28:43+0100,"Communion, empathy, resistance and joy … Writing in the programme of this year’s beautifully curated Fierce festival, artistic director Aaron Wright said that these were the elements that characterised this six-day festival – and these four qualities were abundant in the performances I saw. As was, appropriately enough, a fierce sincerity.Communion featured in Belgian artist Miet Warlop’s astounding and exhilarating Ghost Writer and the Broken Hand Break. Warlop and two other performers whirled away while remaining in lit circles for 45 minutes. Its simple act of balance and velocity rendered extraordinary through repetition and duration, made all the more impressive with music and percussion that made me feel as if my blood was vibrating.Gillie Kleiman and Greg Wohead’s Familiar, with its focus on empathy, consisted of two works – Study in Significant Otherness created by Kleiman and performed by Wohead, and Dog Years, created by Wohead and performed by Kleiman. Aided by two animatronic dogs, it’s a neat conceptual conceit, with both works to-ing and fro-ing around the impossibility of knowing everything about another person.In the first part, Wohead performed a sequence of static canine gestures that evolved into a long sequence of movement under a dim red light. The second work was looser in tone and structure, with Kleiman parroting Wohead’s words as they were spoken into her ear. As she repeatedly asserted that she was here to make a meaningful connection with us, there was a playful, tentative ambivalence about whether it’s possible to fulfil such a promise.Meanwhile, resistance was Lucy McCormick’s theme. Offering a preview of her soon to be released narrative concept album, Life: Live! was a balls-to-the-wall skewering of the misogyny and exploitation that underpin popular culture. While McCormick moves and sings like the most glamorous of arena-filling pop princesses, her shonky-spectacular aesthetic is anything but: it is cold, wet and even humiliating. But it’s all on her terms. This is no easy, ironic parody: it is extreme and often looks dangerous. Her fearless commitment to this contradiction is what makes McCormick’s performances so thrilling.Whether doused in paint and water, frozen meals and raw chicken, or hanging from the rafters, whipping the crowd into a frenzy, McCormick and her backup dancers could lead the revolution.Finally, various moments of joy: Oozing Gloop in The Gloop Show, insisting on a better future as she hula-hooped; the care and precision with which names were spoken and choreographed in Mariana Valencia’s moving, autobiographical Album; the moment when one child stretched out her arms and led her own dance for the first time in Nicola Gunn’s Working With Children."
The real David Attenborough,"He is the most beloved figure in Britain, and, at 93, a global superstar. His films long shied away from discussing humanity’s impact on the planet. Now they are sounding the alarm – but is it too late? By  Patrick Barkham",Patrick Barkham,2019-10-22T06:01:15+0100,"In the late 1980s, a meeting was convened at the BBC studios on Whiteladies Road in Bristol. Its participants – mainly amiable former public schoolboys named Mike – discussed the imminent retirement of a grey-haired freelancer, who had been working with the BBC for almost four decades. “We need to think about who is going to take over from David when this series is finished,” a junior producer, Mike Gunton, remembered his boss saying. David Attenborough was nearing 65 and putting the finishing touches to The Trials of Life, the third of his epic series about the natural world. These programmes had been broadcast around the globe. They had established a new genre, perhaps even a new language, of wildlife films. It was a fine legacy. Now it was time to go.When Alastair Fothergill became head of the BBC Natural History Unit a few years later, executives were still worrying over the same question. The BBC director-general asked him to find a new David Attenborough. “I remember thinking, that’s not very sensible,” said Fothergill. “He has always been this great oak tree under which it’s been hard for a sapling to grow.” Today, Mike Gunton has ascended the ranks to become creative director of the Natural History Unit. He still attends meetings on Whiteladies Road. But, three decades after the subject was first broached, finding the next David Attenborough is no longer on the agenda. “We still haven’t got an answer and I don’t want one,” Gunton told me.Attenborough was born on 8 May 1926, 17 days after the Queen. And, like the Queen, he has become a symbol of stability in a turbulent world. It is hard to imagine a time before he was on our screens, affably engaging with sloths or giant turtles – partly because there wasn’t. Television was invented the year after he was born, and only began to enter people’s homes in the 1950s, when he was beginning his career. The first programme he made was watched by barely 10,000 people gazing at 405 flickering black-and-white lines on large boxes in living rooms in the south-east of England. This spring, his series Our Planet became Netflix’s most-watched original documentary, watched by 33 million people in its first month. This autumn, the BBC will broadcast Seven Worlds, One Planet, the 19th blockbuster series he has written and presented (add a zero and then some if also counting his pre-70s series, short series and one-offs). The television executives who keep offering this 93-year-old freelancer bountiful employment agree that he is more powerful than ever.Attenborough and the Queen are more than just contemporaries. “I see them quite a lot,” Attenborough said of the royal family when I met him at his home in Richmond earlier this year. He first encountered the Queen’s children, Charles and Anne, in 1958, when they toured the BBC’s Lime Grove studios and the young presenter introduced them to his pet cockatoo, Cocky. In 1986, the year after Attenborough was knighted, he produced the first of six Christmas broadcasts for the Queen. Earlier this year, he was interviewed by Prince William on stage at Davos; the future king asked him for advice on how best to save the planet.In our fractured age, Attenborough is the closest we have to a universally beloved public figure. Last year, a YouGov poll found him to be the most popular person in Britain. The crowd at Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage roared when he appeared on stage this summer. Viewers of Love Island expressed outrage when one contestant declared she found his programmes boring. But Attenborough transcended national treasure status some years ago. He is a truly global figure now. So many Chinese viewers downloaded Blue Planet II “that it temporarily slowed down the country’s internet”, according to the Sunday Times. The premiere of his new series, which took place earlier this month in London, was broadcast live in South Africa and India, where rapt schoolchildren held up signs: “Thank you for being you – Sir David A” and “Sir David please come to India please”. As he moves from the White House to the World Economic Forum, urging presidents, businesspeople and the public to better protect the environment, he has come to be viewed, in a way he sees as overblown, as a keeper of humanity’s conscience. “That man who saves the world,” is how my seven-year-old daughter describes him.“There will never be another David Attenborough. What makes him special, apart from all his personal qualities, is the timing of his life,” said Fothergill. When Attenborough began travelling the world in the 1950s, Fothergill noted, we were in a different geological epoch, the Holocene. Today, we live in the Anthropocene, an epoch defined by Homo sapiens’ disruptive dominance of the planet. “He’s seen more of the natural world than any human being that has ever lived on the planet and he’s also seen more change than anyone else. And he feels a responsibility.”Despite the adulation, one charge has dogged Attenborough for decades. Critics argue that he has built himself a unique storytelling platform, only to fail to tell the most important story of all: the destructive impact of people on the planet. But one reason Attenborough has thrived on screen for seven decades is because he has always sensed how attitudes are changing, and moved with the times. For a long time, he maintained that his programmes must showcase the wonders of the natural world, and not speak of the human one. Now his newest series are filled with urgent messages about environmental destruction. Still, he resists the idea that he has changed; he prefers to say that it is the public mood that has transformed. After a lifetime of caution, almost despite himself, he has become a leading champion for action.Attenborough fell in love with the natural world as a boy, exploring his way through his neighbourhood in Leicester, looking for bugs, insects and amphibians. The middle child of three brothers, he grew up in a family of teachers. His father was principal of University College, Leicester. His mother was a talented pianist. Education was revered. When I met Attenborough in the spring, he spoke of his boyhood passions – keeping tanks of tropical fish, venturing across northern England on his bike as a young teen, alone, in search of fossils.To this day, Attenborough is still a collector – of tribal art, books and music – but although more than a dozen species are named after him, including a flightless weevil, Trigonopterus Attenboroughi, and a genus of dinosaur, Attenborosaurus, he is not an authority on natural history. “Everyone thinks he’s an amazing naturalist,” said the producer and writer Mary Colwell, who worked with him at the Natural History Unit in the 2000s. “He isn’t at all. He’s a great storyteller. Everyone thinks he makes these programmes. He doesn’t – but without him they wouldn’t sparkle in the way they do.”Attenborough agrees. “Work and reputation get separated,” he said. Forty years ago, he travelled around the world three times in order to make his groundbreaking series Life on Earth. He wrote the script, and every page of the accompanying book. “But now I just write and speak the words. And people say: ‘What was it like when you saw that animal charging in?’ And I say: ‘I wasn’t there. Thirty cameramen worked on this thing.’ I’m given credit for things I don’t do. I am grateful, but I’m also embarrassed.”It is even worse, he said, when viewers assume he is a source of scientific wisdom. “OK, I was a biologist once, but I’m a hopeless birder. If I go out with a birder I keep my mouth shut. I just nod. ‘Mmmm. Mmmm.’ So to use a horrible word, I’ve become a kind of icon. Using it in its original meaning, I’m the image of what they think of as a naturalist. I’m a reasonable naturalist, but I’m not the great all-seeing source of all information, knowledge and understanding.” At times, Attenborough’s self-deprecation almost sounds like imposter syndrome. When I asked him to list his failings as a person, he narrowed his eyes. “I’m too convincing,” he laughed, comparing his own expertise unfavourably to other wildlife broadcasters such as Simon King and Liz Bonnin. “When it comes to, as it were, conning your way through, I’m not bad at it. Never identify things unnecessarily.”Even so, plenty of colleagues recall Attenborough relishing his ability to surprise them with his knowledge. Jonny Keeling, the executive producer of Seven Worlds, One Planet, was excited to show his presenter never-obtained-before footage from China of a golden snub-nosed monkey. “‘Oh yes, Rhinopithecus roxellana,’” remembered Attenborough instantly: he knew all about it and had tried to film it many years before.The only praise Attenborough will accept is for his skill as a storyteller. Robert Attenborough, David’s son and an anthropologist at the University of Cambridge, remembered, as a teenager, “watching him in the raconteur role as a host of a dinner party and admiring the skill with which he would tell a funny story. Sometimes they get slightly improved. That’s something we used to tease him about. Of course he wouldn’t do that, then or now, when making a serious point.”Attenborough’s storytelling has been honed over seven decades in television – and he is, above all, a TV man. After studying natural sciences at Cambridge, he married his university sweetheart, Jane Oriel, and ditched his boring junior publishing job for the glamorous new world of television. He started off behind the camera, after one of his first bosses decided his teeth were too big for a presenter. In 1954, Attenborough travelled to Sierra Leone with Jack Lester, London Zoo’s curator of reptiles, to film a new series, Zoo Quest. The concept was simple: they would catch wild animals – their bounty from Sierra Leone included pythons, bird-eating spiders and their big prize, the bald-headed rockfowl – and bring them back to London to add to the zoo’s collection. At the outset, Attenborough was the producer, director, sound man and animal-wrangler. He only ended up being the presenter because Lester was taken ill after the first episode.Zoo Quest was broadcast in black and white, but the original colour footage, which was later discovered by BBC archivists, is beautiful. Attenborough narrates his encounters in clipped, 1950s, BBC-issue received pronunciation, with little trace of his more expressive later style. Although the colonial animal-snatching conceit of Zoo Quest is extremely dated, each episode focuses as much on the human worlds he visits as the exotic animals. Attenborough’s script is factual, respectful and open-minded; his films unsensationally depict nudity, polygamy and other cultural traditions, alongside the animal hunt.Over the next few years, new series of Zoo Quest appeared and Attenborough’s reputation grew. With his keen eye for the perceptions of his TV audience, he adapted cannily to a rapidly expanding industry. By the dawn of the 60s, as he admitted in his autobiography, Zoo Quest was looking “increasingly antiquated”. He realised that it was time for a new approach. His next Quest series, filmed in northern Australia, eschewed attempts to bring animals home and instead depicted the cultural lives of Aboriginal peoples.The trip to Australia inspired him to take a part-time postgraduate degree in anthropology, but he was tempted back to full-time TV work before he could complete it. In 1965, he became controller of BBC Two, an appointment greeted with scepticism by “TV professionals” quoted in newspaper columns of the day. At first, he was considered lightweight, a youthful bit of eye-candy, but he was soon hailed for his “unexpected” success, as a Daily Express profile put it. “Everybody forgot I wasn’t just a naturalist – I was always a trained TV man,” he told the paper in 1965. “Hell, I love it. I watch everything. Straight home from the office – switch to BBC Two – see all my babies.”As the channel’s controller and then director of programmes for both BBC channels, Attenborough was a great innovator. In 1967, the government decided that BBC Two would become the first channel to switch to colour, and he set about exploiting this advantage. He put snooker on the channel and helped devise new forms of sport: one-day cricket and rugby league under floodlights. Programmes that emerged under his watch include Dad’s Army, Porridge and Monty Python’s Flying Circus. In 1972, he championed “community programming” that included what has been described as the first sympathetic portrayal of transgender people on British television; he even suggested phone-ins to widen audience participation, years before they became a staple of TV and radio.One of his lasting innovations was the all-you-need-to-know documentary, beginning with Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation. Attenborough designed this epic, 12-part series about the history of art and culture to showcase the glory of colour television. These monumental series became known as “sledgehammers”, and there followed uncompromisingly highbrow treatments of human evolution, economics and US history. But Attenborough believed the best subject for sledgehammer treatment was yet to come: natural history.Attenborough’s achievements at BBC Two made him a prime candidate for director-general, the top job at the corporation. But he was tiring of the senior executive’s life – desk-bound, constant meetings – and in the early 70s he resigned. “The fact he didn’t want to stay as an executive and wanted to go back to programming says something very important about him,” his son Robert told me. Attenborough yearned to be more creative, and had seen the thankless politics involved in the top job. “The Archangel Gabriel couldn’t do the DG’s job,” he remarked to me.Instead, he persuaded the BBC that he could create a Civilisation-style treatment of the evolution of plants and animals. This series took three years to make, and the budget was so big that Attenborough had to pitch to US networks for funding. (He still enjoys impersonating a sceptical American TV man aghast at the prospect of funding a series that opened with “slime mould”.)Life on Earth was broadcast for 55 minutes on 13 consecutive Sunday evenings in 1979. It “started quietly,” according to Mike Salisbury, a former producer who worked on the programme. Despite the presence of a safari-suited Attenborough, binoculars around his neck, skipping between exotic locations, the early episodes often feel like a lecture with moving pictures. Our handsome presenter tries to make the best of diagrams of DNA, micro-organisms and 200m-year-old fossils. “A whole lot of worms have left this delicate tracery of trails in what was mud,” he enthuses in the Grand Canyon. Salisbury chuckled at the difficulty of bringing this to life on television: “Fossils, for God’s sake. They don’t even move.”But as its epic story slowly unfolds, the series warms up. The writing is often superb: “Four million animals and plants in the world,” says Attenborough, “four million different solutions to staying alive.” The penultimate episode, on primates, features the first memorable Attenborough “two shot”, where he appears alongside another animal. He joins a grooming session among mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and still has the presence-of-mind to whisper: “There is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with a gorilla than any other animal I know.” Although some facts have changed – we now know there are more than 8m species, not 4m – the series stands the test of time; one Cambridge professor still shows his undergraduates the primates episode each year.For old-timers at the BBC, history is divided into before and after Life on Earth. “We hadn’t realised what a game-changer it was going to be,” said Salisbury. “By the end there were 14 million people watching it.” The series established what television executives call the “blue-chip” natural history blockbuster. While the BBC has relinquished its dominance over most genres, it remains the pre-eminent maker of natural history programmes, according to Fothergill. So much of that “is down to David”, he said. Much imitated, these blockbusters are still a huge global export: the BBC will not reveal what profit, if any, these series make, but Planet Earth II and Blue Planet II were sold to more than 235 territories.After the success of Life on Earth, Attenborough spent much of the 80s completing what became a triumvirate of blue-chip behemoths, with The Living Planet exploring ecology and The Trials of Life revealing animal behaviour. He also turned his attention to series about less fashionable subjects: plants, spiders, stick insects and other invertebrates. Audiences liked his enthusiasm, his quick wit and his affection for animals, already evident from his early days bottle-feeding a tiny African bush rat in Zoo Quest.From Natural History Unit veterans such as Salisbury to colleagues today, everyone paints the same picture of Attenborough “in the field”: a team-player, carrying kit, energetic, curious, without vanity, funny, not suffering fools and preternaturally lucky. Everyone has a story about him joining a crew that has lucklessly staked out a target species for two weeks, only for that creature – whether Hungarian mayfly or polar bear – to suddenly hove into view. “I don’t like presenters on the whole. I don’t think they are particularly nice people,” one producer told me. But Attenborough was different. “He’s not a prima donna. He’s not an ego on a stick. He doesn’t need to be now.”By the early 80s, Attenborough’s programmes had been broadcast around the world and he became recognised wherever he went. But he was not yet, to use another label that vexes him, a global superstar. Until recently, when Attenborough’s series were shown on US television, broadcasters would replace his narration with voices they thought an American audience would prefer. In 2010, when Life was broadcast in the US, Oprah Winfrey was the narrator.Viewers tend to assume Attenborough writes every word he says on screen, while TV people think his lines are written for him. The truth is somewhere in between. Attenborough’s scripts are written by production teams, but he is an unusually rigorous editor and rewriter. Even today, Attenborough rewrites each script to fit his own turn of phrase and checks for accuracy. “If I send him a script, he goes through it with a fine-tooth comb. More than any other presenter,” said Mary Colwell. “His attention to detail is incredible and he won’t say anything he doesn’t want to say.”When filming, according to Mike Gunton, Attenborough does not learn his lines precisely. “He looks at it and comes back and says: ‘What do you think if I say it like this?’ His turn of phrase and the way he delivers these turns of phrase – it’s got such power. He has the same genes as his brother,” meaning Richard, the Oscar-winning actor-director, who died in 2014. “I’ve often said he’s as good a performer as his brother,” Gunton said. “You change the pace, you change the timbre, you change the mood, and the commentary has organic flow,” Attenborough told me. “If the last sentence ended 10 seconds ago rather than one minute ago, you start in a different kind of way. I don’t think other people do that. It’s a craft, and I quite enjoy it, actually.” His colleagues think his voice has improved with age. “If you go back to the older programmes, even on Blue Planet [from 2001], it’s quite a clipped voice,” said Fothergill. “It’s now the voice of an older man, but it’s become even more powerful, with a timbre and an emotional resonance.”By his own admission, it took some time for Attenborough to realise just what a threat humankind posed to the environment. When he was younger, he said, people knew of species that had gone extinct, such as the Arabian oryx and the dodo, but “you didn’t perceive it as a major ecological problem. And in point of fact, let’s be honest, if the Hawaiian goose disappears, the world doesn’t actually judder in its revolutions.” It wasn’t until Life on Earth that he came to see that species decline was systemic and “actually the disappearance of the giant panda represented some major change”.For most of his life, Attenborough’s environmentalism has been the old-fashioned, off-screen variety, lending his support to numerous green charities. Ever since he was asked, as a bit of a joke, to open a visitor centre at a nature reserve by the village of Attenborough in Nottinghamshire, in 1966, he has given rousing speeches (I have seen several) at hundreds of events for nature charities across Britain. It is hard to find a visitor centre at a Wildlife Trust nature reserve that does not feature a silver plaque declaring that it was “Opened by Sir David Attenborough”.To his critics, these good deeds do not make up for what they see as Attenborough’s great failing as a broadcaster. Putting the case for the prosecution, the journalist George Monbiot has accused Attenborough of “knowingly creating a false impression of the world” by making films that underplay humanity’s impact on the planet and fail to identify the forces driving mass extinction and the climate crisis. Another environmentalist told me that Attenborough possesses irreproachable integrity, but his long silence on extinction and global warming in his television work has contributed towards a popular knowledge deficit.Richard Mabey, a naturalist who worked in television before almost single-handedly reviving British nature writing, has long made a version of this argument. “When Life on Earth came out in 1979, and The Living Planet five years later, I was concerned about the fact that this wasn’t a place I recognised,” Mabey told me. “What one saw was magnificent, but it was what one didn’t see – no humans, no environmental degradation. It was like an idealised biosphere on another planet.” Once, in the early 80s, Mabey bumped into Attenborough at a lunch. “I asked him, genuinely curious, why this picture of the planet was so devoid of environmental strife? He said, very simply: ‘We wouldn’t have got the viewers, they would have turned off.’ I was quite distressed.”TV executives repeat Attenborough’s argument today. A blue-chip series costs millions to produce and requires global funding. BBC programme-makers are terrified of being seen as “political”. At the launch of Seven Worlds, One Planet, Keeling insisted that it’s not “preachy”. As Miles Barton, a long-standing Attenborough producer, put it: “The more preachy you are, the lower the numbers are going to be.” The lower the numbers, the less money the series will make, the less funding for the next. Mabey understood this equation. “Attenborough has power over the audience,” he said. “I’m not sure he has power over the money men. My initial worry about him not including environmental disasters in his early series may have been less his personal choice than corporate pressure.”As a young producer, it was drilled into Attenborough that private convictions must not be aired in public. He has always upheld the values of the liberal establishment – avowedly internationalist and anti-populist in his veneration of expertise – and taken the traditional BBC line on party-political neutrality. “I’m not a political chap, I know about bugs,” he protested when asked about Brexit in 2017. (When pushed, he revealed that he voted to remain.)Like most in the Natural History Unit, Attenborough has also long defended his work with a “show the wonders and then people will care” argument. When we spoke earlier this year, Attenborough put it more bluntly: “People ought to be concerned because they think the natural world is important. If they know nothing about the natural world they won’t care a toss.”To a sympathetic observer, the lack of campaigning films in Attenborough’s oeuvre might look like a canny political calculation about the most effective way to shift popular opinion over the long-term. But it may just reflect his temperament. “I made natural history programmes not because I was a rampaging proselytiser preaching about conservation,” he told me. “I like looking at animals and seeing what they do.” Attenborough praises more outspoken broadcasters, such as Chris Packham. “Chris is to be admired, actually, because he would sacrifice his career in the name of something that he thought was important about conservation. He would. And more strength to his elbow,” he said. But that is not Attenborough’s way. He acknowledged that he would “probably not” ever risk getting banned from the BBC.In public, he has always been reserved. Journalists have often noted his refusal to emote in interviews. This image of an emotionally repressed English gentleman, a man of his era, is not his private self at all, says his son. “I regard him as an exception to all the rules of English maleness,” said Robert. “In personal life, he’s not shy with his emotions. I would not see him as a classic English male in that sense – he’s a warmer person, a more expressive person than that.” When Attenborough’s wife, Jane, died 20 years ago, “his grief was intense and fully expressed,” remembered Robert.Even so, his public reticence and natural caution have made the final stage of his career all the more striking.In November 2004, nearly 20 years after the phrase “global warming” was first coined, Attenborough attended a lecture in Belgium given by Ralph Cicerone, an American expert on atmospheric chemistry. The graphs that Cicerone presented, showing the rise in global temperatures, finally convinced Attenborough, beyond any doubt, that humans were responsible for the changing climate. Attenborough insists he was never a sceptic about man-made climate change; just cautious. Even after Cicerone’s lecture, he still believed his job was to make programmes about wildlife. He worried that people would think he was setting himself up as an expert on climate science.Attenborough’s output changed, however. This distinction may mystify those beyond the Natural History Unit, but its film-makers distinguish between natural history and “environmental” film-making. The former focus on animal or plant biology and behaviour; the latter address environmental issues. Attenborough’s 2006 BBC two-parter, The Truth About Climate Change, was his first to address global warming explicitly. Three years later came How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?, which reflected his long-standing concern over the rising human population. (Attenborough’s position incurred criticism from some who argued he was focusing more on environmental harm caused by poorer nations rather than over-consumption by wealthier populations.) This year came a new Attenborough BBC documentary, Climate Change: The Facts. Next year, the BBC will broadcast another, Extinction: The Facts.The arrival of Blue Planet II in 2017 heralded a new urgency to Attenborough’s blockbusters, helping transform popular attitudes towards waste and pollution with its images of plastic enveloping a turtle, and albatrosses unwittingly feeding plastic bags to their chicks. When I interviewed Attenborough this spring, his Netflix series Our Planet had not yet been released. It was billed as a significantly more pressing appeal to save the world, and Fothergill, its producer, was keen to assert its environmental credentials. Attenborough, meanwhile, seemed equally keen to assert that it wasn’t so different to his earlier work: “If you forget the flummery and the propaganda and the press releases, what does it do? It shows the most breathtaking sequences you’ve ever seen – beauty, wonder, spectacles filmed in a way that you never saw before, with drones and in fabulous colour, with surging music, and so on, and then at the end, it says it’s all in danger. That’s what they do. I’m not ashamed of that. I think it’s a perfectly valid thing.”But the strange thing, when you sat down to watch Our Planet, was that it did not match Attenborough’s billing. Each episode began with him discussing the moon landing. “Since then, the human population has more than doubled,” his voiceover continued. “This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain, and reveal what we must preserve to ensure that people and nature thrive.” The series returned, relentlessly, to this manifesto. It explained the importance of rainforest for a habitable climate, and almost no stunning sequence of wild animals came without Attenborough emphasising the precariousness of their continued existence. Likewise, in Seven Worlds, One Planet, the environmental messages are no longer restricted to an appeal at the end of each episode. The first story about the impact of climate change comes 16 minutes into the opening episode. Throughout, there are sequences that highlight the human actions – climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, poaching – causing Earth’s sixth great planetary extinction. “We are a behavioural wildlife show and we’ve got a whole sequence without an animal in it – that’s a remarkable change,” said the series producer, Scott Alexander.This shift in Attenborough’s work reflects a response by film-makers, and particularly the Natural History Unit, to accusations that they have pulled punches in the past. Yet, as his protestations suggest, being “environmental” has not come easily to Attenborough. “I don’t think he’s naturally an environmentalist at all,” said one former colleague. “He’s not eloquent when it comes to environmentalism. But you can’t take away his intelligence, his understanding of the zeitgeist and his integrity.” According to the source, Attenborough was initially reluctant to include the plastics story in Blue Planet II, worrying once again that “it would be a turn-off”. If that was the case – and senior BBC executives deny it – by the time the series was broadcast in 2017, Attenborough was fully behind the plastics episode. “David really led on the plastics thing, talking about plastics before the series went out,” said the producer Miles Barton.At 93, Attenborough is more in demand than ever. Susan, his daughter, keeps a watchful eye on him and tries in vain to scale back his speaking engagements and charitable commitments. (He has never put his name to any commercial product.) The BBC want him to narrate Planet Earth III, but he will be 96 when the time comes. Meanwhile, he devotes most of his considerable stamina to appealing for radical action to tackle the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. In Poland, at the UN climate change summit in 2018, he was chosen to represent the world’s people in addressing leaders from almost 200 nations. At Davos, in early 2019, he questioned the wisdom of perpetual economic growth: only “a madman or an economist” would cling to this notion, he argued.Earlier this month, Attenborough launched Seven Worlds, One Planet with an exhausting round of interviews to journalists from six continents, while a police helicopter buzzed over Extinction Rebellion protests on the streets of London. At the premiere, when I asked if he was comfortable about his films inspiring Extinction Rebellion, he replied sharply: “Extinction Rebellion doesn’t have the monopoly of people who care about the planet. That’s a section of people who care about the planet, but everybody should care about the planet. We’re citizens of the planet. We have the dominance of it and we ought to care about it.”Attenborough has been supportive of school climate strikers, and likes to suggest that the planet now belongs in younger hands. He remains visibly fascinated by all kinds of life and social change around him, but instinctively cleaves to the role of his lifetime – as an interested observer, watching a new generation clamouring for environmental change. “I’ve had my share of the platform. I’d be better off standing apart from it and trying to be as dispassionate as I can,” he told me last week. “I’m old and they are young. They have their own techniques and their own ethos. It’s their world, not mine, that’s for sure.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."
Watchmen review – the perfect superhero story for our tattered times,"Set in an alternative America where white supremacists are on the rampage, this HBO adaptation of Alan Moore’s classic graphic novel is both thrilling and uncomfortably resonant",Lucy Mangan,2019-10-21T22:10:42+0100,"If we get the heroes we deserve, I hope we get Rachel, the woman whose 45-second vox pop articulated one side of the Brexit debate with the eloquence so conspicuous by its absence among our semi-elected political leaders. Until then, we must settle for our broadcasting platforms delivering us superheroes that at least reflect our frayed and ragged times.At one end of the quality scale there is Amazon’s trashy, schlocky The Boys – the tale of a band of superpowered humans who are effectively owned by a soulless corporation and who, when the cameras turn away after recording their latest heroic deeds, are as corrupt and venal as any mere mortal. The best you can hope for, and better than nothing, seems to be their and the programme’s creed. Pessimists like me find it quite bracing. Optimists – well, I don’t know how you manage even at the best of times, and if there is anything I can do to help you now please do let me know.At the other end there is HBO’s new series Watchmen (Sky Atlantic), a nine-part remix of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ 1986 comic-book creations. It accepts what happened in those dozen issues – but not the 2009 film adaptation – as canonical, but sets its own story 30 years after those events. So we are in a recognisable but alternative United States, in which the intervention of the Watchmen – Ozymandias, Nite Owl, The Comedian, Dr Manhattan, Silk Spectre and Rorschach – have changed history as we know it (Vietnam is still the 51st state of America after losing the war, for example), but the Watchmen themselves barely appear, though they are the subject of a popular TV show called American Hero Story, which is advertised everywhere. This is one of many confident flourishes with which showrunner Damon Lindelof demonstrates his joy in and mastery of his own material and its origins.Watchmen opens in 1921 in Tulsa, during the attack on “Black Wall Street” by the Ku Klux Klan, which apparently orphans a young black boy and a baby girl. We then cut to 2019 – the present, if not our present – and find ourselves in a US in which police wear masks, tell no one what they do for a living and face a growing threat from a group of white supremacists known as the Seventh Cavalry, whose own masks ape that of original Watchmen protagonist Rorschach.Whether their popularity and power is increasing despite or because of the progressive president – Robert Redford, in power since 1992 and instigator of “Redfordations” to compensate victims of the Tulsa massacre and their descendants – is one of many issues the show juggles as it replaces the original’s central concern about the cold war with the biggest contemporary questions: the resurgence of fascism, the refusal of racism to die and the endless erosion of trust between those who are supposed to protect and to serve and those who should be able to rely on them. “After three years of peace,” one officer notes as evidence of Seventh Cavalry activity piles up around them, “we convinced ourselves they were gone.” It is a line that cannot help but resonate at a time when international complacency is falling away in slabs and we are all looking at each other and wondering how much each face can be said to be a mask.The main story revolves round Angela Abar (Regina King), bakery owner by day, hooded avenger Sister Night by … well, you get the idea. Don Johnson plays her friend and colleague Judd Crawford. They are both survivors of an attack on the police that killed many other friends and forced her to invent her alter ego for protection. His murder is the catalyst for war between the police and the nationalists, opening up a plot expansive enough to remind you that Lindelof was the prime mover behind Lost, but controlled enough – praise be – to assure you that his adaptation of Tom Perrotta’s The Leftovers was the result of learning from experience, not a fluke.It is a bravura series that interrogates power, storytelling and the former embedded in the latter. It has a (still unusually) diverse cast, writing team and cohort of directors in terms of both sex and class, and, even as it strays from Moore and Gibbons’ original content, it honours their underlying ambition: to deconstruct our legends and our myths, ask where they come from, what purpose they serve; and to make us think and think again about who tells us what, why – and why they are the ones who get to do so."
The Crown season three trailer - Queen and country in crisis,"The first teaser for the third season of Netflix’s royal saga shows the nation in turmoil as we reach the 70s, with Olivia Colman taking over the lead role from Claire Foy",Hannah J Davies,2019-10-21T17:12:46+0100,"Netflix has released a trailer for the upcoming third season of the hit royal drama The Crown, with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman taking over the role of Queen Elizabeth II from Claire Foy. The series – created by Frost/Nixon writer Peter Morgan – progresses from 1964 into 1976. The first episode airs on 17 November, with Helena Bonham-Carter also joining the cast as Princess Margaret and Gillian Anderson set to portray Margaret Thatcher. The two-minute preview, released on Monday, shows historic events including the Aberfan disaster of 1966 unfold, while tensions rise within the Windsor family itself as the Queen approaches her Silver Jubilee. As Colman proclaims that “the place has fallen apart”, she seems to refer both to a nation in the grip of crisis and to the inner politics of Buckingham Palace, with Prince Charles becoming involved with Camilla Shand (later Parker-Bowles) and the appointment of Labour prime minister Harold Wilson among other catalysts for change. As well as Colman, Bonham-Carter and Anderson, the series has undergone a full cast overhaul. Tobias Menzes replaces Matt Smith as Prince Philip, Charles Dance plays Lord Mountbatten and Josh O’Connor (The Durrells) is Prince Charles. Emerald Fennell – of the BBC’s Call The Midwife, and also the screenwriter of the second series of Killing Eve – takes on the role of Camilla.The show has been a critical hit since it first aired in 2016 – with the Guardian describing it as “the service’s crowning achievement so far” – although the notoriously tight-lipped Netflix has never released official viewing figures. It has also been an expensive endeavour, with the first series rumoured to have cost £100m in total for 10 episode. The Guardian’s Charlotte Higgins gained exclusive access to the filming of the new season and wrote: “In some years it costs more to make The Crown than it does to fund the real Queen’s sovereign grant – that is, the income from her estates that she is allocated by the government.”Anderson, the former X-Files star, told the Observer earlier this year that “I am so excited … to have the opportunity to portray such a complicated and controversial woman. Thatcher was undoubtedly formidable, but I am relishing exploring beneath the surface and, dare I say, falling in love with the icon who, whether loved or despise, defined an era.”Elsewhere, Colman continues a starry, monarchical run, having won on Oscar early this year for her role as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos’ dark period comedy The Favourite. She isn’t hoping to emulate the Queen to a tee, however, telling the Sunday Times last week that “if people think they’re going to see the actual Queen, they can sod off. It’s a drama.”"
Jack Thorne: TV industry needs to address disability diversity,Screenwriter behind new His Dark Materials adaptation calls for meaningful representation,Aamna Mohdin,2019-10-22T00:01:45+0100,"Disability is being ignored in the conversations about diversity in television, according to the award-winning screenwriter Jack Thorne.The writer and director, who co-wrote the Bafta-winning This is England ’88 and ’90 series, has said there is an “invisible prejudice in the industry” and called on broadcasters, drama schools, entertainment companies, and agencies to do more to address the issue.Thorne wrote in the Radio Times: “I sit in meetings pushing disabled talent and I’m told, ‘We don’t want to over-expose them.’ I ask that parts be specifically defined as disabled and I’m told we’ll see disabled actors for the role, but they are almost never cast. I write shows that are exclusively disabled-led and they get rejected. The only one I’ve managed to get away – BBC Three’s Don’t Take My Baby – was done on a reduced budget (again).”Thorne started out in TV on Skins in 2007, writing an episode in the second season where one character dealt with being a carer for a parent with multiple sclerosis. He wrote in the article that he had asked the role to be played by a woman with MS and Maria Miles was cast.Thorne then created the Bafta-nominated series Cast Off, a show where every character is played by a disabled actor. When working on BBC Three’s The Fades, Thorne was successful in his request to get disabled talent on the show.However, he said representation had not improved since then. “These were all over ten years ago and are the best experiences in casting I’ve had,” he wrote. He said disabled creatives are often not given the recognition they deserve and there is a lot of untapped writing, directing, producing and acting talent out there.Thorne called for disabled diversity targets for drama schools, training programmes, entertainment companies and agencies, and said broadcasters – who do have targets – need to do better. He backed Lenny Henry’s proposed “representation tax relief”, which would reduce the taxes on UK film and television productions that meet certain criteria for women, ethnic minorities or disabled people.Warren Kirwan, head of communications at disability equality charity Scope, said: “More than one in five of us is disabled, yet disability remains woefully under-represented on television.“Only 7.4% of the characters on TV are portrayed by disabled people, and only 5.5% of those working behind the scenes are disabled.“Some progress has been made, but we have a long way to go until our screens reflect reality. From casting to commissioning, the industry needs to do much more to recognise disabled talent every step of the way.”"
Great Canal Journeys: how a bittersweet boating show captured viewers' hearts,"The swansong of Timothy West and Prunella Scales’s narrowboat adventures aired this week, having elevated the humble travelogue to a touching saga of love and loss",Jack Seale,2019-10-21T11:56:20+0100,"‘My name’s Timothy West, and this is my wife, Prunella Scales.” Much of the tender magic of Great Canal Journeys is in that proud, robustly jolly, semi-formal introduction, habitually included in the narration as one venerated actor refers to his beloved other. The Channel 4 show – the probable last episode of which was broadcast last night – is one of many travel series that amount to watching celebrities go on holiday, but it’s one of the few that truly feels as if it’s inviting us to come along too.West and Scales have no need to feign canal enthusiasm for the cameras. In their show’s best episodes, they revisit their own, real narrowboating holidays, re-enacting scenes from a romance that’s endured for more than half a century. A simple thing that sets them apart is that they’re a lot older than almost anyone else on British television. What has made this series such a gift is their willingness to share the emotion of navigating that last phase of life together, a bittersweetness made all the more powerful by Scales’s Alzheimer’s disease. West is the boat’s skipper, cajoling and comforting and forever worrying about the welfare of his mate. The success of the series has demanded that Tim and Pru venture overseas, as near as France and as far as India. Their foreign jaunts were fine, but this new trip put them back where they look most comfortable, in the veins of green England. Going up the familiar Oxford Canal from Banbury in Oxfordshire to Braunston in Northamptonshire offered a chance to relax, enjoy choice excerpts from previous seasons, and update us on the topic discussed whenever we and they reconvene: how Pru’s doing. The news was not good.Since the first instalment in 2014, the series has charted the long, slow goodbye that is living with dementia, cherishing every moment of precious normality and celebrating how an immersion in nature is the surest way to bring the old Pru back. But that task of loving a person whose powers are fading only ever gets harder. Now we heard not only that Pru’s mental decline was accelerating, but that deafness was also encroaching.The show’s editors have been masters of holding the shot for an extra second after Tim has finished speaking, long enough for us to discern pain clouding the full-hearted, wrinkly eyed smile that takes over his face when he talks about how happy Pru makes him. As Tim explained that Pru’s hearing loss was denying him the pleasure of ordinary conversation – the quick exchange of ideas and feelings with his best friend, treasured every day since 1963 – we saw more sadness than smile.This episode was broadcast on West’s 85th birthday and possessed an air of soft valediction throughout. In the ancient St Peter’s Church at Wormleighton, Warwickshire, the vicar boldly asked for clarification of what the rest of the programme was only hinting at: was this the couple’s last ever Great Canal Journey? Tim looked at Pru and thought about the bustling community of hobbyists and holidaymakers on Britain’s manmade waterways. “They can carry on without us. I just wonder if we can carry on without them.”So a saga that has been – quietly, let’s not make a fuss about it – one of the greatest love stories on TV seems to be over. There’s another new episode next week, but it’s even more heavily based on old clips, with the linking scenes showing Tim taking care of Pru at home rather than judging tight turns and ratcheting locks.This was the swansong, and in the loveliest of many lovely moments, Fairport Convention came on board at Cropredy to perform the exquisitely appropriate Who Knows Where the Time Goes? “Who knows how my love grows? And who knows where the time goes?” Oh, for a little more time. But what times we’ve had."
Match of the day: meet the people who helped their ex find new love,"You may find the idea of setting up your ex-partner with a date ridiculous – but, for some, it couldn’t be more natural",Sirin Kale,2019-10-22T10:00:55+0100,"After Elliot broke up with his girlfriend Kelly, they stayed friends. Why wouldn’t they? The breakup had been amicable; after dating for a year and moving in together, they started squabbling over silly things and figured they were better off apart. They were on a night out in April last year with their friendship group when Elliot, a 27-year-old childcare worker from Lancashire, bumped into Tom, an old work colleague. They made small talk for a bit, before going their separate ways. But Tom had caught Kelly’s eye, and the next day she called Elliot with an unusual request: could he set them up on a date?Elliot wasn’t opposed to the idea, but there was a problem. “I said: ‘I have no idea who you’re on about!’” he remembers. “We’d had such a brief conversation that it didn’t stick in my memory.” A few days later at work, Elliot’s team leader mentioned Tom’s name. “I thought: ‘That’s who she meant!’ I texted her saying: ‘It’s this guy.’” Kelly and Tom started messaging; Elliot even helped her craft the initial, flirtatious texts. It worked: Kelly and Tom now live together.There are countless articles online about how to find love after a breakup – or win your ex back, if that’s what you want. Helping an ex-partner find love with someone new is an entirely different and much rarer phenomenon. But it happens. This month, New Zealand couple Damien and Whakarongotai Nikora’s Facebook statuses went viral. They had posted announcing their split, and both had included a personal ad on behalf of the other. The pair, who were married for 21 years, titled their posts: “Why you should date my ex.” “If you get the chance to date her, lucky man,” wrote Damien of Whakarongotai.Most people – at least those whose relationships were not abusive or vitriolic – want their exes to be happy. But actively working to help your ex find love? It is unusual, particularly in monogamous circles. Some of Elliot’s co-workers struggled to understand his actions. “They said: ‘I’d hate to see my ex getting with someone else.’ But I thought, why? You’re not together any more. Why should that concern you?”An advantage of setting up your ex is that you know their quirks and foibles better than almost anyone else, and can vet prospective partners for compatibility. “You know your exes, and you know your friends, so you can basically tell what sort of people they will like in relationships and what they do like and don’t like,” says Andrea Campos, 25, a lawyer from London. Two years ago, she was on holiday with a female friend in Dubai when Campos’s ex-boyfriend messaged her. He had seen her friend in the photos Campos had been sharing, and found her attractive.“I said: ‘Do you want me to play Cupid?” Campos says. He agreed. They dated for a short while, but nothing long-term came of it. She doesn’t view her actions as remarkable. “I’m not a jealous person. If I think people will get on, I’ll introduce them. You want the people you care about to be happy, and if you think they’d be happy together, you might as well help.”Although it might seem tempting to launch into your address book and begin setting up your former flames and friends, a word of caution: it is not a risk-free exercise. Perhaps you will discover that you are not over them or, if the resulting relationship turns sour, you may get caught up in the fallout. But if you are thinking of setting up your ex with someone new, the first thing to do is check they are happy with it before you do. “It’s healthy to hope an ex-partner goes on to form other healthy relationships,” says Ammanda Major, a therapist with the relationship charity Relate. “But it depends on whether your ex wants you to do that. Otherwise, you’re treating them like a commodity, and selling them on.”Ask yourself why you’re trying to set up your ex. Are you genuinely motivated by feelings of altruism, or are you doing it to assuage guilt, or to prove a point? “If you ended the relationship and don’t want them to feel bad about it, you might think that fixing them up with someone new will take their mind off it,” Major says. “But it can be disrespectful to what you had, if it can quickly be overcome by being set up with someone new.” Above all, respect a firm no. “We all think we know best and so-and-so might be perfect for them. But doing things without someone’s permission is never a good idea.”Setting up your ex with someone new is an acid test for whether you are truly over that person. If the thought fills you with horror, you may still have feelings for them. “You have to be honest with yourself,” says Christina Gale, 27, who lives in London and works in social media. “If you’re funny about an ex, you’ve obviously still got feelings. If you’ve moved on, why wouldn’t you want to see them in a new relationship? I’m not a jealous person. I think everyone should be able to find love.”Setting up her friends with her exes has become Gale’s signature move. “I’ve done this so many times!” she laughs. “I date people and think, actually, you’d be better suited to someone else I know.” One ex sticks out: they had been together for six years, but ended things amicably. He had started hanging out with another woman – as friends – but Gale was convinced it could be something more. “I went to her and said: ‘Do you think he’s good-looking? She said: ‘Yeah!’” Gale let him know – and they started dating.Not everyone can understand a decision to set up an ex. “I have straight friends that say I’m crazy,” says Leo Camanho, 23, a student from Rio de Janeiro. “They say: ‘You’re so mature; how can you do this?’” He set up his ex-boyfriend Lucas with his best friend, Fabio, after he and Lucas broke up. He thinks setting up your exes is more common in queer circles. “In Rio, if you’re not friends with your ex, you don’t have any exes, because everyone dates everyone here.” After Fabio and Lucas started dating, they came to Camanho for his blessing. “I said: ‘Totally, you are both friends of mine, I love you both, go and be happy.’”In New York’s queer scene, 28-year-old Remy Duran is a legend. The reality-TV star became known across the city for his little black book – in reality, a mobile phone full of contacts, with subfolders categorising sexual preference – that he uses to connect ex-partners looking for love (or sex). Duran didn’t set out to be New York’s answer to Cilla Black: his matchmaking was an incidental byproduct of his dating life. As he dated his way around New York, his social circle grew, and former partners would hit him up for advice if there was someone they had their eye on.“People would be like: ‘Do you know that person? I’ve wanted to hook up with them for ever. And I’d be like: ‘Sure, I don’t own them, you can totally see them!’” His matchmaking is primarily altruistic – he wants to ensure people are having a good time. But there is also a deeper motivation. “It feels liberating,” Duran says. “You don’t own anyone, and it gives you a sense of closure.” He has set up at least 20 former partners, ranging from hookups to ex-boyfriends. So far, so good. “They say thank you,” says Duran. “I don’t think I’ve had any complaints.”Polyamorous people may be more relaxed than monogamous people about helping their exes date someone new. One polyamorous person, who prefers to remain anonymous, says: “I don’t see it as ‘setting people up’. I mean, they’re poly, they bang whoever; I just introduced them.” But outside of polyamory, setting up your ex with someone new is the ultimate affront to a monogamous dating culture that views ex-partners as possessions, rather than autonomous beings with free will. “We live in a possession-based culture where we see human beings as objects,” Elliot says. “You – you’re mine. Monogamous relationships can be like that. Even after you break up, people can’t let go of that sense of ownership. But I don’t think relationships should be possessive in that way.”Sometimes, setting up your ex with a friend happens so organically, it feels like an act of God. When Joanna Delooze was 20, she dated a man named Aaron. On one of their dates, Aaron mentioned that he had a list of qualities he looked for in a potential spouse. Delooze, who is now 55, made Aaron show her his list. “I read it and said: ‘I’m not joking, but with the exception of one thing, my roommate Linda ticks every single box on your list.’” She laughs. “It was completely her! If I was a guy, and this was my list, I’d date my roommate.”Delooze was absolutely right: Linda and Aaron have been together for 35 years and have six children. She is delighted to have helped engineer their happiness. “I see pictures of their family and all their kids and how they’re still together and I think it’s just great.”Some names have been changed"
I can only climax from oral or manual stimulation. Is this normal?,"I enjoy sex, and have had long-term partners, but I have never experienced an orgasm from penetration",Pamela Stephenson Connolly,2019-10-22T08:00:59+0100,"I’m a 35-year-old woman and have never been able to orgasm from penetration. I have had a few partners, some long-term, and I enjoy sex, but can only climax from oral/manual stimulation. Is this normal? Sometimes it’s hard to explain to a partner that I do enjoy it if they do it right (they think there’s something wrong with them or me if I don’t climax from penetration). And sometimes with a newer partner I’m too embarrassed to ask for what I really need. But I don’t want to fake it.For you – and for most women – the most heightened sensations of sexual pleasure emanate from stimulation of your clitoris. Vaginal penetration will only bring you to orgasm if the nerve endings in your clitoris are sufficiently engaged. But many people do not know this, and the politics of sex and gender have meant that incorrect beliefs have prevailed, and feelings of inferiority and frustration remain widespread. There is nothing wrong with you; your sexual response is completely normative. From now on, take charge of your pleasure. Try to find ways to receive more direct clitoral stimulation during intercourse, perhaps manually (your partner’s hand or yours) or through experimenting with different positions, styles or toys. But if you prefer, just relax and allow yourself to be brought to orgasm separately the way you like. Educate your partners and show them exactly what you need. In most cases they will be grateful for the clear instruction, and you will more profoundly appreciate them – and yourself.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

Why Helen Mirren’s Catherine the Great is a sexual revolutionary,"In her portrayal of the much younger queen, the actor is reminding us that many women continue to enjoy sex as long as men do",Jane Martinson,2019-10-22T07:59:54+0100,"The majestic Helen Mirren is showcasing how much more straightforward it is for a woman to play at being royal than it is to marry into royalty.Even better, by playing, at the age of 74, the title role of HBO’s Catherine the Great, Mirren is portraying a woman “half her age”, while simultaneously reminding the world that many women actually like sex. And continue to do so as long as men do. Shocker.We have grown so used to wrinkly old men being found fabulously attractive by young women on screen that we even have a term for it: the Woody Allen syndrome. Yet Mirren, who literally pants for her key ally, Grigory Potemkin, on screen, is very unusual – I can’t think of any other female septuagenarians showing flesh on screen (unless they are playing a corpse).That Mirren is a generation older than the 50-year-old Jason Clarke, who plays Potemkin, is one thing, but the fact that she genuinely seems to be wanting – nay craving – post-menopausal sex is the real surprise.It is unprecedented and has drawn comparisons from some reviewers with other TV hits that subvert sexual power play – the lesbian love triangle in The Favourite, for instance, or Gentleman Jack.The power shift of Catherine the Great comes because she was a monarch. There still aren’t quite as many of those who are women as there are men, but maybe, as the stories we see on screen become more diverse, we will see many more brilliant older women playing romantic roles against younger men. Then we can call it the Helen Mirren syndrome."
How we met: ‘I’m a staunch Brexit critic – but it did lead to us falling in love’,"Tom Browne, 43, and Nara Falcón, 36, have been together since 2018. They have a baby daughter",Nell Frizzell,2019-10-21T14:15:38+0100,"Tom and Nara met in a queue last year. “I’d spent three years living in the UK,” jokes Ireland-born Tom. “I’d picked up some of your ways.” Forced to relocate to Madrid because of Brexit, he had been in town only three weeks and had a friend visiting from Dublin, so he was ticking off some of the local attractions.“We’d done most of the tourist stuff, so we ended up in El Retiro park, queueing to go on a boat ride,” he says. Waiting in front of them was Nara. “There was a vibe from the start. Nara is beautiful and has this warm personality that I could see when she was talking to her friend, even though I couldn’t understand the words she was saying. She’s gorgeous, open and friendly.”His ice-breaker was hardly the stuff of romcoms. “We were in the queue, exchanging glances, and I think I said something very basic like: ‘Do you know how long we have to wait?’ It wasn’t exactly a Hollywood opener.” He and Nara, who is Mexican, and their friends Paula and John decided to hire a boat as a foursome. “I trapped her for an hour on a little rowing boat, so she had to listen to all my nonsense,” Tom says. “My friend John and I did most of the rowing. We were showing off a little bit, I suppose.” The lake is small enough that you can cover it in half an hour, but they were there for an hour. “We took the piss a little bit.”The attraction was mutual and immediate. “I was trying to stop myself, of course, and take it step by step,” says Nara. “But it was the perfect timing. When we met, I was single. Also, for me, Tom was so perfect that I was surprised he was single. Everything was just perfect.” After their time on the lake, the quartet went to a bar for tapas and a drink. “Paula and John were enjoying it, too,” says Tom. “But it was clear as day, I’d say, that Nara and I were falling in love.”Tom, an engineer, works for an EU project called Galileo, which is why he had to move from Southampton to Madrid. “I am a staunch Brexit critic,” he says. “I think it’s a regressive idea and too divisive, but in this case it did lead to falling in love. It’s a cliche and all of that, but it was instant and amazing. If I’d written a list of all the characteristics of the perfect girl, she ticked every single one.”The couple had been together for about four months when Tom was due to fly to Thailand for a month-long Thai boxing training camp in the middle of the forest. “I didn’t know if I should cancel, because we’d only just got together,” says Tom. “But Nara is a synchronised swimmer – she was once on the Mexican Olympic team – and appreciated the importance of an active, physical, adventurous life.”“I basically said: ‘This is your personality, this is who you are, if you don’t go and do it I’ll kill you,’” Nara laughs.Although he had not met Nara’s parents by this point, Tom got in touch with her father, Carlos, to ask if he could fly to Mexico and surprise her at Christmas, after he’d finished in Thailand. “He said that I was making her daughter very happy, that I’d be welcome any time. He gave me the nicest reaction,” says Tom. “Both parents were so lovely.”It was quite a journey. “I went from Madrid to Thailand, then from Thailand to China, China to Canada and finally Canada to Mexico. They were the only flights that weren’t €10m.” By flying so slowly through so many time zones, he managed to have three Christmas Eves and two Christmas Days. When he arrived, Nara’s father collected Tom from the airport while Nara was in bed, somehow managing to keep the entire thing secret. “When I came back to the house she was asleep,” says Tom. “I think her cousin has it on video, but she just didn’t know what was going on.”Almost exactly nine months after that surprise reunion in Mexico, Tom and Nara’s daughter, Chloe, was born in hospital in Madrid. “I can’t wait to tell Chloe this story of how we met,” says Nara. “I think she’ll love it.”Want to share your story?

I can’t come to terms with my boyfriend’s female friendships,"You must master your jealously or it will play havoc with your relationship, says Mariella Frostrup",Mariella Frostrup,2019-10-20T07:30:50+0100,"The dilemma My partner of three years sent a female colleague a pornographic joke, and I can’t get over it. He said they’ve been friends since school days, but it doesn’t sit right with me. He can’t explain why he did it, apart from banter, and he thought she would find it funny. He’s said it won’t happen again and he made an error of judgment. Ten days before this he invited a female golfing colleague to his house for a curry (albeit with his male lodger). It sends out the wrong message, and if he feels this is acceptable, what else is he capable of? My mind is running riot. I know I have trust issues – my ex was unfaithful at least six times, and the reason I found out about the pornographic text was because I checked his phone. He’s the love of my life and he feels the same. There has always been strong chemistry between us and I don’t want to let my past get in the way, but I’m really struggling.Mariella replies Poor you. Having endured the ravages of paranoid (and sometimes not so paranoid) jealousy in my youth, I know how agonising it can be. Luckily, it’s a debilitating condition that most of us manage to control over time. Allowed to flourish, jealousy becomes your master, sapping emotional energy and any hope of happiness.Last time I checked, a romantic union is sustained on the basis of mutual trust and desire. No partnership can survive the scrutiny, strictures and control you’re enforcing. This will lead to the very deceit you’re fearful of, based on the reasonable desire on your partner’s part to have freedom of choice when it comes to his friendships. Hooking up isn’t about placing your beloved in lockdown. It’s about finding someone you can open up to, who enhances your life experience and whom you place in pole position in your affections. That doesn’t mean they should enter a state of purdah, curtail all encounters with the opposite sex, strike friends bearing proscribed genitalia from their address book and only make single-sex social engagements.Risqué jokes and a curry are not the cliff edge of salacityWe know that love is an irrational collision of pheromones and feelings, an arbitrary emotional reaction to another human being. Jealousy is also irrational, but deserves inclusion as envy’s cousin on the list of seven deadly sins. Jealousy is born of fear, laced with insecurity and topped with a heady mix of personal, often historic foibles that make every case unique.Sending a long-term friend a pornographic joke may raise questions about your boyfriend’s sense of humour, but that doesn’t make it an entrée to an affair. Having supper with a sporting colleague is perfectly reasonable behaviour – and even more so in the company of a flatmate. Most of us no longer live in a society where every encounter with the opposite sex is a match-making moment – and how much better off we are for that. Here in the 21st century, those who are sexually compatible also regard each other as equals, work shoulder to shoulder, and play and party together. And we do all that without it having to end in sexual intercourse – often enjoying interactions more because of that.You ask what else your partner is capable of if he can send risqué jokes and share curries with golfing friends, as though those two activities represent the cliff edge of salacity. I’d argue that there’s nothing healthier than a man who still considers other women his friends, while choosing you to be his lover. You’ve already identified the real problem you are struggling with and it’s one of trust. Like innocence, it’s something we should assume and place in others until, and only if, they prove themselves not to be worthy of our assumptions.Your insecurity, currently playing havoc with your imagination, is damaging your ambition for a healthy relationship and is, ironically, the element most likely to prevent you achieving it. Affectionately referred to as a “little green monster”, jealousy is not, in fact, benign. It’s expansive, both in the person feeling it and in its ability to wreak destruction in our romantic lives. So, whether with expert help or a decided determination to overcome your pattern of distrust, I would urge you to tackle it. Obviously, I can’t promise that your partner will be faithful for ever and, as I don’t know him, I can’t even confirm he’s worthy of your trust. I do know, however, that a relationship built on suspicion, where your energy is focused on policing your partner rather than enjoying him, is a relationship doomed to disaster.With the best will in the world, your surveillance powers aren’t omnipotent, and if your man is intent on enjoying extra-curricular activities, he’ll find a way. What a squandering of your time and energy it is to focus on curtailing them. You’d be far better developing a great and irresistible relationship rather than invading your boyfriend’s privacy and keeping tabs on who he mingles with when he’s not in your eyeline. Your toxic levels of jealousy are as likely to destroy your relationship as any infidelity. Obsessive control is neither healthy nor tolerable and the sooner you deal with the origins of your trust issues the better for all concerned.If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.

UK to use £1bn meant for green energy to support fracking in Argentina,Documents show government’s plans to prioritise loans in support of major oil companies,Jillian Ambrose,2019-10-22T12:04:41+0100,"The UK is planning to invest in Argentina’s controversial oil shale industry using a £1bn export finance deal intended to support green energy, according to government documents seen by the Guardian.UK Export Finance, the government’s foreign credit agency, promised in 2017 to offer loans totalling £1bn to help UK companies export their expertise in “infrastructure, green energy and healthcare” to invest in Argentina’s economy.Instead official records, released through a freedom of information request, have revealed the government’s plan to prioritise support for major oil companies, including Shell and BP, which are fracking in Argentina’s vast Vaca Muerta shale heartlands.One government memo, uncovered by Friends of the Earth, said that while Argentina’s clean energy sector was growing, it was “Argentina’s huge shale resources that offer the greatest potential” for the UK.The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: ""The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.""One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change. Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.The briefing note was prepared before a key meeting between the UK government’s trade envoy to Latin America, the UK ambassador to Argentina and Argentina’s energy minister in February this year.Tony Bosworth, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the world hurtling towards catastrophic climate change, and parliament declaring a climate emergency, it’s outrageous that the UK government is continuing to back huge fossil fuel developments abroad.”Separate records, also uncovered by Friends of the Earth, revealed that there had been no fewer than 13 meetings between the UK and oil companies operating in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta hydrocarbon reservoir since the beginning of last year.The companies include Shell, Andina Resources, Phoenix Global Resources and Pan American Energy (PAE), a subsidiary of BP. They have contributed donations amounting to more than £40,000 to fund birthday celebrations for the Queen held at the British embassy in Bueno Aires over the past two years. There have been no meetings with renewable energy companies, according to the records.Argentina has become a magnet for major oil companies after discovering the world’s third largest shale reserves in the world. It hopes to replicate the US energy revolution by encouraging oil companies to exploit the reserves within the Vaca Muerta region despite strong opposition from local communities.A Guardian investigation this month revealed that the fracking industry had already caused irreversible damage to the ancestral homeland of Argentina’s indigenous Mapuche people after an oil fire burned for more than three weeks next to a freshwater lake in Vaca Muerta.Argentina delivered its first-ever export of light crude and liquified natural gas from Vaca Muerta earlier this summer, five years after local community protest was quashed by authorities using teargas and rubber bullets.The UK’s loans to support work in Argentina have been modest to date, but are expected to rise as Argentina’s burgeoning shale industry increases production. One of the largest provisions has been for £346,000 to support BP’s PAE in the 2017-2018 financial year.The government’s plan to support Argentina’s shale industry comes after an investigation revealed an eleven-fold increase in support for fossil fuels over the past year to almost £2bn.The plans are strongly opposed by MPs on the environmental audit committee, which branded the UK’s foreign fossil fuel investments as the “elephant in the room” undermining the UK’s climate leadership.The UK government legislated earlier this year to commit to a zero-carbon economy by 2050, and is preparing to host the UN’s next major climate talks in Glasgow next year. The government’s climate efforts will be led by a new sub-committee within the cabinet office to be headed by the prime minister.Friends of the Earth warned that Boris Johnson must show global leadership ahead of the Glasgow UN summit by putting environmental responsibility and decarbonisation at the heart of every government policy – both at home and abroad.“Boris Johnson’s pledge to lead the world in slashing climate-wrecking pollution will be meaningless if his government continues to back the exploitation of massive oil and gas developments in Argentina,” Bosworth said.A UKEF spokeswoman said the credit agency’s support in Argentina was available on a case-by-case basis to all permitted business sectors, including the renewable energy sector, to ensure “that no viable UK export fails for lack of finance or insurance”. UKEF did not offer evidence that it had met any renewable energy developers in Argentina."

"Ocean acidification can cause mass extinctions, fossils reveal","Carbon emissions make sea more acidic, which wiped out 75% of marine species 66m years ago",Damian Carrington,2019-10-21T20:00:36+0100,"Ocean acidification can cause the mass extinction of marine life, fossil evidence from 66m years ago has revealed.A key impact of today’s climate crisis is that seas are again getting more acidic, as they absorb carbon emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists said the latest research is a warning that humanity is risking potential “ecological collapse” in the oceans, which produce half the oxygen we breathe.The researchers analysed small seashells in sediment laid down shortly after a giant meteorite hit the Earth, wiping out the dinosaurs and three-quarters of marine species. Chemical analysis of the shells showed a sharp drop in the pH of the ocean in the century to the millennium after the strike.This spike demonstrated it was the meteorite impact that made the ocean more acidic, effectively dissolving the chalky shells of many species. Large-scale volcanic activity was also considered a possible culprit, but this occurred over a much longer period.The oceans acidified because the meteorite impact vaporised rocks containing sulphates and carbonates, causing sulphuric acid and carbonic acid to rain down. The mass die-off of plants on land after the strike also increased CO2 in the atmosphere.“We show ocean acidification can precipitate ecological collapse,” said Michael Henehan at the GFZ German research centre for geosciences in Potsdam, who led the study. “Before we had the idea, but we did not have the empirical proof.”The researchers found that the pH dropped by 0.25 pH units in the 100-1,000 years after the strike. It is possible that there was an even bigger drop in pH in the decade or two after the strike and the scientists are examining other sediments in even finer detail.Henehan said: “If 0.25 was enough to precipitate a mass extinction, we should be worried.” Researchers estimate that the pH of the ocean will drop by 0.4 pH units by the end of this century if carbon emissions are not stopped, or by 0.15 units if global temperature rise is limited to 2C.Henehan said: “We may think of [acidification] as something to worry about for our grandchildren. But if it truly does get to the same acidification as at the [meteorite strike] boundary, then you are talking about effects that will last for the lifetime of our species. It was hundreds of thousands of years before carbon cycling returned to normal.”The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analysed sediments that Henehan encountered by chance, during a conference field trip in the Netherlands. The sediments, which straddle the moment of the impact, lie in caves that were used by people hiding from the Nazis during the second world war. “It was so lucky,” said Henehan.The rocks contained foraminifera, small-shelled marine organisms. “In the boundary clay, we managed to capture them just limping on past the asteroid impact. But you can see their shell walls were much thinner and poorly calcified after the impact,” he said.It was the knock-on effects of acidification and other stresses, such as the “nuclear winter” that followed the impact, that finally drove these foraminifera to extinction, he said: “You have the complete breakdown of the whole food chain.” He said oceans also faced additional stresses today, from global heating to widespread pollution, overfishing and invasive alien species.Phil Williamson, at the University of East Anglia, who was not involved in the research, said: “It is relatively easy to identify mass extinction events in the fossil record, but much harder to know exactly what caused them. Evidence for the role of ocean acidification has generally been weak, until now.”He said caution was needed in making the comparison between the acidification spike 66m years ago and today: “When the asteroid struck, atmospheric CO2 was naturally already much higher than today, and the pH much lower. Furthermore, large asteroid impacts cause prolonged darkness.”Williamson added: “Nevertheless, this study provides further warning that the global changes in ocean chemistry that we are currently driving have the potential to cause highly undesirable and effectively irreversible damage to ocean biology.”Henehan said the generally lower ocean pH 66m years ago might have made shelled organisms more resilient to acidification. “Who knows if our current [marine] system is as well set up to cope with sudden acidification?”"
'Racism dictates who gets dumped on': how environmental injustice divides the world,"Five luminaries explain the concept of ‘environmental justice’ and reveal why, alongside the climate crisis, it is one of the most pressing issues of our time ",Nina Lakhani,2019-10-21T11:00:25+0100,"Today the Guardian is launching a year-long series, Our Unequal Earth, investigating environmental injustices: how ecological hazards and climate disasters have the harshest impacts on people of color, native tribes and those on low incomes.The most egregious examples include the lead poisoning crisis in Flint, Michigan, petrochemical pollution in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, and today’s series launch story, about an entire river that stops at the US-Mexico border, leaving ordinary Mexicans without water. Each of these cases has also prompted inspiring community activism.Our new environmental justice reporter, Nina Lakhani, asked five luminaries of the movement to explain “environmental justice” in their own words. They reveal why, alongside global heating and the extinction crisis, it is one of the most pressing issues of our time.Q: How did the environmental justice movement begin?I started working on environment and race in 1978/79 by collecting landfill data for a landmark civil rights lawsuit filed by my wife in Houston, Texas, against the city and the state. This study found that between the 1930s and 1978, 82% of all the waste in Houston was dumped in black neighborhoods, even though only 25% of the population was black. This was not random or isolated; it was targeted and widespread across the southern states and the nation. We lost in court but the concept of environmental racism was born.The seminal Environmental Justice principles adopted by the National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991 built on this [legal case] and became the foundation for social justice movements across the world. Even so, the same discrimination and racism continues to dictate who gets dumped on and who gets resources to mitigate floods, wildfires and other disasters. Of course those with wealth and political clout do best; if you have money you can buy bottled water or move house. The poor cannot go anywhere. Q: How are native communities affected by environmental discrimination?We cannot talk about environmental injustice without understanding the historical context of colonization and capitalism. The federal government put us on reservations on land they believed to be worthless, but many turned out to be rich in “resources”. This means we’re in the way of profits. In most cases we don’t want these megaprojects coming in and destroying our land and water, but it happens anyway. The situation is even worse for our brothers and sisters in the global south where people are silenced, disappeared and killed to make money with no hope of justice. I grew up in a community full of environmental injustices without knowing it. So many people I knew – young and old, men and women – got cancer, including me during my second year in college. I thought this was normal. Our territory is contaminated by the coal industry, uranium mining, over-fertilization and oil. But environmental injustice is a tangled web, it’s about so much more than pollution. Whenever there’s a new megaproject, the area is overwhelmed by men, there’s an influx of money and a rise in organized crime. After the oil boom in 2007, the number of missing and murdered indigenous women increased, and so did drugs. Gangs came and recruited our young people to sell drugs and many of these young men are now in jail or dead. Q: What role does the state play in creating environmental inequalities?Environmental injustice is about [the state] creating sacrifice zones where we place everything which no one else wants. The justification is always an economic one, that it makes sense to build chemical plants on so-called cheap lands where poor people and people of color live, but which are only cheap because all the wealth and economic opportunities have been stripped out. The people who live in these areas are unseen, unheard and undervalued. Environmental justice is about communities being able to reclaim their power, like Spartanburg in South Carolina, which received a $20,000 EPA environmental justice grant [to help clean up contaminated industrial sites], which it leveraged to almost $300m [from public and private sources, to build housing, a job training facility and health centers on the rehabilitated lands].It took a long, long time to build trust with communities, create statutes and programs, which are now being dismantled. The cuts to the EPA proposed by the Trump administration are about protecting the industries which supported Trump’s campaign, and power and discrimination. It’s about showing communities of color and poor communities the administration can do whatever it wants to them because their lives don’t matter.Q: The fight for ‘climate justice’ has become central to the environmental justice movement. Why are you and so many young people getting involved? Climate justice has mobilized young people because there’s something in it for everyone. Whether you care about animals, science, pollution, racism or sexism, all these issues are intertwined with the climate crisis in the worst possible way. Poor people and people of color are much more likely to die in climate disasters than rich people. This means addressing racism, colonialism and patriarchy, because inequalities do not exist in a vacuum, and neither does the climate crisis. It’s the result of all the other societal evils.For me, the climate crisis has been looming over my entire life – and future. Three things happened in 2017 which motivated me to act: the US leaving the Paris agreement, Hurricane Maria destroying Puerto Rico and the wildfires in Canada, which created a thick layer of smog over Seattle that felt apocalyptic. At the beginning my dream with the #ThisIsZeroHour campaign was to mobilize a lot of people for a youth climate march, but it’s got bigger and bigger and we now have a hundred chapters. So far it has been very US-focused but that’s changing. Q: What did we learn from the Flint scandal, in which 100,000 residents were exposed to excessive lead from their tap water?The Flint scandal showed the American people and the world that access to clean water in the US is not always a given. It showed that we have testing methods that are flawed, and we need them fixed, and that sometimes the people who are paid to protect us don’t always do what is in our best interests. It has become my personal mission to make sure we get the Lead and Copper Rule [a federal regulation which limits the concentration of these heavy metals in public drinking water] changed so it protects people like it’s supposed to. I want everyone to know that as of today the EPA has not kept its promises to fix the laws, and still allows states to cheat on water testing.Q: How can people get involved in the struggle for environmental justice?I was an ordinary citizen compelled to take action after watching my children break out in rashes, scream in agony from taking a bath, unexplained illnesses, losing their hair and being told the problem was specific to my house even though the same things were happening to children all over Flint.I made the decision to teach myself about how water is treated, about federal laws and about how to properly test water, because listening to governmental officials lie to my face disgusted me. When situations like this happen, everyday people need to protect themselves. They need to follow their gut if they feel something is wrong. They need to unite because together we are stronger.Sit down in your groups and communities and figure out people’s strengths. You will have defeats – use those as learning experiences. You will have victories, rejoice when those happen. Our environment plays a huge role in our health and future generations’ health, so it is our duty as ordinary people to protect it and fight back. We can make a difference.To contact Nina Lakhani, the Guardian’s new environmental justice reporter, e-mail nina.lakhani@theguardian.com."
Fowl language: Amazonian bird's mating call noisiest in world,White bellbird’s call reaches same volume as pneumatic drill during courtship ritual,Daniel Grossman,2019-10-21T16:20:16+0100,"A bird in the Amazon has shattered the record for the loudest call to be recorded, reaching the same volume as a pneumatic drill.The white bellbird, which lives in the mountains of the north-eastern Amazon, was recorded at 125 decibels (dB), three times louder than the next bird in the pecking order, the screaming piha.Mario Cohn-Haft, an ornithologist at the National Institute of Amazonian Research and the author of a paper published in the journal Current Biology, captured a male white bellbird specimen in the Brazilian state of Roraima in 2017.It was about 30cm (12in) long from beak to tail, said Cohn-Haft. He dissected it in the field, removing the skin and some organs to prepare it to be added to his collection. Something caught his eye under the bird’s pure white feathers: a muscular, sculpted chest. “It had a six pack,” he said, with tissue five times thicker than that of most birds its size.Cohn-Haft enlisted the help of Jeff Podos, an animal behaviour specialist at the University of Massachusetts and a co-author of the paper, to study the white bellbird. They suspected that the bird’s muscular physique might explain its earsplitting song: the male sings an explosive two-toned cry.Cohn-Haft and Podos returned to Roraima and crept up to within 40 metres (130ft) of white bellbirds singing from bare branches. They had brought a directional microphone and a precision audio recorder. In order to make accurate measurements, they had to make recordings with the birds facing them, with no intervening obstacles.The scientists also had front row seats to watch the birds’ bizarre courtship rituals. The female alights on a branch about a metre from the male, which promptly begins singing the louder of the two songs in its repertoire. Cohn-Haft said the male faces directly away from the potential mate for the first of the song’s notes. Then, in a fraction of a second, he swivels around and yells the second note “right in her face”.“She knows it’s coming,” said Cohn-Haft, because just before the second note she flutters back a few metres. The male has a long black wattle hanging down from the top of his head that whips around when he turns his head. “If she didn’t know any better she’d get it in the face,” he said.The bird’s song was recorded at 125dB, which Cohn-Haft and Podos say raises many questions. For starters, said Podos, “how can they do this without going deaf?” The researchers suggested the unusual call may be the result of sexual selection. Cohn-Haft speculated that plentiful food in the bellbird’s mountain habitat had allowed the species to become unhitched from strict obedience to the dictates of survival of the fittest.“Survival is easy enough, so these birds are free to develop traits that, whimsically or not, are attractive to each other.” He said these traits had more in common with the “beauty” of a song or a dance than utilitarian behaviours such as hunting or tools for fighting such as teeth and claws.“This is an example of sexual selection gone wild,” said Podos.He said there was no particular scientific benefit to identifying the most deafening birdsong, any more than there was to identifying the cheetah as the animal kingdom’s swiftest runner. But he said scientists garnered important insights from nature’s extremes. “It’s a good place to understand the limits of what nature can offer,” he said."
Renewable energy to expand by 50% in next five years - report,Energy agency says solar power will drive faster than forecast growth in renewables,Jillian Ambrose,2019-10-21T06:00:23+0100,"Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy.The International Energy Agency (IEA) found that solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years.Its latest report predicts that by 2024 a new dawn for cheap solar power could see the world’s solar capacity grow by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. Overall, renewable electricity is expected to grow by 1,200GW in the next five years, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US.“This is a pivotal time for renewable energy,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. “Technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are at the heart of transformations taking place across the global energy system. Their increasing deployment is crucial for efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution, and expand energy access.”The Guardian reported earlier this month that a renewable energy revolution could end the world’s rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies.Renewable energy sources make up 26% of the world’s electricity today, but according to the IEA its share is expected to reach 30% by 2024. The resurgence follows a global slowdown last year, due to falling technology costs and rising environmental concerns.However, Birol warned that the role of renewables in the global energy system would need to grow even faster if the world hopes to meet its climate targets.The report said growing climate ambitions in the European Union and the US played the biggest role in driving the IEA’s forecasts higher, but it will be China which leads the way in rolling out wind and solar energy projects.The IEA expects solar energy to play the biggest role in jumpstarting fresh growth in global renewable energy because falling costs are already below retail electricity prices in most countries.The cost of solar power is expected to decline by a further 15% to 35% by 2024, spurring further growth over the second half of the decade.The appetite of energy-hungry businesses and factories is expected to be the biggest driver of the solar power boom as company bosses exploit falling costs to help cut their energy bills.But the number of home solar panels is also expected to more than double to reach around 100m rooftops by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, California, the Netherlands and Austria.Even after the “spectacular” growth expected for solar over the next five years, panels will cover only 6% of the world’s available rooftops, leaving room for further growth.“Renewables are already the world’s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” Birol said.He warned that although the potential for solar power was “breathtaking” the rapid rollout could disrupt electricity markets unless regulators and utilities adapt."
"Scores more heart attacks and strokes on high pollution days, figures show",Data reveals acute impact on people’s health and the strain it puts on emergency services,Fiona Harvey,2019-10-21T00:01:09+0100,"Scores of children and adults are being rushed to hospital for emergency treatment on days of high pollution in cities across England, figures show.Each year emergency services see more than 120 additional cardiac arrests, more than 230 additional strokes and nearly 200 more people with asthma requiring hospital treatment on days of high pollution compared with the average on days of lower pollution.The data, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain that poor air quality is putting on already stretched NHS emergency resources.Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said: “These new figures show air pollution is now causing thousands of strokes, cardiac arrests and asthma attacks, so it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency. Since these avoidable deaths are happening now, not in 2025 or 2050, together we need to act now.”Previous studies have found spikes in hospital admissions and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air.The researchers defined high pollution days by dividing the year in two based on levels of pollution and comparing the number of cases of the relevant illness in the higher pollution half of the year with the number of similar cases on each day in the lower half.The data, collated by King’s College London (KCL), covers London, where there are 338 more emergencies a year on higher pollution days compared with low pollution days, Birmingham (65 a year), Bristol (22), Derby (16), Liverpool (28), Manchester (34), Nottingham (19), Oxford (10) and Southampton (16).Much of the recent research on air pollution has focused on the lifelong effects of chronic exposure, including cognitive decline, stunted growth in children and premature death. However, it can also bring on serious illness more immediately.Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Many people may not realise how dangerous air pollution at high levels can be, and that it can trigger heart attacks, strokes and asthma attacks as well as having long-term health effects. These figures will be a wake-up call for city leaders to take the strongest possible action.”The government has pledged to tackle air pollution in its environment bill, proposals for which were laid out after the Queen’s speech. Campaigners are concerned that the measures proposed are too vague and too weak.Polly Billington, the director of UK100, a network of local government leaders across England that have pledged to shift wholly to clean energy by 2050, said: “We would like to see World Health Organization air pollution standards included in the bill, as they are widely seen as gold standard, with a legally binding timetable to meet them, as that creates certainty and enables long-term planning. The absence of significantly increased powers for local leaders, together with a lack of reference to the need for adequate funding, are the big holes in the bill that will hold action back.”On Wednesday the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and UK100 will hold an international clean air summit with the World Health Organization (WHO) director general, Tedros Adhanom.Heather Walton, a health expert with the environmental research group at KCL, said the study was intended to provide more detail than others that have tended to concentrate on the effects of air pollution on life expectancy, such as estimates that pollution contributes to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK.By homing in on hospital admissions for cardiac arrests, strokes and asthma, the researchers were able to provide a clearer picture of the acute impacts on people and how emergency services are affected. “This provides additional evidence of the important need for further action to reduce air pollution,” Walton said.Bates said clean air zones were needed, but also measures to cut all traffic “because all vehicles produce deadly fine particle air pollution from brake and tyre wear. This way the air pollution health crisis and the climate emergency can be addressed together, helping to make our cities and towns healthier and more attractive.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and tackle pollution so people can live longer healthier lives. Our landmark environment bill will set ambitious, legally binding targets to reduce fine particulate matter and increase local powers to address key sources of air pollution.“We are already working hard to reduce transport emissions and are investing £3.5bn to clean up our air, while our clean air strategy has been praised by the WHO as an example for the rest of the world to follow.”Last week Europe’s environmental watchdog found that little or no progress had been made across Europe on cutting levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which is one of the most dangerous forms of pollution because it can lodge deep in the lungs and penetrate the bloodstream."
How to explore the world without harming it: Guardian climate pledge 2019,Guardian travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprint,Andy Pietrasik,2019-10-19T08:30:19+0100,"We recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.” Travel can have a magical transformation on individuals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels; to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes; to meet people with different ideas and perspectives; to try out alternative lifestyles; to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes; to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist, John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the Guardian’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now diving instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."
"Farming could be absorber of carbon by 2050, says report","Veganism and trees could help stop agriculture contributing to global heating, study says",Fiona Harvey,2019-10-21T16:00:36+0100,"If one in five people in richer countries went near-vegan, and threw away a third less food than they currently do, while poor countries were assisted to preserve their forests and restore degraded land, the world’s agricultural systems could be absorbing carbon dioxide by 2050 instead of adding massively to global heating as they do at present.Tree-planting and improving the fertility of soil through better farming practices would also be needed, according to a study of global forests, farming and food systems published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Managing agricultural and other land in a more environmentally sound manner could take the world nearly a third of the way towards meeting the Paris agreement goals. “These [measures] are feasible now and deliver many other benefits,” said Stephanie Roe, environmental scientist at the University of Virginia and lead author of the paper.“Recent reports on the state of our forests and food systems show a worrying lack of progress in the land sector, and our window of opportunity to deliver on the Paris agreement is getting smaller. However, I remain optimistic because we have all the tools we need, as well as increasing public pressure and political will to turn things around.”The changes would also allow for healthier diets globally, improve livelihoods in poor areas, preserve wildlife and flora, and make for higher water and air quality. Many of the measures suggested, such as cutting food waste and shifting from excessive meat consumption, would also save money. For example, improving soil management through organic farming practices would cost about $57bn (£43.9bn) but save nearly $2tn over the period, according to one estimate used in the study.Land accounts for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, or 11 gigatons of carbon dioxide a year. With the right measures, according to the study, it would act instead as a carbon sink absorbing 3 gigatons from the atmosphere a year by 2050. That could give some scope for other sectors such as aviation to continue to use limited amounts of fossil fuels while staying within the global carbon budget needed to avoid a temperature rise of more than 1.5C (a rise of 2.7F) above pre-industrial levels.The authors set out a roadmap for the six large-scale measures they propose, including: reducing deforestation, peatland burning and mangrove destruction by 70%; restoring forests, peatlands and coastal mangroves to generate enough carbon dioxide saving to cancel out China’s annual emissions; planting trees to save as much carbon dioxide as that emitted by the EU.Improving farming practices, including moving to more organic practices, would mean better soil management that could cut carbon dioxide equal to India’s annual emissions. Consumer food waste in rich countries and big developing countries could be cut by a third, while the losses from food production in poor regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia could be cut drastically through simple measures such as more refrigeration and better transport. Moving a fifth of people to plant-based diets in developed and emerging countries, particularly the US, the EU, China, Brazil, Argentina and Russia, is seen as possible by 2030. These near-vegan diets would involve consuming less than 2,500 calories a day and no more than 60g of animal protein.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sThe physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.”Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.Jonathan Watts, Garry Blight and Pablo GutiérrezProf Thomas Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab, who was not involved with the study, said: “This is an excellent review of the many carbon drawdown solutions that the land can provide. There are immense benefits of restoring natural ecosystems like forests, wetlands and peatlands. Managed ecosystems can also be critical through effective agroforestry, biochar techniques and regenerative agriculture that can increase soil carbon sequestration. The review also reveals the considerable uncertainty and challenges that we face in realising this carbon drawdown potential, highlighting the need for more quantitative research into the scale and dynamics of carbon storage on land.”Developing nations are hoping that the forthcoming UN meeting on the climate emergency, COP25 in Santiago, will encourage rich countries to focus on helping them cut emissions through better land use and management of the oceans. A spokesperson for the UK’s Department for International Development said: “Cutting carbon emissions by helping developing countries change how they use and farm land is a priority for UK aid. We are fighting illegal deforestation and supporting poor farmers to make their practices greener. By making farming practices more efficient, we reduce the amount of land needed to produce food.”Nancy Harris of the World Resources Institute, a co-author of the study, said: “The longer we delay action to protect forests, the more difficult it will be to achieve the Paris agreement targets and the more we will need to rely on unproven negative emission technologies.”"
Artist creates deepfake birdsong to highlight threat to dawn chorus,Somerset House exhibit will feature natural birdsong being taken over by artificial sound,Dalya Alberge,2019-10-20T12:41:22+0100,"The dawn chorus is one of the wonders of the natural world, but a discordant note will be struck when a soundtrack of hundreds of birds is heard in London this month. The chiffchaffs, great tits, redstarts, robins and thrushes almost sound like the real thing, but they have been created by a machine as part of a major art installation warning of an apocalyptic world where Britain’s bird population has been allowed to diminish.The synthetic bird sounds are the creation of the artist Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg, who has worked with scientists at an AI company more used to researching Donald Trump deepfake videos to create the work. Through the installation, opening on 31 October within the vaulted chapel of Somerset House’s Embankment Galleries, Ginsberg says birdlife is under threat from modern urban lifestyles, with the cacophony of city life taking its toll.Birds sing to warn of danger, woo mates and establish territory. Against light and noise pollution, they struggle to be heard, risking vocal injury, while mating patterns are also disrupted, leading to falling populations.In the installation, a natural dawn chorus is taken over by the sound of artificial birds. With the sound designer Chris Timpson of Aurelia Soundworks, the artist has combined recordings of real birds with machine-generated responses, which are distinguishable by the machine-like distortion.Ginsberg said: “We chose species that would be found in an urban area … All are affected by the encroachment of sound and light pollution. Even building shapes affect how birds sing.“My work has been about our relationship with nature … I want the piece to ask difficult questions. What would we replace [birds] with and what do we lose? It will make us feel uncomfortable … but the piece will be enjoyable to listen to.”She added: “Urban birds such as sparrows, blackbirds and great tits have been found to sing higher, louder, and earlier, putting them at risk of predators. Near airports, blackbirds sing for longer and modify their song. Research has shown the chorus starting 23.8 minutes earlier in those environments.”This year, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) released a track of pure birdsong to raise awareness of the loss of over 40 million birds from the UK in just 50 years. It warned that the sound could be lost for ever as 56% of species in the UK were in decline.Ginsberg, who studied at Cambridge University and the Royal College of Art, has exhibited worldwide, including at the MoMA in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. She creates artworks, writings and curatorial projects that focus on ecology and technology. An earlier collaborative project resurrected the smell of extinct flowers, extracting DNA from a pressed hibiscus specimen.She has collaborated with Faculty, a London-based AI company, one of the leading researchers into AI-generated deepfakes of humans and of ways to combat their misuse. They worked with an NGO called Alliance of Democracies, set up by the former Danish prime minister and Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, to highlight the threat to democratic elections posed by political misinformation in the form of AI-generated deepfakes of politicians making controversial or inflammatory statements. As part of that work, Faculty built an AI deepfake Donald Trump and also worked on a detector to help people identify when a piece of audio or video is fake.The company also runs a fellowship programme for science PhDs, during which they can work on an AI project for a company, charity or, as in this case, an artist.By adapting a technique known as the generative adversarial network (GAN), which has been used to generate lifelike fake images of human beings, they have been able “to learn and generate” the songs of different bird species.Ginsberg said: “Not much work has been done with sound so far. We’re feeding thousands of individual recorded bird solos into the system to generate increasingly realistic clips of birdsong.”Synthetic sounds will be mixed with real sounds of species such as blackbirds, goldfinches, flycatchers and wood pigeons to create a 10-minute version of a dawn chorus.She said: “It will start with one bird singing, a natural bird – we’re choosing a redstart, which is normally one of the first birds to sing. That bird will sing his song solo. Normally the redstart would sing and he’d be saying, ‘I’m in this tree, I’m here,’ and another redstart would sing back. Instead, we have a machine singing back to him.”The work, titled Machine Auguries, will be accompanied by a light installation that mimics the rising dawn, beginning with “a blue-grey, silverly predawn light”, according to Ginsberg.Commissioned by Somerset House and A/D/O by Mini, Ginsberg is among a number of international artists showcased in the exhibition 24/7: A Wake-Up Call for Our Non-Stop World."
Braingasm ASMR class – like being drunk on a night bus and waking up in nirvana,"It promises the blissful, tingly sensation of ASMR combined with yogic relaxation. Little more than a wellness word salad with zeitgeist sprinkles? Maybe, but I had a divine nap",Rhik Samadder,2019-10-22T08:01:09+0100,"In the dark, a man whispers something in my ear about my root chakra. I’m perched on a block on a yoga mat in a gym in east London, wearing a glowing set of headphones. My eyes are closed: I can’t see the others around me, or hear the David Guetta soundtrack or the slamming of weights downstairs. Just the voice. Lie down, it says. I’m not getting the goosebumps I had hoped for, though. It’s not him, it’s me, I think. Relax, the voice says.ASMR, or aspirated sexy microphone rubbing, is très popular on the internet, but today I’m getting a live version. If you are unfamiliar with ASMR – which actually stands for autonomous sensory meridian response – take a dive into the countless online videos of supreme weirdness. Its breathy practitioners, mostly women, chew ice or stroke towels or click tweezers, with the intention of giving their audience, listening through earphones, “the tingles”. I don’t understand it, but I find it utterly fascinating.People have always found natural sounds soothing, yet exploiting the latent sensuality of modern, unlikely objects is a subversive, even artistic, provocation. All of which means big companies want in. There is even an (unofficial) ASMR KFC advert in which Colonel Sanders talks about his pocket squares for two and a half unsettling minutes. Now ASMR has been packaged into a marketable wellness system. Mmm. *Whispers into mic* Capitalism. *Runs nail along raised lettering of a debit card*The marketing for Braingasm, a new class from Gymbox (from £73 a month; £20 a day for non-members), is hardly subtle. Braingasm sounds like an ITV2 gameshow that thinks it’s Mastermind, but is really Catchphrase with glitter cannons. “Feel your brain get blown,” the website blurts. “Happy endings guaranteed.” I’m hoping they don’t deliver on that promise. Our class is led by Paul Selvey, an experienced yoga teacher. He explains sensitively that the class isn’t just a wellness word salad with zeitgeist sprinkles. The tingly, deeply relaxing sensation of ASMR perfectly complements a yoga nidra relaxation practice. Selvey usually teaches a combination of vinyasa flow, yin and sattva kriya. Braingasm offers a style that speaks more directly to where I am spiritually and emotionally. That is, one where you lie on the floor and everyone leaves you the hell alone for an hour. Bliss.We connect to our breath. We vocalise in Sanskrit, while looking in different directions with our eyes closed. All the while, Selvey whispers instructions. Yoga nidra uses spoken guidance to access deep “interiority”, and these soothing susurrations are an effective delivery system.Like any ASMR, the intimacy may be … a bit much. I can hear the saliva clicks and trickles in the teacher’s mouth, breath catching on palatal ridges. “Try not to fall asleep,” Selvey advises, but being a natural rebel/deeply exhausted, I start to drift. I’m not fully out – rather, floating in a rich semi-consciousness. I’m dimly aware of Selvey’s voice, telling us a George Harrison-esque story. Some weeks, this may be cosmic in nature, or geographic, but this week he is taking us on a journey through inner space. I feel as if I’m in a lucid dream, vaguely aware of stopping off at my heart, navel and assorted other chakras. It’s like being drunk on a night bus and waking up in nirvana. I don’t get the famous tingles, but not everyone does.It’s tricky to be definitive about ASMR’s legitimacy: there is insufficient research, and it’s mostly a self-reported phenomenon. Nonetheless, I like it. It’s an introverted practice in an extroverted world. It rewards those who pay attention to little things, who find their bliss in Blakeian miniature. Stillness, sensitivity and listening are good for the nervous system and the soul. The class’s saucy postcard pitch may be over-promising, but I had a great time regardless. Whisper it, but I may have reached the point where a nap is more desirable than a braingasm. Good lord: now there is something to meditate on.Are the videos meant to be sexytimes? These breathy people, un-crinkling Tunnock’s wrappers and running lint-rollers up the cat – should I be pants-free when I listen? ASM-asking for a friend.ASM-aybe. But the nap was truly divine. 3/5"
Making my own clothes transformed my body image – and my life,"As a teenager, the styles I liked never came in my size. So discovering that I could sew my own was profoundly freeing – and led me to help curvy women all over the world",Jenny Rushmore,2019-10-21T08:00:27+0100,"If you had told me when I was 29 that in 10 years time I would have made my entire wardrobe, run a sewing pattern company and finally found peace with my body, I would have said that was impossible. But learning to sew a simple pillow started a journey that blossomed into a total life transformation.Ever since I was a toddler in ballet class being told off for having a sticky-out tummy, I have been on the bigger side. No matter how many diets I tried, or sit-ups I did, I stayed stubbornly chubby, even if I had brief forays into being a smaller clothes size. By the time I was a teenager, I was resigned to it: not only did I feel like an unattractive failure for being a size 16 at 16 years old (how I laugh now at the idea that that is huge), but there was also no way I would be able to dress as I wanted to, despite the fact I loved clothes, because there simply weren’t clothes I liked in my size in the shops.Of course, my size wasn’t the only thing that defined me. An enthusiastic adopter of hobbies, I was creative from a young age, always starting up a new art or craft. So, when I was looking for a new challenge when I turned 30, I thought I would learn to sew. I vividly remember the first lesson I took, making a “rustic” pillow – as I sewed the first seam, I caught the bug. Before long, I was spending every evening and weekend learning new techniques; soon I was trying to make my own clothes, as I had the exciting idea that maybe I could make things that fitted.Imagine my disappointment, then, when I found out that, just as so many clothing shops ended at a size 16, so did most sewing patterns. Plus, they tended to be made for a B-cup bra and I was much bigger than that. So, I had to learn to alter patterns to fit me, mastering the complex “full bust adjustment” and learning how to make a single garment with different sizes at the bust, waist and hips. It took a long time to refine my alteration skills, but once I did I could create any garment, in any fabric, in any style – and it would fit me.Learning this skill of changing my clothes to fit my body, rather than changing my body to fit my clothes, was profoundly freeing: from the constant internal narrative I had when I was in a changing room willing a size 14 to fit; from having to wear what other people had decided was suitable for someone my size; from being assigned a number that was meant to dictate my worth as a person. I realised I had been tormenting myself to fit into an “average” that had never existed. It became evident that, contrary to what I had always believed, anyone can wear anything, as long as it fits. There is no magic rule that says when women hit a size 16 they no longer want to wear silk dresses, biker jackets, swimsuits or crop tops. All you need is enough fabric and sewing and fitting skills – then anything is possible. I learned that there was nothing inherently wrong with my body, and trying on only clothes that were custom-made for me was total bliss.Still, I was frustrated that I had to make so many alterations to every sewing pattern – and I knew I wasn’t alone, because the average UK woman is a size 16 and a DD cup size. So, one night, about four years after I learned to sew, I had an idea that would change my life again: I was going to help other curvy women experience the body positivity transformation I had, by creating sewing patterns that were designed for our size and body shape – no adjustments required.A year later, I launched Cashmerette Patterns with the Appleton dress, a wrap dress that doesn’t gape at the bust, that comes in sizes 16 to 32 and in cup sizes C to H. It turned out I was right: so many other women felt alienated by sewing patterns, and being able to whip up a dress “straight out of the packet” was not only convenient but also liberating. Since then, I have quit my job to run Cashmerette full-time. We have more than 20 patterns, from simple T-shirts and a swimsuit with a full underwired bra inside, to a shirt that doesn’t gape at the buttons. They are sold all over the world.My 29-year-old self would be astonished to see what my life looks like now, but I know she would be proud and perhaps a little overwhelmed to know how much I have changed and how I have been able to help other women like me. Learning to sew changed almost every facet of my life, and I will always be grateful to the small cushion that opened my mind to what was possible."
Five ways to deal with head lice and nits,"Parents dread discovering an infestation of the itchy menaces, but with the right approach you can stop them in their tracks",Amy Fleming,2019-10-20T15:59:03+0100,"“People are not treating an infestation at the earliest stages,” says Ian Burgess, the director of the Medical Entomology Centre in Cambridge, whose research is cited in the Nice guidelines for this persistent problem. “We quite often find people with hundreds and occasionally thousands of lice,” he says. Dee Wright, the owner of The Hairforce, a chain of self-styled “lice assassins”, says: “If you check your child’s hair and find a bunch of nits [eggs], you should be combing immediately, rather than waiting to spot a live one. It’s good to do a weekly check.”Many of Britain’s bestselling nit combs are ineffective, says Burgess: “They have gaps so wide that lice and nits can slip through.” He recommends using a plastic detection comb. “It needs to be rigid, and the front needs to be squared, to catch the legs of the lice.” The Bug Buster Kit sold by the charity Community Hygiene Concern contains these types of combs, with different sizes for lice and nits, and is available on the NHS (free for children diagnosed with lice). “It’s not going to be done in five minutes,” says Burgess. “With thick or long hair, you need to spend 20 to 30 minutes per session. If you’ve found a dozen and think you’ve done a good job, you probably haven’t – there’ll be at least another dozen hiding.”“Lice are movement-sensitive and scarper when you touch the hair,” warns Wright. Dividing the head into sections helps avoid missing any. Detangle the hair first and use conditioner. Metal combs, especially, can shred individual hairs, says Burgess. “We have even come across pseudo nits, where the comb has peeled back little knots that look and feel like nits,” he says. “So if you’re going to comb, you need to use a lubricant and do it carefully.”Burgess says that we have known about pesticide-resistant lice in the UK since 1995, yet chemical pesticide treatments are still sold – and frequently recommended by pharmacists and prescribed by doctors. “GPs aren’t listening,” he says. “It’s hardly surprising there are a lot of lice.”Silicone-based shampoo treatments, otherwise known as physical pesticides, may effectively smother the lice, but some of the dreaded nits can survive. “We looked at nearly 1,895 case records,” says Burgess. “Most of those who had baby lice appear after a treatment had them within the first week, but the longest case was 13 days.” Either treat again a week or so later, or keep combing for a few weeks to catch any late hatchers."
The new workwear: has the suit finally died?,Hardly anyone wears a suit to work now. How did we all get so scruffy? And what about all those lovely ties? Richard Godwin charts the demise of looking smart,Richard Godwin,2019-10-20T08:00:51+0100,"One afternoon about a decade ago, I was standing at a pub urinal not far from my old newspaper office when the man standing next to me opened up a conversation.“A tie, huh?” (He was American.) “Never take a job where they make you wear a tie.”He was in his mid-30s, wearing expensive-looking trainers, jeans and a sweatshirt. I was in my mid-20s, wearing my standard workwear: some nicely cut trousers, a decent white shirt, probably some black Chelsea boots and, yes, a tie that I would have taken some care selecting.I tried to explain that I liked my job. And I wasn’t forced to wear a tie, I chose to wear a tie. I liked ties! I liked how the French actor Romain Duris paired his tie with a high-collared leather jacket in the movie The Beat That My Heart Skipped. I liked how those old Italian dudes wore their ties on the Sartorialist blog. I liked how I never used to wear a tie and now I did and that meant I was a grown-up. I liked how people sometimes went: “Ooh, looking sharp,” and they definitely hadn’t said that a few years before, when I thought a Sparta Prague football shirt was the way to communicate how cosmopolitan and discerning I was.I even liked buying ties. So easy – one size fits all – and potentially bargainous. I had a fancy peacock silk one that my then-girlfriend-now-wife had bought me from Liberty, but also a weirdly chic green blobby-stripy one we found in an old flea market in Florence for about €2. But hang on – why am I justifying myself to a random toilet person? Who starts a conversation in a urinal?The kind of man who never wore a tie, clearly. The kind of man who refused to see the tie as anything other than a corporate noose around my neck. The kind of man whose workwear vision would ultimately prevail.For the American Neckwear Toilet Evangelist clearly had a better grasp of the future than I did. To wear a tie in 2019 is only marginally less eccentric than turning up to work dressed in chainmail. Formalwear, in general, is increasingly the preserve of dandies and defendants.According to market analysts Kantar, sales of suits are down 7% year-on-year, ties are down 6% and blazers down 10%. Marks & Spencer is cutting back on its formalwear; Moss Bros, the suit specialist, has issued three recent profit warnings. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs – whose bankers were once renowned for their Armani suits and Gucci loafers – announced a move to a “flexible dress code”. A company-wide memo cited the “changing nature of workplaces generally in favour of a more casual environment”. Other financial firms have since followed suit as the banks seek to emulate the “whatever” dress codes of the tech companies.The suit in turn has become “a uniform for the power- less”, according to the American site Vox – only worn by people impelled to do so. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wears a suit when he testifies before Congress. When he is in control, he wears the Silicon Valley uniform of T-shirts and jeans – and don’t think that isn’t its own form of power-dressing, a way of saying: “I’m not going to play by your rules.” Boris Johnson’s calculatedly dishevelled appearance is another way of communicating that, too. However, it’s his special adviser, Dominic Cummings, whose dress is emblematic of the age, somehow – a contemptuous mish-mash of athleisure, dadwear and public school signifiers: the grey Levi’s hoodie with workshirt poking out; the hurriedly grabbed tote bag; the quilted gilet. This mess is what the people voted for, he seems to be saying. Deal with it.I am now in my mid-30s and I don’t work in a London newspaper office any more. I am freelance and I do a lot of my writing in a co-working space in Bristol where I moved a couple of years ago, amid nut-butter influencers and CBD start-ups and 20-something digital marketing types who say things like: “Yeah, a third of my capital is in crypto.” It’s kind of fun. But I have never even attempted to wear a tie there. Bristol isn’t really a tie sort of city. Not having been called to testify before Congress recently (what have I been doing with my life?), I haven’t worn a suit for a while either. The grown-up accoutrements I collected in London – the vintage mother-of-pearl cuff links, the Brooks Brothers shirts, the Paul Smith socks – I sort of left behind. If you want to know the truth of it, I’m writing this in slightly mildewy jogging bottoms and luminous orange Adidas running shoes. And it doesn’t necessarily feel like a liberation.Clearly, I am not the only person readjusting to the new workwear rules. Dan Rookwood, formerly US editor of the menswear site Mr Porter, was once rarely seen without at least eight items of exquisite tailoring. He has recently taken a job as creative director at Nike, moved from New York to Portland, and adjusted his attire accordingly. “I now have the best wardrobe I’ve ever had – a proper walk-in wardrobe, where I can see all my clothes,” he says. “But what it shows me is that I can’t wear the vast majority of it any more. It’s all made-to-measure suits and shirts and ties and bench-made shoes that I just can’t see myself wearing outside the occasional wedding as the winds of style have changed. It’s like a museum.”Rookwood notes that the shift away from formal is industry-wide. “Men’s fashion changes more slowly than women’s fashion. But if you look at what men were wearing in 2014 compared to 2019, it is markedly different. This is a big change. We’re just not as buttoned up as we were.” The emphasis has moved from fine tailoring to luxury streetwear; from Milan and London to New York and Los Angeles; from Don Draper on the front of GQ to Kanye West on the sneaker site Highsnobiety. Louis Vuitton last year appointed West’s old associate Virgil Abloh as the artistic director of its menswear collection. Abloh made his name with the Chicago sneaker brand Off-White, where his stated mission was to add an “intellectual layer” to streetwear. While in the past, a woven silk tie from Brioni sent a subtle cue about status, now it’s more likely to be limited-edition Yeezys. There is a whole new set of rules to fall foul of – as the billion-heir Kendall Roy discovers in the HBO TV series Succession when he fails to impress some prospective clients by wearing a pair of Lanvin calfskin sneakers to a meeting.Rookwood feels that suits and all that will come around again – “everything comes back, eventually, in fashion” – but I’m not so sure. There’s a feeling of permanence in this shift, a once-and-for-all changing of the guard. You might cherish an idea of a father taking his son out to buy his first suit. Now a father is more likely to ask his son where to get a limited-edition Supreme hoodie. In any case, today’s 40- and 50-somethings grew up in a world of hip-hop and punk and trainers and tees. It’s what they know.Besides, when I survey a few not-particularly-fashion-y friends, they seem OK with the new relaxed dress codes. No, hardly anyone wears a suit to work any more. And no, hardly anyone mourns this loss. It’s just easier, freer and more comfortable to wear, say, a checked shirt and chinos. And if you happen to spill mayonnaise on your Urban Outfitted crotch while snarfing an al-desko sandwich, there’s usually no need to visit a dry-cleaner either. Economy comes into play. One friend notes that if you spend £100 on a suit, you will end up with a rubbish suit, but if you spend £100 on trousers and a shirt, you can look sharp and distinctive. He does keep a suit in the office, just in case he needs to go and meet that sort of client. But it’s become the sartorial equivalent of a fax machine; a faintly arcane piece of equipment reserved for specific uses.It wasn’t supposed to be like this, notes the American style writer David Coggins. “If you look at the men who wear formalwear well, they always look incredibly relaxed and ultimately comfortable. That’s what style is: it’s having a sense of ease with yourself in any situation.”The idea of tailoring wasn’t about following trends – massive collars one season, tiny ones the next, etc – it was to find something that worked for your shape, your build, your outlook. It was a process that required a certain self-knowledge. I suppose there’s no reason why luxury streetwear shouldn’t provide the same journey. I mean, when Frank Ocean sings about Nikes, it sounds like a meaningful relationship. But one thing that troubles me about this new power-dressing is the emphasis on branding, labels, items that cost hundreds of pounds not because an apprenticed tailor has spent a long time crafting it, but simply because that’s what the market says this thing is worth. Enforced sneakerdom is its own tyranny.Coggins suggests we have come to place too high a value on comfort as a society. “It used to be accepted that you would go through stages of slight discomfort to have an education. So you would read difficult books, or you’d sit through some operas, and maybe the first time you didn’t like it, but you would learn to like it – or at least appreciate what it is at stake. Now there’s this thought that comfort is everything. People dress as if they’re at home all the time, and they act like they’re at home when they’re in public. It’s why people lie down on the floor in airports and Facetime in restaurants and put their feet up on train seats.”There’s another aspect of this that troubles me. One of the pleasures of wearing a suit to work, for me, was shedding it when I got home. Now there is less distinction between work and home, on and off, public and private. I might be answering a work email at 10.37pm, I might be having a nap at 3.07pm, I might be tapping away in a café a 11.45am on a Sunday while families brunch around me.Some freelancers I consult cherish the freedom of working in their pyjamas – “If you can’t motivate yourself without a literal suit on, maybe freelancing is not for your temperament,” says one. Another notes the environmental cost of maintaining a full office wardrobe with a different outfit each day. But others warn against the entropic lure of Uniqlo stretch jogging bottoms.Freelancers warn against the entropic lure of Uniqlo stretch jogging bottomsPersonally, I’m usually in some smart-casual-compromise outfit that is neither truly smart nor truly casual. Maybe some overly formal trousers and some underly white Stan Smiths. Maybe a canvas tote bag with my laptop in it, or a shirt that could use an iron – but am I going to iron a shirt for the school run?I am more often than not in trainers. I find brogues or loafers make a huge clomping noise on the laminate floor of my co-working space. And when I come up to London, I’m often, literally, running between meetings. I can’t help thinking that the move towards trainers as acceptable workwear has a lot to do with the fact that work is now so much a question of inputs and outputs; life is just hectic; we’re expected to “perform” like athletes. But the trainer is also the footwear of the retired, the overleisured, the underemployed.In Nikolai Goncharov’s 1859 novel Oblomov, the dressing gown worn by the title character – khalat in Russian – becomes a symbol of the turpitude of the archetypal 19th-century “superfluous man”. There is even a word in Russian – khalatnost, “dressing-gown-ness” – to describe the condition. I wonder what the 21st-century equivalent would be. Sneakerness? Jerseyness? Dressing-down-ness?I say I never wear a suit and tie any more. The one exception was a recent 20-year university reunion which required all of the men to dress in “lounge suits”. Everyone remarked on how they never wore suits and ties these days. Everyone spent the evening complimenting one another. And everyone, I sensed, enjoyed looking their unashamed best. What if you never had the chance to look your best again? What kind of future would that be?

Tomatoes are good for sperm count – if only I had known that years ago,A man’s worry seems to be hardwired – as if being fertile constitutes a meaningful measure of masculinity,Adrian Chiles,2019-10-09T18:07:22+0100,"I read that tomatoes might be good for a fella’s sperm count. Sperm’s always been a worry for me, ever since the day of the 1978 FA Cup final. I’ll spare you the goriest of the details, but the long and, er, short of it is that I fell off my bike going to my nan and grandad’s house to watch the match and sustained serious injuries to my pudenda. Fifteen stitches were required to sew my boyhood up, but I made it home in time for kick off, which is all I cared about. I was only 11, after all.My parents had other worries. I don’t know whether some doctor at casualty at Corbett hospital in Stourbridge had said anything, but they were concerned about how my fertility might be affected. Mercifully, having begat two children 20 years later, all seemed to be in fair working order. And almost 20 years after that, I found myself doing a radio item about the National Sperm Bank. This involved having my own stuff analysed. Having breezily agreed to do this, I found myself in a small room in a fertility clinic in London trying to conjure up a sample, with a colleague called Steve standing outside holding a microphone.“Now,” said the white-coated woman when I handed her the vessel, “when I bring your results, are you sure you’re OK for it to be recorded? Many men are sensitive about it.” Why would I care? My procreating days were well behind me. Except suddenly I did care; the concern seemed to be hardwired, as if being pointlessly fertile constituted some meaningful measure of masculinity.Silly really. My heart bled for the blokes who had struggled with this for real. How much anxiety must those walls have witnessed?It took ages for the woman to reappear. She had a studiedly neutral look on her face. “Can I just check your age again?” she said. She made a couple of notes and then announced that, for men of my age, the World Health Organization reckons 15m sperms per millilitre is the average. With deadpan authority she then told me I was rolling with no fewer than 32m of the things and they were quite active, or something. I felt great relief and, absurdly, no small amount of pride. I was walking an inch taller as I strode out of that clinic. And this feeling grew and grew all day.That evening I was on a long motorway drive. Anytime I overtook a female driver, I made sure my window was up, lest one of my 32m had slipped out earlier and was lurking around me looking for an egg to fertilise.However, it wasn’t long before I was put in my place. During the course of the live show from the National Sperm Bank in Birmingham, I met a guy from Northfield, south of the city, who was one of the star donors. “What kind of numbers you posting, mate?” I asked airily, waiting to slap my 32m on the table between us. “Eighty-five million,” he replied. Enough said. My sperm might not have that much going for them after all, but I’ll say this much for my virility: anyone who can do a three-hour live show from a sperm bank must be doing something right."
"‘I’d say I had a mastectomy, and my mates would go: “But you’re a man!”’","Breast cancer affects far fewer men than women. But that’s no reason to ignore warning signs that include lumps, sores, discharges and bleeding",Sirin Kale,2019-10-07T08:00:44+0100,"Andy Manson’s wife, Michelle, had to force him to go to the doctor. Manson, a broadband engineer from Reading, had been experiencing a stabbing pain in his left nipple for months. But he ignored it until December 2013, when it got so bad that Michelle insisted. “She said: ‘I don’t know what you’re playing at!’” Manson remembers.The speed with which the GP referred him to the breast clinic at the Royal Berkshire hospital was Manson’s first inkling that something was wrong. “You figure it’s more than just a pain,” Manson, now 48, remembers. He was right. He had stage four breast cancer that had spread to his lymph nodes. Six years on, following a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Manson’s cancer is in remission – and he is hugely thankful he listened to his wife. “I was lucky,” he admits. “I didn’t go to the doctor as quickly as I should have, but I got away with it and – touch wood – I’m in the clear.”Often mistakenly viewed as a women-only disease, breast cancer can, and does, strike men, including Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé’s father, who went public with his diagnosis last week.According to research from Breast Cancer Now, about 370 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK (versus 55,000 women). Most will get the diagnosis between the ages of 60 and 70. Like women, they are more likely to develop it if they are obese.Because men are more reluctant to visit GPs – and because of the misconception that only women can get breast cancer – their breast cancer is typically more advanced by the time it is diagnosed. “When men have a suspicious lump in their chest, they often disregard it,” says Prof Valerie Speirs of the University of Aberdeen, a cancer biologist who specialises in male breast cancer. “This means they usually present at a later stage than women and the cancer can be more difficult for clinicians to treat, because it’s spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.”“Men need to be breast aware,” says Grete Brauten-Smith, a clinical nurse specialist for Breast Cancer Now. She advises men to look out for breast lumps, which can be painless or close to the nipple, inverted nipples, sores on the chest or nipples that won’t heal, swelling under the arm or in the chest area, or nipple discharge, which may also be bloody. “It’s so important that they check their breast tissue, get to know any changes and report them to their GP.”“It was such a shock,” Doug Harper, 57, from Plumstead, says of his breast cancer diagnosis. “I remember telling my mates and them saying: ‘What do you mean? Men can’t get breast cancer.’” Like Manson, Harper was cajoled into visiting the GP in January 2012 by his wife, after mistakenly thinking he had a cyst on his nipple. “She said: ‘Go to the doctor – this is getting annoying.’” When he took off his T-shirt, the doctor’s entire demeanour changed. Jokingly, Harper asked the doctor if it might be cancer. “He said: ‘It could be.’ I said: ‘Oh God.’”Male breast cancer sufferers will find themselves in a system designed for women. When he was recovering from his mastectomy at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich, Harper’s wardmates asked what procedure he was in for. “I’d say I had a mastectomy for breast cancer, and they’d say: ‘That can’t possibly be right.’”He was given the leaflet of a support group, but the wording only referred to female patients. Men attending breast cancer clinics will often be pegged as supportive partners, rather than patients. “You sit in the mammogram waiting room, and you’re the only bloke there,” Manson says. “You feel like people are looking at you, thinking you shouldn’t be there.”At present, men are excluded from breast cancer clinical trials, although the situation is improving. “There’s more research into breast cancer in men than there was before. People are starting to realise that male breast cancer needs to receive the same kind of attention that female breast cancer has for years,” Speirs says. More work still needs to be done. “I’d like there to be more awareness of male breast cancer. Everything is a sea of pink.” (The international symbol for breast cancer is a pink ribbon.)Having breast cancer as a man can be isolating in other ways. The cancer drug Tamoxifen’s side effects can include impotence, which men may find embarrassing or difficult to talk about. After being diagnosed in January 2012, Harper didn’t meet another man with breast cancer until July of that year, when he took part in a charity event.“I made a beeline for him,” he remembers. “I just wanted to talk with someone else who had been through the same as me.” (Breast Cancer Now runs a matching service to connect male breast cancer patients with other men with the condition.)Recently, when he was going for a routine mammogram – his cancer is in remission – Harper saw a young man in his 20s being screened. He wanted to pass on his details, but decided against it in case he alarmed him. “I’ve always wondered how he got on.”"

I wanted the boy’s first shoes to be posh – but he had other ideas,"It turns out miserliness is in the genes, as my son’s choice of footwear reveals",Séamas O’Reilly,2019-10-20T09:30:51+0100,"Often, when I see nice clothes in the bougie shops near where I live, I entertain a mild fantasy of myself as one of those dads who garbs their child in cooler-than-cool threads. I don’t think that would be a particularly noble vice, of course, but naively imagine it could be one of those annoying eccentricities – like vaping or making jewellery – that people would forgive so long as I occasionally made fun of myself for it.The only problem with this ambition is that freelance life has turned me into a miser, unwilling to buy any children’s clothes that aren’t made in runs of 40,000. When some snazzy jumper or beautiful hat catches my eye, I’ll invariably discover it’s priced as if it was hand-woven instore, by Richard & Judy. I don’t buy these items. No - like you, I place them back on the rack and, gripped by some odd horror that I will appear cheap, continue a discretionary period of fake ‘browsing’ to disguise my eventual exit, presumably out of a fear that the staff will know that the £79 price tag on that pair of mittens just made my soul leave my body.I thought I’d buck that trend this week by investing in his first pair of proper walking shoes. I was told a solid, more expensive pair would be best, presumably because they’d make walking more comfortable, not because he’d be inspired to display his sweet new kicks to the neighbourhood.In fairness, he might well feel cheated, since back when he was born we were gifted with so many clothes that he was covered head to toe in much nicer things. But I spent my entire childhood either wearing hand-me-downs from my eight older siblings, or freshly bought plastic shoes displaying non-copyright text like ATHLETIC SPORT 1999.Such bargains weren’t just common in Derry, they were mandatory. By law, raincoats had to boast the clumpy consistency of something fashioned from melted credit cards, and teachers would do spot checks to make sure every stitch of your clothing was flammable. What need for designer T-shirts when you could support the local polyester industry for a fraction of the price? And why would anyone settle for Giorgio Armani, when there was a perfectly good George of Armagh, NI, just down the road?Clearly such tightness is hereditary, since my boy had no interest in the spangly rubberised trainers we tried in the fancy shop and cried at the pleather beauties from a fancier one still. No, my penny-pinching progeny only had eyes for a drab pair of cloth clogs, which cost £6 and came in plastic tubing usually reserved for tennis balls and Pringles. I might not be a cool dad, but if he’s happy to save me a few pennies, I’ll let him. If that makes me a miser, I just ask you don’t judge a man until you walk a mile in his ATHLETIC SPORT.Follow Séamas on Twitter @shockproofbeats"

‘Do or die’: Australian cycling in limbo amid landmark reform,"Opposition to governance unification, along with the high voting thresholds, risks derailing nation-wide changes",Kieran Pender,2019-10-21T18:00:40+0100,"Cycling in Australia faces unprecedented upheaval, with voting underway to unify the 19 separate entities responsible for the sport across the country. While the proposed restructuring is intended to facilitate better outcomes for elite and recreational cyclists, create “one voice” for advocacy and improve the sport’s financial position, resistance to the reform risks leaving cycling in disarray.“This is a real opportunity to create significant change for the better,” says Scott McGrory OAM, an Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist who now works as a race director. “Doing nothing is, quite simply, stupid. This is a ‘do or die’ moment for Australian cycling.”In 2018, federal agency Sport Australia commissioned a governance review from Ernst & Young, with the support of the three national sporting organisations: Cycling Australia, BMX Australia and Mountain Bike Australia. The consultancy’s subsequent 128-page report identified that cycling is “fragmented in its structure, strategy and delivery”. The division of cycling into three disciplines, with two possessing constituent state and territory organisations, left individual entities with “few assets, restricted revenue opportunities and limited capacity”.This year, the three NSOs proposed a complete unification, merging the three cycling disciplines, and the 19 constituent bodies, to form “AusCycling”. Among the suggested benefits of this model are a single racing licence, improved commercial and advocacy outcomes, and more resources as a result of efficiencies. Sport Australia has also promised A$2.5m if the merger proceeds.“This proposal is about making cycling as strong as it can be,” CA chief executive Steve Drake tells Guardian Australia. “I have always loved cycling – I want to see it prosper. This is the way it can.”The three NSOs have promised that no jobs will be lost as a result of the merger, except the three chief executive roles. “It was never going to be possible for the CEO of, say, CA to be the CEO of AusCycling, because it would be a perceived as a CA takeover.” A new, external CEO will be sought to lead the unified organisation.While staffing levels are expected to remain static or even grow, organisational synergies and improved negotiation power are expected to substantially improve the sport’s financial position. EY estimated an annual saving of about A$2m; the NSOs have indicated all savings will be reinvested.“We want to remove duplicated systems and avoid wasted effort,” says Drake. “At the moment we have 19 legal entities with 19 boards. While all directors are volunteers, for any board you have compliance requirements, audits etc – all of that takes time. That effort that is not needed. Collectively, we are a sport with turnover of about $28m across all the entities. Having 19 boards and over 100 directors does not make sense at our scale.”Voting across the various national, state and territory entities is due to begin in the coming weeks. For the proposal to pass, 75% of MTBA’s individual members and six of the eight constituent bodies of CA and BMXA respectively must approve the unparalleled governance overhaul (each with a 75% majority of their own). Voting rights at state level are predominantly, although not universally, controlled by local clubs.Not everyone is in favour of unification. Several states have expressed concerns with the plan. When the NSOs scheduled roadshows in September in Adelaide, Darwin, Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Launceston, Perth and Mackay to discuss the proposal with stakeholders, Western Australia’s WestCycle suggested that they should not visit Perth. The NSOs went anyway. “It was a lively debate,” says Drake. WestCycle was contacted for comment.This opposition, along with the high voting thresholds, risks derailing comprehensive, nation-wide governance reform. Drake admits the unification may proceed even without unanimity from state and territory bodies, or even with only two of the three NSOs.“There are lots of permutations,” he says. “But AusCycling would not come into operation until the second quarter of 2020, so there would be opportunity for a state body who voted no to change their view, or for constituent clubs from that state to join directly.”If the proposal is approved, it is expected that unification will not be finalised until just months out from the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Drake insists that Australia’s medal prospects are unaffected.“There is no risk of disruption to high performance, whether the unification proceeds or not,” Drake says. “We have been very mindful of keeping the high performance business away from the distraction of the process.”Ahead of the critical voting period – which should conclude by 19 December – Drake is optimistic. “Any process of change can be challenging, but the level of support seems to be going up by the day,” he says. “People have been talking about something like this since 1994, and it has not yet happened. It will be a huge opportunity missed if we do not proceed.”One stakeholder in favour of change is McGrory. “This is the best chance we have to create growth and opportunities for everyone that pedals a bike of any kind,” he says. “I only hope that anyone who is still uncertain at AusCycling can look at this with an open mind.”"
Eddie in Wonderland: Jones cuts a cartoon figure to perform an old script,England’s head coach animates his art of distraction with comic jibes to blur fantasy and reality – and boost his team’s self-belief,Robert Kitson,2019-10-22T12:55:09+0100,"In Disneyland, where England are staying for this semi‑final week, they specialise in blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. Perhaps that is why Eddie Jones has based his squad in a hotel full of people dressed up as Mickey Mouse wannabes. If you are looking to dream big, this is not a bad place to start.Even the late Walt Disney himself would have been impressed with Jones’s Broadway act on a rainy lunchtime, a performance intended for a specific target audience if ever there was one. In between suggesting New Zealand are a side under increasing pressure, dismissing the local media as “fans with keyboards” and hinting that persons unknown had been spying on England training, there was something for all the family.As with all great masters of illusion, it was left up to others to choose precisely what they wanted to believe. Someone was definitely (maybe) spotted on a distant balcony overlooking the training ground but, no, England could not categorically say the individual had Kiwi connections. Innocent until proven guilty? “There was definitely someone in the apartment block filming but it might have been a Japanese fan. Don’t care, mate.” OK, so why mention it?His potshots at the New Zealand media also had a knowing subtext: Jones is equally happy directing fire at their UK counterparts. “One week ago, I was going to get sacked, Owen Farrell couldn’t kick, someone wrote there’d be blood on the walls of Twickenham. Now we are in a World Cup semi-final and have a chance of going through.” So did he simply want to give the All Black management something good to read over their coffee? “Well someone has to ask them a question because the NZ media doesn’t ... you guys are just fans with keyboards.”All good knockabout stuff: if you give it out, you have to be prepared to take it. The message Jones really wanted to sprinkle like Tinker Bell’s fairy dust, though, was that New Zealand are the team with the heavier weight on their collective shoulders this week, in comparison to England’s carefree troubadours. Quick as a flash he asked all those present who thought England would win this Saturday to raise their hand, before – shock, horror – declaring the poll closed a nanosecond later. “Well I couldn’t see too many hands go up. Your first reaction is always your most honest reaction, and if you don’t put your hand up straight away you don’t believe it. And you don’t.” Job done. Next.On and on it went, like Pluto chasing his tail. “We don’t have any pressure, mate. No one thinks we can win. There are 120 million Japanese people out there whose second team are the All Blacks. So there’s no pressure on us ... whereas they’ve got to be thinking about how they’re looking for their third World Cup. That brings an element of pressure. New Zealand talk about walking towards pressure. Well, this week the pressure is going to be chasing them down the street.”The digested read digested? Get under the All Blacks’ skin and you never know. Jones gets on well with Steve Hansen and admires what his coaching adversary has achieved but, in his eyes, the art of distraction is always worth trying. One, it may just cause one or two New Zealanders to take their eye off the ball. Two, it potentially hijacks the media agenda for a day or two. Three, it encourages his own players to demystify their opponents. Not many New Zealanders, journalists or otherwise, gave the British & Irish Lions much chance of emerging with a drawn series in 2017 so why should England not stand a chance in a one‑off semi-final? Jones seldom misses that kind of open goal.“Seventeen of our players went on the Lions tour,” Jones said. “They went down there, they played in their back yard, and they know they’re human. They bleed, they drop balls, they miss tackles like every other player. It’s our job to take their time and space away so that we put them under pressure. I don’t think they are vulnerable but pressure is a real thing.“The busiest bloke in Tokyo this week will be Gilbert Enoke, the mental skills coach. It is potentially the last game for their greatest coach and their greatest captain and they will be thinking about those things. It is always harder to defend a World Cup and they will be thinking about that as well.”Credit where it is due: there are days when Jones makes even the Jungle Book’s python Kaa sound unpersuasive. Just before the final credits, though, it was time to deliver the serious section of the script. “I can remember being in Kyoto for the draw two and a half years ago. Even an Australian could do the mathematics: we were going to play New Zealand in a semi-final. Progressively we’ve built a game that we think we can take New Zealand with and we’ve done that over the last two and a half years. We’re just excited by the possibility.” Neverland? We will all find out on Saturday."
When it comes to blusher don’t be bashful,"Not just for the young, rouged cheeks can revitalise your complexion",Funmi Fetto,2019-10-20T06:30:46+0100,"There is something “girlie” about blusher. Hence, there is an idea it has an age limit. Total nonsense, of course, as shown at Chanel AW19. Yes, it has youthfulness written all over it, but it is magic for a complexion that needs resuscitation. Nailing technique, shade and texture is key. For definition, without the faff of contouring, circular strokes of a powder blush on the cheekbones blended up and out is best. For ease, less density and a freshness that is unsurpassed, go for a cream. Pinks are flattering – paler shades, paler skin; deeper shades, deeper skin – but orange will give you a warm glow. Go easy, otherwise you’ll look like an actual orange.1. Nars Hustle Cheek Palette £36, narscosmetics.co.uk 2. Shiseido Minimalist Whipped Powder Blush £32, lookfantastic.com 3.

Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Sheer Colour Stick N°25 £35, chanel.comI can’t remember the last time I met anyone who wasn’t sleep-deprived. Back in the day, this modern epidemic was limited to insomniacs and new mothers. I can remember lacking a decent snooze for so long that I understood why sleep deprivation was used as a form of torture. Nowadays, everyone is functioning on little sleep. Arguably, it’s because we are all so ‘busy’. Busyness has become a status symbol for our age. We are always ‘on’ and it’s becoming impossible to switch off. And that’s why our cortisol levels (the stress-producing hormone) are through the roof. For better sleep, the experts recommend removing electronic devices from the bedroom, exercising during the day and managing your circadian rhythm – the body’s internal clock – by reducing our exposure to bright lights at least three hours before bed. I’ll add another tip. Get yourself a ‘sleep mist’. I know, it sounds ridiculous and a bit basic, but it really helps. This one has blended essential oils – neroli, chamomile, lavender and geranium, all known for their sleep-enhancing properties – in a distilled flower water concoction. Half an hour before bed I go to town and spray it everywhere for good measure. Sleep comes quick and goes deep. I wake up feeling human as opposed to a half-functioning 21st-century bastion of busyness.

I thought I knew about feminism – then I started work in a women’s prison,"I wanted to teach the inmates about female empowerment. Instead, they overturned my views on everything from sex work to marriage",Mim Skinner,2019-10-17T10:00:49+0100,"I thought I knew about feminism. I had the word “FEMINIST” written in black marker pen across the front of my homework diary aged 15, along with an anti-war sticker that incongruously involved a cupcake. I had graduated from the “girl power” of my primary school years to reading Germaine Greer on a beanbag in the college library. I felt sorry for the girls in sixth form getting Brazilians, who, unlike my enlightened self, clearly hadn’t clocked that waxing was a tool of patriarchal oppression. I studied feminist theory, went to feminist gatherings and listened to feminist podcasts. I had spent several evenings sitting cross-legged at a “collective” organised by other middle-class, university-educated women talking about intersectionality and Frida Kahlo. By the time I graduated from university, I had firmly absorbed a list of the correct ideas and words that I needed to be a “proper feminist” (but was probably not someone you wanted to invite to a dinner party).In 2015, two years after graduating, I began a job working in a high-security women’s prison. I had read enough statistics and policy reports before I started to know that women in prisons were in desperate need of a little female empowerment. But what I quickly learned was that my feminist education had a thick wedge of information missing: namely, the part where it connected to actual women being very fundamentally oppressed because of their gender. Confronted by someone whose cervix had been plugged with four egg-sized capsules of crack cocaine on the behest of a controlling boyfriend who would reap the profits, I found it difficult to work out quite how my Frida Kahlo T-shirt and mansplaining radar were going to help things.I quickly learned that my feminist education had a thick wedge of information missingWomen in prison are a group statistically likely to be on the wrong side of almost any curve: to have grown up in areas of deprivation and be victims of childhood sexual exploitation, sexual and domestic violence, domestic homicide and homelessness. Half of women in prison are there for committing a crime to support someone else’s drug habit – almost always a man’s. For some, this crime is selling sex from pavements, or soliciting; for plenty of others it is professional shoplifting, known as “grafting”. This means pocketing anything from fillet steak to mascara to be resold round the houses. In the months leading up to Christmas, shopping lists are collected in pubs for toys and gifts to be stolen on request and sold cut-price. Women are sent out on these grafting missions because they are seen as less conspicuous than men.Needless to say, I was very green in my first few months in prison. I worked between the education and chaplaincy departments and the majority of my time was spent running art classes to help women with their personal development and self-expression.I had been helping to run a soup kitchen, and lived at a community house where we gave homeless people emergency shelter in our spare room, so I had naively thought the problems would feel familiar. It was so different, though, when those issues – unstable housing, addiction and abuse – were condensed in the prison, packed into classrooms and three metre by two metre cells.In one session, we asked the women to make an A3 map of their lives from torn-up magazines. The collage would show a road that meandered from their past experiences to future goals. Almost every road began with bottles of vodka, syringes and shadowy characters, and almost every one ended with symmetrical houses and white wedding dresses and Laura Ashley sofas. I had spiked the magazine pile with my partner’s railway-modelling magazines and glossy Sunday supplements in the hope of inspiring something different – a new job, an interesting hobby, some travel, perhaps? – but to little avail. “What else would you be doing in the future?” I asked Cathy*, looking at the scenes of domesticity she aspired to. “You’ve been writing some beautiful poetry about your experiences,” I told her. “I could help you get them published as part of a campaign for prison reform.”Cathy was about my age (29) but since leaving the care system had only known the control of either a man or the state. She, like many others, was a shoplifter and was frequently in and out of prison for theft and drug possession. “It will be finding ‘the one’ that will get me out of my mess,” she said. “He will look after me and keep people away who come round trying to sell me gear [heroin] again.”Cathy’s was an oft-told story. She had been prevented from seeing her children by social services because she couldn’t stop seeing an abusive partner. He kept coming round and, against her best judgment, she opened the door.What I wanted to say was that she didn’t need a man to straighten her life out for her, that she had “everything she needed inside of her” (life advice that works best when Instagrammed over a picture of a thin white girl walking into a sunset).In time I came to realise that she was probably right. Ambition and independence are a good deal further up the hierarchy of need than security. It’s pretty realistic to assume that the quickest way to ward off a coercive and abusive man is to find another man who is kinder and stronger to stand in the way.Prison changed my attitude to sex work, too. The jail had just appointed its first female governor and she was keen to put feminism on the agenda for International Women’s Day that year. My projects (I had previously hosted a lecture by a non-binary Mars astronaut, run a workshop on gender-neutral pronouns and started a choir that sang protest songs) that would have been met with eye-rolls before her arrival were now enthusiastically scheduled: a showing of the film Made in Dagenham followed by a debate on the gender pay gap. The learning and skills department was running a concurrent visit from a local museum, featuring artefacts from the suffragette movement.I had engaged with ideological debates on the topic of sex work before, of course I had. I knew that to question whether sex work is really like any other work would make you a dreaded “swerf” (sex worker exclusionary radical feminist) and – like the patriarchy – is an attempt to control what women do with their bodies. People don’t need rescuing, the theory goes, they need rights and unions.I had assumed that sex work was well paid. Most women could only keep 10%Phoebe was the first to speak after I had introduced the topic of equal pay and sexism in the workplace. She was, as many of the women in prison were, “on the game”. She worked as an escort, managing her business online, so she could charge her own prices and didn’t need to rely on a pimp. She was fairly new to the jail, and had been transferred from a big city prison, ruffling the other inmates with her manicured nails and diamante sliders. “I don’t think women get it worse at all,” she said. “We get doors opened, bought presents, we got everything we need to get what we want right here.” She ran her hand down the length of her body and winked. “You can’t do that if you’re a man.”She directed her comments pointedly to the woman next to her. Lesley was the kind of sex worker we more often see in prison, known as a “survival sex worker”, someone on the game because they have no other choice. Lesley sold £6 blowjobs from street corners to fund her and her partner’s heroin addictions, the signs of which showed on her face, with hollowed cheeks and yellowed teeth. Before I worked in prisons, I had assumed that sex work must be quite well paid per hour – that even those with a pimp could surely enjoy a 60:40 split of the takings. This was wishful thinking. Although there are plenty of women like Phoebe, they are less likely to end up in jail, meeting people like me. Most of the women I met were getting more like 10%, or being paid in drugs and housing rather than cash. The almost universally male pimps often have a group of women in their employ and rake in the takings in return for protection. In other words, it’s a racket. Survival sex work has a worse gender pay gap than almost any other industry. “Does anyone disagree with Phoebe?” I asked. There was a silence, then Lesley piped up. “I don’t see anyone’s boyfriends having to go out on the game,” she said. Phoebe rolled her eyes. “No one’s making you, babe. And no one is setting your prices that low either.” I started to sense that there was some sort of argument from the wing going on here that I was not aware of, and the spat was working its way into our discussion in the guise of a price war. “You’re bringing everyone’s prices down with what you charge on the pavement, you slut.” By this point, they had both got up. “We do the same thing,” Lesley shouted. “Don’t you go thinking you’re better than me.” By this point, I had lost the room. Security had arrived. And the questions I had planned about unionisation and female solidarity were drowned out by more immediate concerns.It was not the International Women’s Day I had planned. But as happened so often in my time in prison, the theories and beliefs I came in with sat uncomfortably next to the nuance of the reality. The majority of sex workers I met in prison, who arrived with bruises and track-marks, would rather have been doing anything else. They needed their rights protected, sure, but they also wanted a route out. The reality was not simple. It rarely is.I learned that my idealism had made me treat feminism like a club rather than a journey. My self-congratulatory, cross-legged-femcast feminism was not flexible enough to accommodate the volume of women’s conflicting experiences, thoughts and feelings in the prison.The truth is that some women want to start a business, and others would like the safety and security provided by giving control to a trustworthy man, at least for now. Some sex workers want unions, others want an escape route. For feminism to be at all useful, it has to be uncomfortable. It has to include people whom it would be easier to leave out: women who say they’re not feminists; who think they need a man to save them, or who say they fancy Piers Morgan.Working in prison messed up my ideas of what feminism should be. It didn’t invalidate the ideas I had learned and fought for, it just disrupted the clean lines, leaving me with unresolved tensions and fewer opinions. I went into prison thinking that I would be able to use feminism to help empower women, and to reform a system. Instead I met women who taught me about feminism, and saw myself change instead.* Women’s names have been changed.• Jailbirds: Lessons from a Women’s Prison by Mim Skinner is published by Seven Dials (RRP £16.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020 3176 3837.

Team older feminist: am I allowed nuanced feelings about #MeToo?,"After #MeToo, I wondered if my real problem with young feminists was how little they seemed to need us older ones. As far as I could see, they didn’t even want to know us",Meghan Daum,2019-10-16T06:00:15+0100,"I remember a woman who screamed like a feral animal. She was leather tan and sinewy. Spiked bleached blonde hair, sculpted biceps, low-slung cargo pants with Doc Martens, veins bursting from her neck, eyes bugging from her drawn face.She stood on the sidewalks of New York City with a folding table covered with poster-size images from hardcore pornography: women wearing dog collars, women on leashes, women leaned over and viewed from behind, their backs crosshatched with scars. Much of the time she displayed a blowup of the famous Hustler magazine cover showing a naked woman being fed upside down into a meat grinder.“This is what your husbands are masturbating to,” she shouted in a barking monotone. “Wake up, women! Don’t be passive! Sign the petition!”Most everyone turned away or just kept walking. This was back in 1990. I was 20.To be 20 years old in 1990 in New York City was, as far as I was concerned, to own the world. I owned practically nothing of material value back then, but somehow this was all part of a magical transaction in which I knew I’d eventually get ahead even if it seemed, for the moment, like I could barely keep up. The city was still a wild kingdom, a stone-and-steel fortress with rage burning inside. The crack epidemic was long under way and also a long way from ending. Aids was everywhere – ravaging the bodies of the visibly ill and beckoning from public service announcements that preached condoms or death. The graffiti was only beginning to come off the subway cars.Every man, woman and, yes, many children (including those commuting to fancy prep schools) had been mugged or knew someone who had. Every woman knew what it was like to be creepily rubbed against by some dude in a crowded space, and when this happened many of us either jammed our elbows into his abdomen or rolled our eyes and moved away.One time, as I walked down a mostly empty Columbus Avenue around midnight, a man walked up to me – a redheaded, bearded man perhaps 10 years my senior – reached his hand out, and shoved me just below my left collarbone. It was a fairly hard shove, and I almost lifted my arm to shove him back. Instead, the moment passed and I just looked at him in disgust and confusion as we both continued along our way. I remember feeling grateful that the situation hadn’t escalated into anything worse.What I don’t remember is connecting the incident to anything like what would now be called institutionalized misogyny. This was not systemic oppression of women. This was simply life in the big city.Today, the angry, ranting woman with the folding table is gone from the sidewalk. In her place are millions of angry women marching in the streets and, even more so, ranting online. We are tiny pixels coalescing into a giant portrait of rage in all its definitions.Twenty years after the redheaded man shoved me on Columbus Avenue, men were going down like bowling pins against the unstoppable forces of #MeToo. What could you call the fall of 2017 other than the Fall of the Fall of Man. It was a season of hurricanes and rapid soil erosion, namely the mudslide that began with Harvey Weinstein and quickly pulled more men down with it than anyone could reasonably keep up with.Or maybe that’s the wrong metaphor. Maybe it wasn’t a mudslide as much as a giant oil spill from the tanker on which contemporary western society had been carrying its assumptions about male behavior. Like fossil fuels themselves, this behavior had long been construed as a necessary evil, one for which any purported cure seemed as futile and flimsy as a reusable shopping bag. (Hit him with your stiletto if he gets handsy! Make him get in touch with his feelings! Pry his eyes open and force him to read the Scum Manifesto!)I’m not going to even try to summarize the events of that fall or list the men who went down in the spill of #MeToo. Entire books will be written about that movement, the best of which probably can’t be embarked upon until enough years have passed to allow authors even a modicum of perspective. What I can tell you about the fall of 2017 is that it coincided with a downward slope of my youth that was far steeper than I had any grasp of at the time.The autumn of 2017 marked my second year back in New York City after being away for the better part of two decades, most of it in California. Though I’d left California in 2015 in the wake of irremediable, if mercifully amicable, marital separation, it had taken nearly two years to officially get divorced, and this new status carried a sting whose effects sometimes proved paralytic. How could I have imagined that replacing the license plates on your car could feel like a death? (Somehow I’d managed to keep my car registered in California until the last possible minute.) Who knew that shopping for a new health insurance policy could make you feel like you’re on a plastic pool raft floating aimlessly in the Dead Sea? (OK, I guess everyone knows that.)I’d left New York when I was nearly 30. I was now 47. Whereas my chief experience of the city was that of a young woman, I was now faced with re-entering it as a middle-aged one.It wasn’t just that I had been young in New York; New York was my youth. It was the place where I’d spent my entire 20s. It was the place where I figured out what kind of person I wanted to be. That’s a different thing from actually figuring out how to be that person, and it took leaving New York to accomplish that task, but as they like to say in California, setting your intention is the most important phase of the journey.New York was the backdrop for my earliest triumphs and stupidities. It was the first and last place I ever lived where on any given night you could step outside and feel like absolutely anything could happen, that the course of your life could shift like a subway train switching from the local track to the express.It was the place where I had my first real job, my first grown-up boyfriend, my first martini, my first call from a debt collector, my first call from a hospital pay phone telling me someone was in serious trouble. It was the site of my earliest rough drafts and rough treatments, the ones visited upon me as well as the ones I inflicted on others. Now that I had returned, it was as if my 20s were being handed back to me in used condition. What a strange remnant to hold in your hand; what a bittersweet walk down memory’s plank.Here I was again, a girl alone and on the town. I was my most primordial self, a girl who was rabidly ambitious in some ways but inexplicably lazy in others. I was a girl who technically hadn’t been a girl for the better part of 30 years but who nonetheless felt a strange remove from the word “woman”, which seemed to convey a poise and seriousness I hadn’t yet attained.I may have been in my mid-40s, but I was still all jokes and hammy self-deprecation, still unable to accept compliments, still flirting with men by defaulting to my best Diane Keaton in Manhattan impression, even though it had been decades since I was attracted to the kind of men who were attracted to that.I was all the things I’d been when I was young except for the young part. I had a nicer apartment, a little more money, and a little more professional recognition. I had a dog (this I’d longed for in my 20s the way some women long for babies) and a car that I had to move for alternate-side street cleaning. But my days were more or less the same. I sat at my desk and drank coffee. I did my work when I could, but more often I stared into space and wondered what would become of my life. I surfed the internet at a connection speed that would have been unimaginable in 1995.In part because of that connection speed, the space I stared into most of the time wasn’t my own physical space but some unholy rotation of social media, news media and floating junk courtesy of cyberspace. By the time Donald Trump entered office, I probably spent at least three-quarters of my waking hours with my head in this space. By the time #MeToo reached full force, my brain no longer felt connected to my body. At times, my brain no longer felt associated with my brain as I’d once known it. There were moments in which I couldn’t remember the names of people I’d been acquainted with for years.In intense, animated conversations with friends and colleagues, I’d find myself revving up to some sort of grand insight and then suddenly sputtering out mid-sentence, like a rollercoaster propelled halfway up a loop but unable to make it all the way around. Bunched up in my desk chair, I would stare at the computer screen for hours, hunting for words as though tracking lions on safari and practically sweating from the exertion. More than a few times I wondered if I was experiencing some form of dementia.I once read that there’s scientific proof of a correlation between increased nostalgia and creeping senility. And since returning to New York, I’d been soaking in nostalgia. Everywhere I went, my 20s played in my head like a song stuck there permanently. Every neighborhood, every subway station, in some areas every street corner, echoed with some memory from that time. There was John’s pizzeria on Bleecker, where, at 21 and playing hooky from college upstate, I sat with a man – a boy, really – who both was and wasn’t my boyfriend and listened to him reminisce about his old girlfriend, who, he said, was “sexy without being pretty, if that makes any sense”.There, among the slabs of buildings of Midtown Sixth Avenue, were the offices of more temp jobs than I could count: banks, law firms, insurance companies, each with its own mini kitchen and passcode-protected employee restrooms. There, at 57th and Broadway is a Duane Reade pharmacy that was once Coliseum Books, a place where the feral woman had often stood and yelled: “Sign the petition!”I remember being dumped on Delancey Street, kissed on Charles Street, having a strange and short-lived personal assistant job in a musty apartment on Sutton Place.I remember standing on the corner of Eighth Avenue and 49th Street as hail rained down like shellfire one summer night following a long, somewhat drunken dinner with an older man in a powerful position whose meal invitations I dreaded but nonetheless felt obliged to accept.Those meals had started out as business lunches but then migrated into semi-business dinners. During these dinners, the man would tell me certain details about his personal life, which was in a state of acute crisis. I didn’t particularly want to be there but I accepted the invitations because there was in this transaction the implicit notion that he could help my career, albeit in a rather vague, abstract way. I accepted them so because not doing so felt like a kind of professional self-sabotage, as foolish and irresponsible as missing deadlines.At no time did the man make an ultimatum or proposition me directly. I never felt like I was being sexually harassed and obviously no one was kidnapping me from my apartment and forcibly escorting me to the Oyster Bar, where the man would sit waiting for me, smoking probably the fourth of 15 cigarettes he’d smoke that night. I’ll cop to a certain psychological gamesmanship on my part as well. I’d occasionally bum a cigarette from him, an act that gave me a sense of distance and control but that surely read to him as an intimate gesture.At least a few times, after I probably had one too many glasses of wine, I became rather suggestive and flirtatious, inquiring into his personal life, seeing how much I could get him to disclose as he got drunker. I did this in part as a defense mechanism. The more we talked about him, the less we talked about me. But I also did it because I wanted to mess with his head, and I was young enough then to think that doing so would serve as some kind of tacit punishment for his behavior.The truth, of course (which anyone but a young twerp would have the wisdom to realize), was that messing with his head was its own reward for him. I wasn’t censuring his behavior as much as reinforcing it. As for my own, I’ve been cringing about it ever since.Looking back, it would be easy to say I behaved like this out of some instinctive subordination to the man’s power. There’s an element of truth to that, but there’s also an angle at which the situation could be viewed as quite the opposite. From this angle, I behaved the way I did because in some ways the power imbalance between the two of us was tipped in my favor.I was young and the man was twice my age. He may have had professional power over me, but it was limited and in no way unilateral. In fact, thanks to the personal details I’d siphoned out of him, I probably could have placed one phone call and made his life very difficult. And so I carried on with my coquettishness until somehow the meals became fewer and farther between and then finally ended, probably because he took up with someone else. I carried on this way because my life was an open horizon and his was an overstuffed attic.I behaved this way because I must have known on some unconscious level that, at 25, I had more of a certain kind of power than I was ever going to have in my life and that I might as well use it, even if the accompanying rush was laced with shame.This was the summer of 1995. Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill had come out that June, and I listened to it pretty much on constant repeat through August. One night, after doing my silly routine with this man and riding the subway home in self-disgust, I sat in my room and played Jagged Little Pill and then wandered into the kitchen to talk to my roommate. I remember grumbling to her about my dinner companion, complaining about his lechery while conveniently omitting the parts when I’d dramatically exhaled on my cigarette, looked him straight in the eye, and said something devastatingly witty and possibly a tiny bit dirty. (I’d like to add that I winked, but that wouldn’t past the truth test, since I’m physically unable to wink.)Instead I said: “God, what a perv.”“Sounds annoying,” my roommate said. “But hey, you keep showing up. You must be getting something out of it.”I behaved this way because I must have known that, at 25, I had more power than I was ever going to have in my lifeDuring the Fall of the Fall of Man, I thought a lot about the showing up I’d done over the years. Every woman seemed to be taking this kind of inventory. It was like a novel everyone was reading, one with a plot that seemed easy enough to follow but whose underlying themes and messages amount to an abstruse thicket of personal projection and postmodern obfuscation.Like any sentient being, I’d been shocked and disgusted by the Weinstein revelations and saw no reason to equivocate about the reliability of his accusers or the severity of his punishment. But as the list of perpetrators piled up and the public censure piled on, the conversation around #MeToo (lacking a specific category, each new scandal was not a story or an issue but a “conversation”) began to split down generational lines.The first incident to put this divide in notably sharp relief involved a secret Google spreadsheet called the Shitty Media Men list. This was an anonymously sourced, living document meant to warn women about certain men in the media business, mostly publishing, who were known for inappropriate sexual or sexually charged behavior.It included all kinds of men, from powerful editors to freelance writers, and described alleged misdeeds that ranged from “weird lunch dates” to inappropriate flirting to stalking to physical violence and all-out rape. And though the list was never officially published and disappeared from Google Docs almost as quickly as it emerged, enough screenshots were taken that the perpetrators became common knowledge almost immediately.Within hours of the list’s discovery, the chief line of inquiry around it, even more so than “Who started it?”, was whether infractions like “weird lunches” should be lumped in with crimes like rape. Unsurprisingly, I found myself on the side of the oldsters who were deeply troubled not just by this “lumping” (again, there seemed to be only one operative word, and in this case it was “lump”) but by the idea that anonymously sourced accusations could be made against publicly named people without warning or any sort of due process.“This is so wrong!” my same-age friends and I ranted. “You can’t just do this! These millennials don’t get it!” We said this as we forwarded the screenshots among each other, gawking at the names we recognized.“Weird lunch!” I said to more than one person. “Welcome to publishing! I’m going to write a memoir about my early days in New York and call it Weird Lunch.”And as the “conversation” lurched along and the narrative of the “generational divide” became the default narrative, I found myself reminded of this passage of time on a daily, even hourly, basis. When a scandal broke involving the actor and comedian Aziz Ansari, I felt that my membership on Team Older Feminist was so official that I might as well take out a charge card at Eileen Fisher and call it a day (though has anyone under 40 ever used a “charge card”?)And so the ground began to shake around the fault line. The older feminists scolded the younger ones for not being tough enough to take care of themselves. If the construction worker whistles at you, give him the finger! If the drunk guy sitting next to you at the wedding reception gets fresh, kick him in the shins!In turn, the youngsters chastised the oldsters for enabling the oppressive status quo with cool-girl posturing. We shouldn’t have to suppress our humanity by letting insults roll off us! We shouldn’t have to risk our safety with physical violence because patriarchal norms have taught the drunk wedding guest he can act like that!Neither side was entirely wrong, of course. But both sides were talking past each other in ways that suggested there was no meeting in the middle. In the New York Times, Daphne Merkin identified a gulf between what women said publicly about #MeToo and the eye-rolling that went on in private. “Publicly, they say the right things, expressing approval and joining in the chorus of voices that applaud the takedown of maleficent characters who prey on vulnerable women in the workplace,” she wrote. “In private it’s a different story. ‘Grow up, this is real life,’ I hear these same feminist friends say.”In the Atlantic, Caitlin Flanagan, whose tendency toward a certain impish prudery has never made her popular among young feminists, wrote that the Ansari fracas, at least the version of it chronicled on Babe.net, constituted “3,000 words of revenge porn”. She decried the helplessness of “a whole country full of young women who don’t know how to call a cab”.On cable news, the HLN anchor Ashleigh Banfield looked straight into the camera and addressed “Grace” directly.“What you have done in my opinion is appalling,” said Banfield, calling the allegations “reckless and hollow” and charging Grace with having “chiseled away at a movement that I along with all of my sisters in the workplace have been dreaming of for decades”.This being cable news, Banfield’s producers invited Katie Way to appear on the show. And this being the digital era, Way declined the offer not with a “no thanks” but by popping off an email that called Banfield a “burgundy lipstick bad highlights second wave feminist has-been” and noted that “no woman my age would ever watch your network”.As I watched all of this whiz past me on my computer screen, sharpened by the reading glasses I’d lately been forced to wear, I wondered if my real problem with young feminists was how little they seemed to need us older ones. As far as I could see, they didn’t even want to know us.At 25, I not only wanted to know people like Daphne Merkin and Ashleigh Banfield, I wanted to be them. There were hundreds of women in my imaginative orbit – some of them over 50 or possibly even 60 – whom I felt this way about. I knew none of them, but I wanted to be all of them. Together, they formed a great phalanx of wise elders whose only duty to me was to be themselves. My duty, in turn, was to watch and learn. By which I mean that was my duty to myself.But something was different back then. I shared a planet with those elders. We occupied the same universe. We breathed the same air. The same cannot be said for the relationship between my generation and those that are coming up behind us.The world has changed so much between my time and theirs that someone just 10 years younger might as well belong to a different geological epoch. To a young person, someone like me is not so much an elder as an extinction. Is it any wonder, then, that older generations’ contributions to the conversation are, at best, a kind of verbal meteor shower, the flickering, nattering remains of planets that haven’t existed for eons?So this is where I find myself. Amid my exasperation and confusion, I have wandered into a devastating but oddly beautiful revelation: my generation will be the last to have known the world in its analog form. As a result, we’ve grown old before actually getting old. We’ve become dinosaurs before we’re even 50.And it’s here, from this primitive-creature vantage point, that I find myself pressed up against yet another revelation: the questions we face now when it comes to men and women are questions that arose a split second ago. Modern humans have been around for about 200,000 years. Civilization as we know it has been churning away for perhaps 6,000 years. Until the birth control pill came along in 1960, we were all essentially prisoners of nature, with women’s conditions being markedly worse, sometimes obscenely so.Until 1960, the idea that women could compete with men in the job market, that men should do housework, that women had any purpose in life higher than having babies and men had any purpose higher than financially supporting those babies or going to war to protect them, was something close to unthinkable.That we have come so far in so little time is a marvel. That we should expect all the kinks to have been worked out by now is insane.In the scheme of things, the 59 years that have elapsed between 1960 and today is a nanosecond, a flash of time so imperceptible that it has passed in increments of billions by the time you have read this sentence. It was already nearly 30 years ago that the feral woman was out there with her folding table yelling: “Sign the petition.” It was already nearly 30 years ago that, as far as I was concerned, I owned the world. It feels like yesterday. Then again, every day feels like yesterday. Every day becomes yesterday before you know it.Copyright 2019 by Meghan Daum.

Roast at 200C/gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft and their skins lightly browned in places.Finely chop 2 tbsp of tarragon leaves and the same of basil. Mash 150g of goat’s cheese with a fork and then stir in 100g of crème fraîche. Add the chopped herbs and a little pepper then chill until needed.When the tomatoes are ready, remove them from the oven and transfer to a serving plate. Toss 100g of samphire into the tomato roasting juices in the tin then add next to the tomatoes on the serving plate. Spoon the herbed cheese into a small bowl then serve with pieces of crusty white baguette to soak up the juices. Enough for 2.To get the full sweet, sharp and smoky flavour of the tomatoes, roast them until their skins start to blacken here and there. Serve them hot, straight from the oven to contrast with the chilled whipped cheese.The tomatoes can be replaced by aubergines. Cut them into large cubes, then add to the roasting tin with the thyme and olive oil and bake for a good half hour or so, turning them as they burnish and soften.

A South African shepherd's pie: Thomasina Miers' family recipe for bobotie,"An intriguing recipe handed down by Tommi’s mischievous nanna Mimi – a sort of South African, spicy version of shepherd’s pie called bobotie ",Thomasina Miers,2019-10-21T12:00:25+0100,"My maternal grandmother was known for being a tiddlywinks demon, having the naughtiest twinkle in her eye and, whenever she went home to South Africa, for disappearing into the bush to hang out with Zulu tribespeople – the people with whom she seemed to feel most at home. Her stories of her time there were always captivating, and of the recipes she made that were both homely and exotic, this was one of the best.Don’t be put off by the long list of ingredients – this is essentially a South African shepherd’s pie, only easier, with some lovely spicing thrown in.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 6-8Butter, for greasing4 tbsp olive oil3 onions, peeled and choppedSalt and black pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped2 bay leaves1½ tsp mustard seeds2 tsp curry powder½ tsp chilli flakes1 tsp turmeric1 ½ tsp garam masala1kg beef or lamb mince100ml red-wine or cider vinegar100g flaked almonds120g raisins50g fresh breadcrumbs75g fruit chutney (I like Tracklements’ Country Garden Chutney)For the topping3 eggs500ml whole milk3 bay leavesGrease a large baking dish and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. Warm a large, wide casserole pot over a medium heat and, when hot, add three tablespoons of oil.Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and sweat for 10 minutes, until soft. Stir in the garlic, bay leaves and spices and cook for another three to four minutes, until fragrant. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. When hot, season the meat with salt and pepper, and brown in the pan in two or three batches, breaking up the meat with a spoon and cooking until caramelised and dark. Once all the meat is browned, return the onion mixture to the pan and add the vinegar, almonds and raisins.Turn the heat down to low and simmer for five minutes, to allow the flavours to mingle. Take off the heat, stir in the breadcrumbs and chutney and check the seasoning. Transfer to the baking dish, smooth over with the back of a spoon and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes.To make the topping, beat together the eggs and milk and pour over the meat. Scatter over the bay leaves, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden and the custard just set. This is delicious served with brown rice and some greens.Leftover flaked almonds make the best biscuits. I love florentines, or you could mix them with honey and a little butter for a crunchy topping for shortbread. Leftover bobotie makes a killer filling for a jacket potato, so don’t eat it all at once."
Bitter-sweet memories: Rachel Roddy's recipe for marmalade cake,Hand-me-down recipes come inseparably steeped in memories – such as this recipe for marmalade cake from an old friend that became etched into the family biography,Rachel Roddy,2019-10-21T12:00:28+0100,"The other day I opened a book to find a sentence, and a bit of paper fell out. As the square piece of block pad glided to the floor like a dead moth, I recognised it as a recipe for a ring cake written out for me not long after coming to Italy, about 14 years ago. I remember making the recipe several times, before using it as a bookmark that was left at page 76. What I don’t remember or recognise is whose neat writing it is.My memory lapse is frustrating. Sharing a recipe is an open-handed act, one made even more tangible if the person sharing has taken the time physically to write it out, maybe with notes, which is a small labour in these copy-and-photograph times.Even if the recipe given is never made, I want to remember where the Post-It lemon pudding or back-of-envelope braised chicken came from. And if the recipe becomes part of my cooking life, it is no different from a recipe from a book or famous chef: it absolutely must have that person attached to it, like a name tag sewn into a collar. Then, every time the recipe is made, the person and your relationship to them, whatever it was, is remembered. Even if it means you have to relive a tired exchange about authenticity, or be reminded that Mario subsequently left his wife for his secretary, recipes have names: Mario’s red-wine risotto; my elegant neighbour Vera’s creme caramel; Lise from Bavaria’s liver and apple.Shared name-tagged recipes are also a way of marking time. Years ago, I organised my mum’s loose recipes, gluing the loose-leaf pages and lips of envelopes into a book and noting where and who they came from. The book is now a sort of collective biography of our family – a strained one.Freda Coleman was a neighbour in the late 1970s, and her marmalade cake marks the margarine years. It was, and is, an ideal cake for a family with congenital marmalade dependency: a rich pound batter into which you stir orange marmalade, which bakes into a bitter-sweet cake. The icing is as good as the cake, which you zig- zag over the top where it then sets into a hard lattice that can be pulled off, although hopefully not from the entire cake as once happened.Part of the pleasure of a cake is the smell as it bakes: marmalade bakes into an almost toffee-like sweetness, and hopefully a bit of peel at the bottom of the cake catches and the smell of that, like dark treacle, assaults your senses.Recipes are only recipes, but they can become fixed points in our lives around which other things move: with them, we can measure time, places, people. Freda’s cake – now our family cake – is one such recipe. If I could only remember the name of the person who gave me the recipe that fell out of the book, that would have a name tag too. Until then, it is just a ring cake. Both cakes are good, but the marmalade triumphs for its amber chunks of peel and icing which, because cake is 50% pleasure, 50% habit, I still want to pull off before eating a slice.This is a cake of four equal parts, plus marmalade (thick-cut or thin, you decide). It is a preference based on habit, but a loaf tin (lined with parchment) seems the best tin for this cake.Prep 10 minCook 40 minMakes 1 loaf110g margarine or butter, at room temp110g sugar2 medium eggs110g self-raising flour4 heaped tbsp marmalade50g icing sugarHot waterBeat together the butter and sugar until soft and creamy. Beat in the eggs, followed by the flour, before stirring in three tablespoons of marmalade.Scape the mixture into a loaf tin lined with parchment. Bake at 170C (150C)/335F/gas 3 for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is puffed up and cracked, and a strand of spaghetti comes out clean.Leave to cool for 30 minutes, then lift the cake from the tin.To make the glaze, loosen the remaining tablespoon of marmalade with a little hot water, then brush the cake.Make a thick icing by mixing the icing sugar with just a little water, and zig-zag it over the cake, letting it dribble down the sides."

We should feel sorry for Jared Leto. His Joker never had a chance,The actor’s Suicide Squad character had been sidelined long before Todd Phillips’s film starring Joaquin Phoenix as Batman’s arch enemy was greenlit,Ben Child,2019-10-22T13:21:45+0100,"Would it really be surprising that Jared Leto had tried to stop Todd Phillips’s Joker from being made? This is what a piece in the Hollywood Reporter suggests, though the claim is said to have been denied by a representative for Leto and by Warner Bros.It might seem ridiculous to fans that a film that has taken more than $700m (£541m) at the global box office and (at least initially) wowed critics could have been swatted from the schedules at the whim of an actor who barely appeared as the clown prince of Gotham in 2016’s Suicide Squad. And yet that would be to forget the circumstances in which Leto found himself cast as Batman’s nemesis five years ago, and was subsequently thrown to the slavering hounds by Warner Bros.In 2014, when the studio announced that Leto was to star as the Joker, the actor-turned-musician had just won his first Oscar, for playing a transgender drug addict in Jean-Marc Vallée’s Dallas Buyers Club. Before this, he had hardly acted for five years, preferring to focus on his suddenly successful rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars. By all accounts, Leto was choosing roles very carefully during this period, so it came as a shock (and coup for Warner Bros) when he was announced as the world’s most infamous supervillain.By all accounts, Leto threw himself into the role with method mania, reportedly sending a letter and video to fellow stars apologising for not joining them for early rehearsals, accompanying his missive with a live rat for Margot Robbie (his on-screen paramour, Harley Quinn), some bullets for Will Smith (Deadshot) and a dead pig for the entire cast. Warner suits, aware of the potency such a blend of recent Oscar-winner and iconic role would bring to the table, must have been head over heels at the publicity.With all this fuss, fans expected Leto’s Joker to emerge as the leader of the Suicide Squad, a gang of colourful Dirty Dozen-style supervillain miscreants put together by questionable authorities (Viola Davies’s Amanda Waller) to take down an even worse threat: Cara Delevingne’s acting. We will never know quite what the original plan was, but when David Ayer’s film finally emerged, Leto was reduced to a bit-part player. A bit of torture here and there, some hanging around with Harley in nightclubs, and then completely absent from the movie’s main narrative.The Oscar winner could perhaps have been forgiven for thinking that this would never have happened in the 70s. Imagine if Robert De Niro had gained 60 pounds for Raging Bull, only to be told that his scenes had been excised. Then imagine the shock when Warner green-lit a Joker origins movie starring Joaquin Phoenix as a completely different version of the supervillain. This was precisely the kind of movie Leto probably thought he was going to be making at some point when he signed on to play the part. The dream opportunity to get under the character’s powder-caked skin.Leto had every chance to assume he'd be playing the Joker in further movies – otherwise why cast him in the first place?This kind of thing would never have happened at Marvel, either. The last time a star was cast in a big role at the Disney-owned studio, then kicked to the kerb, was 2010, when it was announced that Ed Norton, the somewhat sickly green giant in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk, would not reprise the role in The Avengers (unless one counts Terrence Howard’s replacement by Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes in 2010’s Iron Man 2, reportedly over pay). Leto had every chance to assume he would be playing the Joker in further movies over the next decade – otherwise why cast him in the first place?Thanks to Warner’s chaotic approach to comic-book world building, that never happened. The Hollywood Reporter now suggests Leto-Joker is done as a going concern, something that ought to have been pretty obvious as soon as James Gunn’s Suicide Squad 2 and Cathy Yan’s Birds of Prey were announced without the actor’s involvement. In any case, neither movie had an obvious place for the cackling villain, so it would not be a surprise to learn that Leto turned them down – perhaps fearing a repeat of earlier experiences.Phillips’s Joker is the movie Leto really needed to showcase his talents and begin developing a multi-movie character arc, but Phoenix was handed the role instead. The whole thing smacks of terrible planning. Like the unfortunate Arthur Fleck himself in Phillips’s film, it seems Leto never really had a chance."
Jenny Slate: 'I find myself dressing like characters from The Wind in the Willows',The actor and standup on changing her outfit twice a day and why she loves brushing her hair out like Diane von Furstenberg,Leah Harper,2019-10-22T11:32:11+0100,"This picture was taken in downtown Soho, New York, and I’m wearing a large, striped, mohair sweater and booties, both from Acne, with Jesse Kamm jeans and a vintage silk blouse. I love this outfit because it has elements of style that make me feel mature and the pieces are by really imaginative designers. I don’t have a problem with spending money on more expensive items as long as I am buying them to feel good and provided they will last me quite a while.I’m a petite person and I love wearing oversized items in an effort to be both comfortable and chic. Sometimes I change my outfit a couple of times a day depending on how I feel or how I want to feel. There was quite a while when I dressed monochromatically; my personality is very colourful and I felt there were many different tones happening at once. I tend to be a pretty frenetic thinker – I scale emotional heights and dip to emotional lows many times a day just as part of being a live human person – so it felt very good to dress in one colour. It meant that at least one thing about me was very simple and straightforward and complete. I stopped dressing monochromatically almost a year ago when I realised that I wanted to be what I am, and not always try to control it. Occasionally, however, I still feel the need to dress in just one colour, and now I know that move is available to me.I am a fan of miniskirts, silk patterned dresses and things that might be seen as more traditionally femme. But I really like wearing outfits where I feel I am separated from qualifications that are put on gender. I love vintage Katharine Hepburn, as well as Hepburn later in her life and what she wears in the movie On Golden Pond. I’m from Massachusetts, and love a tweed and a nubby wool. Right now I find myself trying to dress like characters in The Wind in the Willows – I really like those natural tones. There have been times when my fashion inspiration was Carmen Miranda or Fiona Apple, but at the moment I am drawn towards more earthy colours. I’m also really into brushing my hair out like Diane von Furstenberg – that is so luscious."
Uniqlo accused of mocking wartime sexual slavery victims,Japanese clothing company pulls advertisement from South Korean TV after outcry,Justin McCurry,2019-10-21T09:09:04+0100,"The Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo has pulled an ad from South Korean TV after it was accused of mocking victims of wartime sexual slavery.The company said it had stopped airing the 15-second ad after critics pointed out that the Korean-language subtitles appeared to question the testimony of women who said they were forced to work in Japanese military brothels across Asia before and during the second world war.The decision comes after months of diplomatic wrangling between Tokyo and Seoul over the countries’ bitter wartime legacy. The dispute began after a South Korean supreme court ruling last year ordering Japanese companies to compensate Koreans forced to work in Japanese mines and factories when the Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony. But Japan insists that all compensation claims were settled by a postwar peace treaty.The decision triggered a trade spat that has since spread to the tourism sector, and even preparations for next summer’s Tokyo Olympics.In the ad, the 97-year-old model Iris Apfel is asked by the 13-year-old designer Kheris Rogers how she dressed when she was her age. Apfel replies: “I can’t remember that far back.” But the version with Korean subtitles gave Apfel’s reply as: “Oh my God, how can I remember what happened more than 80 years ago?”The Korea Herald said some viewers interpreted the time reference as an attempt to ridicule former sex slaves and forced labourers, whose recollections of abuses have been questioned by rightwing politicians and academics in Japan.In response, Uniqlo pulled the ad in South Korea and from its YouTube account days after it first appeared, but said it had not intended to cause offence.“The advertisement in question is a part of a global advertisement series to mark the 25th anniversary of fleece and it has no links to any political or religious agendas, belief or organisations, but we decided to stop airing the ad as we take it seriously that many people felt uncomfortable,” Uniqlo said.It said the Korean-language subtitles had been worded that way to highlight the age gap between Apfel and Rogers.Some historians say the Japanese imperial army coerced or tricked as many as 200,000 women and girls – most of them from Korea – to serve in frontline brothels.Uniqlo, which has 186 stores in South Korea, was already among several high-profile targets of a South Korean boycott of Japanese goods."

The camera taught me to observe. And the bike taught me teamwork and competitiveness – I started racing when I was 12. My sister was eight years older than me; my brother 11 years older. I was sort of an only child.We had a lovely family, but we weren’t very worldly. We travelled in England: Dorset in the summer, weekends in Derbyshire. I came home once and said, “Dad, I really like Jacques Anquetil,” the famous French cyclist, and my father said, “What are those words?”I’ve never been a reader. We never really had books in the house. And I’m dyslexic, so I’m not good at concentrating. It would have been nicer to have had a better education. I left school at 15, and I was really not very good at school. I can’t even remember going to school.Do I feel old? I went to buy a croissant recently and they wouldn’t take money from me.

On the trail of garage sale bargains: 'I see this as a political act. It’s taking our power back',Feelings of ‘stuffocation’ and a yearning for connection are feeding the share economy … along with the hunt for a perfect Halloween costume,Clare Press,2019-10-22T04:00:49+0100,"Lindy Baker describes herself as “on a mission to minimise but determined not to throw things away”. She is enjoying the sunshine outside her Darlinghurst terrace on day two of her sale. Her front fence doubles duty as a clothes rack and a table on the pavement displays bric-a-brac, kitchenalia and costume jewellery.Her motivations are political as well as practical. Baker is an Italian translator and artist who used to be a coordinator for the Sydney Democracy Network. “We need to find new ways of accessing and entering the share economy, because our current consumerist culture is weighing too heavily on the environment,” she says.“I’m interested in how society can cut down on waste across the board, avoiding plastic packaging, recycling more. City of Sydney now picks up e-waste, so I’ve booked that in, and I’ve finally found a home for a massive pile of sewing fabric I’ve been hoarding.“It’s a work in progress, a mindset. Even though a lot of my stuff was secondhand in the first place, I still have too much. A garage sale is one of a few different solutions.”At the weekend more than 18,000 Australian households registered garage sales as part of the Garage Sale Trail. Some were driven by more than just the urge to purge and earn a bit of cash – they speak of environmental motivations, promoting the share economy and rebelling against the constant pressure to consume.“We have to find ways to cycle clothes, furniture, objects, anything useful, through multiple owners,” Baker says.She clearly has an eye for design, but she’s not much of an entrepreneur if these prices are anything to go by. A terracotta plate costs a buck. “It’s not about the money,” she says, pausing to sell a vintage silk scarf with hand-rolled edges and a striped straw hat for $14. “The unwritten rule we have on this street [is] that if there’s something decent in your house that you don’t want any more, you put it out the front for anyone to take.”A yard sale is more social. “I do think there’s a community-building aspect,” Baker says. “I just met a woman who lives two doors down. She’s been here 15 years and I’ve been here five but we hadn’t spoken. She wanted to buy a cup – I gave it to her.”The day before Baker sold a hammer to another woman from the neighbourhood she hadn’t met previously. “She came back again today and bought a rug. We were chatting so long I invited her round for drinks. The unexpected joy of this has been the fun conversations. But isn’t that what people everywhere have always loved about shopping?”It’s an experience you wouldn’t have in a mall, she notes. “I do see this as a political act. It’s taking our power back.”A young woman in denim cutoffs and an embroidered white linen blouse stops to look at a set of five 1970s kitchen canisters illustrated with vegetables – $5 for the lot. She’s Lizzy Logan, a Legal Aid lawyer. What is it about the canisters? “I have stuff like this,” she says. “They would match well with my decor. My personal style and home reflect each other.”“A friend salvaged them from a council clean-up,” Baker says. “You’d be amazed what people chuck out. Actually, they match your top.”Logan bought the blouse for $15 at another garage sale on Saturday – “from these two older women, a travel writer and a food writer. They were selling books and clothes they’d picked up on their travels.” Logan has been thrifting since she was a teenager in Brisbane.“I like the individuality of the pieces. I have quite a conservative, traditional career and thrifting is a creative outlet for me. But there’s also this other side of it – I feel strongly that we should use what’s already in existence.”The best thing she ever found? “Classic Ferragamo court shoes from an op shop in Brisbane for about $20. Honestly, you can thrift anything.”Nearby, 15 sellers have set up in Darlinghurst public school. One man smiles valiantly above a stash of DVDs – it looks as though Netflix has destroyed his market – but it’s mostly kids’ toys and approachable fashion here. Mostly.Alex Riggs is selling some high-ticket items. She could probably get a better return on one of a growing number of high-end luxury resale sites, or the consignment store up the road. She agrees, but this was something they wanted to do as a family.The DVD guy is her brother; her 13-year-old nephew has a stall too. “We all went to the climate strike together,” Riggs says. “It’s the younger generation who are leading this movement, they’re asking questions about environmental impact and ethics. It doesn’t just wash over these kids – they really take it on board.”Her mother, Freida Riggs, is also here, selling clothes and accessories. “Fashion is about self-expression, not about status,” the retired academic says. “Who cares if you bought something new or not? What I care about is the shapes, colours, the stories behind clothes, and I don’t want to dress like a granny.”She sells a necklace for $15 to Cassy Cochrane, a drama teacher.“It’s nice to see it go to someone who appreciates it, and to meet that person,” Freida says. “I do send clothes to charity, but you never know who gets them, do you?”Cochrane is a vintage clothes collector. “I love clothes swaps,” she says. “I started doing them I was a student in New Zealand. We’d throw the tarp down on our back lawn in Wellington, everyone would bring their loot, it became a party. I still have them now that I’m 50. It’s awesome, what happens when you take money out of the equation.”Thirteen-year-old Olivia Solomon says she and her friends swap their clothes and haunt op shops. ““This T-shirt I’ve got on cost $2 and it’s not mine anyway,” she says. “I can’t afford to buy fast fashion, but I wouldn’t really want to anyway.”Olivia is looking for something to wear to a Halloween party and decides on a thrifted black velvet shift dress for $5. “Halloween is so gross with everyone buying plastic outfits from costume shops, and they’re not even that cheap. Some of them are $35.“Why this dress? It fits me. I love the velvet, and I can wear it again. I’ll do my makeup white. I’m going as a goth.”The frock’s previous owner is Jess Taylor, a marine biologist: “I bought it for a few dollars in an op shop, thinking maybe I could fit it, but it’s actually a child’s size. I got it home and realised that’s never going to happen.”Did she ever consider throwing it away? “What? No way. That’s wasteful. I’m all about conservation and looking after our natural world. I couldn’t throw something out if it had possible value for someone else. With clothes, it’s also about workmanship – someone had to sew that dress.“Everything I’m wearing is secondhand, actually, except for my shoes. Consumer choices matter. Our choices feed the market, what we want becomes what’s available, so if we change what we want then the market will change. Although ultimately I think government regulation is the thing that will really save us.”"
Palazzo of dreams,Living above Leonardo’s Milanese vineyard is a constant source of inspiration for fashion designer Massimo Alba,Scarlett Conlon,2019-10-19T16:00:28+0100,"Not many people can say that they share an address with Leonardo da Vinci, but Massimo Alba can. The fashion designer’s Milan apartment is part of the Casa degli Atellani, an elegant palazzo and one of the city’s most celebrated museums. It is also home to the vineyard gifted to da Vinci by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Maria Sforza, in 1498.“Every time I come home, I feel privileged to be living in this terrific place, surrounded by good energy,” says Alba as he leads the way through the museum to the garden where the Renaissance artist tended to his vines.Alba’s home, which he shares with his wife Marilena and their 14-year-old son, Nicolò, is situated on the first floor, but our tour starts in the sun-dappled gardens. Alba is keen to highlight the harmonious juxtaposition between past and present that inspires not only his work but his apartment, too. The 59-year old designer and his family moved here shortly after their home on the island of Ischia was destroyed by the 2017 earthquake. They had already sold their other two properties in and around Milan to raise capital to set up his eponymous label, so when the Casa degli Atellani’s current owners, the Portaluppi family, suggested Alba rented one of the storied dwellings, the family saw it as an opportunity to start their next chapter.“You don’t really own things [in life], only emotions,” reflects Alba, explaining that no longer being a proprietor – much like running his independent brand – makes him feel, “in a funny way, free”.The apartment is peppered with mementos from the past. When you step into the apartment you’re met with a treasure “from a lifetime ago”: an exquisite Tibetan chest that sits beneath a high ceiling. Beyond is an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living area with a retro floor-to-ceiling shelving system that acts as a room divider.Taking centre stage, the shelving unit is covered in dog-eared paperbacks piled high, unframed canvases, souvenirs, family photographs, hand-written notes, candlesticks, paperweights and small vintage lamps picked up at markets and auctions. It acts as a captivating storyboard of lives spent and shared.So, too, the artwork that covers the walls. Black and white photography and abstract oil paintings by Lillian Bassman, Kenro Izu, Evelyn Hofer and François Berthoud sit on floating shelves along one wall that stretches the length of the apartment. Meanwhile, giant scenes by French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier and the Sicilian photographer Ferdinando Scianna stand side by side on the floor next to a small sculpted chair by Tom Dixon.On the opposite wall, giant windows frame the view of the Santa Maria delle Grazie church across the road where da Vinci, commissioned by Sforza, painted The Last Supper in 1498, where it still hangs to this day.“In a certain way, our home is a melting pot, everything is slightly different, from a different place in time,” says Alba. As with the collections that he and Marilena design to be seasonless, comfortable and worn with everything else in your wardrobe, his home is a holistic extension of that. “We never look at each item; we look at the way items work with other items. We don’t want to change every season – we want to follow our inner voice and instinct.”Many of the pieces have sentimental value. Midcentury chairs by Danish and Italian designers including Hans Wegner and Gio Ponti are decorated with cushions Alba had embroidered by his friend, the artist Roberto Reale. They read: “Happiness is not in another place but in this place, not in another hour, but in this hour,” and “Hello there.” A lampshade also features needlework by Reale that reads: “M’illumino d’immenso.” It translates as: “I flood myself with the light of the immense,” and is a quote from the late Italian modernist poet Giuseppe Ungaretti, whose poetry Alba’s son was recently studying at school.Tibetan rugs, which overlap each other across the floor, have been hand-painted by Alba – himself a keen artist whose line of painted handkerchiefs has become a signature of his brand. Beds are draped in blankets he designed with the Scottish cashmere company Begg & Co. The kitchen, where I’m told generous servings of pasta and wine are served up for regular dinner-party guests, is decorated with classic Sicilian head vases, vintage mismatched glassware and family relics passed down from parents.“Personally, I like it when things from different times become friends and live together – something from the 50s, something from the 30s,” explains Alba. “I really feel it’s home. I feel close to everything I like.”Warm and inviting, it’s a home that is lived in, not looked at; the kind of space that speaks style and whispers “well-travelled” with a curiosity in every corner and a cup of coffee on the table.It’s kept feeling cosy by the walls and ceilings which are the same shade of matt grey throughout. They were done this way, says Alba, so that the rooms not only “become circular” and create intimacy but also complement the view of Santa Maria delle Grazie. It brings the outside in – as do the pots of Monstera deliciosa, along with unidentified succulents and vases of wild eucalyptus.One of the most memorable pieces from Alba’s home is a glass sculpture of a salmon by the glass artist Hugh Findletar, which Alba says he was drawn to “because salmon swim against the tide”. In creating this very personal space inside this world-famous landmark, Alba and his family have created a Renaissance of their own."
New gene editing tool could fix most harmful DNA mutations,"‘Prime editing’ more precise than Crispr-Cas9, but still needs time before use on humans",Ian Sample,2019-10-21T16:27:23+0100,"Scientists have raised fresh hopes for treating people with genetic disorders by inventing a powerful new molecular tool that, in principle, can correct the vast majority of mutations that cause human genetic diseases.The procedure, named “prime editing”, can mend about 89% of the 75,000 or so harmful mutations known to mangle the human genome and lead to conditions such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anaemia, and a nerve-destroying illness called Tay-Sachs disease.The landmark work opens the door to a new era of genome editing, but scientists caution that more research is needed before it can be safely used in humans. Beyond proving its safety, another major hurdle is how to deliver the molecular machinery to cells that need it in sufficient amounts to treat a disorder.“This first report of prime editing is the beginning rather than the end of a longstanding aspiration in the life sciences to be able to make any DNA change in any position of a living cell or organism, including potentially human patients with genetic diseases,” said David Liu at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts.The ability to rewrite the genetic code is one of the most striking scientific advances of recent years. The most common approach, known as Crispr-Cas9, has been likened to “molecular scissors” which home in on a particular DNA sequence and then cut it in two. The procedure allows scientists to disable specific genes and even correct harmful mutations by providing cells with fresh strands of DNA with which to repair the cut.Crispr-Cas9 is not perfect, however. Often, it leads to cells with a haphazard mix of edits, including extra chunks of DNA called insertions, or missing chunks of genetic code called deletions. These are less of a problem when scientists are working on cells in a dish, because those that are affected can be thrown away. But when genome editing is used to rewrite faulty genes in people’s lungs, hearts and other tissues, far more precision is needed.Andrew Anzalone, also at the Broad Institute, created prime editing with Liu by giving Crispr-Cas9 an overhaul. The new system homes in on its target as before, but instead of chopping the DNA in half, it nicks it, and then writes a new section of DNA into the specified position.Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists describe how they made 175 different DNA edits to human cells with impressive precision. In one demonstration, they corrected mutations that cause the inherited blood disorder, sickle cell anaemia. In another, they removed the four extra DNA letters in a particular gene that cause Tay-Sachs disease, a rare condition that destroys children’s nerves and usually proves fatal by five years old.Before prime editing, it was impossible to make such a range of DNA changes in so many different cell types without leaving behind insertions, deletions and other genetic detritus that can interfere with the workings of the edited cell.“You can think of prime editors as being like word processors capable of searching for target DNA sequences and precisely replacing them with edited DNA sequences,” Liu said. “Potential impacts include being able to directly correct a much larger fraction of the mutations that cause genetic diseases, and being able to introduce DNA changes into crops that result in healthier or more sustainable foods.”Robin Lovell-Badge, a geneticist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said prime editing looked “very exciting” and would be useful for exploring what genes do, making animal models of human genetic disorders, and improving animal and plant agriculture. Because the procedure can make changes that occur naturally in plants, at least some prime-edited crops should not be regulated as “genetically modified”, he added.But much more work needs to be done before prime editing can be used in humans, Lovell-Badge stressed. “As the authors themselves point out, these are new methods and effort will be needed to develop them to show that they are sufficiently safe and efficient. So far the authors have conducted experiments on just a few human cell types, which is far from being enough.”While the efficiency of the edits – about 50% in some cases – would be good enough for scientists conducting basic research, he questioned whether it would be useful for scientists working on live animals. “Nevertheless, I am excited about the methods which certainly hold promise and I expect we will see many applications that use these or next generation methods based on them.”"
"Can you solve it? The four points, two distances problem",A dot-to-dot puzzle with a difference,Alex Bellos,2019-10-21T07:10:18+0100,"Today’s question is probably the shortest I have ever set:Find all the ways to arrange four points so that only two distances occur between any two points.In other words, how many ways are there to draw four dots on a piece of paper such that whichever two dots you choose, the distance between these two points is one of two values?I’ll give you one solution for free, the most obvious one, in which the points are arranged in a square:The four blue lines are one length, and the two green ones are another length. (With four dots, there are six ways to chose a pair of dots, so there are six ‘distances’ between dots.)I learned of this puzzle from maths juggler Colin Wright, who learned it from puzzle maven Peter Winkler. What’s beguiling about the problem is not just the satisfying brevity of the statement, but the deceptiveness of the answer.“Nearly everyone misses at least one [solution], and for each possible solution, it’s been missed by at least one person,” said Winkler.I think it’s a lovely problem because it embraces many levels of difficulty. If you struggle with geometry, you’ll be overjoyed to find one or two other solutions. (There are more.) The business end of the problem, however, is proving that you have found every solution.I’ll be back with the solutions at 5pm UK time today. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS. Although do discuss how you might attack the problem. Is there a ‘simple’ strategy that gets them all or is it just down to intuition and trial-and-error?UPDATE: Solution now available here.Clarifications: The four points must be distinct. That is, no point is allowed to be superimposed on another point. For each solution, we exclude all reflections, rotations and different sizes of that solution. Also, if the two distances that occur between any two of the four points in one solution are a and b, then the two distances that appear in another solution are not necessarily a and b.I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.My new book So You Think You’ve Got Problems? is out on November 7. It’s a puzzle book, but also a book of true stories and mathematical ideas. The 200 puzzles I selected all, in different ways, contain an element of surprise.

Dr Sarah E Hill: ‘We have a blind spot about how the pill influences women’s brains’,The social psychologist’s new book tackles the tricky subject of how oral contraceptives may affect women’s minds,Zoë Corbyn,2019-10-19T14:00:28+0100,"At a time when women’s reproductive freedoms are under attack, any suggestion that the birth control pill could be problematic feels explosive. But Sarah E Hill, a professor of social psychology at the Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas argues we need to talk about how oral contraceptives are affecting women’s thinking, emotions and behaviour. How the Pill Changes Everything: Your Brain on Birth Control is her new book about the science behind a delicate subject.Some US states have recently made it harder to get an abortion and the Trump administration is doing its best to chisel away at access to birth control. Is your book trying to dissuade women from using the pill?My institution was founded as a Christian school, but it doesn’t have a particular religious bent now. My goal with this book is not to take the pill away or alarm women. It is to give them information they haven’t had up until now so they can make informed decisions. The pill, along with safe, legalised abortions, are the two biggest keys to women’s rights. But we also have a blind spot when it comes to thinking about how changing women’s sex hormones – which is what the pill does – influences their brains. For a long time, women have been experiencing “psychological” side-effects on the pill but nobody was telling them why.The backlash we are seeing against the pill, particularly with millennial women walking away from it, I think is because women haven’t felt right on it and have grown weary of doctors patting them on their heads and telling them they are wrong. The more information women have, the more it will bring them back to the pill.How exactly does the pill affect women’s brains?The pill works mainly by mimicking the second half of a woman’s monthly ovulatory cycle, in which the hormone progesterone is dominant. Its primary ingredient is artificial progesterone – so-called progestin – which shuts down the brain signal that prompts egg development. But that also means the ovaries aren’t producing oestrogen, the hormone which dominates the first half of a woman’s natural cycle. And oestrogen does some of our favourite things to our brains and bodies, making us feel sexier and more energetic. While most pills include some synthetic oestrogen – primarily to offset progestin’s unpleasant side-effects – women can feel the lack.A less well-understood mechanism is that progestins, which are often created by changing the molecular structure of testosterone, aren’t an exact match for our progesterone receptors. This means they can potentially stimulate other receptors, including those for testosterone, leading to masculinising effects, and for cortisol, which over time can dysregulate stress response. The stress hormone profile of pill-taking women, research suggests, is similar to people who have experienced chronic stress. Other research has found effects on the immune system, learning and memory.We know a lot about the small but serious health risks associated with the pill – things like stroke and blood clots. Why have we been kept in the dark about the effects on the brain?Until very recently, there has been little research. And the research that is out there doctors often aren’t aware of because it isn’t being published in the medical journals they look at, but rather in psychology and neuroscience journals. Then society has taboos about talking about it. The best defence against the sexist notion that women’s hormones make them less rational than men seemed to be to deny hormonal involvement in the brain. And the pill is so useful, no one is motivated to examine it too critically. But our hormones, especially our sex hormones, are a key part of what creates the experience of feeling like ourselves. And talking critically about the pill doesn’t mean that the benefits aren’t going to outweigh the cost. It’s not antithetical to women’s rights to talk about this stuff.Some women are going to experience big changes while others are going to have noneHow does the pill potentially affect women’s choice of mate?Oestrogen is known to nudge women’s preferences when it comes to their romantic partners to favour qualities that are associated with masculinity and higher testosterone: square-cut jaws, broad shoulders and brow ridges, for example. But research suggests pill-taking women – in their state of artificial progesterone dominance and lacking a cyclical oestrogen urge – seem to prefer the faces of men who are less masculine. The implication is that if a woman chooses her partner when she’s on the pill and then goes off it – it might lead to relationship dissatisfaction because she no longer finds herself as attracted to the person. It is a possibility that women should at least keep in mind. What about the mood changes women report on the pill?Being on the pill is associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed with anxiety and depression, though there are some women who report the pill stabilises their moods. The association was particulary high in young women aged 15-19 and their suicide risk is also more than twice that of non-pill takers. A dysregulated stress response is likely part of the picture, but another driver seems to be low levels of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone – a breakdown product of progesterone that acts as a natural sedative. In pill-taking women, the research suggests, levels are significantly lower than in naturally cycling women. Women starting the pill should keep a mood journal or tell a friend to keep an eye on them, especially if they have a personal or family history of mood-related symptoms. For young women, the pill may not be worth the trade-off if it is being used for reasons other than to prevent pregnancy – for example to clear acne or regulate periods.How big are the effects you are talking about?They are relatively small. But at an individual level, some women are going to experience big changes while others are going to have absolutely none. Each woman should know about the research that’s out there so they can monitor themselves and troubleshoot.There are over 100 different formulations of pill along with multiple other hormonal birth control options. Should we treat them the same?The signalling is going to be different. Progestins divide into four different generations each with a somewhat different molecular structure. Each pill can also have a different ratio of progestin to artificial oestrogen. Right now, the research that exists rarely divides women based on the type of progestin they are on, let alone the ratios. We need to push science to start looking at this.Should women seek alternatives to the pill?I am not making recommendations to any individual woman. Each knows what her own life goals are and how her body feels. But I do advise women to be strategic in their use of the pill. Understand the psychological trade-offs and then decide whether or not you want to use it. For a lot of women, the answer is still going to be yes, but now they choose knowing that information. With all the different formulations out there, I am confident women who want to use the pill are going to be able to find one that works for them. For women who are looking for something which doesn’t have hormones in it, the copper IUD is one of the most failsafe.Are you concerned that raising these issues might turn women to less effective methods of birth control that could leave them with unwanted pregnancies?It is the last thing I want to have happen. I’m hoping we can use this moment to educate ourselves, but still recognise how important it is to protect ourselves from unwanted pregnancy. Not being pregnant when you don’t want to be pregnant – for me the benefits of that far outweigh almost any brain changes the pill can cause.You say the issue of birth control is not yet solved. So what would solve it? Better pills, a male pill, or something new entirely?Ideally we want contraception that’s really safe and effective that doesn’t monkey with anyone’s brain. Maybe that means more investment in the copper IUD. Or maybe it is something yet to be invented. But we need the imagination of the best researchers on this issue. The pill works so well and is so easy, we’ve become complacent. And in the meantime, we need more and better research to understand what we’ve got.• How the Pill Changes Everything: Your Brain on Birth Control is published by Orion (£19.99).

"Scores more heart attacks and strokes on high pollution days, figures show",Data reveals acute impact on people’s health and the strain it puts on emergency services,Fiona Harvey,2019-10-21T00:01:09+0100,"Scores of children and adults are being rushed to hospital for emergency treatment on days of high pollution in cities across England, figures show.Each year emergency services see more than 120 additional cardiac arrests, more than 230 additional strokes and nearly 200 more people with asthma requiring hospital treatment on days of high pollution compared with the average on days of lower pollution.The data, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain that poor air quality is putting on already stretched NHS emergency resources.Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said: “These new figures show air pollution is now causing thousands of strokes, cardiac arrests and asthma attacks, so it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency. Since these avoidable deaths are happening now, not in 2025 or 2050, together we need to act now.”Previous studies have found spikes in hospital admissions and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air.The researchers defined high pollution days by dividing the year in two based on levels of pollution and comparing the number of cases of the relevant illness in the higher pollution half of the year with the number of similar cases on each day in the lower half.The data, collated by King’s College London (KCL), covers London, where there are 338 more emergencies a year on higher pollution days compared with low pollution days, Birmingham (65 a year), Bristol (22), Derby (16), Liverpool (28), Manchester (34), Nottingham (19), Oxford (10) and Southampton (16).Much of the recent research on air pollution has focused on the lifelong effects of chronic exposure, including cognitive decline, stunted growth in children and premature death. However, it can also bring on serious illness more immediately.Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Many people may not realise how dangerous air pollution at high levels can be, and that it can trigger heart attacks, strokes and asthma attacks as well as having long-term health effects. These figures will be a wake-up call for city leaders to take the strongest possible action.”The government has pledged to tackle air pollution in its environment bill, proposals for which were laid out after the Queen’s speech. Campaigners are concerned that the measures proposed are too vague and too weak.Polly Billington, the director of UK100, a network of local government leaders across England that have pledged to shift wholly to clean energy by 2050, said: “We would like to see World Health Organization air pollution standards included in the bill, as they are widely seen as gold standard, with a legally binding timetable to meet them, as that creates certainty and enables long-term planning. The absence of significantly increased powers for local leaders, together with a lack of reference to the need for adequate funding, are the big holes in the bill that will hold action back.”On Wednesday the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and UK100 will hold an international clean air summit with the World Health Organization (WHO) director general, Tedros Adhanom.Heather Walton, a health expert with the environmental research group at KCL, said the study was intended to provide more detail than others that have tended to concentrate on the effects of air pollution on life expectancy, such as estimates that pollution contributes to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK.By homing in on hospital admissions for cardiac arrests, strokes and asthma, the researchers were able to provide a clearer picture of the acute impacts on people and how emergency services are affected. “This provides additional evidence of the important need for further action to reduce air pollution,” Walton said.Bates said clean air zones were needed, but also measures to cut all traffic “because all vehicles produce deadly fine particle air pollution from brake and tyre wear. This way the air pollution health crisis and the climate emergency can be addressed together, helping to make our cities and towns healthier and more attractive.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and tackle pollution so people can live longer healthier lives. Our landmark environment bill will set ambitious, legally binding targets to reduce fine particulate matter and increase local powers to address key sources of air pollution.“We are already working hard to reduce transport emissions and are investing £3.5bn to clean up our air, while our clean air strategy has been praised by the WHO as an example for the rest of the world to follow.”Last week Europe’s environmental watchdog found that little or no progress had been made across Europe on cutting levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which is one of the most dangerous forms of pollution because it can lodge deep in the lungs and penetrate the bloodstream."
F1’s attempt to host grand prix in Miami hits hump in the road,Plan announced this week to host race in Florida city faces opposition from some local people due to its impact and noise,Giles Richards,2019-10-17T10:00:18+0100,"“A vacuum humping a goat”. Well, try and banish the picture, if that is possible, but consider instead the sound. An unholy conjugation of machine and animal from which Formula One would surely like to keep its distance.This description of the sound of F1 cars is not the aural sculpture the sport wants associated with its expansion in North America. Yet said development, in the form of this week’s announcement of an agreement in principle to host a race in Miami, may yet see the delightfully colourful phrase bandied around for a while longer.Since taking over the sport in 2017 the owners, Liberty Media, have sought to add to the lone USGP in Texas. Their original plan to put on a race in Miami was stymied earlier this year by objections over its impact on business, traffic and residents at the proposed bayfront site in downtown.However, on Tuesday Sean Bratches, F1’s commercial director,and the CEO of the Miami Dolphins, Tom Garfinkel, issued a joint statement covering the new plan to host a race in the Miami Gardens district, near the Dolphins’ Hard Rock stadium.“We are thrilled to announce that Formula One and Hard Rock Stadium have reached an agreement in principle to host the first-ever Formula One Miami Grand Prix at Hard Rock Stadium,” it read. “With an estimated annual impact of more than $400m and 35,000 room nights, the Formula One Miami Grand Prix will be an economic juggernaut for South Florida each and every year.”The project, aimed for the calendar in 2021, has been backed by the Dolphins’ franchise and stadium owner, Steve Ross. He is expected to cover costs, including an estimated $40m to build the circuit and its immediate infrastructure.The layout is set to make use of the car parks and land surrounding the stadium. It is far from the glamour of the bayfront but requires fewer grants of approval from public bodies. It does, however, include a stretch of public road to the south of the stadium on Northwest 199th street. Which is one reason this is not yet a done deal.In September residents appraised of the proposal immediately expressed concern. The Miami Herald reported that homeowners commissioned a report on the impact of the race. The acoustics expert Colby Leider who compiled it warned that the noise would reach over 120 decibels, compared it to a jet plane taking off and – bravo Colby, for your critique of the modern F1 sound – cited the quote, originally made in an article from thedrive.com, that goats and vacuum cleaners would be getting it on. En masse.Public pressure put paid to F1’s first shot at Miami and it has not gone away. The race still requires the approval of the Miami-Dade County Commission. County Commissioner Barbara Jordan opposes hosting it at the stadium and, having met residents, has not changed her opinion.“It solidified my position as a no, in terms of something this community does not want,” she said. The Herald reports that the Miami Gardens Mayor, Oliver Gilbert, also opposes the race.Members of the community were out on Sunday protesting on 199th street. Leading the activists was the former Miami-Dade Commissioner Betty T Ferguson, who made her point to 7 News Miami. “Even more people will be affected negatively by a race like this than even in the downtown area,” she said. “Because you’re talking about a stadium that is surrounded on all four sides by bedroom communities.” It would, she added, be “environmentally devastating”.Regardless, Garfinkel remains optimistic. “Imagine people coming to this region from around the World in May,” he tweeted. “Multiple passing zones and world-class clubs and amenities. Barcelona, Monaco … Miami … make it happen.”Which raised another potential corollary of making it happen. With 22 races next season, Miami would make 23 in 2021, pushing to the limit teams already loth to add meetings. F1’s sporting director, Ross Brawn, said this week it was looking at reorganising race weekends so teams and drivers can arrive a day later, specifically because of the increase in meetings. Which may work or there may still be some pushback and it would be Barcelona – a race in May and only on a contract until 2020 – that may find itself under threat.Some business leaders, especially in hospitality and tourism, are understandably bullish about the advantages of hosting in Miami with the grand prix being likened to hosting a Super Bowl every year. Which is a comparison no doubt not being made by accident. F1 has already described how it wants its races at “destination cities” to represent Super Bowl-style events.Whether it finally achieves that in Miami lies first in the hands of the county commissioners. Another rejection would be a severe blow for Liberty Media, their juggernaut derailed by the threat of noisy humping."
'Mozart would have made video game music': composer Eímear Noone on a winning art form,The Irish composer and conductor – who’s worked with film director Gus Van Sant and on World of Warcraft – talks passionately about making game music,Keith Stuart,2019-10-22T07:01:11+0100,"Eímear Noone got into composing and conducting video game music by accident. One day, while studying music at Trinity College Dublin, a fourth-year student came to the bar she was drinking in with members of the college chapel choir and offered them a few quid to help with the orchestration on a project of his.“I have a vivid memory of sitting on a studio floor somewhere in Dublin writing choral parts with my pals and then singing them,” she says. “Six months later, my brother calls me in a complete tizzy and says, ‘Did you work on Metal Gear Solid?’ I was like, ‘No!’ He says, ‘Well, I’m looking at your name on the screen credits right now.’ And sure enough, the session she had contributed to for beer money was the soundtrack to Hideo Kojima’s blockbuster adventure game. “Years later, I was at the Bird’s Nest in Beijing conducting this very piece of music,” she says. “It’s just a bizarre life.”Noone is now a successful composer for films and video games, having contributed scores for directors such as Gus Van Sant and Joe Dante, and for games such as World of Warcraft, Diablo III and Hearthstone. In November, she will present her second series of High Score, Classic FM’s programme dedicated to game music. Underappreciated outside of game fandom for years, the genre now has dedicated orchestras playing sold-out concert tours around the world. And Noone is a passionate advocate to explore and explain the unique elements of the form.There is, naturally, a foundational similarity between game and film scores: they are both composed to accompany and accentuate screened action. But while a film score needs to accompany a two-hour linear experience with specific cues and events, video game music must be present for many hours of play. Most open-word action adventures, such as Assassin’s Creed Origins, Witcher 3 and Final Fantasy XV, offer more than 100 hours of narrative, but many players will spend much longer exploring their worlds.Music has two roles in games: it accompanies the noninteractive cinematic sequences that set up the story and occur throughout a game (sort of like short animated movie sequences) and they provide background music while you play. “Cinematic are scored very similarly to a movie or an animated film,” says Noone. “The composer will be given an animatic, which could be anything from a fully rendered sequence to just stick figures on screen. But the edit is pretty close to what it’ll be in the end.“But when music needs to respond to changes the player makes in the world, we employ a kind of loop system. We use a recording method known as striping – we might record the strings separately, for example, but we’ll compose in a way that the strings on their own provide a functioning piece of music. Then, if our character triggers something in the world, perhaps a battle, we can land the wood winds or brass on top of that to increase the intensity. Each part must be self-contained yet work with others – you need to be able to kick in the brass, kick in the percussion, whenever its triggered by gameplay. It’s like a Rubik’s cube puzzle! This is the kind of thing Mozart would have enjoyed – he loved puzzles. Mozart would have loved making game music.”Noone also points out that video game scores help establish the reality of the world the player is about to explore: the instruments used, the style of music, the pace and tempo all work with the art and design to give the players clues about how the universe functions. “The composer has to put you in the headspace of the world, emotionally and intellectually,” she says. “Often these are fantasy worlds, but to ensure they make sense they must have their own rules – and the composer must abide by them. I had a fan contact me once who said ‘I was just listening to the score of World of Warcraft and there are electric guitars! There are no electric guitars in Azeroth!’ But these rules are important – they help make an authentic fantasy world.”For Noone, the most satisfying part is composing the themes that accompany the player throughout the interactive experience. “In-game music is where the composer gets the most freedom – it’s where we creates the big themes,. This is where a lot of the music we perform live with orchestras comes from; it’s the big identifiable themes that players associated with the game and with the characters.“Take the music of Koji Kondo – as soon as you hear the theme from Legend of Zelda, you’re right back in the game, you’re back in the time period in your life that you played it and you’re back with the people you played it with. It’s like hearing a great pop song playing over and over again on the radio – it encapsulates that time for you, it’s in bars, it’s in shops … and with video game music, you live with that soundtrack for the entire time you’re playing the game. It’s not two hours, it’s however long you spend in that game, which can be years.“Game soundtracks become the soundtracks to people’s childhoods, the soundtracks to their second childhoods and their children’s childhoods! More people are listening to orchestral music through video games than ever before in the history of recorded music.”Noone moves on to another difference between film and video game music: they follow different trends. “In film, there’s a stylistic trend at the moment away from the big theme,” she says. “Directors talk a lot about texture. But it seems that video game directors still embrace the big theme, and that’s good for composers because we want to write something more involving.”She is passionate and defensive about game music and its merits. I ask her if the medium, with its lush symphonic orchestration, is kind of old-fashioned – if you compare it to where modern instrumental music is going? I bring up Elgar and his use of big sweeping themes as an example of where game music seems to be and she smiles broadly. “Actually, this is a really good example because when Elgar was writing that music it would have been really uncool – it’s very emotional, it’s visual but at the time there was a lot of atonal music, things were changing, going into serialism even – and Elgar was writing these big lush emotional tunes – how dare he?!”So it’s quite radical for video game music to be overtly lush and emotional? “This is the music of the 21st century,” she says. “Look, we do have atonal music in video games – listen to Garry Schyman’s BioShock score, for instance. I just sat on a panel with Krzysztof Penderecki and his influence is all over horror games. It’s all about the context. There’s a gorgeous mobile game Contre Jour – it’s very visually different, and the piano score is reminiscent of the score to Amélie. I hear the influence of Glass or Reich in lots of what you might consider more traditional classically influenced scores – especially Steve Reich’s Proverb, the vocals on that. Ethereal vocals are definitely part of the video game music style.”For the next season of High Score, Noone has lined up some themed features dealing with specific elements of game music. One show is all about Japanese soundtracks, from the seminal work of Nobuo Uematsu and Yoko Shimomura, who operate in the western orchestral tradition, to J-pop-inspired Masato Nakamura, composer for Sonic the Hedgehog, who is part of the band, Dreams Come True. She also has a programme dedicated to nostalgia, looking back at the earliest works of composers such as Nintendo’s Koji Kondo, who started out on arcade games in the mid-1980s. Before the arrival of CD-Rom technology in the early 1990s, game soundtracks had to be programmed directly to sound chips, with only a very limited amount of memory available.Noone thinks this process was vital in forming the unique sound of game scores. “The reason some of these themes endure, especially Koji Kondo’s, is he had to sit down and painstakingly programme the themes in note by note – so every note mattered – he had to really seriously plan it. If you look at Beethoven’s manuscripts you’ll see him start with a complex theme and then cut that back and he ends up with the opening of the fifth symphony. Similarly, Koji had to refine and chisel down – and that’s why the themes from Mario and Zelda endure: they had to be simple but effective and meaningful.”Noone’s programmes then are going to be an interesting listen for game and music fans who want to understand why scores sound the way they do – and she can be amusingly honest about how game scores (just like film scores) have tropes and techniques that composers will rely on again and again. “If I’m going to be really simplistic, we all know instantly that when the chord of C major goes to F sharp major then back to C major, there’s a spaceship about to fly over head,” she laughs.“Flat five one or sharp four one is a spaceship flying over. That’s it. Every time.”• Eímear Noone presents the new series of High Score from 9 November at 9-10pm on Classic FM."
"Fortnite Chapter 2 is live with new map, weapons and more","It’s back on! Out of the black hole, a whole new world begins, bringing fresh characters, weapons and maybe a redesigned progress system",Keith Stuart,2019-10-15T12:03:11+0100,"It begins. In familiar Fortnite fashion, the first news of the game’s future arrived throughout Monday night, not via official channels, but via the army of celebrity YouTubers and specialist leak accounts spread across social media. Rumours suggested the game may launch at any point in the next few hours.Then we got the cinematic trailer for what will be known as Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1, showing four new characters arriving at dawn on a brand new island, featuring a beach area and gloop-spewing power plant. At the close of the trailer, the battle bus arrives, filled with familiar superstars from the game’s previous seasons, including our own personal favourite, Cuddle Team Leader.Also leaked online was a new Battle Pass trailer showing a fresh range of weapons and a new in-game levelling up system in which players are awarded medals for carrying out tasks such as surviving into the Top 50 players and making head shots – these medals are collected on a punchcard which no doubt unlocks items. This trailer also shows players hopping across the landscape on pogo sticks. Yes, there are going to be pogo sticks.As from right now, the new update is downloadable and a text intro tells us that the Visitor managed to stop the destruction of the universe at the last moment. Players are then dropped straight into a live game, allowing them to explore the map, opening up and revealing new sections as they go.We’ve only had a few minutes play but it’s clear the landscape features remixed versions of classic areas such as Risky Reels and Pleasant Park, as well as totally new discoveries such as Craggy Cliffs, a small town with a range of olde worlde buildings and takeaways, and Sweaty Sands, a hotel and apartment complex complete with rooftop tanning areas. We’ve already had a swim in a spa pool, sped around in a motorboat, found a fishing rod and seen a lighthouse on a distant shoreline. We noticed that the Playground and Creative modes have also been updated.So we’re back in Fortnite again, sooner than expected, and with an impressively stable server experience. There’s a lot to discover in this new if familiar environment, and fans will perhaps be relieved that this isn’t a total reimagining of the beloved Fortnite world with its fluffy trees, rolling hills and eccentric architecture. It will be interesting to see how the new systems work, and how Fortnite Chapter 2 deals with the problem of rivals such as Apex Legends, which brought in the ability to revive downed teammates, putting Epic Games on the back foot. For Chapter 2, Fortnite is adding bandage bazookas, which you can fire at team mates to heal them, and the ability to carry knocked teammates to safety, adding new strategic elements to those frantic gun fights.Other features we’re yet to see include hiding locations such as haystacks and dumpsters, allowing you to leap out on unsuspecting foes, and explosive gas tanks and barrels, to take out enemies when you don’t have grenades. Most interesting is the addition of a weapon upgrade bench so you can tweak your guns with resources discovered during play.Right now, as we charge across a hillside trading gunfire with a man dressed as a golden medieval knight carrying a submachine gun, what’s most striking is that this is very much Fortnite, just in a nice new playground, with fresh rides and the odd surprise. In other words, everything we wanted."
Fortnite has reached The End – changing video game storytelling for good,"Season 10 of Fortnite climaxed in apocalyptic fashion – sucking gamers into a black hole. Whatever the future brings, it has transformed video-game storytelling",Keith Stuart,2019-10-14T11:24:35+0100,"On Sunday evening, more than 6 million people gathered online via streaming services such as Twitch and YouTube to watch the end of the world. Not our world, thankfully, but the world of Fortnite, which was sucked into a black hole, taking the whole game and all player characters with it. If you try to load Fortnite today, you’ll be presented with a blank screen. When developer Epic Games called the finale of Fortnite Season 10 “The End”, it wasn’t kidding.OK, before confused parents start celebrating, let’s be clear: Fortnite will be back, it’s just that Epic has closed out the first chapter of the game, which has amassed 250 million players since the launch of its Battle Royale mode in September 2017. And amid all the hype, hysteria and controversy that has surrounded the gigantically successful title over the past two years, one aspect has been overlooked outside its fanbase: this has been one of the most innovative story experiments of the decade.There is no conventional “narrative” to Fortnite Battle Royale – Epic doesn’t provide an origin story for its endless 100-player wars, it doesn’t give us long cinematic scenes with characters explaining the world, the factions and the plot. Instead, Fortnite is split into a series of three-month-long seasons, each with a climactic event that suggests some kind of interdimensional struggle taking place over the future of the game’s isolated island locale.The plot began in Season Three when players noticed space rocks hitting the surface of the island as they played. Season Four opened with a huge meteor crash, which destroyed the Dusty Depot area of the map, and then at the close of the season, a rocket flew out of the impact site in a live, in-game event visible to all players online at the time – an incredible technical achievement, and a fascinating new way to tell stories within a non-persistent multiplayer universe.From here, each season brought some new anomaly to the world, including giant alien cubes and vast volcanoes, all seemingly part of a fissure in space-time. But players were never told exactly what was going on – everything played out through dramatic season events, and clever little environmental storytelling features, such as in-game television screens suddenly showing countdowns, and new scenic features such as impenetrable bunkers appearing in the woods, with no explanation.Through this system of events and signs, a kind of narrative economy emerged between players. Fans took to Reddit forums in their millions to discuss findings and theorise over what the latest signals could mean. These theories were focused and amplified by the game’s biggest YouTube players – especially Fortnite superstar Ninja – who made videos, picking through clues they and other players had found in the landscape.Environmental storytelling has always been a key element of video game design. When you have a world that players are free to explore, it makes sense to fill that world with story-enhancing elements, rewarding players for having a good look round. Hidden audiotapes, emails and scrolls are a familiar element of action adventure titles such as Assassin’s Creed, Mass Effect and Grand Theft Auto. But these are grand, single-player experiences, where narrative discovery is a key element.In short, it's a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a flying bus on to a small island and then fight until only one is left. Hidden around are weapons and traps, and players must arm themselves while exploring.Fortnite started in July 2017 as a four-player cooperative survival game, but the game's developer, Epic, noticed the huge success of PC title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which pits 100 players against each other, and decided to release a new version.The game is free and players are able to unlock new items as they progress without paying anything. A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items.It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. Players can pull a variety of dance moves, and team up with a friend to compete as a duo or a squad. Participants can chat as they play using headsets and microphones.Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements – nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers – into one package that is free to download.Fortnite Battle Royale, on the other hand, is a multiplayer online game where players interact with the world in discrete 20-minute sessions. Ostensibly, there’s no need for a narrative – Epic could, in theory, retain player interest simply by making sure there is a steady supply of new dance moves, costumes and scenic features to enjoy. Instead, the studio has built a vast functional universe in which an alien known as The Visitor is attempting to mend the space-time fissure around the island, and communicated this through systems of signs, signals and miracles – sort of like the Medieval Christian church. Indeed, it’s interesting how Fortnite has co-opted a lot of religious symbolism into the game’s suggestive narrative, from comets trailing across the sky, to the decidedly apocalyptic imagery of fire, brimstone and global destruction.For Season 10, Epic was always building toward something vast and catastrophic and upped the narrative signalling accordingly. Throughout the last months players have been able to find audiotapes hidden around the map in which The Visitor has made recordings about his attempts to fix a loop in time and prevent a singularity. It sounds like the ravings of a conspiracy theorist, echoing back the most extreme theories from the fanbase itself.And then in the game’s final moments on Sunday evening, a giant explosion took place, sucking the world into a black vortex, leaving players stunned and confused. Brilliantly, Epic took the explosion out of the “fiction” of the game, so that the menu pages and user interface were also pulled into the black hole. To complete the meta-narrative, players who looked up the game’s server status found the narrative had even extended here:Mad props to everyone on the @FortniteGame team for the brilliant execution of this season’s end. I really appreciate the little details like the server status (see picture below). This STW player is excited to see what’s next! 😊 #Fortnite #FortniteChapter2 pic.twitter.com/jGHnJLlMfbFortnite has been criticised as a shallow, cynical machine of compulsion, its trendy dances and outlandish outfits a means of ensnaring younger players. But as a purveyor of new forms of storytelling, in which the community is left to construct its own narrative based around subtle semiotic systems and climactic events, it is a fascinating innovator.In many ways, video-game storytelling is still young. The artform is barely 40 years old as a mass medium – compare that to the movie business (taking the Lumière brothers’ Cinématographe as our start point), which was only just getting into era of colour after four decades. We have seen the rise of massively multiplayer adventures such as World of Warcraft, where global arching narratives are woven into the largely player-directed quests, and we have seen plenty of interesting live story experiments, such as the mostly single-player adventure Dark Souls allowing players to leave messages to each other within the game.But Fortnite is playing with storytelling concepts, tropes and systems while also providing a piece of blockbuster entertainment for millions of mostly teenage players. It’s like a new Marvel superhero movie being performed entirely in interpretive dance.When Chapter 2 inevitably begins, bringing a new landscape with new gameplay features, it will be interesting to see where Epic goes next on its somewhat transgressive storytelling odyssey. It is, after all, quite hard to top the end of the world as a narrative device."
PlayStation 5 v Xbox Scarlett: the next console war begins in 2020,"Sony’s PS5 will have haptic feedback, while Microsoft’s competing console will have four times the power of Xbox One. Here’s how the two high-end machines compare",Keith Stuart,2019-10-09T10:07:34+0100,"The next console war has a start date – or at least a start period. Sony has announced that its next console, PlayStation 5 (PS5), will be launched next autumn/winter, putting it in direct competition with Microsoft’s forthcoming Xbox Scarlett, also due in time for the 2020 Christmas holiday period.In a post on the PlayStation site, Sony revealed that PS5 will have a new controller that replaces the current joypad’s rumble feature with more sensitive and contextual haptic feedback.“With haptics, you truly feel a broader range of feedback,” Sony said. “Crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field. You can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.”The console will also have “adaptive triggers” incorporated into the L2 and R2 trigger buttons. Developers will be able to program the resistance of the triggers so that players, “feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain”. Microsoft is experimenting with a similar technology for its Scarlett controller.This is not the only apparent similarity between the competing consoles. In April, Sony revealed that PS5 would feature an eight-core CPU based on the third generation of AMD’s Ryzen processors, as well as a custom graphics processor based on the AMD Navi family (a technology capable of real-time ray-tracing effects), and a solid state drive (SSD), which will mean the faster loading of games and in-game content, and may also allow more granular loading processes, so players can choose to install only a game’s multiplayer component, or its campaign. The machine will support 8K resolution displays and 120Hz screen refresh rates.Meanwhile, Xbox Scarlett will also utilise the latest AMD Ryzen processor and Navi graphics chipset; it will support screen resolutions of up to 8K and 120Hz refresh rates, and it will use an SSD rather than a traditional hard-disc drive. In addition, Scarlett is set to offer backwards compatibility for all Xbox One games as well as the Xbox and Xbox 360 titles that are available via Xbox One’s backward compatibility feature.Little else is known about the machines. Sony has spoken about PS5’s 3D audio capabilities, using a custom AMD sound chip to create incredibly immersive effects. In an interview with Wired, system architect Mark Cerny claimed the PlayStation user interface is getting a complete overhaul, and will show games information such as multiplayer activities and forthcoming mission objectives while players browse the menu.Virtual reality will also be supported on PS5, at first via the current PlayStation VR headset, but later through a new headset, which is rumoured to support eye-tracking technology and may be wireless. Microsoft has not announced VR or augmented reality tech for Scarlett, but in the summer, rumours surfaced that the machine might be compatible with the Oculus Rift S gaming headset, currently available for PC.It is unclear how the machines’ online multiplayer services will evolve for the next generation. Sony is likely to overhaul its PlayStation Now streaming game service, while Microsoft has its Xbox Game Pass equivalent. Rumours of an Xbox console that uses Microsoft’s cloud-based gaming service have been denied by the company.As for Nintendo, the Switch console is only two years into its lifecycle, so a successor is unlikely to be released next year. However, rumours persist that the company is planning to release an updated and more powerful version of the Switch – known as Switch 2 or Switch Pro on tech sites – featuring an updated processor.In an entertainment market dominated by streaming platforms and services, where everyone is looking for the next equivalent to Netflix or Spotify, it will be interesting to see how two specialist high-end machines fare, especially with Google Stadia (out in November) and Apple Arcade (launched in September), looking to entice more casual players."
'It's a new golden age': Radio 3 launches video game music show,"Presenter Jessica Curry says she wants to prove it’s not all about soundtracking battle scenes – there are plenty of beautiful, relaxing sounds, too",Keith Stuart,2019-10-09T07:00:53+0100,"Radio 3 is launching a new weekly programme dedicated to video game soundtracks. Running from Saturday 26 October, the hour-long show will be presented by composer Jessica Curry, who won a Bafta for her work with UK studio The Chinese Room and created and presented Classic FM’s video game music programme, High Score.“[BBC presenter and journalist] Tom Service and his producer Brian Jackson came to interview me for Radio 3 at Chinese Room a couple of years ago, and we all really hit it off,” said Curry. “Tom’s an avid gamer and there was a definite feeling of excitement about the gaming scene and the music that’s being composed for games.“Lots of people think that it’s all battle music and aggression. The show will prove that that couldn’t be further from the truth.”Video game music has undergone a boom in interest and appreciation in the past five years, as the art form has grown and matured. The Distant Worlds concert, which features compositions from Japanese role-playing game Final Fantasy, has been touring the world for more than a decade, while video-game-themed symphony concerts devoted to games such as Legend of Zelda, Mass Effect and Halo have taken place at the world’s major classical venues, including the Royal Albert Hall in London and Sydney Opera House. Meanwhile, a new market for vinyl video game soundtrack albums has grown up with specialist labels iam8bit and Data Discs producing lavishly packaged records for new and retro games.For fans, the appeal of the music is often nostalgic and related to their love of the games, but Curry says video game soundtracks are attracting a wider interest for their own qualities. “I believe we’re entering a golden age of games music,” said Curry. “The sheer breadth of soundtracks this year has been mind-blowing, and the quality and diversity of games music is on the rise. At the moment, I am in love with Lena Raine’s music for Celeste – it has such a beautiful nod to nostalgia but is also completely now. All of Grant Kirkhope’s music is stunning, and I have Olivier Deriviere’s incredible score for 11-11 Memories Retold on repeat.”Unlike film and TV scores, which are linear and require specific sequences for specific moments, game soundtracks are more open and afford greater compositional space. Speaking to the Guardian last year, composer Winifred Phillips said: “Games are structured so that there are long expanses where there is no dialogue. And music that you create for those sequences, you have the opportunity to really develop musical ideas.”Curry also points out that, as game music needs to be able to fill long periods of time while the player explores at their own pace, it can be more ambient and unintrusive – making it perfect to listen to while doing other things or relaxing. “Todd Baker’s music for Monument Valley always goes on when I’m stressed and need to chill out,” she says.While symphonic scores are flourishing, experimental electronic soundtracks are also gaining wider recognition. “If you look at Sayonara Wild Hearts, that game is packed full of lush electronica. Berlinist’s score for GRIS was a gorgeous mix of more traditional game music and epic electronic dreaminess. Chipzel is tearing the house down with her chip-tune bangers.”While many video game soundtracks are intended as a discrete compositions, there has been a rise in “procedural” scores, which adapt to the actions of the player, rising in tempo and urgency in action set pieces and becoming more ambient during exploration. Experimental group 65daysofstatic produced over two hours of modular electronic music for the space adventure No Man’s Sky, while Matt Boch, associate arts professor at NYU Game Center, created a percussive interactive jazz soundscape for beat-’em-up game, Ape Out.“Nostalgia isn’t going anywhere; the AAAs will stick with the traditional filmic orchestral model,” said Curry. “But the success of Ape Out means that the use of procedural music is going to keep growing.”She believes an influx of new talent, training specifically as video game composers, will also challenge the status quo.“Lots of us older composers were trained in film and television and adapted our compositional approach, but the young guns are digital natives and grew up wanting to compose specifically for games. They have a very intuitive understanding of interactive media and that’s one of the reasons that music for games is getting better and better. It’s been exciting to see more women breaking through, as traditionally it’s been very male, and those different voices have inevitably led to new and exciting approaches.”Curry says her programme will seek to showcase the variety in the medium, as well as explore how game scores are written.“Each week we play a classic track – one that I feel has stood the test of time – as well as a new release and an interview with a games composer, lifting the lid on what it takes to write music for games. For the rest of the show I will be unashamedly partisan and just play tracks that I absolutely love.”Curry sees the medium evolving further as its profile increases. “More bands will write music for games,” she says. “And with an increase in tours and performances of their work, game composers are going to become stars in their own right.”• Sound of Gaming is a recurring four-part series, running from Saturday 26 October, 3 - 4pm, on BBC Radio 3. The programme will also be available on BBC Sounds."

A handful of words can hardly do it justice. With just two tail-ender wickets remaining and needing 107 runs for victory, Australia produced an epic fourth-day fight-back led by Brett Lee. England’s bowlers squirmed as the run chase narrowed, knowing defeat would put them 2-0 down in the series, yet when Michael Kasprowicz edged Steve Harmison’s rising delivery to Geraint Jones the tourists agonisingly fell two runs short of their target. Unusually, the defining image of that match is not the winning delivery itself or even the wild celebrations that followed, but this quiet moment of sportsmanship displayed by Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff, England’s talisman, towards Lee, his crestfallen rival. England would go on to win the series 2-1 and reclaim the Ashes for the first time in 18 years, lending this remarkable image even greater resonance.Photograph: Tom Jenkins / The GuardianWords: Jonny WeeksBuy your exclusive print herePrice £55 including deliveryPrintsPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100-plus years.

Palazzo of dreams,Living above Leonardo’s Milanese vineyard is a constant source of inspiration for fashion designer Massimo Alba,Scarlett Conlon,2019-10-19T16:00:28+0100,"Not many people can say that they share an address with Leonardo da Vinci, but Massimo Alba can. The fashion designer’s Milan apartment is part of the Casa degli Atellani, an elegant palazzo and one of the city’s most celebrated museums. It is also home to the vineyard gifted to da Vinci by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Maria Sforza, in 1498.“Every time I come home, I feel privileged to be living in this terrific place, surrounded by good energy,” says Alba as he leads the way through the museum to the garden where the Renaissance artist tended to his vines.Alba’s home, which he shares with his wife Marilena and their 14-year-old son, Nicolò, is situated on the first floor, but our tour starts in the sun-dappled gardens. Alba is keen to highlight the harmonious juxtaposition between past and present that inspires not only his work but his apartment, too. The 59-year old designer and his family moved here shortly after their home on the island of Ischia was destroyed by the 2017 earthquake. They had already sold their other two properties in and around Milan to raise capital to set up his eponymous label, so when the Casa degli Atellani’s current owners, the Portaluppi family, suggested Alba rented one of the storied dwellings, the family saw it as an opportunity to start their next chapter.“You don’t really own things [in life], only emotions,” reflects Alba, explaining that no longer being a proprietor – much like running his independent brand – makes him feel, “in a funny way, free”.The apartment is peppered with mementos from the past. When you step into the apartment you’re met with a treasure “from a lifetime ago”: an exquisite Tibetan chest that sits beneath a high ceiling. Beyond is an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living area with a retro floor-to-ceiling shelving system that acts as a room divider.Taking centre stage, the shelving unit is covered in dog-eared paperbacks piled high, unframed canvases, souvenirs, family photographs, hand-written notes, candlesticks, paperweights and small vintage lamps picked up at markets and auctions. It acts as a captivating storyboard of lives spent and shared.So, too, the artwork that covers the walls. Black and white photography and abstract oil paintings by Lillian Bassman, Kenro Izu, Evelyn Hofer and François Berthoud sit on floating shelves along one wall that stretches the length of the apartment. Meanwhile, giant scenes by French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier and the Sicilian photographer Ferdinando Scianna stand side by side on the floor next to a small sculpted chair by Tom Dixon.On the opposite wall, giant windows frame the view of the Santa Maria delle Grazie church across the road where da Vinci, commissioned by Sforza, painted The Last Supper in 1498, where it still hangs to this day.“In a certain way, our home is a melting pot, everything is slightly different, from a different place in time,” says Alba. As with the collections that he and Marilena design to be seasonless, comfortable and worn with everything else in your wardrobe, his home is a holistic extension of that. “We never look at each item; we look at the way items work with other items. We don’t want to change every season – we want to follow our inner voice and instinct.”Many of the pieces have sentimental value. Midcentury chairs by Danish and Italian designers including Hans Wegner and Gio Ponti are decorated with cushions Alba had embroidered by his friend, the artist Roberto Reale. They read: “Happiness is not in another place but in this place, not in another hour, but in this hour,” and “Hello there.” A lampshade also features needlework by Reale that reads: “M’illumino d’immenso.” It translates as: “I flood myself with the light of the immense,” and is a quote from the late Italian modernist poet Giuseppe Ungaretti, whose poetry Alba’s son was recently studying at school.Tibetan rugs, which overlap each other across the floor, have been hand-painted by Alba – himself a keen artist whose line of painted handkerchiefs has become a signature of his brand. Beds are draped in blankets he designed with the Scottish cashmere company Begg & Co. The kitchen, where I’m told generous servings of pasta and wine are served up for regular dinner-party guests, is decorated with classic Sicilian head vases, vintage mismatched glassware and family relics passed down from parents.“Personally, I like it when things from different times become friends and live together – something from the 50s, something from the 30s,” explains Alba. “I really feel it’s home. I feel close to everything I like.”Warm and inviting, it’s a home that is lived in, not looked at; the kind of space that speaks style and whispers “well-travelled” with a curiosity in every corner and a cup of coffee on the table.It’s kept feeling cosy by the walls and ceilings which are the same shade of matt grey throughout. They were done this way, says Alba, so that the rooms not only “become circular” and create intimacy but also complement the view of Santa Maria delle Grazie. It brings the outside in – as do the pots of Monstera deliciosa, along with unidentified succulents and vases of wild eucalyptus.One of the most memorable pieces from Alba’s home is a glass sculpture of a salmon by the glass artist Hugh Findletar, which Alba says he was drawn to “because salmon swim against the tide”. In creating this very personal space inside this world-famous landmark, Alba and his family have created a Renaissance of their own."
How to save: Martin Lewis’s four top tips for putting money away,"As incomes are squeezed and millions of Britons put nothing aside, the savings expert explains how best to build a healthy bank account",Emine Saner,2019-10-21T16:52:18+0100,"According to NatWest, which looked at the data of 750,000 anonymised customers, around half are not saving any money each month. Household finances are under pressure – earlier this year the Resolution Foundation thinktank described it as “an unprecedented income squeeze over the past decade”. Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, agrees: “There are people in this country who have less income than their minimum outgoings, and that is a real crisis,” he says. However, part of it may also be an attitude problem: the NatWest survey found that those earning over £90,000 were just as likely not to put anything away. So, if you have money coming in and a potential to free up cash, how can you get into the savings habit? Lewis has some tips.If you have expensive debts, it’s better to clear them than to save. If you are debt-free except for your mortgage, the interest rate on that will probably be higher than savings rates, so you should consider overpaying your mortgage, although I would like to see a minimum of three months’ worth of bills put aside.Sit down with three months’ worth of bank and credit-card statements, factor in Christmas and other expenses. Make sure you are not overpaying your gas and electricity bills, you’re getting the best deals on things like your digital TV, and work out your necessary expenditure. Look at your discretionary spending – that £3 coffee every working day is £750 a year. Set up different accounts, and as soon as you get paid, put money away – but manage your cash so you don’t go overdrawn, because that defeats the point. You can start to learn what spare money you really have, and start to discipline yourself. We are very unrestrained when we don’t have a budget.The minimum anybody should be earning on savings right now is 1.45%, which is the rate of the top easy-access account. There are ways to earn more, such as locking money away. If you are young and saving for a property, open a Lifetime ISA, which will give you a 25% boost. For those people on a low income, the government has a Help to Save scheme – I was worried it would encourage people to keep money in savings when they should be clearing their debts, but it’s a clever scheme.If you are able to free up some cash, saving is about a mindset change. Some people like a challenge – put a penny aside on the first day, 2p on the second day, 3p on the third. Anything that gets you into the habit is worthwhile. For younger people, if you’re lucky enough to get a pay rise, put a quarter of it into savings straight away, because once we get used to having more money, we find it very difficult to have less. It’s a difficult time to save at the moment because interest rates are so low, but anything you can do break your habitual pattern, and start to put money aside – if your finances have room – will be helpful."
Seaside residents dominate personal debt league in England and Wales,Stoke-on-Trent tops list but coastal towns such as Scarborough and Blackpool dominate,Rupert Jones,2019-10-21T06:01:18+0100,"Seaside towns and cities dominate the list of areas with the highest numbers of people getting into serious difficulties with debt, according to new figures.Scarborough, the largest resort on the Yorkshire coast, ranked second out of 347 local authorities in England and Wales for personal insolvencies, while Torbay in Devon – which includes the town of Torquay – came third, said the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young.Plymouth, on the south coast of Devon, was ranked fourth, while Blackpool was in sixth place.However, it was the city of Stoke-on-Trent in the Midlands which had the highest rate of personal insolvencies, recording just over 51 per 10,000 adults in 2018. The national average was 25, said the firm.The insolvency rate includes personal bankruptcies, debt relief orders and individual voluntary arrangements.UHY Hacker Young said the data suggested many of the locations “are still a long way from recovering from the decades of contraction in their traditional coastal industries such as tourism, shipbuilding and fishing”.It added that the slump in sterling and the resulting rise in the numbers of people taking staycation holidays had apparently had little tangible impact on traditional holiday destinations such as Scarborough and Blackpool.Scarborough had 47.8 insolvencies per 10,000 adults, while Torbay had 45.7, and Plymouth had 45.2.Other coastal locations or regions featured in the firm’s “top 20” included Weymouth and Portland in Dorset, which includes the resort of Weymouth, which was in 12th place (39.6 insolvencies per 10,000 adults); the Isle of Wight, in 13th place (39.3 per 10,000); Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, in 14th place (39.2 per 10,000); Cornwall, in 17th place (38.5 per 10,000); and Hastings in East Sussex, in 19th place (38 per 10,000).The accountancy firm said many coastal towns outside south-east England had struggled to replace their traditional industries with faster growth sectors such as financial services and technology.A number of the locations named in the survey, including Scarborough, Blackpool, Plymouth, Great Yarmouth, Ryde on the Isle of Wight and Hastings, are among 69 English towns and cities that will benefit from a £95m regeneration fund announced by the government in September 2019."
Lowest October rise in UK house prices since 2008 financial crisis,Rightmove says sluggish market and Brexit uncertainty are putting potential sellers off,Rupert Jones,2019-10-21T00:01:10+0100,"UK house prices have registered their lowest October rise since the 2008 financial crisis as Brexit uncertainty continues to take its toll, according to the property website Rightmove.Its data also showed that some parts of London are continuing to see asking prices fall, in some cases by £15,000 or more in a month.The price of property coming to market at this time of year usually experiences an “autumn bounce,” with an average rise of 1.6% recorded in the month of October over the last 10 years – but this year saw a “more sluggish” monthly rise of 0.6%, which was the lowest since October 2008.The current state of the housing market combined with the ongoing political uncertainty from Brexit appears to be putting off many would-be sellers. Rightmove’s average number of new house sale listings per week has fallen to just over 24,000 – its lowest at this time of year since October 2009. This is down 13.5% on the same period a year ago.By contrast, many buyers “seem undeterred”, with the number of sales being agreed virtually unchanged on a year ago, according to the site, whose latest data was based on the asking prices of more than 122,000 properties put on sale between 8 September and 12 October.Miles Shipside, a Rightmove director, said: “With upwards pricing power now pretty flat, some sellers who are motivated by maximising their money seem to be holding back. They may be waiting for more certainty around both achieving their price aspirations, and also the Brexit outcome.”Marc von Grundherr, at the estate agent Benham & Reeves, said that while the sector was more subdued than usual, “the UK property market is yet to disappear down the Brexit abyss”.Rightmove’s detailed data paints a mixed picture for London, with some boroughs seeing sizeable price falls and others experiencing price growth. The average price of a home in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London, has fallen by more than £17,000 in a month – from £605,000 in September to £587,000 in October. Wandsworth in south London recorded a typical £16,000 price fall. But in other boroughs, including Britain’s most expensive area, Kensington and Chelsea, average prices continued to climb."
"Pacer train passengers deserve fare cuts, say northern England leaders",Northern Rail urged to compensate people forced to use outdated ‘buses-on-rails’,Maya Wolfe-Robinson,2019-10-21T10:38:51+0100,"Leading politicians in northern England have demanded a cut in fares on routes that still use the much-derided Pacer trains.In a letter to Northern Rail, they say passengers deserve financial compensation for having to use the “buses-on-rails” that were due to be retired by the end of the year.The Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, the Sheffield city region mayor, Dan Jarvis, and the Leeds city council leader, Judith Blake, told the train operator that the continued use of the old carriages was “unacceptable” and that an urgent commitment to reduced fares “is the very least that could be done”.The diesel-powered Pacers, built as a temporary stopgap in the 1980s from bus frames set on train wheels, do not comply with disability regulations that come into effect in the new year and still have toilets that flush on to the track. It emerged over the summer that, because of a delay in manufacturing their replacements, they would not be scrapped by 2020 as promised by the rail franchise.The city leaders express “deep disappointment and frustration” in the letter, which was sent to David Brown, the managing director of Arriva Rail North, which owns Northern rail. They also ask for “urgent assurances” regarding the arrangements planned for customers with accessibility requirements while the Pacers remained in use.They say the “widening disparity between transport investment” in northern England, compared with the south has been underlined by the continued use of Pacers, but also acknowledge that withdrawing them before the replacements were ready would be a worse solution. The “retention, for a short, time limited period appears to be the best of an extremely poor range of options”, they write.Blake said the withdrawal of Pacers was “one of the centrepiece commitments made in the Northern franchise”, adding: “The fact they will still be running in 2020 is symbolic of the broader issues with this franchise which continues to deliver an unacceptable level of service to passengers.”The three politicians have requested a meeting to iron out a compensation package and promises regarding accessibility over the next week.Last week, the transport secretary signalled that the Northern rail network could be renationalised after years of late and cancelled trains. Grant Shapps said he had asked the company, which runs routes from Newcastle to Leeds, Liverpool, Hull, Manchester and Stoke, to draw up proposals to improve the service, saying it could not “continue delivering in the current delivery method”. He also said he was “hugely impatient [to see] the extinction of Pacer trains”.A spokesperson for Northern said “a small number of Pacers units” would need to be used “for a short period of time in 2020”. It said the first Pacer went into retirement in August, and “the majority of Pacers” were expected to be removed by the end of the year.The company, acknowledging that “customers will be disappointed”, said it was “finalising proposals for customer support and offers” for passengers who travel on Pacers in 2020.It added: “From today, Monday 21 October, we will have 29 of our 101 new trains in service for customers and a further 27 new trains are in final testing or being used for driver training.“We agree the north deserves the best possible rail service and are working hard to improve performance and reliability for customers.”"
Regulator acts after ‘illegal’ airport parking scheme collapses,"Investors were told paying £20,000 to acquire places at Gatwick and Glasgow would bring returns of 12%",Hilary Osborne,2019-10-20T09:00:50+0100,"Investors who put their money into an airport parking scheme that went into liquidation earlier this year are hoping for compensation after the Financial Conduct Authority announced it was taking legal action against those behind the scheme.The Park First scheme, which collected more than £230m from thousands of people, offered returns of up to 12% to those who invested £20,000 a time on individual parking spaces at Gatwick and Glasgow airports.But the FCA claims it was an “illegal collective investment scheme” that was “promoted to the public using false or misleading statements”.Park First is just the latest in a string of schemes, many related to property, to have disappointed investors who were hoping for decent returns. While it is not always possible to sort the good from the bad, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself.• “As a starting point, never invest in anything that you don’t understand,” says Patrick Connolly of financial advisers Chase de Vere. If something sounds highly complicated, or if the explanation of how the returns will be achieved doesn’t seem to stack up, ask questions. If it still doesn’t make sense, it might be a sign that something is wrong.• It’s an old adage, but true: “If an investment seems too good to be true then it probably is,” says Connolly. “And if it is promoted with a very high interest rate then that means it is very high risk.” With returns on bank accounts still languishing in the low single figures, high rates of return may be a sign of high risk.• “Stick to investing with reputable and established firms,” says James Daley, managing director of consumer group Fairer Finance. The FCA publishes a register of companies that it authorises – you can check it at register.fca.org.uk. It also has a list of unauthorised firms – these are firms that it has received complaints about, but do not assume that a company that does not appear on this list is legitimate.Also look out for the badge of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme – as its name suggests, this is set up to pay out if a company goes wrong and leaves investors out of pocket.• Treat unsolicited calls and emails with suspicion. Often people who have bought into one investment scheme will get calls about others – it may be that some companies sell their lists. There are also fraudsters who make a business out of offering to buy up failed investments – they typically ask for an upfront fee of some kind, then disappear. Do not agree to anything without doing some research first.• Do not assume property is good security. Many schemes offer ownership of a leasehold in return for your cash, and it can be reassuring to know that you own the rights to a room or a piece of land. But as investors caught up in landbanking schemes can vouch, even property can be worthless if you can’t use it and no one else wants to buy it.• Use a reputable financial adviser. “If you’re parting with any serious sums of money, it’s worth taking advice from a good professional,” says Daley. “Look for advisers who are chartered or certified, which means they’re qualified to a higher level.”"
Extinction Rebellion: what price could you pay for taking a stand?,"How being arrested on a climate or anti-Brexit protest could affect your job, mortgage or travel",Miles Brignall,2019-10-19T07:00:24+0100,"For many people, this weekend could be their first experience of protest, whether on the anti-Brexit march on Saturday or as part of Extinction Rebellion’s rolling campaign. But what about those willing to go further and be arrested?Extinction Rebellion launched a wave of civil disobedience on 7 October to highlight the escalating climate emergency, and by yesterday, more than 1,700 people – including the Guardian columnist George Monbiot – had been arrested, with some now facing an anxious wait to find out what comes next.Guardian Money has spent the week looking at the possible financial implications of being arrested in this type of protest, and talked to lawyers, experts and those who have put themselves on the line for environmental causes.We found that, depending on the outcome of arrests, those involved could face issues with their personal finances, including mortgages, insurance and future employment.One of the big unknowns, say those behind the protests, is how many people will be prosecuted. Following previous Extinction Rebellion action, only about 10% of those arrested were charged, but it could well be higher this time. There has been a hardening of attitudes this week at the Home Office and the Metropolitan police, and the Met has warned it will be pushing for more prosecutions this time round.Prosecutions can lead to unspent convictions and – while that might sound technical – it is these that can cause the biggest problems. Extinction Rebellion does not duck this issue on its website, which has downloads and FAQs covering this area. “Before attending an action, it’s crucial that all rebels inform themselves about their rights as protesters and the possible consequences of arrest,” it says.This article is not designed to put anyone off participating in protests. The aim is to clearly spell out the implications that being arrested could have so individuals can make an informed choice.A criminal conviction can be for anything from a serious crime resulting in a prison sentence to littering or speeding leading to a fine. It is likely that in the case of most of those charged this week, it will be for failing to leave a controlled area of London when instructed to do so by a police officer.Once someone has been convicted, that conviction is deemed to be current – or unspent – for a period based on the sentence. The more serious the conviction, the longer it remains unspent.In short, convictions are what insurers, mortgage companies, employers and other organisations do not want to see on your “file”. For example, British Heart Foundation does not accept volunteers to work in its shops if they have any type of unspent conviction.John Briant, an Oxford-based criminal barrister who has been advising local Extinction Rebellion protesters about the implications of being arrested, says most of those previously arrested who chose to go to court have ended up with a conditional discharge of six months and/or a fine related to income. Conditional discharges are only considered to be spent at the end of that term – typically six or nine months.For those who are fined in court, the conviction is only considered to be spent a year from conviction. Those given a community order face a year on top of the order’s length.The extraordinary 15-month prison sentences meted out to anti-fracking protesters are a much bigger problem, as the conviction is not considered spent for a further four years on top of the sentence.It may sound ridiculous, but a 70-year-old retired teacher who may have never claimed on their home insurance is unlikely to have their policy renewed once they reveal they have an unspent conviction.Christopher Stacey, a co-director of the charity Unlock, which was set up 20 years ago to help people with all types of convictions, says most big insurers will not renew, or issue a new household policy, when they learn someone in the insured household has an unspent conviction. Several insurers including Direct Line, LV= and Aviva told Money this was the case.“Getting insurance can be a big problem for people with an unspent conviction. For those with existing house insurance, if you don’t notify them of the change when you next renew, the firm could refuse to pay out if you later try to claim. We have seen this happen in the past, particularly when people have let their policy simply automatically renew,” he says.Convicted protesters given a six-month conditional discharge would be fine if their renewal came up after it was considered spent. However, if it fell within the six months, it would be unlikely to be renewed – if you admit it. Unlock has produced a list of specialist brokers who will help those with an unspent conviction find insurance cover, but this is likely to come at a cost.Some insurers have a clause in their terms and conditions that requires the customer to inform them of a conviction, at any time. One of the UK’s largest, Aviva, told Money it insists customers inform it of any new non-motoring convictions “as soon as reasonably possible”. It admits it could lead to a decline or cancellation of the policy, either at the time or at the point of renewal. As soon as your conviction is spent, you have no obligation to mention it to an insurer. The Unlock calculator can help with this.Car insurers are not so obsessed with non-motoring convictions unless they are serious and relate to theft, fraud or handling stolen goods. Again, you will have to declare any unspent convictions at renewal. However, Aviva said it would insure a driver with a minor protest conviction who had an otherwise clean record – but again at a cost.No, there is no obligation to tell your insurer or other financial company that you were arrested. If you accept a caution, that is considered to be immediately spent. However, it can have long-term consequences, as it stays on your police file for life – and will be likely to appear on any enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check carried out later.The credit reference agency Experian told us criminal fines and convictions have no impact on credit scores, and only a fraud conviction would show up as a “marker”. Banks generally take a similar stance. Nationwide says it does not ask about criminal convictions when someone is opening an account. Only serious financial crimes such as money laundering, bribery, tax evasion or mortgage fraud would lead to account withdrawal, it adds.However, things become a bit murkier when it comes to mortgage applications, says Stacey at Unlock. Mortgage companies do ask about unspent convictions, and every year, the charity hears reports of people having their mortgage application seemingly turned down for this reason.Stacey says most lenders will ask about criminal records – typically: “Have you ever been convicted, or have any prosecutions pending for any criminal offence (other than motoring offences)?” Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, spent convictions do not have to be disclosed as part of a mortgage application, irrespective of what questions are asked. Mortgage companies should be clear about this, but often aren’t, he says.If your conviction is unspent, you will need to disclose it.Ruby Dinsmore, an employment law specialist at Slater and Gordon, says: “Strictly speaking, employees are under no legal obligation to tell their boss if they have been arrested or charged with an offence, but there are exceptions. For example, if their contract of employment states that they must disclose such matters, or the conviction affects their ability to do the job, such as a taxi driver banned from driving, or if they work in certain regulated professions.”She says honesty is usually the best policy, as the consequences could be much worse if an employer were to find out at a later stage.“While information about arrests is not publicly available – unless an employer were to carry out an enhanced background check – details of charges and convictions are,” Dinsmore says.“And if the employer decided that their trust had been broken, that the person’s behaviour posed a threat to colleagues or customers or had brought the business into disrepute, they could be within their rights to dismiss them, even before the outcome of any criminal case.”For many younger protesters, this will be the biggest issue, particularly if they decide to change career.Most big employers conduct a basic DBS check before they offer a new employee a contract. This will show up only unspent convictions and conditional cautions, which will not be a problem for most first-time environmental protesters.However, if you decide you want to work with children or vulnerable adults, even on a voluntary basis, and the organisation does an enhanced check, it will show all convictions – including spent ones – plus cautions and any other information the police deem to be relevant. Most cautions given to first-time Extinction Rebellion protesters would likely only come off their enhanced check after six years.It would then be up to the employer to decide whether to carry on. Would a caution following a climate protest lead to a teacher being denied a job offer?It is worth noting that plenty of people taking jobs in finance have been caught out after telling their employer they had no convictions, as they were spent, only to have the offer withdrawn when the employer did a DBS check. Arguably, as more people are arrested at climate protests, employers will have to stop lumping them in with every other convicted or cautioned person.Generally, anyone travelling to the US for less than 90 days can travel under the visa waiver programme. However, if you have been arrested, you are ineligible to travel under the scheme, and will have to apply to the US embassy for a visa. A typical six-month conditional discharge given to a climate protester would probably not be grounds for a visa refusal, but the visa process can be a real pain. Equally, those planning to emigrate in later life will have to disclose any brushes with the law, and it could be a problem depending on the country.Miranda Cox, who was one of a number of people arrested after locking themselves to the entrance to Cuadrilla’s fracking site near Blackpool, says environmental protesters need to go into the process with their eyes open.Along with 11 others, she pleaded not guilty in 2017 to obstructing the highway, but was convicted. They each received a 12-month conditional discharge and had to pay a total of £270 in costs.“Looking back on it, I think we were a little naive about the consequences. We knew we wouldn’t be visiting America any time soon but we didn’t really think about the other consequences. I think we were lucky that most of us were a bit older and we weren’t about to make big career changes or similar,” says Cox, 50, who was a councillor at the time.She says she did not have insurance problems but others in the group have faced rises in car premiums. No one lost their job, she says, but she suspects that was more due to their circumstances.“To anyone thinking of joining an environmental protest I’d say go for it, as you will be on the right side of history. However, you need to go into it with your eyes open. Being handcuffed and thrown in the back of a police van and spending several hours in a police cell was really unpleasant – much worse than I thought it would be,” she says."
Mortgages: 40-year terms are becoming the norm – but watch out,First-time buyers could end up paying a lot more – and not be mortgage-free until their 70s,Rupert Jones,2019-10-19T07:00:25+0100,"Mortgages with a maximum term of 40 years are now becoming the norm, according to new data this week. However, with the average age of a first-time buyer standing at 32, that raises the prospect of a generation of homeowners not achieving mortgage-free status until they are in their 70s.Latest research from the data experts at Moneyfacts.co.uk shows that 57% of the residential mortgage products currently available have a standard maximum term of up to 40 years – up from just under 36% in March 2014.It provides more evidence that the traditional 25-year mortgage is increasingly becoming a thing of the past, particularly when it comes to first-timers.Yorkshire building society this month became the latest big provider to increase its maximum term to 40 years.By stretching the term, borrowers can reduce their monthly payments and are therefore more likely to meet banks’ strict affordability rules.But there’s a big sting in the tail. Moneyfacts gives the example of a £250,000 repayment home loan with an interest rate of 2.5%.Over 25 years, that equates to a monthly repayment of £1,121, and the total interest payable would be £86,463.The same mortgage taken over 40 years would cut the monthly repayments to £824, but whack up the total interest to £145,733. That’s an additional £59,270.Shaun Church, a director at mortgage broker Private Finance, says: “Continued efforts need to be made to ensure home ownership remains attainable early in adulthood to avoid jeopardising this generation’s financial security later in life.”Darren Cook at Moneyfacts says an extended mortgage term may well go beyond pension age, “so it is imperative these borrowers consider their options and attempt to make provisions if their personal circumstances change”."
DIY travellers risk being tripped up by lack of protection when booking via comparison sites,Booking a villa through an online platform can leave the holidaymaker with little or no recourse to compensation when the property fails to live up to its description,Anna Tims,2019-10-20T08:59:50+0100,"It was early evening when Victoria Morley arrived at her €6,000 holiday villa on the Maltese island of Gozo. The five-bedroom farmhouse had been described on TripAdvisor as a “unique experience of luxury accommodation” and Morley had spent her savings on a fortnight’s stay to reunite her family after the recent death of her husband. The luxury turned out to be restricted to the seductive photos on the TripAdvisor listing. “It was dirty, some of the furniture was broken, toilets were blocked, cable TV had been advertised but wasn’t subscribed to, the whirlpool bath didn’t work and the pool had lots of tiles missing,” she says. “The whole place was rundown and, more worryingly, it failed to meet European safety standards, with no fire extinguishers or smoke detectors.”Morley was unable to find a phone number for TripAdvisor on its website and, since it was getting late, the family went to bed. She emailed the company at 6am the following morning to report her concerns and was called by a representative who assured her that she would be covered by the company’s payment protection scheme.The ensuing holiday was interrupted by plumbers and builders called to repair leaks and other defects, and by regular emails to TripAdvisor as new evidence of the villa’s condition emerged. At the end of their stay, the company announced that they would not be covered after all, because Morley should have informed them of the problems on arrival, then vacated the property. “We weren’t told this at the time and we would in any case have been unable to find another property at such short notice,” she says. “With my two autistic sons and an 85-year-old mother in our party it wasn’t viable to walk out with all our luggage in the evening, after a long day of travelling and with nowhere to go.”Morley tried to claim via PayPal’s buyer protection scheme, but was told that since the accommodation had been “delivered”, it could not help. She could not issue a claim via her credit card issuer because transactions through third-party payment systems, such as PayPal, are not covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. The only agency to act on her complaint was the Maltese tourist board, which barred the owner from renting the property again until it complied with safety standards. However, the listing remains on TripAdvisor’s website.Morley’s experience was a painful lesson in the lack of protection available to travellers who book through comparison platforms such as TripAdvisor, Skyscanner or TravelSupermarket. And it serves as a warning to those who, in the wake of the collapse of Thomas Cook and other travel companies, decide to organise a holiday themselves.Unlike most travel agents and tour operators, comparison platforms are not members of Abta or Atol, which offer insurance-backed safety nets and, in the case of Abta, a code of practice and arbitration. Nor can travellers rely on the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations, which offer degrees of protection when two or more components of a holiday are booked through a single provider. Because bookings via comparison platforms are made directly with a hotel, airline or travel agent, they don’t count if the provider for each part differs. TripAdvisor only handles payments for private accommodation rentals, like Morley’s, but the contract is with the property owner, so customers who book a flight as well are unprotected.Confusingly, bookings via similar-seeming websites, such as Ebookers or Hotels.com, may be covered under the regulations because they are brokers and handle all transactions themselves. A trawl through the usually well-hidden terms and conditions can be the only way to distinguish between a broker and comparison site.Moreover, while travel agents and tour operators must take responsibility for the accuracy of their adverts, travel platforms are not necessarily held to account for misleading listings. According to the Advertising Standards Authority, the advertiser is usually held liable, rather than the platform hosting the advert, and substandard accommodation is a matter for council trading standards departments which, as Morley was to discover, won’t help if the advertiser is based abroad. This leaves the courts as the only recourse for dissatisfied customers.Last month the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced a crackdown on hotel booking sites to ensure they complied with consumer protection law. Twenty-five firms, including TripAdvisor, Skyscanner and Travelsupermarket, agreed to commit to make their websites fairer and more transparent. The move followed enforcement action against six sites (which did not include TripAdvisor, Skyscanner or Travelsupermarket) that had been found to have exploited customers with pressure-selling tactics, hidden fees and misleading discount claims.TripAdvisor is a fantastic resource for researching holidays, but consumers need to treat it as just that“Sites have a responsibility to ensure the information on their platforms is reliable and, if they continue to fall short, they should be compelled to make changes so holidaymakers are no longer at risk of being duped by dodgy reviews or misleading photographs,” says Which? Travel’s Naomi Leach. “We have exposed sites like TripAdvisor for failing to take action on activity, such as suspicious hotel reviews that artificially boost rankings, as well as glossy marketing photos used by accommodation owners that turn out to be a far cry from reality.” Tripadvisor responded that it is “aggressive” in catching fakes.TripAdvisor eventually paid Morley €1,000 for the “inconvenience” after pressure from the Observer. It insisted that she had breached the terms of its payment protection policy by spending the first night in the property and claimed that when she contacted customer services the following dawn, the money for her stay had already been released to the villa owner, who offered a €200 “refund”. Moreover, it said its policy does not cover “maintenance issues with amenities or services” only “material differences” between a listing and the reality, a distinction which will be lost on travellers who find a pool exists but is filthy, or a garden too overgrown to use.However, it accepts Morley was misinformed. “An agent incorrectly advised that Ms Morley would be covered by our payment protection policy, but [as] this was the second day of Ms Morley’s booking, this was not the case,” said a spokesperson. “We fell short of the standards which we hold ourselves to on this occasion, which is disappointing, and we hope the gesture of goodwill helps to make up for this inconvenience.”The company states that it always works with travellers and property managers to resolve problems. It confirms that although the substandard villa was delisted by the property agent, a listing for the same property under a different name by the owner remains on the site.Morley hopes that her experience will warn others of the pitfalls of DIY holidays. “Travellers need to be aware of the complaints system and not think they can sleep on a situation, no matter how jetlagged they are,” she says. “TripAdvisor is a fantastic resource for researching holidays, but consumers need to treat it as just that. They’re not a travel agent, which I falsely assumed they are. People may feel protected and secure buying their holiday through a huge firm that regularly advertises on television, but it relies on consumers to review their stay and that isn’t foolproof, as the reviews can be taken down by the owners, or, as in my case, the owner can simply take down the original advert and re-advertise under another name. For me it was never about getting a free holiday, just the holiday promised by the advert.”• This article was amended on 21 October 2019 to remove potential ambiguity from the headline and to add details about the CMA announcement last month."
Mortgage prisoners: domestic abuse survivors on how they got trapped,Homeowners fleeing toxic relationships can get stuck with large mortgages they can’t escape,Suzanne Bearne,2019-10-19T07:00:26+0100,"Four years ago, without a word of warning, Wendy’s estranged husband stopped paying his share of the mortgage, leaving the mother of one to pay the full £1,100 a month.Despite this, Wendy*, 46, was still at the mercy of her abusive ex, who prevented the sale of the property and refused to sign the papers when she negotiated a new mortgage rate.“A court order said the house must be sold, but until I sold, I had to pay for everything,” says Wendy, who was divorced in 2017. “But when I needed to apply for a new mortgage rate during the process, he refused to put his signature down until I paid for all fees upfront. Both our names were on the mortgage and we needed both signatures, but it’s maddening that I was solely responsible for meeting all the expenses. What financial right was there for me and my daughter? It’s total nonsense.”He eventually signed and the house was sold in July this year but, says Wendy: “I lost 5kg in a month through this. I’ve had to pay for the mortgage and everything for the house, then when it was sold he got 50%. I’m in a lucky position as I could afford to pay the mortgage by myself, but there’s thousands of women out there who can’t.”According to the domestic abuse charity Refuge, one in five people in the UK have experienced economic abuse in an intimate relationship. This can range from their partner racking up debt in their name to controlling their money.Adina Claire of the charity Women’s Aid says: “Perpetrators use tactics to control and isolate their victim, forcing them into a state of dependency. This makes it harder for survivors to leave their abusers and rebuild their lives.”Some homeowners in abusive relationships can find themselves trapped with mortgages they cannot escape due to their ex-partners wanting to continue to control them.Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, the director of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse, says: “A lot of survivors come to us after they have left their partner and they’re paying the mortgage themselves.“Often, because it’s a joint mortgage, when the rate is up for renewal, they have to get their ex-partner to agree terms, and they are usually controlling the victim by refusing to agree. For example, if they’re on a variable mortgage, payments go up and they struggle to make the payments. It can lead to arrears and repossession. It’s an odd state of affairs where the system is allowing that control to be executed by the perpetrator.”Claire Throssell, 47, who lives in South Yorkshire, was left with a £50,000 mortgage bill after her estranged husband, Darren Sykes, deliberately set fire to her house in October 2014, killing their two sons, Jack and Paul. Sykes also died in the fire.She says: “Unbeknown to all of us, he cancelled the house insurance in June, and in October, two weeks after we separated, he started 14 fires in the house and barricaded our sons in. He also sent a letter to the bank saying he would kill himself, and that I would be responsible for the £50,000 mortgage because he was dead. It was incredible that the bank received it and did nothing about it.”The bank, HSBC, insisted the £50,000 needed to be paid, she says: “The house was completely destroyed and worth nothing. I had to keep going to the bank every few months and show pictures [of her destroyed home]. If it hadn’t been for the community who rebuilt the house with their own materials and their own time, then I wouldn’t be there. There’s no way I could have paid that back.” She sold the property in 2016 and managed to buy a flat and start again.Throssell, an ambassador for Women’s Aid,describes the bank’s actions as “unbelievable”. She adds: “The fact they kept getting in touch [with me]. I did say to them that it was as if they didn’t trust me. I took in pictures of the house and they were gobsmacked. It was stress I didn’t need. They could have been more compassionate. I didn’t need the pressure.”Fortunately, there have been moves to help those experiencing economic abuse. In January, the government published a draft domestic abuse bill, that would include economic abuse for the first time. The bill was included in the legislative programme set out in the Queen’s speech on Monday.In October last year, financial organisations and banks including HSBC and Halifax committed to implementing a voluntary code to help survivors of financial abuse. The code includes training staff and noticing when someone makes unusual or large withdrawals of cash accompanied by their partner.A HSBC spokeswoman said: “Ms Throssell’s story is truly heartbreaking … We were notified the tragic incident had taken place by Ms Throssell’s solicitors and remained in regular correspondence with them regarding the customer’s mortgage with us, waiving all interest and commitments on the mortgage until the property was sold. We have trained all branch staff on how to spot the signs of abuse, and have dedicated procedures in place to help customers regain control of their finances.”Claire says that too frequently, survivors are left destitute as a result of their perpetrator’s behaviour. “It’s essential that these cases are properly investigated and that survivors are not left to pay off huge mortgages and other debts as a consequence of their partner’s abusive behaviour,” she says.Isabelle*, 52, who lives in Swansea, met her husband while on holiday in Cuba in 2006 and says she was coerced into marriage after six months. “I was afraid to say no,” she says. The domestic abuse soon increased. They were together for four years until she left him. Unable to buy a house on her own, a year later she says she “naively” asked him to help her get a mortgage by signing his name to the contract. “I was moving in on my own, buying it, and I paid all the deposit.” But she soon discovered she wouldn’t be living there alone. “He said ‘I’m coming and moving in, you can’t stop me’. If I’m honest, I tried to give it a go, but he assaulted me in 2012, and that led to a conviction for GBH.”They continued to have an on-off relationship but, when she tried to sell the house, he would not let her. “I can’t sell the property as he won’t let me. I pay for everything and should be allowed to sell, but I’m not allowed.”Her ex-partner refused to sign for a new, and lower, mortgage rate when it was due for renewal. “He told me he was going to ruin me,” says Isabelle, a healthcare worker. “I asked Santander to intervene, but they said they could not help me.” The rate was set to increase from 2.99% to 4.9%, forcing her to pay out an extra £180 a month.Santander sent a letter to her husband asking him to sign the paperwork, but he didn’t respond. After much persistence, five months later, eventually Santander intervened and provided a fixed rate for two years. “If someone has got a joint mortgage and only one person is paying, why should they need a second signature? He controls what I pay – it’s another form of control.”While Wendy’s ex no longer controls her biggest outgoing, she wants financial institutions to have a clearer understanding of what financial abuse is, and be more sympathetic. “If the other person is meeting the financial obligations, they should step in,” she says. “You can’t have one paying for everything and then need the signature of the other half who is not contributing.”* Some names have been changed"
‘I’m a law student who works to help mental health charities’,"Lewis Baxter, 21, on how he makes ends meet with his student loan and part-time tutoring work",Suzanne Bearne,2019-10-19T07:00:30+0100,"Name: Lewis Alexander BaxterAge: 21Income: £3,000 plus student loan of £4,500 a yearOccupation: Full-time law student, part-time tutor and organisation founderI’ve just started my second year at Durham University, where I’m studying law. I’m not your typical student: I probably only go out once a week or, more accurately, once every two weeks. I’m not into mad nights out and clubbing. Let’s put it bluntly – if I did have those classic kind of night outs several times a week, I’d have very little money left at the end of the week.At Durham I’ve really had to budget. I work out how much I need every month. I’ve started to use a spreadsheet – my dad loves a spreadsheet. I was sceptical but this year I’ve really got into it. I’ve had to be very frugal. Durham is quite an expensive city, and drinks are costly, so you have to be quite savvy in terms of eating and going out.I receive a student loan of £4,500 a year. I’m living with five lads in a house share half a mile from the city centre, which costs £105 a week each. Fortunately my parents pay for my rent in Durham, which is quite expensive compared with other cities. I pay for the bills, which come to about £15 a month each. We use apps such as Splitwise to work out what we owe if one of us buys a toaster or a kettle or pays a bill.My main living costs are food and drink. I’m super-organised and budget food costs. I spend about £45 a week on my food shop, which is certainly not excessive or extravagant. I might miss lunch occasionally, but that doesn’t matter as I’m trying to lose weight anyway. I love cooking and having friends over. I do shop around for the best deals and check out the products in the reduced section. I treat myself to the occasional meal out at somewhere such as Nando’s.I really like to go travelling. I’ve had two amazing holidays in the past year: I visited Bali and Italy for a week each. This year has been a freak year as it’s been my 21st, and my mum is not very well at all. She’s always said: “When I was 18, I always visited these amazing countries, and if you can afford to go, do it.” Bali cost me about £1,000, but once we were there it was very cheap. When I came back, my bank balance was about £400, so I had to start building up money again.To up my income, I do a bit of tutoring on the side and make about £100 a month from it. I go back to my parents’ in Blackburn every two weeks, and while I’m there I’ll see if anyone wants support or tutoring. I help with subjects like English literature, geography and law. When I was 14 to 18 I worked two nights a week and every Saturday in a restaurant on the minimum wage. I wondered how I could utilise my time better and earn more money.In 2016 I suffered from depression and tried to take my own life several times. I’d been suffering from severe depression for about six months before I found myself standing on a bridge. I was there for four hours with emergency servicemen trying to talk sense into me. It was a torrid time. I ended up starting a new sixth form and shared my story in assembly. Speaking about my mental health for the first time felt really good – lads who played rugby or outwardly had a strong and determined exterior opened up afterwards about their mental health, so I thought maybe I could help more people. Now I give talks about my story to businesses and donate the fees to my organisation, the Blurred Line Group, which I set up this year to help mental health charities with grants and support. Our first event in Lancashire last year raised £7,500. As we’re a startup, there’s not a lot to play around with in terms of cash, and paying for train tickets across the north and down to London for meetings can set me back £60 at times.My five- to 10-year goal is to work for a non-profit organisation. But as soon as I finish my degree I’ll probably go and work in law for a couple of years. I’ve started looking at flats in London and am now starting to save to live there. Moving to London for anyone my age is stressful if they’re not from the capital or the south. I do plan to go into law, and that career path can make a lot of money. But the Blurred Line Group is my baby – I want to watch it grow and develop over time. I want mental health charities and local grassroots initiatives to get the vital funding they need.As told to Suzanne Bearne"
Three network crash affects millions in UK,"Phone network with 10m UK customers apologises for voice, text and data problems",Julia Kollewe,2019-10-17T10:31:51+0100,"Millions of Three UK mobile phone network customers were unable to use their phones after a network meltdown.The company, which has 10 million users in the UK, said the the problem started on Wednesday night and service had started to be returned to some customers on Thursday. The network advised customers to switch their phones off and on again to restore service.Three was unable to say how many customers had been affected or whether they would receive compensation, but admitted that a “significant majority” of users had initially been left without a phone signal or access to data. It said a minority were still affected by Thursday afternoon.The problems started on Wednesday at about 11.30pm after repairs to Three’s 3G network infrastructure.“Following technical difficulties with our services across voice, text and data, some customers will be experiencing an intermittent service,” a Three spokesperson said. “Our engineers are working to fix the issue and the service is returning to normal, and we expect it to be resolved over the course of the day.“We advise our customers to turn their phones off and on or turn airplane mode on and off, which may resolve the issue. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to our customers.”Downdetector, a website that tracks outages across various networks, said it had received reports of problems from thousands of Three users in Manchester, London, Glasgow, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Nottingham, Edinburgh, Bradford and Sheffield.Ofcom, the industry regulator, said it was too soon to say if it would carry out an investigation into the outage. A spokesperson said: “We are aware of the problems experienced by some Three customers. We are speaking to Three to find out what is happening.”The Three website also went down for a number of hours and later carried the message: “ We’re aware of network issues and are working hard to fix them. We know the impact this is having on your day, and we’re sorry. Rest assured, we’ve got our best minds on the job.”Many Three mobile users complained on Twitter they had been unable to make calls or go online for hours and that there had been no communication from the company.@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport so my network and mobile usage I'm paying for has been down for at least 3 hours now with issues earlier today as well. When will it be back up and what compensation will we be receiving? #ThreeUK #Three #ThreeMobileDownAfter a long silence, Three tweeted on Thursday morning:we’re currently experiencing technical difficulties with voice, text and data, meaning some of you will be experiencing intermittent service. please accept our apologies, we’re sorting this out right now. check back here for updatesAdam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, said: “Huge numbers of Three customers have woken up to find they are unable to make calls or use roaming data and will be left feeling angry and frustrated as a result. The mobile operator has to do right by its customers by keeping them informed, ensuring no one is left out of pocket, and we expect those affected by this lengthy lack of service to be compensated.”He added: “The UK is already lagging behind the rest of the world on the provision of 4G. Failures like this will only intensify the pressure on the government, industry and the regulator to up their game and ensure we get a decent service.”Last December rival mobile phone provider O2 promised its 25 million UK customers that they would receive up to two days’ credit in compensation as a goodwill gesture after a UK-wide outage left them unable to get online.Ofcom says on its website: “Depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate for your provider to offer you some money back while repairs are being carried out.” If this takes much longer – for example, if it takes longer than usual to access a mast site to undertake repairs – customers could receive an additional refund or account credit.It adds that customers who have been without service for some time may also have the right to leave their contracts without penalty and should check the terms of their contracts.Ofcom advises consumers to complain to the company directly, but if the complaint is still unresolved after eight weeks, they can submit it to an independent alternative dispute resolution scheme.Which? said: “If you were affected by the Three outage, you can make a consequential loss claim if you can show you incurred reasonable losses and the cause of the outage was a failure to provide the service with reasonable care and skill. You can do this if you are a consumer – for example, if you incurred expenses in order to use internet services for personal reasons.”Businesses may also be able to make a claim if they suffered losses – although not under the Consumer Rights Act – and are advised to check what level of coverage is promised in their contracts."
No1 overall pick Kyler Murray learning new ways to win in the NFL,The Arizona Cardinals quarterback was used to making spectacular plays in college but he has had to adapt to a team with flaws in the pros,Dave Caldwell,2019-10-22T09:00:54+0100,"Kyler Murray has already played NFL games in which he compiled much flashier statistics, and he will surely play many more big games in the future. But stats were not his goal when the Arizona Cardinals played the New York Giants in the rain on Sunday.“I’m not too into the numbers,” Murray said after the Cardinals beat the Giants, 27-21.Murray, the quicksilver quarterback from Oklahoma who was the No1 overall pick in April’s draft, was asked simply to manage the game – to make smart decisions with the football, to make as few mistakes as possible. And that was pretty much what Murray did, a sign that he can also win games with more than either his legs or his arm.“He protected the football, and that won us the game,” Kliff Kingsbury, Arizona’s first-year coach, said of Murray. “Zero turnovers for him, that was a hard deal. It was hard to throw it, and like I said, I didn’t want a ton of that going on, but he protected it well, led the team well, got us in some good checks and won the game, which in this weather for a rookie quarterback on the road, that’s huge.”At 5ft 10in, Murray is small for a quarterback. He passed for only 104 yards against the Giants and rushed for just 28 more, but the Cardinals (3-3-1) efficiently won their third straight game for the first time in four years and matched their victory total for all of last season.Those might seem like modest accomplishments, especially considering that the three lousy teams that the Cardinals defeated (Bengals, Falcons and Giants) have won three of 21 games combined. But Murray and the Cards are trending in the right direction. Playoffs? Probably not. But the Cards have a good quarterback, and some hope.Murray is not a prototypical pocket passer – and he happens to be a pretty good outfielder, having been drafted No9 overall by the Oakland A’s in the 2018 MLB Draft. He got a $4.6m signing bonus from the A’s, but he decided to pursue a pro football career.“He’s a cool kid – hasn’t changed at all,” said DJ Humphries, the Cardinals’ veteran left tackle. “He plays the game the same way he always did.”Murray has only been around for seven NFL games, but he has impressed Kingsbury and his teammates with the way he has taken on such a big load. He has three 300-yard passing games this season, and has not thrown an interception in his last three games.Murray also pledged after the Giants’ game to overcome mental mistakes – he made two during Sunday’s game. First, he took a 15-yard sack, back to the Cardinals’ four-yard line, after evading two tackles but trying to make a play instead of throwing the ball away. It led to a blocked punt and a Giants’ touchdown. Then, after the Giants had used their last time out, Murray was forced out of the pocket but ran out of bounds, stopping the clock with two minutes and 13 seconds left. The Cards kicked a field goal to extend their lead to 27-21, but the Giants had one more chance to win the game.“I should have told him not to step out,” Kingsbury said. “It was a bad play call, and I didn’t even give him a heads up like, ‘Hey, make sure you stay in bounds if it’s not there,’ so that was on me.”But Murray said: “That was my fault. That was terrible. That was bad by me. But we’ll be better next week.”This has not been a solo reclamation project, though. The Cardinals were a bottom-three team in defense entering the Giants game, but they forced three turnovers. Their star running back David Johnson was injured, but the reserve Chase Edmonds rushed for 126 yards.Murray is still very much the catalyst of the Cardinals’ so-called “Air Raid” attack. The Cardinals don’t huddle much, and they line up in shotgun formation on virtually every play, with Murray attempting to wear down opposing defenses with sideline passes galore. He threw 137 passes in the Cardinals’ first three games. He threw just one deep pass against the Giants.“We just have been adjusting each and every week, getting better each and every week, coming to work and just trying to get better, honestly,” Murray said. “I think we fixed some of those things that we were messing up on earlier in the year. I think you see we’re playing more complementary football. Guys bought in. Guys are trusting each other. We’re just really all in it and doing whatever it takes to win.”Not that it seemed to matter, but Murray also won the match-up of two first-round rookie quarterbacks with vastly different physiques and styles. Daniel Jones, the 6ft foot 5in, 220-pounder from Duke, had an interception and was responsible for both the Giants’ lost fumbles.Giants fans, soaked to the bone and detecting a hopeless cause, started leaving at the end of the third quarter, even though the Cardinals led by only 10 points. Although the Giants still had a chance to win, the stadium was all but empty in the final minutes.Murray had indeed failed to roll up big numbers, but “he was able to find a way to get a win,” the veteran Arizona wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald said.The Cardinals play the Saints next, then the 49ers, who have a superb defense. So this tidy little run that the Cards have going may be over soon. Murray seems to be enjoying himself. He says he is paying little attention to what is going on in baseball, anyway.“It’s hard to watch. I kind of get the updates. I saw that Altuve hit the home run,” he said, referring to Jose Altuve’s blast that won the American League Championship Series for the Houston Astros. “Other than that, I don’t really watch the game too much.”"
NBA 2019-20 predictions: The rise of Los Angeles and the era of the super duos,Who will fill the power vacuum left by a weakened Warriors? Can anything stop Zion Williamson from becoming rookie of the year? Our writers have their say,Hunter Felt,2019-10-22T09:00:54+0100,"How things shake out in Los Angeles. The Lakers brought in LeBron James last season and still missed the postseason, so this time around they traded for Anthony Davis. They had hoped to add Kawhi Leonard and become the new Golden State Warriors. Then the Clippers not only added Leonard but Paul George. Now the Lakers may not even be the best team in their own building. HFThe end of the superteam era means the first legitimately wide-open title race in years. The star-studded paradigm favored by the Celtics, Heat and Warriors over the last decade has given way to a two-star model co-opted by more than a dozen NBA teams. Increased league-wide parity promises an improved nightly product and a much-needed injection of suspense at the business end. BAGDuos. The regular season will mirror the offseason, with the NBA’s best duos dominating the headlines in the same way they did this summer. Leonard and George with the Clippers, James and Davis with the Lakers and James Harden and Russell Westbrook with the Rockets are just a few of the superstar combinations that are sure to own the months to come. DPInjuries. Every team is one bad spill away from watching their championship dreams swirl down the drain. Take the 2019 NBA finals, for example, when Golden State lost Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson to back-to-back injuries, greatly interfering with their hopes of beating Toronto. Talent is nothing without health. MRCan I give a 0/10? If NBA commissioner Adam Silver is telling the truth about resisting China’s demands to force Daryl Morey out from his role as GM for the Houston Rockets for tweeting in support of anti-government protestors in Hong Kong, feel free to bump this up to a 3/10 for taking at least one clear stand. Strike me as not giving the commissioner the benefit of the doubt on this one. HF7/10. The controversy has in many ways awakened the broader public to the scale of Chinese censorship – and the degree to which US corporations are willing to play along with it in pursuit of their bottom lines. The NBA has shown it’s no different than the countless other American corporations who have bowed to Beijing in recent years, but Silver has done an admirable job by standing steadfastly behind his players. BAG3/10. The NBA took a benign tweet and turned it into an international fiasco. Representatives at every level of the NBA overreacted, as LeBron, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and Silver all scolded Morey and created a media firestorm. DP7/10. The NBA learned that it can’t have it both ways. In Silver’s first statement he toed the line, angering many people who thought he was supporting a totalitarian regime which happens to generate huge revenues for the league. After the backlash, he released another statement clarifying that the league supports free expression, later adding that Money won’t be disciplined. With millions on the line, Silver was in a tough position – but he ended up doing the right thing. MRIf the Brooklyn Nets were getting a healthy Durant alongside Kyrie Irving, they would have a case. But Durant’s likely out for the entire season, so it’s clearly the Clippers for luring Leonard and George to California. HFThe Clippers’ splashy acquisitions of Leonard and George could go down as the best summer for any NBA team since the Miami Heat signed Chris Bosh and James in 2010. The addition of a lengthy superstar wing player who can create for himself or his teammates off the dribble, make threes and play lockdown defense would have been enough to lift the longtime Los Angeles afterthoughts into the title conversation. Adding two of them, while managing to retain their depth, makes them overnight frontrunners in a loaded Western Conference. BAGIt would be utterly insane to argue in favor of any team other than the Clippers. Leonard’s decision to skip town on the Raptors and link up with the Clippers’ veterans was a win from the jump. The surprise addition of George took things over the edge, separating their summer from the rest of the pack in one of the biggest off-seasons in recent memory. DPThe Clippers secured the biggest free-agent on the market in Leonard and also acquired George. That’s enough to transform a team that have never made it past the second round of the playoffs in their 49-year franchise history into instant title contenders. Leonard led the Raptors to their first-ever championship last season, perhaps he could do the same thing this year with the former laughing stocks of the league. MRThe Boston Celtics will have a better record this season than they did last year despite the losses of Irving and Al Horford. The Celtics won’t be able to replace everything Horford gave them but Kemba Walker could end up being a better fit for the Celtics than Irving, even if he’s somewhat of a downgrade at point guard. HFLonzo Ball wins the Most Improved Player Award. The No 2 pick in the 2017 draft has resurfaced with the Pelicans after a pair of injury-hit seasons with the Lakers and he should thrive away from the drama and pressure of playing alongside LeBron. New Orleans has some interesting pieces in place, and it all should add up to plenty of opportunities for Ball to shine in his natural point guard role. BAGKyrie Irving will be a perfect teammate. Many are expecting the Nets’ newest member to cause a talented team to crumble from the inside out. But I think Irving learned a lot about himself and the potential pitfalls that leaders face in the locker room and in front of the media last season. Irving has close friends around him in Kevin Durant and DeAndre Jordan and a strong leadership in Kenny Atkinson and Sean Marks. We can expect Irving to play just as well on the court and comport himself much better off it. DPDon’t count out the Warriors. Sure, Durant bolted and Thompson is out at least until February with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, leaving the Warriors with a 47.5-point scoring hole. But Stephen Curry is in top shape and D’Angelo Russell is awfully talented too. Not to mention, the team needed a challenge after five-straight NBA finals appearances and three championships. No more going through the motions. MRZion Williamson has this one locked up if – and it turns out this could be a big if – he’s healthy and doesn’t miss more time once he’s back from the knee surgery that has ruled him out for the start of the season. Expect the New Orleans Pelicans to be extremely cautious with the Future of the Franchise, but here’s hoping that we aren’t denied what could be a rookie season of the ages. HFZion Williamson’s bully ball won’t immediately translate to the NBA, so I expect the No 1 pick to endure some growing pains as a rookie. He’s also surrounded by an intriguing mix of young and veteran talent, which could make it difficult for him to stand out even if he plays 30 minutes a night. Instead look to Ja Morant, who put up PlayStation-like numbers at Murray State and will get plenty of opportunity running the point for the rebuilding Memphis Grizzlies. BAGZion Williamson. A rare lock in a season that is otherwise impossible to predict. Williamson’s game is built for New Orleans, a team full of young guards who are sure to get up and down the floor. If preseason and Summer League serve as any indication, Williamson will be productive and efficient every night. DPZion Williamson. Barring his knee injury causing problems down the line, Williamson should make an immediate impact on the league when he returns to action. He’s strong, agile and unstoppable around the hoop. MRGiannis Antetokounmpo. If Zach Lowe says he’s going back-to-back, who am I to argue? The Bucks star’s main rival should be Davis, but it’s hard to get the votes when you’re on the same team as LeBron James. HFStephen Curry. The best shooter in the history of basketball first earned the NBA’s highest individual honor in 2015, then became the first-ever unanimous winner in 2016. Only Curry’s willingness to accept a scaled-back role to accommodate the addition of Durant loosened his stranglehold on the trophy. But with Durant out of the picture and Thompson sidelined all or part of the year with an ACL injury, Golden State will be relying on Curry more than ever – and his numbers will reflect it. BAGThe Lakers wanted Anthony Davis as badly as he wanted them. The worst kept secret in the NBA paired Davis with one of the best passers in league history, LeBron James. While they have two of the most transcendent basketball players in history, the Lakers are still top heavy and they’ll need career years from Davis and James. If the Lakers are to make good on their lofty expectations, Davis must be the best player in Los Angeles – and the league. DPLeBron James. We all know the saying ‘Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.’ Well, I believe that saying – gender notwithstanding – now applies to a certain 6ft 8in, 250lbs player from Akron. He missed the playoffs last season with the Lakers after eight-straight finals appearances. Not reaching the postseason was embarrassing for the four-time MVP, and you better believe he’ll be playing with a chip on his behemoth shoulders this time around.

BAGMilwaukee Bucks 4-3 Philadelphia 76ers. DPPhiladelphia 76ers 4-2 Milwaukee Bucks. MRLA Clippers 4-2 Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks were the best team in the East last season but they lost to Leonard and the Toronto Raptors in the Conference finals. Leonard’s in the West now, which means their biggest challengers in the East are an oddly-constructed Philadelphia 76ers team and whatever the post-Kyrie Boston Celtics end up being. The bad news? They may end up facing Leonard again eventually. The Clippers will have a tougher road to the finals, but if they make it they will have a clear advantage over whoever comes out of the East. HFPhiladelphia 76ers 4-3 LA Clippers. The superteam era may be over but Philadelphia may have the closest thing resembling one. The Sixers lost Jimmy Butler in free agency but added Josh Richardson and the still-underrated Al Horford to a lineup that includes Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. This is a team that’s built their identity around size, versatility and defense and one of the few outfits equipped to counter the Clippers’ two superstar wings. One year after pushing Kawhi and the Raptors to the limit in a seven-game Eastern Conference semi-final thriller, look for Philadelphia to go further and capture their first NBA title since 1983. BAGLA Clippers 4-2 Milwaukee Bucks. With the Warriors’ dominance drawing to a close, this season feels like one of the hardest to predict. The star power is heavy across the league but so are the issues. The Clippers, Warriors and Nets have injury issues, the Lakers and Bucks have short rotations and the 76ers and Nuggets are still green. Equipped with the best stars and the strongest supporting cast, the Clippers are essentially my pick by default. DPLA Clippers 4-3 Philadelphia 76ers. Leonard and George are going to be an incredible duo, and they’re going to be hungry. Coached by Doc Rivers, this team is going to go far. As for the 76ers, it’s quite tough to bet against a team that added Horford to a roster with Simmons and Embiid. It will be an exciting series, with the Clippers coming out on top. MR"
OnePlus 7T Pro review: the best kind of deja vu,"Still an absolute beast in every way, even if it’s just a minor update to an already cracking smartphone",Samuel Gibbs,2019-10-22T07:01:16+0100,"The OnePlus 7T Pro is an update to the best phone of the first half of 2019 and the good news is that they haven’t messed up, with tweaks that make it just as good, if not better, than the model it replaces.The bad news is that the updated phone starts at £50 more than its predecessor, at £699, although as it also comes with more storage and RAM; in effect it matches the cost of the earlier mid-range 7 Pro version. It also gains a faster processor, an improved camera and a slightly tweaked paint job.The star of the show is the 6.67in 90Hz QHD+ AMOLED screen, which is just as stunning as it was five months ago. Once you get used to the smoothness of 90Hz display it’s very difficult to go back.The popup selfie camera removes any notch at the top, while the bezels are still thin all round, with curved sides reaching a slim metal band at the sides and a curved glass back. It’s an attractive, incredibly modern-looking design with excellent build quality.The 7T Pro is just as big and heavy as its predecessor: 206g, 162.6mm tall, 75.9mm wide and 8.8mm thick. While much more manageable than Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max (77.8mm wide, 226g) the 7T Pro is still a beast that is right on the limit of usability – those with smaller hands will struggle. The 7T may only be a little bit smaller with its 6.55in screen (74.4mm wide, 190g) but the difference is palpable.Flip the phone over and you’re treated to a slightly lighter but equally gorgeous shade of blue for the glass back. There’s also a new laser focus patch to the left of the vertical camera lump. The USB-C socket in the bottom is the only input for charging or connecting wired headphones.Screen: 6.67in 90Hz QHD AMOLED (516ppi)Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+RAM: 8GB of RAMStorage: 256GB (UFS 3.0)Operating system: OxygenOS 10 based on Android 10Camera: triple rear camera 48MP, 16MP ultra-wide angle, 8MP telephoto, 16MP front-facing cameraConnectivity: LTE, dual sim, Wi-Fiac, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPSDimensions: 162.6 x 75.9 x 8.8mmWeight: 206gThe OnePlus 7T Pro is faster on paper than its predecessor, with Qualcomm’s slightly newer Snapdragon 855+ chip, which has 15% faster graphics and a slightly faster processor.Whether anyone will be able to tell remains to be seen. The OnePlus 7 Pro was already the fastest-feeling phone available, and the 7T Pro is no different, powering through things with an immediacy unrivalled by anything else on the market.There are two versions available. The standard, widely available 7T Pro comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. A McLaren Edition, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, as well as a new black and orange paint job, will also be available in limited quantities.All that speed is backed up by solid battery life of about 32 hours between charges – four hours longer than the OnePlus 7 Pro and enough to last from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two.That was as my primary device, with the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, lots of browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, watching 50 minutes of Into the Badlands on Amazon Prime Video and shooting about 10 photos a day.Despite the glass back, there’s still no wireless charging. Instead, OnePlus has reduced the internal resistance of the battery to make it charge even faster, hitting 70% in 34 minutes and full in just under 70 minutes.The 7T Pro ships out of the box with OxygenOS 10, based on the latest version of Android 10, making it one of the first phones to do so, just like the 7T.OxygenOS continues to set the standard for custom versions of Android from third-party manufacturers, focused on refinement and speed. Full theming support for changing the colour and shape of screens, icons and boxes, including a full dark mode, is new for this version. But it is Google’s new swiping navigation gestures, replacing the custom ones used by OnePlus on previous phones, that are the biggest improvement.Swipe up on a bar at the bottom of the screen to go home, up and hold for recently used apps, or left or right to jump to a previously used app. A swipe in from the left or right side in the lower two-thirds of the screen is now used for going back, which is a vast improvement, making using large-screen phones much easier.The traditional three-button Android navigation bar is available if gestures aren’t your thing. New privacy controls for location data are also welcome.OnePlus offers software support for at least three years from release, including two years of Android version updates and then a further year of security updates on a bi-monthly schedule.The 7T Pro has an even faster version of OnePlus’s excellent in-display optical fingerprint reader, which continues to set the standard for speed and accuracy, matching traditional capacitive sensors and putting everyone else to shame.The 7T Pro has the same triple camera system, combining a 48-megapixel main, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera, as its predecessor and performs similarly.The primary camera is great, capable of capturing some really good, finely detailed and well-exposed shots that aren’t too far away from what you get from the very best on the market. Low-light performance was solid. A revamped version of OnePlus’s Night Scape proved to be more effective and can now be used on the ultra-wide angle camera too.The 3x telephoto camera (which is technically 2.87x rounded up) is also good, but produces noticeably more noise in dull lighting than the main camera. It has optical image stabilisation and 1x more magnification than the cheaper 7T.The 10x digital zoom rivals the best, but isn’t in the same league as Huawei’s 50x zoom. The ultra-wide angle camera was great fun, and the 7T Pro also gains OnePlus’s new super macro mode. Focusing on objects at a minimum of 2.5cm away takes a bit of practice but you can produce some really interesting images, rich in detail the human eye can’t see on its own.Video quality was generally pretty good too, but could be a little yellow in indoor lighting. The popup 16-megapixel fixed-focus selfie camera was also capable of capturing some great, detail-rich images.OnePlus’s excellent alert slider toggles between silent, vibrate and ringThe stereo speakers are some of the bestA screen protector comes pre-applied, while a good clear plastic case is included in the boxThe OnePlus 7T Pro costs £699 in haze blue with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The McLaren Edition with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costs £799.For comparison, the OnePlus 7T costs £549, the Huawei P30 Pro costs £749, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ costs £999 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149.The OnePlus 7T Pro is the best kind of deja vu: an exact copy of arguably the best smartphone of the first half of 2019 with an improved camera, slightly longer battery life and a slightly faster processor.Whether an update was really required is debatable, but OnePlus has made a name for itself with this rapid, six-month refresh schedule.The camera’s new macro mode is great fun and can produce some spectacular images. Android 10’s new gestures have made handling the phone easier, the fingerprint scanner is even faster and having the very latest Snapdragon 855+ processor keeps the 7T Pro at the top of the pile on paper, even if the difference is hard to see.The 7T Pro starts at £50 more than its predecessor, but also comes with more storage and RAM, matching the cost of the mid-range 7 Pro version.It still has the downsides of its predecessor too: there’s no water resistance rating, no wireless charging, no expandable storage or headphone socket, the camera is good, but not quite iPhone 11 Pro standards, and it’s massive and fairly heavy. But that gigantic, gorgeous, fast and notch-free screen is still something to behold and the curved glass and metal band make it just about manageable.Class-leading performance, extremely fast charging and a battery that’ll last 32 hours round out a device that still undercuts rivals and offers a better experience in almost every way. The biggest challenge to the 7T Pro is actually OnePlus’s cheaper (£549), smaller 7T, which offers much the same but is easier to handle.If you want the biggest, best screen, in the fastest, slickest device, that’s the OnePlus 7T Pro. A massive phone still worth stretching for.Pros: stunning screen, superfast performance, fast in-screen fingerprint reader, good battery life, superfast charging, dual sim, good camera, great software, alert sliderCons: glass back but no wireless charging, no IP water resistance rating, no expandable storage, no headphone socket, big and heavyBest smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and rankedSamsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screenSamsung Galaxy Note 10+ review: bigger and now with a magic wandApple iPhone 11 Pro Max review: salvaged by epic battery lifeHuawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery lifeFairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Google to add eye detection to Pixel 4 after privacy concerns,Update will prevent new smartphone being unlocked using owner’s sleeping face,Alex Hern,2019-10-21T13:35:43+0100,"Google has said it will update its new Pixel 4 phones to prevent them being unlocked using the sleeping faces of their owners.The phones, which are not yet in shops, are the first from Google to include a secure face unlock feature, in place of the fingerprint sensor used on previous iterations. The feature is also used to confirm payments and sign in to apps.Unlike the similar feature on iPhones, FaceID, the Pixel face unlock does not require the user to be looking at the phone – or even to have their eyes open.The operating system warns users that “your phone can be unlocked by someone else if it’s held up to your face, even if your eyes are closed”.Google has announced an update that will offer a more secure option. “We’ve been working on an option for users to require their eyes to be open to unlock the phone, which will be delivered in a software update in the coming months,” it told technology website The Verge.“In the meantime, if any Pixel 4 users are concerned that someone may take their phone and try to unlock it while their eyes are closed, they can activate a security feature that requires a pin, pattern or password for the next unlock.”Google’s initial decision was based on a tradeoff between speed and security, with the company focusing more on speed than Apple had when it launched its competing system in 2017 alongside the iPhone X.Apple pointed out that FaceID required user attention to work, preventing what one reporter called the “girlfriend nap” attack, when a suspicious partner could try to unlock the phone of their sleeping partner."
"Tinder boss Elie Seidman: ‘If you behave badly, we want you out’",The dating app has become the go-to tool for singles looking for a ‘hook-up’ rather than a relationship. Its chief executive reckons it can broaden its appeal – but will have to get tough with some users,Alex Hern,2019-10-20T14:00:55+0100,"Swipe right for “would like to meet”, left for “wouldn’t”. Seven years after Tinder made choosing a date as simple as flicking your thumb across a smartphone screen, it is by far the most-used dating app in the UK and the US. Downloaded 300m times and with more than 5 million paying subscribers, it is the highest-grossing app of any kind in the world, according to the analysts App Annie. For Americans, apps and online dating are the most common way to meet a partner. “It’s an amazing responsibility, and an amazing privilege,” says Elie Seidman, Tinder’s 45-year-old chief executive. If he finds it less daunting than others might, that’s because, before he took over Tinder in 2018, he was in charge of OkCupid, the Tinder of the 00s. He has spent much of his working life helping people to find love.“The vast majority of our employees are energised by that very mission,” he says. “We’re not selling plumbing supplies, right? Obviously, plumbing is really important, but ours is a really noble and exciting mission. So, when we’re taking new risks – new challenges, new chances – we know that, if we’re successful, it’s about helping members connect.”At times, though, it has felt as if Tinder has chased that goal with too much passion. Launching on college campuses, before expanding to New York, London and then everywhere, Tinder rapidly gained a reputation as less of a dating app and more of a “hook-up” app: laser-focused at finding users a match as quickly as possible, with minimal fuss between opening the app and getting lucky.In its early days, Tinder leaned into this reputation. Perhaps the most notorious feature was the introduction of a secret “Elo ranking”, a term borrowed from the chess world to describe a way to score people based on their previous matches. With the Tinder version, your score went up a lot if hot people swiped right on you; if ugly people swiped left on you, it went down just as much. Whether or not your matches were hot was based on their own Elo ranking, and so on.Matching hot people to hot people felt like the purest distillation of what Tinder was – and a good summation of the often bro-filled atmosphere in the office in the early days. (This approach continues to shake out in messy legal battles between cofounders, with allegations of sexual harassment blending with claims of share-price manipulation.) In hindsight, Seidman says, this approach was a mistake. Now, rather than how hot a person might be perceived to be, it’s how often they use the app that takes priority – that and location, which, Seidman points out, is hardly an innovation. “My father has a story from when he was growing up in Queens. He was dating a woman who lived on the Upper East Side. She broke up with him because he was ‘geographically undesirable’. So the idea of long commutes being a thing, we see that very clearly. The other one’s age, right? People absolutely filter on age. They also filter on sexual orientation, not surprisingly.”When it comes to the systemic – almost species-level – effects of Tinder, Seidman is happy. “The relationships are much more diverse,” he says, citing a 2017 study from Cornell University which argued that the rise in online dating had resulted in an increase in mixed-race marriages in the US. “For human history, right, we meet people down the street – you know, a mile away, two miles away, church, work, school – and all of a sudden the breadth that you get has been totally changed. That’s a profound shift and a good one.”And, he adds: “The quality of the relationships and the connections that are being made by all accounts is as good or better, according to the University of Chicago.” A 2013 study found that couples who meet online “have happier, longer marriages”.More diverse, happier, longer relationships is certainly a something for the company to boast about. But for many users, these possibilities aren’t worth the stress of using Tinder day-to-day.The app, like most dating services, has many more male users than female users. According to the analytics firm App Ape, more than three-quarters are men – a disparity that is bad for everyone. Men complain about being ignored or mocked when they do get matched with a date. They are the main target of Tinder’s revenue drives, with paid services such as Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold offering users the ability to promote themselves to the top of their likers’ queues and highlight their profiles to others. (Tinder settled a class-action suit this year over age-discriminatory pricing for these features. It had been charging older users more for the same tools.)We’re better at it than we were two or three years ago. It is much harder to misbehave and stay on TinderBut women have it worse. Even putting aside Margaret Atwood’s observation that men worry that women will laugh at them, while women worry that men will kill them, the misogyny on Tinder is the stuff of legend. One 2016 study, from Manchester Metropolitan University, found that straight men who feel “let down” after finding a date was less attractive than her picture saw it as “a licence to use their date as they saw fit”. Meanwhile, dick pics, solicited and otherwise, are so ubiquitous that they are inspiring art. Francesca Harris, a student at the University of Nottingham, used the app to solicit more than 300 (and one headshot of Donald Trump) for her fine-art degree show project, entitled The Modern Male.“We have a really, really, really clear view,” Seidman says, “which is that people who are awful need to be removed from these apps. We have a ton of work in our trust and safety group between tech and people – massive teams of moderators benefiting from AI. We have things in the app to educate people about how to behave. So we’re coming at it from a lot of angles. If you have behaved badly, we want you out – and we want you out as quickly as possible.”Seidman says Tinder’s record has improved. “Without getting into lots of specific details about metrics, which I won’t divulge, we’re much, much, much better at it than we were two or three years ago. It is much harder to misbehave and stay on Tinder.”But if Tinder is getting better at spotting abusive behaviour, and turfing perpetrators off the platform, what about the other side: are people learning to behave better in the first place? “What’s clear is that if you grow up in a world where you are accustomed to digital social – you were on Fortnite with your friends or your friends of friends, or you did FaceTime with your aunt or your grandmother when you were a kid – you don’t think of the digital world as a different world, one where the rules of decorum and the norms of behaviour that we take for granted in a bar or a restaurant just go out the window. It’s not an alternate universe. It’s a part of real life. Every next set of 18- and 19- and 20-year-olds who join Tinder have grown up in a different environment in terms of digital social life.”That generational shift, Seidman says, is crucial to understanding Tinder’s very visual skew, which differentiates it from older services such as OkCupid and has been blamed for the “shallow” nature of the connections it leads to. On OkCupid, when Seidman started, users were asked to fill in enormous questionnaires. An algorithm then purported to match them to those most compatible based on anything from big life choices to opinions on blockbuster movies. On Tinder, by contrast, the basic question is simpler: “Is this person hot?”Seidman argues that this shift is, in part, just a reflection of the changing nature of technology. “The internet has become vastly more visual over the past 20 years, right?” Smartphones played a big part in this because they made it so much easier to upload photos. In fact, if you can remember the net before smartphones, Tinder may well not be for you. Half of the app’s users are under 25 (and, Seidman emphasises, over 18), and signing up for an account as you arrive at university is virtually a rite of passage for Gen Z. With that comes new ambitions.The core of the Tinder interface, with its pictures and swiping, is, Seidman says, designed to replicate the “click” that two people get when they lock eyes for the first time, only in a way that works for a generation that has already used to the idea of socialising online. So what next? The first date. “To what extent can we get the elements, the quality elements of a first date to happen digitally? The thing people are struggling with, is: ‘OK, I’ve got this match. How can I figure out if we’re going to like each other. Do we have anything to talk about? Can we connect and, you know, how’s our chemistry?’ Right? And so can we get more of what you would get and figure out on our first date?”The company’s first exploration into answering those questions is … odd. Swipe Night, running every Sunday in October, is Tinder’s first original video production. As in the Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch, viewers get to pick how the story progresses. Unlike Bandersnatch, they get matched with others on the platform who picked similar outcomes. “We’re saying: ‘Hey, not only is it connections that you make, but we think that the shared experience as a community – of coming together – is a really special one. We think that shared experiences as a community of people is a powerful, important and ancient idea – and it shouldn’t go away.’”As long as those shared experiences don’t involve unwanted dick pics, he may have a point."
Erdoğan threatens to ramp up assault on Kurds in Syria 'safe zone',Turkish leader says he will act ‘even more strongly’ as end of US-brokered ceasefire looms,Bethan McKernan,2019-10-22T12:12:50+0100,"The Turkish president has threatened to press ahead with an operation against Kurdish-led forces in Syria “even more strongly” if promises made by the US regarding the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters have not been met by the time a five-day ceasefire expires.Up to 1,300 fighters from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are yet to vacate Ankara’s proposed border “safe zone”, as per the terms of a ceasefire announced by the US vice-president, Mike Pence, in Ankara last week, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told reporters before flying to Russia.Erdoğan is meeting Vladimir Putin in Sochi on Tuesday for talks expected to focus on the size and scope of the planned buffer zone before the pause in fighting ends at 10pm local time (1900 GMT).Turkish troops, allied Syrian rebel proxies, the SDF, and soldiers belonging to both the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and his Russian allies are all now present in the border area after Donald Trump announced he would withdraw US troops, paving the way for Ankara to launch an attack on the SDF on 9 October.As a result of the Turkish offensive, Syria’s Kurdish officials struck a deal with Assad, their former enemy, for military reinforcements in the border area.Trump’s withdrawal of the remaining 1,000 US special forces from Kurdish-held Syria means Moscow and Ankara have emerged as the two main foreign players in Syria’s long war.Russia has previously demanded that Turkey respect Syria’s territorial integrity. Putin is likely to seek commitments from Erdoğan on Tuesday.“The most important thing for us is achieving long-term stability in Syria and the region,” President Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said ahead of the talks on Tuesday. “We believe this can only be achieved by restoring the unity of Syria.”Despite the ceasefire, intermittent fighting between the SDF and Ankara’s Syrian rebel proxies has continued.Kino Gabriel, the SDF spokesman, confirmed over the weekend that all its fighters had evacuated the town of Ras al-Ayn, one of the two border towns bearing the brunt of the Turkish attack, as part of the US-brokered pause.Redur Khalil, a senior SDF official, also said that following the evacuation of the remaining civilians and fighters from Ras al-Ayn, his fighters would pull back from the strip of land between the town and Tel Abyad, which is also under Turkish attack.Ankara has stuck to its original proposal of a 270-mile long (440km), 20-mile deep buffer zone, but the SDF has only acknowledged the 75-mile area between Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad.The US-brokered agreement struck last Thursday did not specify the zone’s size. Previous agreements between Washington and Ankara over a “safe zone” along the Syria-Turkish border have floundered over diverging definitions of the area.Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria, which effectively green-lighted the Turkish attack, has been widely condemned as a betrayal of the US’s military partner in the five-year-long campaign to defeat Islamic State.Ankara, however, has long maintained that the main Kurdish unit within the SDF is indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which has waged war against the Turkish state for decades."
Canada elections: Trudeau wins narrow victory to form minority government,Liberals secure four more years in power despite lingering criticism over handling of corruption inquiry and blackface scandal,Leyland Cecco,2019-10-22T10:19:32+0100,"Justin Trudeau has won a second term as Canada’s prime minister after the country’s federal election, but his narrow victory means he will lead a minority government that will be forced to depend on other parties to govern.With results still trickling in on Tuesday morning, the Liberals had 156 seats, 14 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons.“We seek hardship for none and prosperity for all, and if we unite around these common goals, I know we can achieve them,” Trudeau told cheering supporters in Montreal. He said Canadians had sent a clear message of support for progressive policies.Thank you, Canada, for putting your trust in our team and for having faith in us to move this country in the right direction. Regardless of how you cast your vote, our team will work hard for all Canadians.Despite Trudeau’s attempt to strike a conciliatory tone, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer issued a stark warning to the Liberals. “Mr Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready, and we will win,” Scheer told supporters at his concession speech.Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Trudeau for “a wonderful and hard-fought victory”. Although the two leaders have not had a warm relationship – Trump described Trudeau as “dishonest” at last year’s disastrous G7 meeting in Quebec – the US president tweeted: “Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries!”Four years after the Liberal leader swept to power promising “sunny ways” after nearly a decade of Conservative rule, Trudeau struggled to inspire voters as he campaigned for re-election.Trudeau, 47, was endorsed by Barack Obama in the last days of the campaign, but his standing as one of the few remaining progressive leaders in a major democracy was undermined by the emergence of blackface images, and lingering criticism of his handling of a major corruption inquiry.Before the vote, polls showed him neck-and-neck with Scheer. But with neither of the main parties reaching the number of seats needed for a parliamentary majority, Canada is headed towards a minority government, and Trudeau will be forced to co-operate with smaller left-of-centre parties to govern.“We’re seeing a much-needed chastening of the Liberal party,” said David Moscrop, a political scientist at the university of British Columbia. “Some of [the result] is a backlash against Liberal arrogance and entitlements. The Liberals set the bar so high they’re bound to run into it.”In the final week of campaigning, Trudeau faced a strong challenge from the left-wing New Democratic party, led by Jagmeet Singh, which looked poised to peel away progressive votes from the Liberals.But despite a surge in the polls in the final weeks of the campaign, the NDP was unable to convert that success into electoral wins. The party’s 44 seats were nearly cut in half.The overall result laid bare the deep divisions in the country: not a single Liberal was elected in the western Prairie provinces, which the Conservatives swept.Trudeau lost key cabinet members, including veteran lawmaker and public safety minister Ralph Goodale, 70, who was the only Liberal MP in Saskatchewan, where the local energy industry is increasingly at odds with federal environmental policies.In Alberta, Amarjeet Sohi, the natural resource minister, and Randy Boissonnault lost their seats, a result that means the neither Alberta nor Saskatchewan will have representation in Trudeau’s federal government, at a time of growing frustration in the economically strapped western provinces.Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general and justice minister who was expelled from the Liberal party after publicly criticising Trudeau for his role in the SNC Lavalin scandal, was successful in her bid to retain her seat as an independent.The first Indigenous person to hold one of the most powerful positions in government, Wilson-Raybould played a central role in one of the most damaging episodes in Trudeau’s first term of office, when she testified the prime minister and his staff improperly pressured her to abandon the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC Lavalin.After she resisted, she was shuffled out of the position of attorney general and eventually ejected from the party.Jane Philpott, the former treasury board president and close friend of Wilson-Raybould, was also booted from the party for criticising Trudeau. But her attempt as an independent candidate to keep her seat in Ontario failed, with a disappointing third-place finish for the one-time Liberal star.Monday’s result marked a clear defeat for Scheer, whose campaign pledges to quash carbon pricing legislation and cut taxes failed to resonate with voters. The Conservative party also took a heavy loss, with deputy party leader Lisa Raitt losing her race to former Olympic kayaker Adam van Koeverden. Meanwhile, Maxime Bernier, the leader of the populist People’s Party of Canada, which critics have called xenophobic and racist, lost his seat. It means the former Conservative minister’s newly formed party will have no presence in the House of Commons.After his landslide victory in 2015, Trudeau positioned himself as a progressive force in Canada and aboard: he welcomed Syrian refugees when the US and other countries were closing their doors, and he legalized cannabis nationwide.But in a country heavily reliant on natural resources, his efforts to strike a balance on the environment and economy have been criticized by the right and the left. His government brought in a carbon tax to fight the climate crisis – but also paid billions to rescue a stalled pipeline project.Monday’s result marks a significant erosion of support for the charismatic prime minister, but the narrow victory will be enough to ensure Trudeau’s marquee policies – including the national carbon tax – are likely to remain in place.But without his majority, Trudeau will have to reach out to other parties with a “confidence-and-supply” deal in which junior partners will support the government on individual pieces of legislation, as opposed to joining in a fully-fledged coalition.Such a deal will leave the leftwing NDP and the Bloc Québécois holding the balance of power a minority government. The most likely ally for Trudeau is Singh, who has made a commitment to fighting climate change and funding healthcare key requires for co-operation from the NDP."
"Today, I aim to get arrested. It is the only real power climate protesters have","By putting our bodies on the line and risking our liberty, we make this great neglected issue impossible to ignore",George Monbiot,2019-10-16T05:59:08+0100,"A few hours after this column is published, I hope to be in a police cell. I don’t yet know what the charge will be, where I will be arrested or when, but I know that if I go home this evening without feeling the hand of the law on my sleeve, I will have failed. This may sound like a strange ambition, but I believe it is a reasonable one.If I succeed, I will be one of many. In the current wave of Extinction Rebellion protests, more than 1,400 people have so far allowed themselves to be arrested. It’s a controversial tactic, but it has often proved effective. The suffragettes, the Indian salt marchers, the civil rights movement and the Polish and East German democracy movements, to name just a few, all used it as a crucial strategy. Mass arrests are a potent form of democratic protest.They work because they show that the campaigners are serious. When people are prepared to jeopardise their liberty for their cause, other people appear more likely to listen to what they say, and more likely to recognise its importance. Those who founded Extinction Rebellion researched these histories and sought to apply their lessons to the greatest predicament humanity has ever faced - the gathering collapse of our life support systems.Nowhere on Earth does government action match the scale of the catastrophes we face. Part of the reason is the remarkably low level of public discussion and information on this crisis. Another is that the political risks of action are higher than the perceived rewards – a balance the protesters want to redress. But perhaps the most important factor is the brute power of the pollutocrats driving this disaster. As the Guardian’s The polluters series shows, the big fossil fuel companies have used political funding, intense lobbying and gross deceptions of the public to overwhelm environmental protections and keep harvesting their massive profits.Those who confront them have no such power. We cannot buy television channels and newspapers, pour billions into political lobbying or seed dark ads on social media. We have only one strength: our vulnerability. By putting our bodies on the line and risking our liberty, we make this great neglected issue impossible to ignore.So far, the campaign has been remarkably successful. Alongside the youth climate strikes, Extinction Rebellion has changed the global conversation about climate and environmental breakdown. These movements are directly responsible for the declaration of a climate emergency by the UK parliament and many other political bodies. But this is not enough. It is one thing to recognise an emergency, another to act on it. We must do more. I cannot justifiably say “we” if I don’t mean “I”.I know this action will expose me to criticism as well as prosecution. Like other prominent activists, I will be lambasted for hypocrisy: this is now the favoured means of trying to take down climate activists. Yes, we are hypocrites. Because we are embedded in the systems we contest, and life is complicated, no one has ever achieved moral purity. The choice we face is not between hypocrisy and purity, but between hypocrisy and cynicism. It is better to strive to do good, and often fail, than not to strive at all.Other criticisms carry more weight. Extinction Rebellion is too white, and too middle class. Both charges are true, as the organisers recognise: they know that they must do more to break down the cultural barriers the movement unconsciously erects, engage with community leaders, and listen to voices that have not been heard.But I cannot help who I am. I accept that the costs of arrest for people like me – a white, middle-class man with an established career – are lower than for other people. But this means I have a moral duty to use my privilege.The victims of climate breakdown have so far been mostly voiceless and invisible to us. But we know that, even with just 1C of global heating, climate chaos is already a bigger cause of forced migration than either poverty or political oppression. Large numbers of people in Somalia, Mozambique, Bangladesh, the Caribbean, Central America and many other parts of the world are already losing their homes and livelihoods. The poor parts of the world are the least responsible for climate disaster but the most likely to suffer its effects. They carry the cost of our consumption. We have imposed this crisis on others, and must do what we can to curtail it.Since I began writing this article, getting arrested has become easier: the police have imposed a blanket ban on “any assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion autumn uprising” across London. This looks to me like a breach of article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: “Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.” Over the past four decades, the police have acquired an extraordinary array of powers – enabling them, in effect, to shut down any protest. But they deem even these insufficient: at a recent press conference they demanded new “banning orders” for “habitual” protesters. Given that regular protest has proved throughout history to be an essential mechanism for political reform, this looks like a direct attack on democracy.Far from deterring me, the draconian ban this week and the police demand for even greater powers has strengthened my determination. Now I feel I am standing not only for the habitability of the planet but also for the continued right to protest. This is my duty, and I intend to fulfil it.• George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
Donald Trump’s sanity is not the question. The real issue is how he got into office,"To reduce his presidency to a frail mind is to ignore the fact he’s an emblem of free-market, white supremacist nationalism",Gary Younge,2019-10-18T06:00:43+0100,"While writing a New Yorker profile on Donald Trump in the late 1990s, Mark Singer attempted to discover something about the businessman’s private thoughts, as opposed to his outsized, public persona. When Singer asked him what he thought about when shaving in front of the mirror, Trump did not really understand the question.“OK, I guess I’m asking, ‘do you consider yourself ideal company?’” Singer said. “You really want to know what I consider ideal company?” replied Trump. “A total piece of ass.”Divining, assessing and adjudicating the mental health of this US president has become more than just a parlour gameDivining, assessing and adjudicating the mental health of this US president has become more than just a parlour game. Following a 2017 conference, 27 psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental health experts wrote a book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, arguing it was their moral and civic “duty to warn” America that “for psychological reasons”, Trump was “more dangerous than any president in history”. They diagnosed him with everything from “severe character pathology” to “delusional disorder”, which can be added to the more common verdicts of “narcissistic personality disorder” and “antisocial personality disorder” which are regularly offered.His behaviour and comments over the past fortnight would appear to not only confirm these conclusions, but to suggest his condition is deteriorating. There has been the appalling treatment of Harry Dunn’s parents, and his reference to his own “great and unmatched wisdom”. He sent a letter to the Turkish president, Recep Erdoğan, warning him: “Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool. I will call you later.” On Wednesday, in a single press conference with the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, he attacked Google, Amazon, Germany, France, Spain, his guest and the European Union, as well as several US intelligence and law enforcement officials.Later that day, Democratic leaders walked out of a White House meeting with him after he continually insulted them. But not before he told House speaker Nancy Pelosi: “I hate Isis more than you do,” and claimed “I captured Isis … in one month.”As the threat of impeachment leaves him more isolated, and an election he may lose makes him more vulnerable, we can expect more bizarre behaviour and, consequently, more attempts to frame his actions as those of an unstable and unhinged despot. Such depictions are tempting. They should also be resisted.Trump’s state of mind is, of course, relevant. He is the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military forces in the world. He has the nuclear codes. He is impulsive and capricious. He lies constantly, unashamedly and apparently compulsively. It is deeply worrying that the executive powers of the presidency lie in the hands of a man who is at one and the same time so brittle, aggressive, vindictive, ridiculous and self-obsessed. His decision to abandon a longstanding ally in Kurdistan and pull US troops out of Syria, against all military advice, is a case in point.But to reduce his presidency to this – one man and his frail mind – is to ignore how he got there, all he has said and done since he has been there, and how he remains there. (It also risks reducing mental health to a lazy slur.) Just because he believes he will go down in history as a great man doesn’t mean we have to subscribe to the “great man theory of history” – the theory which claims events are moulded not by ordinary people, social movements and economic processes, but by key individuals who stamp their will on the world through force of personality.For along with Trump’s personal frailties is a series of political characteristics that underpins his anomie. He is a misogynist, a racist, a xenophobe and a nationalist. Those are not psychological descriptors but political ones, fortified by systems and ideology.As such, his behaviour has been irascible but hardly erratic. The rhetorical objects of his disdain are not random. He has not lashed out at the National Rifle Association, the religious right or white people. Politically, his tantrums invariably find their mark in the weak, the poor, the dark, the female, the Muslim, the marginalised and the foreigner. (He will attack powerful people, but not simply for existing. They must cross him first.)These inclinations were clear when he stood for the presidency. He has been every bit as bigoted, undisciplined, indiscreet, thin-skinned and braggadocious as his campaign promised. And he won.This was not because people didn’t see those things, but because they either didn’t care, cared about other things more, preferred him to the alternative, or simply didn’t show up. As such, his victory marked a high point for the naked appeal of white supremacy in particular and rightwing populism in general, and a low point for the centre-left, neoliberal agenda.True, he did not win the popular vote, but nonetheless close to 63 million people voted for him. True, his party lost the House of Representatives in the 2018 mid-term elections. But they also gained two seats in the Senate – the first time the party holding the presidency has achieved that since 2002 – in the wake of a synagogue shooting and mail-bomb attacks inspired by his rhetoric. True, more than half of the country wants to impeach him; but about 40% still approve of the job he’s doing. The one thing that stands between him and impeachment is the party behind him in both houses.Even his thuggish “America first” foreign policy stands as part of a tradition. In 1964, when the Greek ambassador tried to point out the shortcomings of the US plan to partition Cyprus, President Lyndon Johnson replied: “Fuck your parliament and your constitution … We pay a lot of good American dollars to the Greeks, Mr Ambassador. If your prime minister gives me talk about democracy, parliament and constitution he, his parliament and his constitution may not last long.” He would never have put that in a letter. But three years later, Greece was under a brutal military junta backed by the US from which it did not emerge for seven years.In other words, this particular form of insanity – if that is what it is – enjoys mass, if not majority, support, institutional defence and historical precedent. It is the mindset of more than just an individual. Trump’s presence serves a purpose and interests. If he is a lone wolf, how do we explain the likes of Boris Johnson or Silvio Berlusconi, who share so many of his “idiosyncratic traits”, from accusations of sexual harassment to a cavalier attitude towards democratic norms and casual racism.“The great man of the age,” wrote Friedrich Hegel – using “great” to mean powerful rather than wonderful – “is the one who can put into words the will of his age, tell his age what its will is, and accomplish it. What he does is the heart and essence of his age; he actualises his age.”As such, in his desire to blame everyone but himself, in his lies, bullying, despotism, insecurity, ineptitude, cheating, scapegoating, preening self-regard, vanity and ignorance, Trump is an emblem of the free-market, white supremacist nationalism that is ascendant in this moment.Ultimately there may be a medical or therapeutic intervention that can help him; but only a political intervention can help us get rid of him.• Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist• This article was amended on 18 October 2019 to correct an indiscrete/indiscreet homophone"
Saving the union will need imagination – and we’ve lost it,"As our common culture disintegrates amid Brexit and globalisation, the chances of holding the country together go down",Aditya Chakrabortty,2019-10-17T06:00:48+0100,"How do some countries tear themselves apart while others keep together? To the most vital question facing the UK the answer, it seems to me, lies in an old book. I can picture its burgundy spine, the black-and-white cover photo of three solemn Asian gentlemen wearing tuxedo jackets and sarongs, and that title so good it is almost a spell: Imagined Communities.Perhaps you know this classic study, for its influence still reverberates nearly 40 years after its first edition. In it, Benedict Anderson analyses how a national identity is manufactured, so that a hunk of rock can inspire men and women to kill or die for it. Prescribed it by a university teacher a quarter-century ago, I felt the thing practically buzzing with timeliness. The Soviet imperial glacier had broken apart, and politicians and pundits assumed the world’s future lay in the nation state. Yet Anderson argued that what nationalists saw as ageless and undeniable was to scholars modern and confected. The nation, he wrote, “is an imagined political community” – a collective waking dream fed by comparatively recent technology, such as books in the vernacular language and common consumption of the same media. Reading the same newspapers as one’s neighbours on the train or in the barbers reassured citizens that their “imagined world is visibly rooted in everyday life”.Every nation state stands on the brink of death; keeping it alive requires constant reaffirmation. And while the late Anderson focused on Asia, his argument applied equally to the land of warm beer and old maids cycling to communion. In her history, Britons, Linda Colley nailed Great Britain as “an invented nation superimposed, if only for a while, on to much older alignments and loyalties”.If only for a while. That clock has been ticking, and the time is nearly up. What was proclaimed in 1707 the “one united kingdom by the name of Great Britain” is slowly crumbling into pieces before our eyes. Chip! This week it is Nicola Sturgeon promising Scots another independence referendum by next Christmas. Chip! Last week it was a Telegraph column asking whether Britain really needed Northern Ireland.The same bunch of spivs, blimps and yahoos chuntering on this week about making Britain great again are more likely to shrink it, making the country smaller than at any time since the Stuart dynasty. Weeks before the 2016 referendum, the then prime minister David Cameron warned that Brexit meant national “disintegration”. This summer his predecessor, Gordon Brown, said: “The union is today more at risk than at any time in 300 years.” When it finally comes, the proximate cause of the UK’s demise will be easily ascribed: it will be death by hard Brexit. However deep the warm bath of mutual congratulation sunk into by commentators and backbenchers at potentially seeing off a no-deal Brexit, it doesn’t hide the ugliest truths. Westminster is still heading out of Europe, and Boris Johnson’s proposed deal is harder and worse than the one punted by Theresa May. Failing to agree on anything apart from the disaster of crashing out of the EU, the rebel alliance has won a battle yet stands to be utterly routed in the war.All that’s left now is the most negative way to hold together a nation: an imagined enemyIf Brown shares just one thing with Labour’s current leadership, it is this: both calculate that the Scottish nationalists will win a landslide at the next general election, spurring Sturgeon to demand a new referendum that Westminster will find near-impossible to deny her. And if remain-voting Scotland goes its own way, it will make the Brexit maelstrom look like a passing shower. Westminster’s relationship with the EU goes back four decades. The union with Scotland stretches back three centuries. At Stormont, the political arithmetic is far harder, but politicians there must be taking legal advice on whether the framework of the Good Friday agreement allows Northern Ireland to leave the UK and rejoin the EU.Signs of this were visible even in the hours after the 2016 vote, but the recklessness with which the Tory party has behaved since has made it only more likely. Look no further than Johnson, who spent decades at the Telegraph sneering at the “Jocks”, their hands outstretched for pocket money from “Uncle Sugar” down in Westminster. As London mayor, he declared: “A pound spent in Croydon is of far more value to the country than a pound spent in Strathclyde.”No wonder that when Scottish Conservatives battled this summer to block Johnson from becoming party leader they adopted the codename of Operation Arse. Yet Johnson’s greatest gift is to take the conventional wisdom of his class and wrap it in outrage, and on Scotland he is no different, merely expressing the attitude of a ruling party that long ago stopped giving a tinker’s cuss about anywhere or anything too far over the horizon.While it would be easy to argue that this national instability is the fault solely of Johnson and his red-faced, jabby-fingered Brexiters, it would also be wrong. What just a few weeks ago Brown bemoaned as “the unravelling of a community of mutual interests, common purpose and shared ideals” is a process that has taken decades and that has been led by London.As described by Anderson and others, nation-building is a long journey of establishing common interests and promulgating them through an engineered common culture. The UK’s store of both is dwindling. As recently as Margaret Thatcher, the country had only four TV channels; today you need never watch the same thing as either your spouse or your offspring. Last year, media watchdog Ofcom reported that the third-biggest source of news in the UK was Facebook. It also found that social media users were mainly drawn to stories that were “trending”, or “commented on by friends or people that I know”.So a national culture gets fragmented into friend groups, even while the idea of a national economy becomes ever more laughable. Thatcher’s legacy is summed up by historian David Edgerton in The Rise and Fall of the British Nation as “a new kind of economy … in which there was no longer any concern for national champions, for the ownership even of firms operating in the UK, or the balance of payments”. What’s left is the idea of a territory sullenly governed and subsidised by central London, which is itself a global entity – a host to multinational businesses, an international tax haven, a laundromat for the world’s hot and dirty money.What happened to the idea of Britain? It lost the interest of elites who spotted easier, quicker ways to cash in. Perhaps all that’s left now is the most negative way to hold together a nation: an imagined enemy. It used to be the Frogs and the Krauts and all those other ugly words. Now? It’s the SNP, who used to have Ed Miliband in their pocket, the saboteurs in the judiciary and in parliament, the remoaner establishment. The inventiveness essential to hold a nation-state together has largely disappeared, to be supplanted by the language of loss and sourness and existential threat.• Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"
David Cameron’s ‘greased piglet’: the perfect image for the Brexit moment,It’s entirely fitting that the former prime minister went there at a time of maximum national derangement,Marina Hyde,2019-10-18T17:22:30+0100,"There’s a real sense of occasion now we’ve almost reached the bit of Brexit where the elites who gifted it to us don’t have to pretend any more. Always ahead of the curve, David Cameron is leaning in to the coming winds of financial and ritualistic deregulation with demob abandon. Speaking in Harrogate to promote his book on Thursday night, Cameron predicted success for Boris Johnson and his deal. As the former prime minister put it: “The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people’s hands where mere mortals fail.”That’s it, mate. Why keep your mouth shut about pigs any more? We should just take it from one who knows: greasing a pig makes it go better. Given the dramatic degeneration of our public conversation over the past three years, it feels right that Cameron chose to finally “go there” on the porcine front in Harrogate, a town that was for so long a byword for a certain type of regional gentility.I would imagine his next tour stop will be in Royal Leamington Spa, where he will expand on the point with a demonstration comparing different means of lubricant. Local boars who’ve always wanted to put their daughter on the stage are invited to get in touch with his promoter.As for which atrocious timeline we are about to be flung into tomorrow, who can say? A lot of journalists would certainly like to say. Everything has improved, hasn’t it, since journalists decided their job is predicting what might happen in the future as opposed to reporting on what they do currently know, or scrutinising what they can currently see.Thus the 36 hours or so between Johnson announcing his deal in Brussels and the special sitting of parliament to vote on it feel like they have been mostly spent watching or reading hacks and pundits debating the complex question, “Will the agreement pass?” I don’t know, guys! I guess you could concentrate on what’s in it – or are you as committed to a no-spoilers Brexit as the government is?Lavishing hours of airtime and miles of column inches on speculating precisely how close it all is feels a bit like being given advance notice of a shitstorm, and frittering your day away taking spread bets on the possible wind speed. Six votes? Three votes? Would someone like to come on air and say they reckon there’s maybe just a couple of votes in it? What if it was a tie?Either way, the conclusion, which may of course be debunked tomorrow, is that it will be Very Close. Then, when it is, lots of people will be able to sweep online to declare that they “CALLED IT”. You can print out those tweets and burn them for warmth in the years when we’re discovering the true implications of the Very Close Vote on whatever it was a vote on.The only people who seem to have spent less time thinking about the detail are the likes of Andrew Bridgen. “It looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit,” he explained to Channel 4 News. “That’s Brexit for me.” Despite being even more cruelly miscast as a “Spartan” than cinema’s Gerard Butler once was, the likes of Mark Francois and Andrew Bridgen have succeeded in getting apparently serious commentators to use their self-styled nickname “the Spartans” without deploying airquotes so thrustingly sarcastic that they could be harnessed for wind power.Meanwhile, Michael Gove could be found lurching unsteadily towards the TV camera to bat away Andrew Neil’s inquiry about the possibility of a second referendum amendment. “That ain’t gonna happen,” drawled the bespectacled Clint Eastwood of Surrey Heath. “Ain’t gonna – ain’t gonna be no second referendum.” In retrospect, that may be the moment this once self-respecting nation had to officially admit it was over.We have created an environment so intensely deregulated that Michael Gove is emboldened enough to imagine he’s some kind of gunslinger. The system has already failed. We passed checks and balances three galaxies ago. Our executive defences have been breached by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man grown in a petri dish to provide Monty Burns with someone who could lose to him at arm wrestling.Given the problems Theresa May had, there was some sense of surprise that Johnson should have pulled off a deal acceptable to the more deranged elements of his party. But history is likely to judge that it’s easier than it looks when you’re a man whose sole ideological red line is frictionless abortions. Having given a speech in November 2018 insisting that “no British Conservative government could or should sign up” to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea, Johnson’s British Conservative government was just shy of three months old when it cheerily signed up to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea. That was a great outcome, explained foreign secretary and famous geography dunce Dominic Raab, who said it was a “cracking deal” for Northern Ireland on the basis that they’d keep “frictionless access to the single market”. There it is: the dream. Only a few more days of having to remember which lie you told.Speaking of Northern Ireland, the week has offered the chance to watch the Democratic Unionist party discover in real time who the sucker at the table was. It would take a heart of stone not to enjoy the disappointment of DUP hive queen Arlene Foster, who has carried herself throughout the Brexit process like the kind of maternal screen villain who tries to scupper their child’s every romantic attachment for not being good enough.The DUP have so enjoyed being at the centre of the soap opera since the 2017 election, and acting like divas, that they didn’t realise until they saw this week’s script that the producers couldn’t be doing with them any more and were killing them off. It’s a lot like what happened with Martine McCutcheon on EastEnders. She went off and showed them by having a 15-minute pop career; Arlene is not thought to have any musical ambitions, but will now always be a hero to those dreaming of a united Ireland.As for the prime minister, he seems to be enjoying himself, as much as is possible for a sort of middle-aged Kylo Ren who’s making all the correct self-care decisions. In Westminster, many judge that, whatever happens tomorrow, Boris Johnson is in a win-win situation, with the sole losing entity being the entire United Kingdom. As David Cameron continues to promote his bestselling book, and the rabid deregulators continue to promote Boris Johnson, it does feel as if the nation might end up the true sucker in all this. Then again, for all the mirth it produced, there was always a rather leaden sense of dramatic irony clouding the original Cameron/pig tale. People like David Cameron end up playing David Cameron. The rest of the public is in danger of being the pig.• Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"
