Jaguar attacks woman who climbed Arizona zoo barrier to take a selfie,Woman in her 30s returned to the zoo to apologise after she was treated in hospital for her injuries,,2019-03-11T00:34:24+0000,"A jaguar has clawed an Arizona woman who climbed over a barrier to take a picture at the Wildlife World Zoo near Phoenix, officials said.Mobile phone video of the incident showed at least one gash on the woman’s left forearm as she writhed on the ground in pain after the attack on Saturday.The zoo assured animal lovers the big cat would not be put down.“I hear this young girl screaming: ’Help, help, help’ ... and the jaguar has clasped its claws outside the cage around her hand and into her flesh,” witness Adam Wilkerson told Fox 10 television.Wilkerson’s mother distracted the jaguar by pushing a water bottle through the cage, and Wilkerson said he pulled the woman away. Cellphone video later showed the animal chewing on a plastic water bottle.The identity of the woman, in her 30s, was being withheld, said Shawn Gilleland, a spokesman for Rural Metro Fire, the agency that responded to the incident.She was taken to a hospital and treated, then later returned to the zoo to apologise, Gilleland said.“She wanted to take a selfie or a picture of the animal, and she put her arm close enough to the cage that the cat was able to reach her,” Gilleland said.The zoo’s statement said the female jaguar never left its enclosure, and that the incident was being fully investigated.“We can promise you nothing will happen to our jaguar,” the zoo said on Twitter, responding to public concerns the animal might be put down.The barrier surrounds the entire exhibit, creating a buffer of several feet (metres) from the enclosure, zoo spokeswoman Kristy Morcom told Fox 10.“There is climbing involved. It’s not something that is easily done,” Morcom said. “These are wild animals and those barriers are put there for a reason.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/11/jaguar-attacks-woman-who-climbed-arizona-zoo-barrier-to-take-a-selfie
Trump donor who owned spa linked to Kraft arrest offered access to president,Miami Herald and Mother Jones report Li Yang claimed to be able to get Chinese clients pictures with Trump,,2019-03-10T23:05:57+0000,"A company run by a donor to Donald Trump claimed it could provide Chinese clients with a chance to mingle and take photos with the president, along with access to his private club in Palm Beach, Florida.It remains unclear how much Li Yang charged for the services and whether she was ever hired to provide them.But the company’s claims and other eyebrow-raising activity, first reported by the Miami Herald and Mother Jones, mark the latest in a litany of complications and ethical issues stemming from Trump continuing to own and operate a private club where dues-paying members and their guests rub shoulders with the president and his family, friends, White House staff and members of his cabinet.The AP has previously reported that aides who accompany the president on trips to the club are always alert for club members and guests who like to buttonhole the president. They raise pet projects, make policy suggestions and share oddball ideas ranging from the benefits of nuclear-powered cars to personal plans for peace in the Middle East.Former administration officials have described the lengths to which aides have gone to try to run interference, including reserving the dinner table next to Trump’s to keep as close an eye on him as possible and scanning guest lists for visitors who might prove problematic.In normal times this is jaw-dropping news that would imperil a presidency. For Trump, it's just another week in the White House https://t.co/CI4vCj9e7cYang appears to be a relative newcomer to Palm Beach’s political scene. GY US Investments LLC, a company she registered in 2017, according to Florida state documents, describes itself on a now-defunct, mostly Chinese website as an international business consulting firm.The firm “provides public relations services to assist businesses in America to establish and expand their brand image in the modern Chinese marketplace”, according to a translation of the page accessed through an internet archive service.That has included, the website claims, access to presidential dinners and roundtables, White House events, photo opportunities and “VIP” activities including the “opportunity to interact with the president, the minister of commerce and other political figures”.The site also featured numerous photographs, including a picture of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club and photographs of Yang with Trump, Florida governor Ron DeSantis, transportation secretary Elaine Chao and former White House aide Sebastian Gorka.Yang is described on the website as the company’s “founder CEO”, as well as a member of a “presidential fundraising committee” and a “presidential club member”.Yang and the company did not respond to messages seeking comment, nor did the Trump Organization, Mar-a-Lago club or the Republican National Committee.Christian Ziegler, vice-chairman of the Republican party of Florida, played down the significance of the webpage and photos Yang has posted of herself with the president and other prominent Republican politicians.“Anyone can buy tickets to any event and I’m assuming that is what she had done,” Ziegler said. “I’ve never met the lady and I could never pick her out of a police lineup.”He added: “I know the media, Democrats, the left is going to try to do everything to connect her with us, but she had zero role with us. It just looks like she attended some events and took some pictures.”In China, however, pictures can be an end unto themselves, giving an appearance of influence. Pictures with famous people are especially valued in the country, where personal relationships and connections carry special weight in business and politics.Mother Jones on Saturday offered details on Yang’s efforts to provide Chinese clients access to Trump and his circle.The Miami Herald on Friday published a photo of Yang with Trump at a Super Bowl party at his West Palm Beach country club and reported on the link between Yang and the spa where New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, a friend of Trump, was charged with soliciting prostitution. Yang was a former owner of the spa.Yang wasn’t charged in a multiagency anti-human trafficking operation that resulted in 25 arrests, including that of Kraft, and shut down 10 Asian day spas in South Florida last month. None of the spas is registered to Yang or her family. She sold the Jupiter spa to Hua Zhang around 2013. Zhang was charged with racketeering and running a house of prostitution and has pleaded not guilty.Yang’s family still owns several South Florida spas.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/10/trump-donor-prostitution-case-day-spa

That when it comes to tuition-free or debt-free college, the answer has been, ‘We need to write a big check.’If we compensate people because we take their property, why wouldn’t you compensate people who actually were property?“And so, if the issue is compensating the descendants of slaves, I don’t think that the argument about writing a big check ought to be the argument that you make, if you’re making an argument that a big check needs to be written for a whole bunch of other stuff.”He did not say that if elected he would push for direct compensation to descendants of slaves, saying instead he would appoint a commissioner or taskforce to make recommendations.On Saturday night, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa poll concerning the Democratic field put Castro at 1% support. The poll winner, former vice-president Joe Biden, at 27%, has not yet declared his candidacy.Castro told CNN he was “articulating a strong, compelling vision for the future of this country” and said he could tell he was “going to gain traction”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/julian-castro-reparations-descendants-slaves
Halal holiday bookings soar as Muslims opt for the Med,Tourism industry wakes up to the rapidly growing earning potential of the Islamic economy,Harriet Sherwood,2019-03-10T21:14:20+0000,"It’s a magnet for sun-deprived tourists from northern Europe, drawn to its long sandy beaches, pretty coves and ancient sites. Along Turkey’s Turquoise Coast, holidaymakers down exotic cocktails and ice-cold beers between dips in the sparkling Mediterranean and snoozing on the sun-lounger.But an increasing number of hotels in and around Antalya are turning away from the traditional resort fare of booze and bare flesh in order to attract a new and growing clientele: Muslim tourists.Halal travel, catering for Muslim requirements, is undergoing a boom. Worth $177bn (£136bn) in 2017, the market is expected to reach $274bn by 2023, according to the most recent state of the Islamic economy report.Driven by a rapidly expanding global population and a burgeoning middle class, overall Muslim lifestyle spending – including food, fashion, cosmetics, media and recreation – was worth an estimated $2.1tn in 2017.The report – produced annually by analyst Thomson Reuters – says that the halal travel sector is “spreading its wings through offering cultural, historical, religious and beach tourism. Muslim-friendly beach resorts are proving particularly popular.”Muslim spending power has never been stronger – and hoteliers on the Turquoise Coast have been quick to respond. Some have converted existing hotels to be halal-friendly; other purpose-built resorts are springing up. Their restaurants serve halal food. The premises are alcohol-free. They provide prayer rooms and mosques, and broadcast the call to prayer over public address systems.Most resorts have screened-off women-only pools and beach areas, in which women can sunbathe in bikinis without fear of being seen by men. Boys over the age of five or six are banned, along with cameras and mobile phones. Spas and gyms have separate opening times for men and women. Organised entertainment is “family-friendly”.Basma Kahie, a fashion blogger, said she had previously had doubts about taking holidays because of the difficulties facing Muslim families. But after visiting a halal-friendly resort in Antalya last year with her husband and daughter, she was planning another holiday, this time with friends.“It was amazing not to have to worry about things that might compromise my religious beliefs,” she told the Observer.According to Ufuk Seçgin of HalalBooking.com, which caters for Muslim tourists, “absolutely there is a boom in this sector; we see it and feel it every day. There is a growing Muslim middle class. The first generation [of immigrants to the UK] tended to work in low-skilled jobs, but in the second and third generations we see more doctors, lawyers, people working in finance and so on.“They want to take two or three holidays a year, not just an annual visit to their grandparents or relatives in their home country. They want to see the world – beach holidays, city breaks, heritage sites – and they have money to spend.”Bed capacity in halal-friendly hotels along the Turquoise Coast had increased by 450% in the past five years, said Seçgin. About 18 months ago, the Turkish government set up a halal accreditation authority to provide certification to hotels and resorts. Turkey also has the world’s first halal-friendly ski hotel in the Uludağ resort.Muslim tourism is still largely focused on the Gulf, with Saudi Arabia the top destination because of its custodianship of the Muslim holy sites, Mecca and Medina, which attract millions of pilgrims each year.The kingdom accounted for $21bn of Muslim travel spending in 2017, with the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait next on the league table. Other countries attracting large numbers of Muslim travellers were Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Russia and Nigeria.But, increasingly, countries with small Muslim populations are waking up to the potential of the halal travel market. Two hotels on the Costa del Sol in Spain serve only halal food and are alcohol-free. A handful of small hotels in London and other European cities have similar policies.According to Soumaya Hamdi, who runs the online Halal Travel Guide, alongside her job as a Whitehall civil servant, many destinations have halal-compliant restaurants and accommodation but, until recently, it was hard to find reliable information about them.She started writing about halal travel after a road trip to South Korea and Japan with her husband and baby daughter in 2015. The response was “tremendous”, she said.“There is a new generation of Muslims who are well-educated and professional with quite a lot of purchasing power. They see amazing destinations online, and they want to travel,” she said.“When I was a child, my family had to make do. On holiday, we had to self-cater or eat vegetarian or fish and chips, and that was that. Going to the beach was a nightmare – there was no such thing as a burkini then. But as Muslims have become more affluent, businesses have realised the strength of the Muslim pound. Food was important, she said. “A big aspect of travelling for everyone is trying out new cuisines. It’s not just a question of finding halal food, but finding authentic local food that is also halal.”There was also an increasing number of Muslim women – “unmarried, professional, with money” – who wanted to travel alone or in small groups. Other travellers wanted more “immersive experiences that enrich the soul and mind”.She said: “The last 10 years have been about meeting the basic needs of Muslim travellers. The next stage is to take it further to new destinations and authentic experiences.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/halal-holiday-bookings-soar-as-muslims-opt-for-the-med
Theresa May battles to save Brexit deal amid threats to oust her,Eurosceptics could move against the PM if Commons defeat leads to Brexit delay,Rowena Mason,2019-03-10T20:26:26+0000,"Theresa May was battling on Sunday night to save her Brexit deal and prolong her premiership, amid signs Eurosceptics could move against her if there is a delay to leaving the EU.The prime minister’s position looked precarious as she was unable to announce any progress in talks with the EU less than 48 hours before her House of Commons vote on the deal.One Downing Street insider said the week ahead looked “choppy” as parliament is likely to vote to extend article 50 and rule out a no-deal Brexit if MPs do not approve May’s withdrawal agreement with the EU.Two former cabinet ministers – Nicky Morgan and Dominic Raab – suggested that her premiership would be in trouble in that scenario, with speculation that Eurosceptics will try to force her out.To avoid that threat, May will need votes in the week ahead from about 100 Tory and Democratic Unionist party Eurosceptics, who want an assurance that the UK will not indefinitely be bound by the Irish backstop and a permanent customs union with the EU.In a last-ditch effort to win over the rebels, ministers were discussing whether the prime minister could even offer to name a departure date if it would help the deal to pass, while Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was preparing to offer billions to “end austerity” in the spring statement.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, also warned Eurosceptics that failing to back May’s deal meant there was “a risk and a possibility that we end up losing Brexit in the next couple of weeks”.But hardline pro-Brexit supporters were holding their nerve and insisting they would still only consider backing a deal if Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has changed his mind about the permanent nature of the backstop.Steve Baker, a leading figure in the European Research Group, said: “I am clear a change of prime minister would not create an escape from the backstop unless the new prime minister were willing and able to breach international law. And that is absolutely not who we are as a fair-dealing UK.”To those warning of a threat to Brexit, he said: “The people who would stop Brexit should know just this: what you do, you’ll have to do in public now. Stopping Brexit will be on you, not Brexiteers. Don’t kid yourselves otherwise.”David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, also said an offer by May to resign “would not be enough” and warned that a delay to leaving the EU could cause a backlash amounting to a “Trump moment” among the public. Many Eurosceptics will oppose a delay not just over fears it could lead to a second referendum but also the likelihood that the EU would increase the UK’s exit bill by billions of pounds. May was also facing difficulty securing enough Labour votes to get the deal through, despite attempting to woo them with a package of guarantees on workers’ rights and cash for towns across the UK.If May fears she is heading for a heavy defeat she may pull the vote on her deal and instead hold an indicative vote to show the EU what parliament would accept before attempting another negotiation, but there is no certainty that Brussels would be open to more talks without a change in direction towards a softer Brexit. In an article for the Guardian, Sam Gyimah, a Conservative who resigned as a minister to back a people’s vote, warned his colleagues across the parties against voting for the deal under government pressure, suggesting bad policy decisions such as the Iraq war were made under similar circumstances.“The framing of the choice is similar to the one MPs were presented with in the run-up to the Iraq war: military action against Saddam Hussein, or the risk of an attack on this country,” he said.“The prime minister’s version is a similarly artificial choice: her deal, or a chaotic and disorderly exit from the EU that we know will have severe consequences for our communities. MPs are effectively being asked to choose between the frying pan and the fire, in the hope they will choose the former and that will somehow be declared as a victory.”The prime minister was poised to fly to Brussels in the early hours of Monday if there were signs of a breakthrough but she was still undecided late on Sunday night about whether to make a last-minute dash. She was also wavering over whether to make a statement on the issue in the Commons on Monday.If May fails to pass her deal, Labour said it was open to working with other parties to secure a better Brexit deal involving a customs union. But the prospect of parliament seizing control of the negotiations has heightened the chance of Tory Eurosceptics attempting to replace May.His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt’s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse.Overall, Hunt’s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the 'Theresa in trousers' nickname among some Tory MPs – one that is more catchy than accurate (since May herself often wears trousers).In the final round of MP voting Hunt edged out Michael Gove, 77 votes to 75.Johnson’s progress to Downing Street appeared unstoppable even before an overwhelming victory in the first round of voting among MPs. Most of his colleagues believe it is now all but inevitable that he will be Britain’s next prime minister.His well-disciplined campaign team will continue with their strategy of subjecting him to minimal media exposure, though once the field is narrowed down to two, the final pair will appear in more than a dozen head-to-head hustings for Tory members. The team’s main aim is simply to keep heads down and avoid Johnson creating headlines for the wrong reasons. It may not have worked. Johnson came first in the final round of MP voting with 160 votes.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary who is tipped to run for leader and already has a grassroots supporters group called Ready for Raab, told Sky News: “She has said she is going to step down. I would like to see her able to do that in a way of her own choosing. But the government has found itself in a precarious situation and, particularly if the government extends article 50 or tries to reverse the Brexit promises that we have made, I think that situation will get even trickier.”Morgan, the former education secretary, also told the BBC’s The World This Weekend that it would be the “beginning of the end” for May’s policy if the Commons again votes down her deal and then votes against a no-deal Brexit and for an extension of article 50.“I think that her position is going to become slowly less and less tenable as parliament changes the government’s Brexit policy,” she said. “If the votes go this week in a way which means that the prime minister’s policy as she has set out and stuck to rigidly over the course of the last two-and-a-bit years is taken away, dismantled slowly by parliament this week, I think it would be very difficult for the prime minister to stay in office for very much longer.”She suggested the cabinet would have to “take a role in saying potentially to the prime minister, ‘Actually, things have changed significantly. We think you should think about your position, prime minister.’”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/10/theresa-may-battles-to-save-brexit-deal-amid-threats-to-oust-her
'A city of shadows': fear as Venezuela's crippling blackout enters day four,Power outage – that Maduro blames on foreign saboteurs – could have dramatic implications for country’s political future ,Joe Parkin Daniels,2019-03-10T20:09:31+0000,"When night falls on Venezuela’s ghostly capital, an unnerving hush grips the streets of this once-bustling South American metropolis.“You feel a profound silence all around you,” said Alejandro Guzmán, a 26-year-old lawyer and one of millions of Venezuelans left in the dark after their country was hit by an unprecedented blackout some believe could have dramatic implications for its political future. “It’s like a city of shadows.”Like many Venezuelans, Guzmán has spent most of the last three days without electricity after a crippling outage – that Nicolás Maduro’s beleaguered administration is blaming on foreign saboteurs – struck at about 5pm on Thursday afternoon plunging virtually the entire country into the gloom.“I feel frustrated and I feel angry about what is happening – but we saw this coming,” Guzmán said on Sunday lunchtime, shortly after the lights came back on in his neighbourhood of eastern Caracas.Guzmán’s elderly grandmother, aged 80 and suffering from Alzheimer’s, was less lucky. Across town, in the western municipality of Libertador, she remained in the dark.“The situation is critical,” her grandson said. “She has people who love her around her. But everyone at her age in this situation is in danger.”The Chavista mayor of Caracas, Érika Farías, told state media on Sunday that electricity supply had been restored to 22 of the city’s 32 parishes.As night fell in Caracas, lights began to flicker on across the city, lifting a shroud of darkness that had been interrupted only sporadically since Thursday. Fearful that the power could go again, residents continued to stockpile water and food staples from the few shops that opened their doors while other cities across Venezuela continue to report blackouts.As the power problems entered a fourth day there was anger, exasperation and growing fear over the human toll the dramatic collapse of its electricity system would take.There was concern, too, that the outage might spark disorder and, in turn, repression as Maduro’s security forces sought to quell any unrest. On Sunday there were reports of looting in at least two of Venezuela’s 23 states.“Venezuela is on the verge of a total collapse,” tweeted Bolivia’s former president Jorge Quiroga. “In a few hours the surreal dystopia of Mad Max will be unleashed.”Maduro, who has made only one public appearance since the outage began, tried to reassure citizens that his embattled government was in control.“We are making great efforts to restore supply … in the coming hours,” Hugo Chávez’s heir tweeted.At a rally of supporters on Saturday, Maduro claimed the blackout was the result of a White House-backed “electricity war” designed to topple his administration and replace him with a US “puppet”.But Maduro’s political challenger – the opposition leader Juan Guaidó – slammed the leftist’s “dictatorship” for failing to restore electricity and warned “hard days” lay ahead as the true extent of the disaster became clearer.“Sixteen states are still completely in the dark … We need to deal with this catastrophe now,” said Guaidó, who most western governments now recognize as Venezuela’s rightful interim leader.Guaidó called for fresh street protests and summoned an extraordinary session of the country’s opposition-controlled national assembly for Monday at which he pledged to declare a national emergency. “What we are living through right now in Venezuela is like a science fiction movie,” the 35-year-old politician told reporters.With already buckling hospitals across the country starved of electricity, there was particular concern for the wellbeing of terminally ill patients and newborn babies in need of treatment in intensive care units.There were unconfirmed reports that dozens of newborn babies had died in a hospital in the western city of Maracaibo as a result of the blackout. At least 13 patients were reported to have died in a hospital in the city of Maturín, 540km east of the capital.“You try not to think about everything that is going on,” said Zoraida Córdoba, the 67-year-old wife of a dialysis patient who had gone nearly four days without treatment until finally managing to find treatment on Sunday lunchtime at a clinic in Caracas.“There hasn’t been power in my house since Thursday afternoon. We can’t even buy food because the ATMs aren’t working,” said Córdoba, from Petare, a sprawling shantytown in the city’s east.As she queued for food supplies on Sunday morning, Marlene Márquez described how her elderly parents had been stranded in their 16th-floor flat by the outage.“They are trapped in their home as they can’t get up and down all those stairs. When I visit I have to light the way with candles,” she complained.“These blackouts mean everything gets ruined. Chicken and meat in the fridge goes bad, so do medicines that need to be kept cold,” Márquez added. “And just like there was no power, there was also no water.”By night, the streets of Caracas have the air of an apocalyptic movie. With communications down, people stand on the roofs of their cars, desperately hoping to pick up a signal. Customs officials at Venezuela’s main international airport used flashlights on their mobile phones to check passports.Desireé García, a 36-year-old mother-of-three, poured scorn on Maduro’s claims that the opposition and its US-backers were behind the outage.“It’s a joke to say it was sabotage. It’s all a lie,” fumed García, who scrapes by on remittances sent home by her husband, who fled to Chile in search of work.“I’m neither a Chavista nor from the opposition. I just say what I see … There is no light because they don’t do their jobs, they don’t maintain things.”Guzmán agreed the blackout – which he, like many, blames on government incompetence and corruption – was a calamity foretold and said the lack of electricity would re-energize anti-Maduro protests. “I believe we are going to see more and more demonstrations, every day,” he predicted.But Guzmán admitted he also felt trepidation about what the days ahead might bring.“We feel anxious,” he said. “We don’t know if this is going to be the new normal.”José Manuel Olivares, a doctor and opposition politician who is tracking the power cut’s impact on Venezuela’s healthcare system, said at least ​18 deaths had been confirmed​​.“But we are certain there are more,” Olivares added, pointing to how it had been impossible to contact many hospitals ​because they were still without electricity. “I feel indignant and worried – for the patients, for my friends, for my parents.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/venezuela-blackout-day-four-maduro-fear-anger
Ethiopian Airlines crash: inquiry to explore how 'excellent' pilot was unable to avert disaster,All 157 passengers and crew onboard brand new aircraft on flight ET 302 were killed,Jonathan Watts,2019-03-10T19:36:13+0000,"Aviation authorities have begun investigating how a new Boeing plane with an experienced pilot crashed minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board.The destruction of Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302, which was on its way to Nairobi, is the second calamity involving a Boeing 737 Max 8, a new model that experienced a similar accident in Indonesia in October.The largest number of the victims were Kenyans. At least seven Britons were on the flight, which left Bole airport at 8.38am local time (5.38am GMT).At least 19 people affiliated with the United Nations were among those killed, according to the UN migration agency chief. Many were delegates on their way to the UN environment assembly, which starts in Nairobi on Monday. Eighteen Canadians also died.The pilot said he was experiencing technical problems and asked to return to the airport. The control tower lost contact with the aircraft at 8.44am. Wreckage was later discovered near the town of Bishoftu, 39 miles (62km) south-east of the Ethiopian capital.The flight tracking website Flightradar24 tweeted that the plane had unstable vertical speed after takeoff.The cause of the accident is not yet known. The Ethiopian Airlines chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, said routine maintenance had revealed no problems with the plane, and the captain Yared Getachew had flown more than 8,000 hours with an “excellent flying record”. The airline took delivery of the plane in November.“As I said, it is a brand new airplane with no technical remarks, flown by a senior pilot and there is no cause that we can attribute at this time,” he told reporters.Questions have been raised about the safety of the Boeing 737 Max 8, which has been in commercial operation since 2016. The same model was involved in the Lion Air crash, where a jet plunged into the Java Sea soon after takeoff last year, killing 189 people.More than 300 of these planes are in operation with different airlines. Ethiopian has six more. Asked whether they would be grounded, GebreMariam said no because “we don’t know the cause of the accident”.Several airlines around the world fly the 737 Max 8. On Sunday night reports said China had asked its local airlines to temporarily ground the planes.In a statement, the airline said it would conduct a forensic investigation in conjunction with officials from Boeing, the Ethiopian civil aviation authority, the Ethiopian transport authority other international bodies.The plane was carrying passengers from more than 30 nationalities. According to the airline, Kenya had 32, Canada 18, Ethiopia nine, Italy, China and the US eight each, the UK and France seven each, Egypt six, the Netherlands five, India and Slovakia four each, Sweden and Russia three each and other countries one or two.Sebastiano Tusa, 66, a renowned Italian archaeologist, was among those killed, the Italian government said. He had been flying to Kenya for a project with Unesco.A Slovakian MP, Anton Hrnko, wrote on Facebook that his wife, son and daughter had all been killed in the crash. “It is with deep sorrow that I announce that my dear wife, Blanka, son Martin and daughter Michala, died in the air disaster in Addis Ababa this morning.”Kenyan authorities offered support to families and friends waiting at Nairobi airport. The transport secretary, James Macharia, said they would be transported to an emergency centre at a nearby hotel. “It is a very sensitive emotional matter,” he said. Earlier many people had been waiting at the arrival gate with no information.“We’re just waiting for my mum. We’re just hoping she took a different flight or was delayed. She’s not picking up her phone,” said Wendy Otieno.Robert Mudanta, 46, was waiting for his brother-in-law coming from Canada. “We haven’t seen anyone from the airline or the airport,” he told Reuters more than three hours after the flight was lost. “Nobody has told us anything. We are just standing here hoping for the best.”Four of those on board were travelling on UN passports. . “Early indications are that 19 staff members of UN affiliated organizations perished,” said International Organization for Migration head Antonio Vitorino.“Numerous other staff members from at least five UN and affiliated organizations are understood to have also perished,” he said.Inger Anderson, the incoming head of UN environment, told the Guardian: “We’re devastated by what transpired. Obviously many of our partners and colleagues are deeply impacted. This is a house in mourning but a house that doesn’t yet know all the facts.” The assembly’s organisers have shared details of emergency hotlines with delegates.Several prominent humanitarian workers were among the victims, including International Committee for the Development of Peoples founder Paolo Dieci; three members of Italian humanitarian organisation Africa Tremila, including the president Carlo Spini, his wife, and treasurer Matteo Ravasio; and Save the Children child protection in emergencies adviser Tamirat Mulu Demessie.The Ethiopian prime minister’s office sent condolences via Twitter to the families of those lost in the crash.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said the crash was “devastating”.Under international rules, responsibility for leading the crash investigation lies with Ethiopia but the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will also participate because the plane was designed and built in the United States.Representatives of Boeing and Cincinnati-based engine-maker CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and the French company Safran, will advise the NTSB.The aircraft had shattered into many pieces and was severely burnt, a Reuters reporter at the scene of the crash said. Clothing and personal effects were scattered widely over the field where the plane came down.An eyewitness told AFP the plane came down in flames. “The plane was already on fire when it crashed to the ground. The crash caused a big explosion,” Tegegn Dechasa recounted at the site. “I was near the river near the crash site. Shortly after the crash police and a fire crew from a nearby air force camp came and extinguished the plane’s flames on the ground.”He added: “The plane was in flames in its rear side shortly before the crash. The plane was swerving erratically before the crash.”The cause of the earlier crash involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia is still under investigation. A preliminary report focused on airline maintenance and training, as well as the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor, but did not give a reason for the crash. Since then, the cockpit voice recorder was recovered and a final report is due later this year.State-owned Ethiopian is one of the biggest carriers in Africa by fleet size. It said previously that it expected to carry 10.6 million passengers last year. Its last major crash was in January 2010, when a flight from Beirut went down shortly after takeoff.The airline is in the middle of an expansion, aiming to double its fleet to 120 and become Africa’s biggest airline by 2025. It has tripled its passenger numbers over the past decade. A new terminal recently opened at Bole, tripling the airport’s size.Additional reporting by Lorenzo Tondo",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/ethiopian-airlines-says-kenya-flight-with-157-onboard-has-crashed
The Guardian view on Pius XII: a pope not a saint,Editorial: Some have accused him of being Hitler’s pope. The decision to open the archives will show if he was guilty of something more than indifference,Editorial,2019-03-10T18:25:02+0000,"Compared with other popes, Pius XII was not an egregiously wicked man. He neither enriched nor enlarged his family. He burnt no heretics and started no wars. But he was – unremarkably so by the standards of his time and class – antisemitic. He was also a contemporary of Adolf Hitler’s, and one who occupied a position of considerable moral authority.The historical record shows Pius did very little to condemn the Holocaust, and nothing effectual to stop it. He was the Vatican’s chief diplomat before becoming pope in 1939. He held the office all through the second world war and the first decade of the cold war. Since his death he has been accused of crimes ranging from active collaboration with the Nazis to passive acquiescence in their crimes and indifference to the suffering of their victims. It is also charged against him that he dissolved the Catholic lay party in Germany, when that party might have been a bulwark against Hitler’s rise.Some German Catholics, including some he personally tried to help, did risk and even lost their lives in the struggle against fascism. Most did not. All these claims have been fought over by historians for decades. But their arguments have been hampered by the fact that the relevant Vatican archives were mostly closed to scholars. Now they are all to be opened, after 30 years of pressure. “The church loves history,” said Pope Francis, announcing the move. The question is whether history will love his church.The charge against Pius of active collaboration is certainly unfounded. There were some parts of the Catholic church in eastern Europe which went along enthusiastically with the fascist programme, as the church had also done in the Spanish civil war. In all these cases, Christians believed they were defending themselves, and their societies, against Stalinism. Pius was ferociously anti-communist, but he balked at the planned extermination of the Jewish people.His defenders argue that he did what he could within the constraints of his powers. That may be true. If so, that gives his case a tragic aspect. Popes cannot, like Jesus, renounce all power to save others. As heads of a vast multinational organisation, they must exercise their power in the world, compromising with others, sometimes with evil regimes. Whether they choose unyielding defiance, or supple accommodation, innocents will suffer.Pope Francis himself had to deal with the military dictatorship in Argentina, and now with the Chinese police state. His compromises in both situations can be criticised. But great moral choices are always easier to make when seen from a safe distance. Those who rush to condemn Pope Pius today might ask themselves how history will judge the British government which chooses to sell arms to Saudi Arabia in its murderous and unjustified war in Yemen. Perhaps the civilian victims of that war seem as the Jews of Europe seemed to Pope Pius, not really quite as human or as valuable as other people.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/10/the-guardian-view-on-pius-xii-a-pope-not-a-saint
Deutsche Bank begins talks over merger with rival Commerzbank,Union would form Europe’s second largest bank and a rival to HSBC,Patrick Collinson,2019-03-10T18:21:56+0000,"Deutsche Bank has begun tentative merger talks with rival Commerzbank, which would create Europe’s second biggest bank behind HSBC and fend off unwanted potential bidders such as French giant BNP Paribas.Reports in Germany’s Welt am Sonntag suggest that the banks have come under political pressure to consider a merger and avert a foreign takeover of Commerzbank, much the smaller partner in any deal.Deutsche is regarded as a bank of global importance, but has been plagued by three years of losses, boardroom battles, money laundering issues and its role as the biggest lender to the Trump business empire.Despite Germany’s industrial dominance in Europe, it has only one bank in the continent’s top 20, and Berlin is understood to be keen to create a larger national champion. The combination of the two banks mean that Deutsche, currently fifth biggest, and Commerzbank, currently 23rd, will become Europe’s second biggest bank and only marginally behind HSBC.Deutsche Bank’s chief executive Christian Sewing was seen to be the main opponent of a merger, but investor pressure – Deutsche’ shares are trading at around €7.68 compared with €32 five years ago – is understood to have forced his hand.The talks are believed to be at a very early stage – “unofficial contacts in a very small group” according to Welt am Sonntag – but are likely to be welcomed by major shareholders.Cerberus, the US private equity group that is one of the biggest shareholders in both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, is reportedly keen on a merger, while Deutsche Bank’s chairman Paul Achleitner is also said to be open to the idea.Resistance to a merger may come from Commerzbank, according to Reuters. Commerzbank has largely shed itself of its investment banking activities and become a simpler and more stable retail and corporate lender. But Deutsche remains a significant investment bank player with huge, loss-making trading activities. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Deutsche lost $750m (£576m) in equity trading in New York alone during 2018.There are also question marks over how much of a premium Deutsche could offer Commerzbank shareholders. If the bank stumps up more than €10bn, or a third over Commerzbank’s current share price, then it would send the banks core financial ratios below target.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/10/deutsche-bank-begins-talks-over-merger-with-rival-commerzbank
'A cop on the beat': Elizabeth Warren defends plan to break up tech giants,"In echo of 2020 attacks from Trump, Massachusetts senator faces question about being ‘labeled as a socialist’",Tom McCarthy,2019-03-10T18:12:36+0000,"Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, who called this week for the breakup of America’s biggest tech companies, was challenged on her capitalist credentials on Sunday. The exchange offered a preview of how Democratic presidential candidates might handle Donald Trump’s campaign strategy of stoking fears about “socialism” in attacks on his challengers.Asked on CBS’s Face the Nation if she might properly be described as a capitalist, Warren, a former Republican who has done pioneering academic work in the area of consumer debt, said: “Yeah.”“I believe in markets,” the Massachusetts Democrat said. “Markets that work. Markets that have a cop on the beat and have real rules and everybody follows them.”Interviewer Ed O’Keefe followed up: “So if you get labeled as a socialist –”“Well,” the senator replied, “it’s just wrong.”It is unclear if the “socialist” charge will gain traction with voters in a negative way as the election approaches. In Gallup polling last year, 57% of Democrats said they held a positive view of socialism, compared with 47% who said the same for capitalism. It should also be noted that 6% of all poll respondents defined socialism as “being social”.There is no doubt, however, that Trump intends to paint his opponents red.“We are born free, and we will stay safe,” he said in his State of the Union address last month. “Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”Two weeks later, Trump told an audience in El Paso, Texas: “The Democrats have never been more outside of the mainstream. They’re becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime.”Warren, who among the emerging Democratic field has unique experience in designing protections for consumers against predatory lenders, credit card companies and abusive banking practices, has drawn fire for years from Republicans concerned for the wellbeing of the financial industry.As a candidate for president, the Massachusetts senator has proposed an “ultra-millionaire tax” on the country’s 75,000 richest families, universal childcare and “a new era of strong antitrust enforcement”.Bennet raised his national profile earlier this year when the senator, typically known for his congeniality, delivered a fiery speech on the Senate floor, accusing Republican senator Ted Cruz of shedding 'crocodile tears' over the government shutdown.Biden unsuccessfully ran for the nomination in 1988 and 2008, and his campaign is likely to be dogged by controversy after allegations from several women they were left feeling uncomfortable by their physical interactions with him. If successful, Biden would become the oldest person to be elected president in US history.Now in his second term as mayor of New York City, De Blasio is a hometown foe of Donald Trump's running on the message that there's plenty of money in the country but it's in the wrong hands. With a progressive track record but a chorus of critics in New York, can this Democrat overcome his late start and win the chance to take on Trump?Booker first made a name as the hands-on mayor of Newark. Known for his focus on criminal justice reform and impassioned speeches on immigration, he has though been criticized for ties to Wall Street.Buttigieg wants to be the first openly gay millennial president. A Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar, he became the youngest mayor of a mid-size US city at the age of 29. As a Navy Reserve lieutenant he deployed to Afghanistan.Castro casts himself as an antidote to Trump and the adminstration's hardline immigration policies. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant and raised by single mother, the 44-year-old Democrat is one of the most prominent Latinos in Democratic politics.He has delivered his message of pragmatism to voters in all 99 of Iowa’s counties since he officially kicked off the race in July 2017.

Gabbard made history as the first Samoan American and the first Hindu elected to Congress. But progressives are wary of her past conservative views on on social issues.Years before the #MeToo movement, the New York senator was leading efforts in Congress to combat sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. The former corporate lawyer has embraced a slate of economic ideas supported by the party’s progressive wing.At 88, Gravel will be the oldest candidate to be run for the nomination. However, according to his campaign, the staunch non-interventionist is not running to win, but to challenge Democratic orthodoxy on foreign policy. Will this little-known quixotic figure succeed?Harris is one of Trump’s fiercest critics, and has built a national reputation grilling administration officials during their confirmation hearings. A former state attorney general and the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, Harris believes she has the unique profile to take on Trump.Before he served two terms as governor of Colorado, the 67-year-old Democrat worked as a geologist for a petroleum company. After a lay off, he switched careers and opened a successful brewpub in Denver that helped to revitalize the city’s downtown.Inslee is running as the “only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation’s number one priority”. As the country experiences more powerful hurricanes, scorching wildfires and submerged coastlines, polls show public concern is growing.On Election Night 2018, Klobuchar coasted to a third term as senator in a state Trump almost won. Next morning she was on every short list of potential presidential candidates. Supporters say her success with rural voters makes her a formidable candidate in the Rust Belt, while her calm demeanour provides a clear contrast with Trump.Facing long odds, Messam, the son of Jamaican immigrants to the US and a former receiver for the Florida State Seminoles football team, is tossing his hat in the ring anyway. The 44-year-old businessman became Miramar’s first black mayor when he was elected in 2015. The Harvard educated Marine veteran arrived in Congress with a bang, after unseating a nine-term Democratic incumbent in a Massachusetts primary in 2014. Moulton has continued to make waves by calling for 'generational change' in Democratic leadership and supported an effort to block Nancy Pelosi from becoming House Speaker in 2018.A one-time guitarist for an El Paso punk band called Foss, O’Rourke had kept a relatively low profile as a three-term congressman with little name recognition. He rose to national prominence during the 2018 midterms, when his bid to unseat Senator Ted Cruz garnered unprecedented grassroots support and a historic fundraising haul.Elected to Congress in 2003 at just 29, Ryan represents the blue-collar voters Democrats hope to win back in 2020. He won national attention when he challenged Nancy Pelosi for Democratic leadership in 2016. He has continued to push for a generational change in leadership. Sanders turned a long-shot, anti-establishment bid for the presidency into a “political revolution” that energized the party’s progressive base. His political career began nearly 40 years ago, but it wasn’t until his 2016 run that Sanders became a national figure as a new generation of Democrats – and 2020 contenders – embraced his populist economic policies.Raised in Iowa and California, the 38-year-old Democrat would be among the youngest candidates in the race. Swalwell serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating Russian collusion, a position that has earned him frequent appearances on cable news shows.Her sharp criticism of Wall Street and big corporations has made Warren a favorite among progressive activists, and she will campaign on a message of a rigged economic system and income inequality.This is not the spiritual guru and a new age author’s first foray into politics: in 2014, she mounted an unsuccessful congressional bid in California. Her entry adds some star-power to the race that may attract more celebrities.A former tech executive and entrepreneur running the longest of long shot campaigns centered on the perils of automation. His central plank is a plan to give every American adult a salary of $1,000 per month, paid for by a tax on companies that benefit the most from automation.Lauren Gambino, Sam Morris and Martin BelamMost of her proposals would fit comfortably in the campaign platforms of her fellow Democratic contenders. But her proposal to break up the tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google has attracted a burst of attention – and attacks.Asked about Warren’s plan on CNN’s Face the Nation, the Washington state governor, Jay Inslee, described a need “to protect Americans in this new economy” but declined to join Warren in her call for a tech breakup. Amazon is based in Seattle.Warren’s call could have some bipartisan appeal. Writing in the Guardian on Sunday, the Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich said support for breaking up the tech giants was bipartisan. He quoted the Missouri Republican Josh Hawley, who told him: “Every day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies’ behaviors. Of course the public is going to want there to be action to defend their rights. It’s only natural.”Warren speaks much more directly to the issue. Explaining her proposal at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday, she drew a baseball analogy.“You can be an umpire – a platform – or you can own teams,” she said. “But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game.”On Sunday, Warren declined to turn her proposal into the argument over “isms” that Trump is spoiling for.“I believe in a level playing field,” Warren told CBS. “And as long as we’ve got that then we will get the best out of markets because it means the people who come up with great ideas, who work hard, are the ones who will prosper, not simply those who were born into wealth.”The rising Democratic star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also appeared at SXSW. Speaking on Saturday night, the New York congresswoman said that because “capitalism is an ideology of capital” and “the most important thing is the concentration of capital and to seek and maximize profit”, to her, “capitalism is irredeemable”.The remark was duly seized upon on the right.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/10/elizabeth-warren-break-up-amazon-google-facebook-socialism-capitalism

"Brexit: Labour would back delay to seek better deal, says McDonnell","Shadow chancellor says focus should be on defeating May’s deal, not second referendum",Rowena Mason,2019-03-10T17:41:55+0000,"The shadow chancellor has said Labour would back a delay to Brexit to help secure a better withdrawal deal, as the party retreated from supporting a parliamentary vote on a second referendum this week.John McDonnell said it was no longer the right time to vote on a second referendum on Tuesday, because the priority should be defeating May’s Brexit and then trying to help negotiate a better one.He had previously said Labour would either put forward an amendment calling for a second referendum or support a backbench one at the time May put her Brexit deal to a vote on 12 March.His comments will disappoint some in the party who want Labour to have a clear position in favour of a second referendum as the top priority. Senior figures in the People’s Vote campaign, however, believe there is not yet enough support in parliament for a second referendum. Alastair Campbell said this would only happen when “it becomes clear there is not a majority for any specific form of Brexit”.McDonnell suggested Labour would back an extension to article 50 to give time to seek a better deal when that option is put to a vote on Thursday. He said the party could help to secure such agreement involving a customs union within weeks, but that article 50 should be extended as long as was necessary to strike a deal.He said it was still Labour’s policy to support a second referendum, but only if parliament proved unable to agree on a better outcome than May’s withdrawal agreement.He told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “We’ve got to abide by exactly what we’ve said at Labour party conference, which is we go through the sequence of respecting the referendum, preventing a reckless deal that Theresa May is bringing forward, preventing a no deal, looking to see how we can construct a deal which we think could protect jobs and the economy, and failing that going for a general election or failing that going back to the people.“And this week, we thought this would be the week in which Theresa May brought back for a meaningful vote a different deal, a new deal. It doesn’t look like that. It looks as though she’s bringing back the same deal, so I think it will have the same result and it’ll be thrown out. And then we’ll move into a situation where we, at least we can try and vote down a no deal, and then I think, yes, further negotiations will take place.“My view is everything we do this week has got to prevent a no deal and a bad deal. Other discussions will take place but we’ll always, exactly as our party conference said, we’ll always keep on the agenda if necessary. If parliament can’t agree we’ll have to go back to the people. We’ll be forced to.”His position was echoed by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who suggested Labour wanted a straightforward vote on May’s deal on Tuesday. “I think across parliament now people know the deal is the same. There is a strong sense that it should be an up-down vote on the deal,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.“Now that is not just a Labour position. Back on 15 January, when we first went through this exercise, there were lots of amendments down and, in the end, across the house, everybody pretty well pulled their amendments and said we need to know the size of the defeat, if it is a defeat, and we are back to that moment on Tuesday.“That doesn’t mean that the public vote is gone, it doesn’t mean we won’t come to it … Tuesday is about exposing the weakness of the prime minister and then moving on.”Starmer suggested Labour would prefer to back an amendment by backbench MPs than tabling its own, because such a strategy would be more likely to attract support across parliament. He also said Labour’s default position ought to be supporting remain if there were a public vote.Labour wants to throw its weight behind an amendment by Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, two backbench MPs, which would offer a referendum on any deal achieved by the government versus a remain option.The MPs, however, are now not likely to put that amendment to a vote this week given the scale of defeat that May is likely to face on her deal.Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, accused Labour of pulling its punches. “Labour’s apparent belated support for a people’s vote needs to be put to the test very soon. If not Tuesday, when? And their commitment must go hand in hand with a three-line whip,” he said.Scottish Labour’s conference voted earlier on Sunday to support a second referendum on Brexit, reflecting UK Labour policy to “put forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote, between the option on the one hand of a credible leave deal and on the other hand remain”.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/10/brexit-john-mcdonnell-says-labour-must-focus-on-defeating-theresa-may-deal
Europe must abandon these foolish Brussels treaties,"Emmanuel Macron fails to address many of the most urgent problems facing Europeans today, says French politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon",Jean-Luc Mélenchon,2019-03-10T17:29:01+0000,"An alternative to what Europe could and should be exists to the one Emmanuel Macron described last week. If there is a need for a rebirth, then let it be of the sovereignty of the people, of enlightenment against the obscurantism of money and religion.In Europe, the time has come to speak the only truly international language capable of motivating peoples widely diverse in history, languages and culture. It is the language of common good, of its defence and its extension, of living together, of rebuilding after 30 years of ransacked rights and public services, and free and undistorted competition. It is a language for peace, in the face of frenzied belligerent, anti-Russian, warlike Nato provocations.There is urgency, for we are threatened by a system of production and exchange that is destroying not only the Earth but also the human beings who live on it. Has the time not come for solidarity that will save us from the impending ecological disaster? Europeans can insist environmental rules be respected everywhere: that not more is taken from nature than she can replenish. We can abandon pesticides, which kill biodiversity, immediately. We can decide to eradicate poverty, guarantee a decent wage for everyone, and restrict the income gap to stop inequality. We can extend women’s rights.We can bind the hands of those who steal by tax evasion, those who misappropriate thousands of billions of euros every year. In short, it is possible to begin a new age of human civilisation here, on the richest and best educated continent. We can make humanist norms the new horizon for billions.Europe should no longer have anything to do with the Franco-German alliance controlled by Germany’s Christian Democrats. It humiliates the other 26 EU member states and isolates French people from their natural family in the south.We should not fear the Russians, who are our partners. If democracy is threatened, it is more by the tyranny of finance and the brutal methods used to rule, which paved the way for the suffering in Greece and the hounding of opponents of the EU in Poland or Hungary.The problem posed to our democracy in France does not come from Moscow, but from Paris itself, with a president who has been leading fierce repression against the “gilets jaunes” for 17 weeks. How can Macron lecture on democracy when the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have publicly voiced deep concern about police violence in France?And what about the illusion that fortress Europe may be protected from economic and ecological refugees by letting them drown in the Mediterranean? The fact that Viktor Orbán welcomed Macron’s recent proposals as a starting point for discussion should be worrying. Instead, an immediate policy is needed to examine the causes that lead to forced exile: wars, climate change and economic plunder.All these social miseries have their common origin in the content of the European treaties, which have frozen economic policy in the absurd dogma of ordoliberalism – Germany’s variant of social liberalism so dear to the Merkel government. Cooperation in Europe will need an exit from these treaties. A change of direction is urgently called for. Macron and Angela Merkel embody the old, morbid recipes.

"UK considering how to bring home children of Isis Britons, says Hunt",Foreign secretary reacts to death of Shamima Begum’s baby son in apparent policy shift,Ben Quinn,2019-03-10T17:25:14+0000,"The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said the government is now looking at ways of bringing the children of British fighters in Syria back to the UK, in an apparent shift in policy which comes days after the death of Shamima Begum’s baby son.Hunt said it was too dangerous to send British officials to rescue the 19-year-old’s baby son from the camp in Syria, and she knew she would not be able to rely on British consular assistance when she went to the Islamic State-held territory.But he appeared to signal a change of policy when he said the Foreign Office was now working with the Department for International Development on ways of contacting and removing British children in the camps.Hunt, in reference to Begum who was stripped of her citizenship on the orders of the home secretary, Sajid Javid, gave the first reaction by a senior government figure since it emerged that the teenager’s son had died in a Syrian camp.He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Begum “chose to leave a free country to join a terrorist organisation and we have to think about the safety of British officials that I would send into that war zone as a representative of the government”.Challenged as to why officials could not have gone to rescue the child from a camp where the press had gone to interview Begum and others, Hunt said journalists had “some protection” but added: “Sending a British government official into a war zone in a situation where you are getting advice that those officials’ lives may be put at risk is a very different matter.”Hunt said earlier: “Shamima knew, when she made the decision to join Daesh [another name for Isis], she was going into a country where there was no embassy. There was no consular assistance. And I’m afraid those decisions, awful though it is, do have consequences.”Javid, who faces increasing criticism over the case of Begum, has remained silent on the controversy even after reports emerged that two more British women were being held in Syrian camps with their young children and have had their British citizenship revoked.The other women who have had their British citizenship removed were named by the Sunday Times as two sisters, Reema Iqbal, 30, and Zara Iqbal, 28, who are said to have five sons under the age of eight between them and have been widowed after their husbands died fighting for Isis.The sisters, from Canning Town in east London, are believed to be living in separate Syrian camps, where tens of thousands of people have flocked amid the disintegration of the “Isis caliphate”.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on individual cases. Any decisions to deprive individuals of their citizenship are based on all available evidence and not taken lightly.”Javid, during a weekend of criticism, was accused of moral cowardice and “treating the UK as a banana republic” in pursuit of his leadership ambitions after the death of Jarrah, Begum’s son.A Church of England bishop and a former director of public prosecutions criticised the home secretary as demand grew for Javid to review his decision, which left Begum stateless with her child in legal limbo.Begum, from Bethnal Green, east London, was 15 when she and two other schoolgirls went to join Isis in February 2015. She gave birth in a Syrian refugee camp last month. She had already lost two children.News that a third child has now died has left her relatives in London distraught. The Begum family’s lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said: “They are utterly crushed and despondent at the moment.”Javid’s decision to strip the teenager of citizenship triggered a  debate about whether she should be allowed to return and raised questions about the legality of his decision.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, tweeted: “It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane.”Reema Iqbal told Sky News: “I don’t trust anyone. I’m sorry. I’ve been burned before.” Iqbal was quoted earlier this year in the Daily Telegraph, which identified her as one of a number of British women who wanted to return. “The security services came to speak to me and I was honest, I told them my whole story, so now it’s up to them to judge,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/two-more-isis-women-reema-and-zara-iqbal-syrian-camps-stripped-of-british-citizenship
"Trump border wall request will set up new budget fight, adviser says","Discussing White House request for $8.6bn for wall in 2020 budget, Larry Kudlow also claims ‘no reason to obsess’ about deficit",,2019-03-10T17:22:56+0000,"Donald Trump will on Monday will ask Congress for an additional $8.6bn to pay for the wall he has promised to build on the border with Mexico, officials familiar with his 2020 budget request said.Asked if that meant there would be another budget fight over the wall, like that which led to a long and damaging government shutdown at the turn of the year, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said: “I suppose there will be ...“He’s going to stay with his wall and he’s going to stay with the border security theme. I think it’s essential.”Budgets are mainly seen as blueprints for White House priorities, often panned on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers craft the bills that fund the government if the president signs them.Speaking to Fox News Sunday, Kudlow also said the Trump 2020 budget would contain a 5% across-the-board reduction in domestic spending, and would “point a steady glide path” towards lower federal spending and borrowing.There was “no reason to obsess” about the budget deficit, he said, as long as it remains below 5% of the overall economy. The deficit is approaching $1n. Kudlow also said he was confident economic growth would top 3% in 2019 and beyond. Other observers have predicted lower growth.The demand for wall funding is more than six times what Congress allocated for such projects in each of the past two fiscal years, and 6% more than Trump has corralled by invoking controversial emergency powers.We have provided the course of action, the strategy and the request to finish the jobDemocrats, who oppose the wall as unnecessary and immoral, control the House of Representatives. Republicans control the Senate.Trump built his 2016 campaign around his promise of a wall, which he said Mexico would pay for. It will not. A bruising battle with Congress over wall funding resulted in a five-week partial federal government shutdown that ended in January. Trump’s budget could touch off a sequel, ahead of three fiscal deadlines this fall.Funding legislation needs to be passed before 1 October or the government could shut down again. If Congress and the White House fail to agree to lift mandatory spending caps set in a 2011 law, steep automatic cuts to many programs will kick in. Around the same time, Trump and lawmakers must agree to lift the debt ceiling or risk a default.Regardless of whether Congress passes it, the Trump budget request will help the president frame his argument on border security as the 2020 election takes shape. “It gives the president the ability to say he has fulfilled his commitment to gain operational control of the south-west border,” an administration official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said of the budget request.“We have provided the course of action, the strategy and the request to finish the job. It’s a question of will Congress allow us to finish the job,” a second official said.Trump’s request is based on a 2017 plan put forward by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials to build or replace 722 miles of barrier along the border, which in total is estimated to cost about $18bn. Only 111 miles have been built.Following the rejection of his last wall funding demand, Trump declared a national emergency and redirected $601m in treasury forfeiture funds, $2.5bn in defense department drug interdiction funds and $3.6bn from a military construction budget.The $8.6bn in proposed wall funding for fiscal 2020 would include $5bn from the Department of Homeland Security and $3.6bn from military construction. The budget proposal will also include another $3.6m to make up for any military construction projects delayed by the wall, officials said.Trump will propose an overall 5% increase to the Department of Homeland Security budget, including $3.3bn, or 22% more, for CBP, and $1.2bn more for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a 16% hike, officials said. The budget proposal includes a plan to hire more than 2,800 law enforcement and support personnel for the agencies, and 100 immigration judge teams, officials said.Many lawmakers accused Trump of overstepping his constitutional powers. The House has voted to revoke the emergency and the Senate is likely to do the same this week. Trump is expected to veto the resolution.A coalition of state governments led by California has sued Trump to block the emergency move, though legal experts have said the lawsuits face a difficult road.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/10/trump-border-wall-budget-kudlow
SDF launches assault on last Isis enclave in eastern Syria,Direct clashes under way and airstrikes target weapons stores in Baghuz,,2019-03-10T17:02:36+0000,"Airstrikes have targeted Islamic State weapons stores as the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) launched an attack against the jihadists’ enclave in Baghuz near the Iraqi border.An SDF official, Mustafa Bali, said the attack began at 6pm local time and “direct and fierce” clashes were under way.The assault by the SDF aims to wipe out the last vestige of Isis’s self-declared “caliphate” that once spanned a third of Iraq and Syria.While the Baghuz enclave represents the last shred of populated land held by the jihadists, the group is still widely seen as a big security threat with remote territory elsewhere and the continued capacity to launch guerrilla attacks.The SDF, spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, has been poised to advance into the enclave for weeks but has repeatedly held back to allow for the evacuation of civilians, many of them wives and children of Isis fighters.Bali said no further civilians had emerged from the enclave since Saturday and the SDF had not observed any more civilians in the area, prompting the decision to attack.“The military operations have started. Our forces are now clashing with the terrorists and the attack started,” he said.Tens of thousands of people have streamed out of the shrinking territory held by Isis over the last months. Bali said more than 4,000 militants had surrendered to the SDF in the past month.Earlier on Sunday, a Reuters correspondent saw SDF forces advance into a tented area of Baghuz after Isis fighters withdrew from it. SDF fighters gathered some ammunition and rifles left behind by the jihadists.In its previous guise as an al-Qaida offshoot in Iraq a decade ago, Isis navigated adversity by going underground, biding its time to rise suddenly again.Since suffering devastating territorial losses in 2017, Isis has steadily turned again to such tactics. Sleeper cells in Iraq have staged a scatter-gun campaign of kidnappings and killings to undermine the Baghdad government.The group has also carried out many bombings in northeast Syria, which is controlled by US-backed Kurdish forces, including one that killed four Americans in January. Kurdish and US officials say it remains a menace there.The fate of the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, remains a mystery.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/sdf-launches-assault-on-last-isis-enclave-in-eastern-syria
Algerians begin general strike against Bouteflika's rule,Many citizens object to the ailing president’s attempt to serve a fifth term in office,Ruth Michaelson,2019-03-10T16:48:21+0000,"Algerians have begun five days of general strike as protests against the rule of the ailing president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, entered a new phase.Shops across the country were closed and groups of workers gathered in the streets brandishing flags and signs objecting to Bouteflika’s attempt to serve a fifth term in office. Social media posts implored citizens to enact civil disobedience and refuse to attend their jobs for the rest of the working week.“You have a date with history,” said the national syndicate for electricity and gas workers, which represents employees of the national gas company Sonelgaz and has declared its allegiance to the strike. “Now is the time for all free workers to participate in this movement,” it said.Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Algeria on Friday, marking the third week of demonstrations against the rule of 82-year-old Bouteflika. What began as protests against the his bid for a fifth term as president quickly expanded into opposition to the entire regime around the infirm leader, who has rarely been seen in public since a stroke in 2013.On Sunday afternoon, an Algerian government aircraft believed to be transporting Bouteflika left Geneva, where he had been receiving medical treatment. Bouteflika landed at a military airport south of the capital, and departed in a convoy, the Associated Press news agency reported.He previously warned protesters of the risk of infiltration by “misleading parties” and offered to hold another election to choose his successor if re-elected in April.Algeria’s leaders attempted to maintain an image of control amid the growing protests. “The people and the army have a unified vision of the future,” said Gaïd Salah, the head of the military. The education ministry combatted a mass student strike by bringing forward the spring holiday originally scheduled for 21 March and extending it until 4 April.Despite the government’s efforts to contain the protests, some workers in the energy sector, which accounts for an estimated 30% of the country’s GDP, joined the strike on Sunday, the first day of the working week in Algeria.Video posted to social media appeared to show employees of the state oil and gas giant Sonatrach protesting in the town of Béjaïa. The company employs an estimated 120,000 people and is considered the backbone of the industry. It declined to comment on the strike when contacted by the Guardian. “Sonatrach has nothing to do with the strike,” said an employee who answered a call to its offices.Some private companies took a different approach. Cevital, the largest private conglomerate outside of Algeria’s energy sector with 18,000 employees, tweeted a statement of support for the strike, saying it was “united with the movement for a general strike chosen by civil society to demand a change to the system.”Riccardo Fabiani, a senior geopolitics analyst at Energy Aspect, told the Guardian the strike could rattle Algeria’s leaders should oil and gas field engineers or those working on energy pipelines and transportation choose to participate, thereby affecting energy output in the third largest supplier of natural gas to Europe.He said: “It’s a direct existential threat to the regime, as energy production is effectively the lifeline of the country. If instability propagates and reaches the sector, the regime would be in panic mode. This is the kind of shock that can alter the balance of the current standoff.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/algerians-begin-general-strike-against-abdelaziz-bouteflika-presidency
Roy Moore considers new run for Senate in Alabama,Hard-right Republican’s 2017 campaign was marred by allegations he sexually assaulted or pursued teenage girls while in his 30s,,2019-03-10T16:47:53+0000,"The Alabama Republican Roy Moore, whose unsuccessful 2017 campaign for US Senate was marred by allegations he sexually assaulted or pursued teenage girls while in his 30s, has said he may run again.In an interview on the Christian program Focal Point on American Family Radio, host Bryan Fischer asked Moore about the 2020 race for the Senate in Alabama.“Tell me what you’re thinking about throwing your hat back into the ring,” Fischer said.“I’m seriously considering it,” Moore said. “I think that it [the 2017 Senate race] was stolen.”He cited what he described as misinformation campaigns against him.The Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor, defeated Moore by a narrow margin in a special election in December 2017 to fill the seat vacated by Republican Jeff Sessions when he became US attorney general. Jones was the first Democrat in a quarter-century to be elected to the US Senate in Alabama.If Moore, a 72-year-old former state chief judge known for staunchly conservative views, does decide to run for the Senate in 2020 and secures the Republican nomination, he could face Jones again.Moore’s 2017 campaign was beset by allegations from women who told the Washington Post he sexually assaulted or pursued them while he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. Moore denied the allegations.In January, Alabama’s Republican attorney general, Steve Marshall, asked federal elections officials to investigate allegations that the special election was tainted by use of a misleading social media campaign against Moore.The New York Times has reported that Democratic operatives sought to undermine Moore by creating a Facebook page claiming his supporters wanted to ban alcohol in the state. The newspaper has also reported that Democrats created a separate “false flag” Facebook page to portray Moore as supported by Russian bot accounts.The US representative Bradley Byrne is the only Republican in Alabama who has formally pledged to run for the Senate in 2020, according to AL.com.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/10/roy-moore-considers-2020-senate-run-alabama
