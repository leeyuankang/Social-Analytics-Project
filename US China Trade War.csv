557,"Donald Trump will meet China’s negotiating team at the White House on Friday for the latest round of talks aimed at ending a 15-month trade battle that is weighing on the global economy.“Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I?” the president tweeted. On Wall Street stocks moved higher on hopes that there would be a breakthrough in the dispute.Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.China’s vice-premier, Liu He, is leading the delegation in negotiations with the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin.This is the 13th round of talks between the two sides and the world’s two biggest economies are deadlocked over US allegations that China steals technology and pressures foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as part of a sharp-elbowed drive to become a world leader in advanced industries such as robotics and self-driving cars.Ahead of the meeting a Chinese official told Bloomberg that China was open to a “partial trade deal” but talks have been further complicated by the US decision to blacklist 28 Chinese tech firms over Beijing’s treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. That decision came just days before the latest talks were due to start.US-China relations have been further strained by a tweet from Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team, in support of the Hong Kong democracy movement. The tweet, since deleted, led to the cancellation of NBA events in China this week.Under Trump, the US has slapped tariffs on more than $360bn worth of Chinese imports and is planning to hit another $160bn 15 December. That would extend import taxes to virtually everything China ships to the United States. China has hit back by targeting about $120bn in US goods, focusing on farm products.The high cost of the tariffs and uncertainty over when and how the trade war will end have taken an economic toll, especially on manufacturing companies. A private survey last week found that US factory output had dropped to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was in the grips of a deep recession.“Both sides have been losing, and so has the global economy,” said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce.Brilliant, who spoke with both delegations before the meetings, sounded optimistic about the chances of progress, noting that Beijing has stepped up purchases of US soybeans in a goodwill gesture. He said he hoped a productive meeting would persuade the Trump administration to call off or postpone plans next Tuesday to hike tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports from 25% to 30%.“We all know we can’t afford a further escalation of the trade war,” Brilliant said.Still, Beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy Washington. Doing so would probably require scaling back the Chinese leaders’ aspirations to technological dominance they see as crucial to their country’s future prosperity.The news came amid the chaos of the impeachment inquiry engulfing US politics, which is examining Trump’s phone call in July where he asked the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Joe Biden, a leading Democratic rival in the 2020 US presidential election.Trump also last week brazenly asked China in public to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden over their international business dealings, despite no evidence of illicit activity and despite conspiracy theories about the Bidens and Ukraine having been debunked.",Trump to meet with China for talks aimed at ending trade war,2019-10-10/17:37:18,donald trump will meet china s negotiating team at the white house on friday for the latest round of talks aimed at ending a  month trade battle that is weighing on the global economy big day of negotiations with china they want to make a deal but do i the president tweeted on wall street stocks moved higher on hopes that there would be a breakthrough in the dispute big day of negotiations with china they want to make a deal but do i i meet with the vice premier tomorrow at the white house china s vice premier liu he is leading the delegation in negotiations with the us trade representative robert lighthizer and the treasury secretary steven mnuchin this is the th round of talks between the two sides and the world s two biggest economies are deadlocked over us allegations that china steals technology and pressures foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as part of a sharp elbowed drive to become a world leader in advanced industries such as robotics and self driving cars ahead of the meeting a chinese official told bloomberg that china was open to a partial trade deal but talks have been further complicated by the us decision to blacklist  chinese tech firms over beijing s treatment of uighur muslims and other predominantly muslim ethnic minorities that decision came just days before the latest talks were due to start us china relations have been further strained by a tweet from daryl morey the general manager of the houston rockets basketball team in support of the hong kong democracy movement the tweet since deleted led to the cancellation of nba events in china this week under trump the us has slapped tariffs on more than bn worth of chinese imports and is planning to hit another bn  december that would extend import taxes to virtually everything china ships to the united states china has hit back by targeting about bn in us goods focusing on farm products the high cost of the tariffs and uncertainty over when and how the trade war will end have taken an economic toll especially on manufacturing companies a private survey last week found that us factory output had dropped to its lowest level since  when the economy was in the grips of a deep recession both sides have been losing and so has the global economy said myron brilliant head of international affairs at the us chamber of commerce brilliant who spoke with both delegations before the meetings sounded optimistic about the chances of progress noting that beijing has stepped up purchases of us soybeans in a goodwill gesture he said he hoped a productive meeting would persuade the trump administration to call off or postpone plans next tuesday to hike tariffs on bn of chinese imports from  to  we all know we can t afford a further escalation of the trade war brilliant said still beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy washington doing so would probably require scaling back the chinese leaders aspirations to technological dominance they see as crucial to their country s future prosperity the news came amid the chaos of the impeachment inquiry engulfing us politics which is examining trump s phone call in july where he asked the president of ukraine volodymyr zelenskiy to investigate joe biden a leading democratic rival in the  us presidential election trump also last week brazenly asked china in public to investigate biden and his son hunter biden over their international business dealings despite no evidence of illicit activity and despite conspiracy theories about the bidens and ukraine having been debunked ,US China Trade War,0.22322113811969757
638,"Thailand’s Chiang Mai zoo has been exonerated in a panda diplomacy row after autopsy results revealed that a celebrity panda that had been loaned to the zoo by China, died of heart failure and not from neglect or foul play.The sudden death of Chuang Chuang, this September sparked outrage in China, where social media users blamed the Thai zoo for his death, suggesting it was caused by neglect or careless feeding.Chuang Chuang was 19 when he died. In the wild pandas generally live to up to 20 years, but can survive up to another decade in captivity.The panda, who had been on loan to Thailand since 2003 with female panda Lin Hui, was known for being obese and was famously put on a diet in 2007.But in the wake of Chuang Chuang’s death, a Chinese-assisted autopsy has ended speculation the Chiang Mai Zoo was at fault, with results showing he died from heart failure.“The autopsy and analysis by Chinese-Thai experts showed that the nutrition health of Giant Panda Chuang Chuang was good, no external wounds were found and no foreign objects were found in his trachea,” the zoo said in a statement released Tuesday.“The cause of his death was heart failure, resulting in the lack of oxygen of internal organs and leading to his death.”However, the Chiang Mai Zoo confirmed it would pay an unspecified amount of compensation to China as outlined in the loan agreement.When Chuang Chuang collapsed after eating a piece of bamboo at his enclosure in the Thai zoo, panda fans lashed out at Thailand and also questioned China’s “panda diplomacy” where zoos abroad pay the country millions to host the endangered giant animals.On Chinese social media platform Weibo one user wrote: “Please don’t rent any more pandas to Thailand! No! Chuang Chuang is probably the most bitter panda in the world! What kind of bamboo he was given eat? If you can’t afford [a panda], don’t rent it.”Chuang Chuang and Lin Hui, who is expected to remain at the Thai zoo for the time being, were media darlings in Thailand.Their 2005 “wedding” garnered significant media attention, and their first cub, which was subsequently sent to China, was featured on a 24-hour Panda Channel on Thai TV.","Thailand panda death that sparked outrage caused by heart failure, not neglect",2019-10-09/06:14:52,thailand s chiang mai zoo has been exonerated in a panda diplomacy row after autopsy results revealed that a celebrity panda that had been loaned to the zoo by china died of heart failure and not from neglect or foul play the sudden death of chuang chuang this september sparked outrage in china where social media users blamed the thai zoo for his death suggesting it was caused by neglect or careless feeding chuang chuang was  when he died in the wild pandas generally live to up to  years but can survive up to another decade in captivity the panda who had been on loan to thailand since  with female panda lin hui was known for being obese and was famously put on a diet in  but in the wake of chuang chuang s death a chinese assisted autopsy has ended speculation the chiang mai zoo was at fault with results showing he died from heart failure the autopsy and analysis by chinese thai experts showed that the nutrition health of giant panda chuang chuang was good no external wounds were found and no foreign objects were found in his trachea the zoo said in a statement released tuesday the cause of his death was heart failure resulting in the lack of oxygen of internal organs and leading to his death however the chiang mai zoo confirmed it would pay an unspecified amount of compensation to china as outlined in the loan agreement when chuang chuang collapsed after eating a piece of bamboo at his enclosure in the thai zoo panda fans lashed out at thailand and also questioned china s panda diplomacy where zoos abroad pay the country millions to host the endangered giant animals on chinese social media platform weibo one user wrote please don t rent any more pandas to thailand no chuang chuang is probably the most bitter panda in the world what kind of bamboo he was given eat if you can t afford a panda don t rent it chuang chuang and lin hui who is expected to remain at the thai zoo for the time being were media darlings in thailand their  wedding garnered significant media attention and their first cub which was subsequently sent to china was featured on a  hour panda channel on thai tv ,US China Trade War,0.1597190797328949
819,"Business and union leaders in Britain have reacted angrily to the announcement of US tariffs on a range of European goods including Scotch whisky and stilton cheese after a World Trade Organisation ruling over subsidies for Airbus.The US unveiled the list of goods to be hit with tariffs late on Wednesday after the WTO ruled that Washington could impose tariffs worth $7.5bn (£6.1bn) to remedy subsidies given to Airbus. The EU said it would retaliate.Scotch and Irish whisky made in the UK will be subject to the tariffs but not whiskey from Ireland. The US spared cognac and champagne from the list but announced tariffs of 25% on goods including French wine, Italian and Dutch cheese and Spanish ham.Gary Smith, the Scotland secretary of the GMB union, said the move represented a “troubling glimpse into the post-Brexit future” for the UK. “Scotland and the rest of the UK are sitting ducks after October 31st. The collective strength we have in the EU trading bloc will be gone and there is simply no such thing as a ‘special relationship’ with the United States – Trump will squeeze the UK economy for everything he can get,” he said.Scotch whisky exports to the US were worth £1bn last year, , supporting a wider industry employing 11,000 people across Scotland. Karen Betts, the chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the tariffs would put jobs and investment at risk. “Despite the fact that this dispute is about aircraft subsidies, our sector has been hit hard.”Airbus shares rose most on France’s CAC 40 index of leading companies, in a sign that investors had feared a stiffer sanction was possible. Analysts said the tariffs may not be as bad as first feared for European drinks makers. Shares in Diageo, the owner of brands including Lagavulin and Baileys, rose by 1.9% on Thursday despite a fall in the FTSE 100 of about 0.6%. Shares in the French distillers Rémy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard also rose.The US investment bank Jefferies said about $440m of revenue at Diageo would be affected by the tariffs, about 5% of its total US sales.A spokesperson for the UK’s Department for International Trade said: “Resorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US.

1530,"Donald Trump continued to defend his trade war with China on Tuesday, claiming “great patriot farmers” in the US would benefit from tariff increases that triggered sell-offs in stock markets across the world.In a series of tweets, Trump promised a new deal with China would be reached soon and made a case for how farmers would benefit from a tariff increase that many of them oppose.If China stops buying American farm products because of tariffs, Trump said, farmers will be compensated. “This money will come from the massive tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us. The farmers have been ‘forgotten’ for many years. Their time is now!”The long-running trade dispute between the US and China escalated on Friday after Trump raised tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. China retaliated on Monday with tariffs on $60bn of US imports, precipitating a dive on the US stock markets.American farmers are likely to feel the pain first. Soybean exports to China collapsed last year when the trade war began, and agricultural exports will be hit harder when, or if, the new tariffs are imposed. Farmers are also suffering from extensive flooding that has delayed planting.“The sentiment out in farm country is getting grimmer by the day,” said John Heisdorffer, the chairman of the American Soybean Association. “Our patience is waning, our finances are suffering and the stress from months of living with the consequences of these tariffs is mounting.”The new round of tariffs will hit other parts of the US food industry, with beans, lentils, honey, flour, corn and oats all on the list of goods that will be taxed.Despite the mounting economic threat and escalating tensions, Trump was optimistic about reaching a deal with China.“When the time is right we will make a deal with China,” Trump tweeted. “It will all happen, and much faster than people think!”Trump’s position has divided Republicans, especially those in agricultural districts who fear the retaliatory tariffs will burden farmers, agricultural businesses and consumers.The president’s supporters claim short-term economic pain will have positive long-term consequences.The Republican senator Chuck Grassley, who represents Iowa, a state heavily reliant on agriculture, has called for a quick resolution to the dispute. “Americans understand the need to hold China accountable, but they also need to know that the administration understands the economic pain they would feel in a prolonged trade war,” Grassley said in a statement.• This article was amended on 15 May 2019.

1561,"World markets plunged further on Tuesday following heavy losses on Wall Street after China delivered a swift rebuff to Donald Trump by imposing retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of US imports.Beijing ignored warnings from Trump about the dangers of escalating the trade conflict and sent tremors through global markets by announcing a new 25% import duty on a range of US products.In early trade on Tuesday, Hong Kong led losses when the market reopened after a long weekend. The Hang Seng Index sank 1.7% while Shanghai shed 0.2% and Tokyo was off 0.7% at the break.Sydney and Singapore each dropped more than one percentage point, with Manila and Jakarta both down 1.6%. There were also losses in Taipei and Wellington, though Seoul edged up slightly.Medha Samant, director of investment at Fidelity International, told Bloomberg TV: “In the short term, it looks like volatility is here to stay and we could see this risk-off, risk-on going on for a long time.”The retreat came after the Nasdaq on Wall Street suffered its worst day of 2019 and the Dow ended at its lowest point in more than three months.In the latest stage of the tit-for-tat battle between the world’s two biggest economies, China targeted almost 2,500 products, from food and consumer goods to chemicals and machinery, and said the increases would come into force next month.Apple, Boeing and Caterpillar were the biggest casualties of a global market sell-off as investors concluded that they would be among the companies most affected by China’s action.The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 600 points, both it and the S&P 500 recording their biggest losses since January, after hopes of a speedy resolution to the dispute were replaced by fears of a long and damaging trade war.In London, the blue-chip FTSE 100 fell 39 points, or 0.55%, to end Monday at 7,163, its lowest level since 13 March, while the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized, more UK-focused companies, fell more than 1.2% to a six-week low. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index also hit a two-month low, down 1.2%. Consumer goods-makers and technology firms led the fallers.Trump has drawn up plans to extend US tariffs to the $300bn-plus of Chinese imports not currently targeted, while there were hints from Beijing that it would start to sell some of the US Treasury bonds it holds.The US president took action last week after what the US considered backtracking by China’s president, Xi Jinping, on commitments contained in a 150-page draft trade deal between the two countries.But despite warnings from Trump of the risks of retaliation, China said it would “never surrender” to US pressure.US President Donald Trump Trump has often repeated that China pays for US tariffs on its goods. 'We have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our treasury; now we have billions coming in' he said on 24 January 2019. On 5 May he tweeted: 'For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA.' But that is not how tariffs work.China's government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by US-registered firms to US customs for the goods they import into the United States. Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of US tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer US importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher US duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if US importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that 'both sides will suffer on this' contradicting the president. In a series of tweets, Trump said: “I say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don’t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries. Too expensive to buy in China. You had a great deal, almost completed, & you backed out!”He added: “There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China, very good for USA! But China has taken so advantage of the US for so many years, that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job). Therefore, China should not retaliate-will only get worse!”China criticised the White House for its “escalation of Sino-US economic and trade frictions, contrary to the consensus between China and the United States on resolving trade differences through consultations, jeopardising the interests of both sides and not meeting the general expectations of the international community.”Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics, said China’s move would risk provoking Trump. “That could make the prospect of US tariffs being imposed on the remaining $300bn of Chinese imports – provisional details of which were due to be published by the US trade representative later on Monday – even more likely.”China’s new 25% tariff will affect almost 2,500 items, from food and consumer goods to chemicals and machinery. Other products will soon incur a 20% or 10% additional levy.China’s Global Times newspaper reported that Beijing was also considering cutting orders for new Boeing planes and boycotting US agricultural products.Timme Spakman, economist at ING bank, said China’s response could have been harsher and showed that Beijing was keen to keep the door open for negotiations.Trump ordered the tariff increases after talks in Washington with China’s vice-premier Liu He ended with no deal in sight.The president suggested that manufacturers who make goods in China could shift production to other countries to avoid the tariffs. Trump said in another Twitter post that the trade war would not have a significant impact on US trade. “We are right where we want to be with China. Remember, they broke the deal with us and tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from China.

1566,"Donald Trump has again defended tariffs as his dogged, often self-contradictory pursuit of a trade war with China put allies and opponents alike in a difficult spot.Stocks tumbled after China said it would impose higher tariffs on US goods including frozen vegetables and liquefied natural gas, in retaliation for America raising tariffs on $200bn in Chinese imports. Trump has threatened to extend tariffs to the remaining $300bn or so in Chinese imports that have not been targeted yet, but told reporters on Monday: “I have not made that decision yet.”As the clash of the world’s two biggest economies raised fears of global shockwaves, Trump denied American consumers would pay the price.“There is no reason for the US consumer to pay the tariffs, which take effect on China today,” Trump tweeted, before offering a convoluted explanation.That put him at odds with his own national economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who was asked on Fox News Sunday: “It’s US businesses and US consumers who pay, correct?”Kudlow replied: “Yes, I don’t disagree with that.”He also acknowledged that “both sides will suffer”.Not for the first time, Trump is scrambling political allegiances. It is especially awkward for Republicans. The president’s protectionist “America first” agenda flies in the face of the party’s free market principles and threatens to hurt voters in red states.Farmers are one example. At a news conference organised by the campaign group Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, in response to the raising of tariffs to 25%, Brent Bible, a soybean and corn farmer in Lafayette, Indiana, said: “Our competitive advantage has always been we are a reliable source of product. This has taken that away.“It has made it … so uncompetitive that other countries are willing to now take the risk that some of the South American countries have in terms of logistics, safety and being reliable. China and others are now willing to take that risk since we are priced so far out of the market.”Trump has promised to “make it up” to farmers hurt by Chinese tariffs against soybeans and other agricultural products. Previously set at $12bn, on Monday he suggested the compensation could go even higher.He said: “We’re going to take the highest year, the biggest purchase that China has ever made with from our farmers, which is about $15bn, and do something reciprocal to our farmers so our farmers can do well.”US President Donald Trump Trump has often repeated that China pays for US tariffs on its goods. 'We have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our treasury; now we have billions coming in' he said on 24 January 2019.

Chinese companies might also lose business if US importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that 'both sides will suffer on this' contradicting the president. The bailout programme, which has been slow to take effect because of bureaucratic hurdles, threatens to wipe out whatever financial rewards Trump claims tariffs have reaped. “We’re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs,” he insisted at the White House, dangling the prospect of yet more.But Republicans have become accustomed to twisting themselves into unexpected positions to support Trump on all kids of issues. This is no different.Last week the White House issued a list of those who back Trump for taking a hard line after China allegedly reneged on commitments made during months of talks. It included Senator Marco Rubio of Florida: “Not surprised #China is trying to go back on changes they had previously agreed to. For years they have had counterparts so desperate for a deal they allowed them to get away with this. [Trump] is the first to ever pose a credible threat to walk away from a bad deal.”Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said: “I completely support President [Trump]’s approach in trade negotiations with China. This is the last, best chance for America and the world to get China to play by the rules.”Intriguingly, the roll call also quoted Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate: “Hang tough on China, President [Trump]. Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.”Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Democrat, said: “China’s cheating has hurt American workers for far too long. Tariffs brought China to the negotiating table and now that we’re there, the president must secure real changes to level the playing field.”The remarks illustrate the dilemma facing Democrats. Former vice-president Joe Biden, the frontrunner for 2020, was recently condemned for remarks that played down Chinese competition. “China is going to eat our lunch?” he said. “Come on, man.”Bernie Sanders has pledged to label China a currency manipulator, a stand Trump vowed he would make but was talked out of by advisers. Sanders and another progressive candidate, Elizabeth Warren, share Trump’s distaste for Republican worship of the free market.But centrist Democrats are going on the offensive. Another 2020 contender, the Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton, told Fox News Sunday:“Wielding tariffs like a cudgel because it makes the president look tough? That only hurts American families.”Many feel Trump has hit upon an important theme – the threat posed by China and its long history of flouting rules.A few Republican voices have warned against a prolonged dispute. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told ABC’s This Week he advised the president to finalise a deal with China soon, “because the longer we’re involved in a tariff battle or a trade war, the better chance there is that we could actually enter into a recession because of it”.Trump said on Monday he plans a meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, next month at the G20 summit in Japan. He insisted: “We’re in a great position right now, no matter what we do. I think China wants to have it.”The Associated Press contributed reporting",Trump defends China tariffs as trade war leaves allies and opponents in bind,2019-05-13/21:18:14,donald trump has again

1599,"The US expects China to retaliate over the Trump administration’s latest tariff hike, chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday.“The expected countermeasures have not yet materialized,” Larry Kudlow told Fox News Sunday. “We may know more today or even this evening or tomorrow.”As markets digested the comments, futures trading pointed to a drop in Wall Street stocks on Monday while Asian shares slipped in early trade.Talks ended on Friday and Trump raised the spectre of a full-blown trade war when he ordered that tariffs on Chinese imports worth around $200bn be raised from 10% to 25%.Beijing retaliated for previous tariff hikes by raising duties on $110bn of US imports. Chinese officials have also targeted US companies by slowing customs clearance and stepping up regulatory scrutiny.On Saturday he had tweeted saying Beijing had deliberately sought to delay negotiations. “China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky [and] have a Democrat win,” he said.Kudlow told Fox no more talks were planned but also said there was a “strong possibility” Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping “will meet in Japan at [the] G20” summit at the end of June.In China, state media said the door to talks was always open but China would not yield on important issues of principle. In a commentary carried by the official Xinhua news agency, the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily said there are no winners in any trade war and China did not want to fight but would not be afraid to do so.China and the US are sparring over allegations that China steals technology and pressures US companies into handing over trade secrets, as part of a campaign to turn Chinese companies into world leaders in robotics, electric cars and other advanced industries.Kudlow said China had not implemented changes Washington wanted, including strong enforcement provisions on issues such as forced technology transfer and intellectual property.“We have to have a very strong agreement,” he said, “to correct, to right these wrongs before we will be satisfied”.Kudlow also said Trump’s plan to raise tariffs across the board could take “a couple of months. Call it three months. I don’t know. That will take some time and then of course the president’s going to have to make the final decision on that.”The face-off with China has proved tricky political territory for Democrats, given Trump’s framing of his stance as a defence of American workers.On Sunday the California senator Kamala Harris, a leading contender for the presidential nomination, was asked on CNN’s State of the Union if she agreed with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who this week told Trump he should “hang tough” in his dispute with Beijing.Harris dodged the question, choosing instead to criticise Trump for not working with allies and for “conducting trade policy, economic policy, foreign policy by tweet”.“That’s irresponsible,” she said. “It is a display of a president who thinks that unilateral action is better than working with the friends to address issues that not only impact our country, but impact the globe. And I think it puts us in a weaker position.”Continuing his Twitter thought on Saturday, Trump said “the only problem” with China’s approach to talks “is that they know I am going to win (best economy & employment numbers in US history, & much more), and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!”Many observers have suggested Trump seems not to understand the economic impact of tariffs. One study released this week said that as companies which import steel absorb the cost of tariffs by passing it on to their customers, American consumers and businesses are paying $900,000 a year for every job created or saved by the US action.On Sunday evening Trump returned to Twitter to claim the US was “right where we want to be with China”, and would “be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from China”. He added that “buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from non-tariffed countries”.In a confused pair of tweets, the president also claimed the US would “spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture), which is a small percentage of total tariffs received, and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world! GREAT! #MAGA”.On Sunday, Kudlow conceded to Fox that China does not actually “pay” tariffs, but claimed “the Chinese will suffer GDP losses and so forth with respect to a diminishing export market”.On Sunday the Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul warned that Trump’s policies could damage his claim to the “best economy in US history”, a key line of attack as the 2020 election approaches.Speaking to ABC’s This Week, Paul advised the president to finalise a deal with China soon, “because the longer we’re involved in a tariff battle or a trade war, the better chance there is that we could

1623,"Donald Trump’s obsession with tariffs may be based on one of his few core beliefs. Or it may be part of a grand strategy to win votes. Either way, triggering a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies represents a huge gamble ahead of next year’s US presidential election.The US has raised tariffs on $200bn in imports from China to 25% from 10%, with another round in the offing. Beijing vowed to retaliate but Trump, ever the salesman, claimed on Twitter that the new tariffs will bring “FAR MORE wealth” to America.Trump is notoriously a non-ideological pragmatist who has switched parties and positions on countless issues, but for four decades he has taken a tough line on trade. Dan DiMicco, the former chief executive of the steel company Nucor, told the Washington Post in 2018: “People think he just came to this issue last year, but he came to it on his own, decades ago, seeing what was going on in the ’70s and ’80s with job losses and manufacturing in decline.”Defying Republican party free market orthodoxy, Trump talked about trade relentlessly during the 2016 election campaign and it worked with enough people to help win the electoral college. He therefore sees no reason not to pursue the same course while in office and in the 2020 election.Indeed, Trump and allies insist that the current trade policy has helped generate positive economic growth – 3.2% in the first quarter – though most experts contend that tariffs reduce economic activity by raising prices for consumers.Politically, however, Trump senses an opportunity to divide his opponents and put Democrats in an awkward spot. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, has repeatedly praised him for taking a harder line on China than either Barack Obama or George W Bush.US President Donald Trump Trump has often repeated that China pays for US tariffs on its goods. 'We have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our treasury; now we have billions coming in' he said on 24 January 2019. On 5 May he tweeted: 'For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA.' But that is not how tariffs work.China's government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by US-registered firms to US customs for the goods they import into the United States. Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of US tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer US importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher US duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if US importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that 'both sides will suffer on this' contradicting the president. But other Democrats, Trump believes, are vulnerable to the accusation of “weak on China” while he plays strongman putting America first. Former vice-president Joe Biden, currently leading the primary polls, raised eyebrows last week by downplaying the threat of Beijing.At a rally this week in Panama City, Florida, Trump cast doubt on whether another contender, the South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, 37, is up to the job. “We have a young man, Buttigieg … He’s got a great chance, doesn’t he? He’ll be great, representing us against President Xi of China – that’ll be great. I want to be in that room. I want to watch that one.”But there are clear political perils. One of Trump’s favourite applause lines at rallies is the health of the stock market and the stalled talks threaten that run. Studies also show consumers and companies are already paying billions more in higher taxes and lost efficiency.And farmers are especially vulnerable from lost sales to China, an issue on which the president seems to be in denial. He tweeted on Friday: “Your all time favorite President got tired of waiting for China to help out and start buying from our FARMERS, the greatest anywhere in the World!”In fact China is the fourth biggest export market for US agriculture. It bought $9.3bn in American agricultural products last year, according to the US agriculture department. Losing farmers’ votes could prove costly to Trump at the ballot box. And if his tariffs tunnel vision brings about an economic slowdown or worse, his central argument for re-election will be lost.",Tariffs: Donald Trump's trust in trade war tactic is big electoral gamble,2019-05-12/07:00:25,donald trump s obsession with tariffs may be based on one of his few core beliefs or it may be part of a grand strategy to win votes either way triggering a trade war between the world s two biggest economies represents a huge gamble ahead of next year s us presidential election the us has raised tariffs on bn in imports from china to  from  with another round in the offing beijing vowed to retaliate but trump ever the salesman claimed on twitter that the new tariffs will bring far more wealth to america trump is notoriously a non ideological pragmatist who has switched parties and positions on countless issues but for four decades he has taken a tough line on trade dan dimicco the former chief executive of the steel company nucor told the washington post in  people think he just came to this issue last year but he came to it on his own decades ago seeing what was going on in the s and s with job losses and manufacturing in decline defying republican party free market orthodoxy trump talked about trade relentlessly during the  election campaign and it worked with enough people to help win the electoral college he therefore sees no reason not to pursue the same course while in office and in the  election indeed trump and allies insist that the current trade policy has helped generate positive economic growth   in the first quarter though most experts contend that tariffs reduce economic activity by raising prices for consumers politically however trump senses an opportunity to divide his opponents and put democrats in an awkward spot chuck schumer the minority leader in the senate has repeatedly praised him for taking a harder line on china than either barack obama or george w bush us president donald trump trump has often repeated that china pays for us tariffs on its goods we have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from china we never had  cents coming into our treasury now we have billions coming in he said on  january  on  may he tweeted for  months china has been paying tariffs to the usa but that is not how tariffs work china s government and companies in china do not pay tariffs directly tariffs are a tax on imports they are paid by us registered firms to us customs for the goods they import into the united states importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers manufacturers and consumers in the united states by raising their prices chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of us tariffs in indirect ways exporters sometimes for instance are forced to offer us importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher us duties chinese companies might also lose business if us importers find another tariff free source of the same goods outside china white house economic adviser larry kudlow has acknowledged that both sides will suffer on this contradicting the president but other democrats trump believes are vulnerable to the accusation of weak on china while he plays strongman putting america first former vice president joe biden currently leading the primary polls raised eyebrows last week by downplaying the threat of beijing at a rally this week in panama city florida trump cast doubt on whether another contender the south bend mayor pete buttigieg  is up to the job we have a young man buttigieg he s got a great chance doesn t he he ll be great representing us against president xi of china that ll be great i want to be in that room i want to watch that one but there are clear political perils one of trump s favourite applause lines at rallies is the health of the stock market and the stalled talks threaten that run studies also show consumers and companies are already paying billions more in higher taxes and lost efficiency and farmers are especially vulnerable from lost sales to china an issue on which the president seems to be in denial he tweeted on friday your all time favorite president got tired of waiting for china to help out and start buying from our farmers the greatest anywhere in the world in fact china is the fourth biggest export market for us agriculture it bought  bn in american agricultural products last year according to the us agriculture department losing farmers votes could prove costly to trump at the ballot box and if his tariffs tunnel vision brings about an economic slowdown or worse his central argument for re election will be lost ,US China Trade War,0.17798130214214325
1655,"The economic conflict that has been simmering between the US and China has entered a new and dangerous phase. Without question, the world is closer to a full-blown trade war than it has been since the 1930s.The issue now is whether the two sides can step back from the brink. So far, financial markets think the standoff is akin to the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, the closest the US and the Soviet Union came to nuclear conflict during the cold war.Seen this way, Donald Trump is John F Kennedy, Xi Jinping is Nikita Khrushchev and the goods that have just left Chinese ports on their way to the US are the Soviet missiles en route to Cuba.That Trump’s decision to increase tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200bn (£154bn) of goods only applies to items leaving China after the measure was announced just reinforces the historical parallel. As there was time for Khrushchev to back down, so there is time for Washington and Beijing to do a deal while the ships are crossing the Pacific.China has more to lose from a trade war. It exports far more to the US than it imports, the Chinese economy is slowing and there are only a limited number of additional US products to which tariffs could be applied in the event the tit-for-tat protectionism continues.What’s more, China is more to blame for the hotting up of the trade cold war than the US. The US thought a 150-page draft agreement was the basis for a comprehensive deal, only to find Beijing had filleted the document of its concessions in contentious areas, such as the theft of US intellectual property rights.Now China has met with firm US resistance, the expectation is Xi will back down – as Khrushchev did. Since Trump has no desire to see a meltdown on Wall Street, both sides will seek to avoid the mutually assured destruction a full-blown trade war would involve.But what if the idea that sense will prevail is wrong? What if neither side is prepared to back down? Then, this is not 1962 but the summer of 1914, after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Trump and Xi – both self-styled hardmen with an aversion to backing down – are not Kennedy and Khrushchev but Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II.Politically, Trump is seeking to make capital out of the fact he is prepared to stand up to China. In contrast to the views of most economists, he thinks protectionism is good for the US and plays well in swing states.For his part, Xi says he would prefer to talk, but he is prepared to fight if that’s what the US wants. Nationalism plays well in China, so Beijing says reluctantly it has no choice but to respond to Trump’s tariffs with equivalent action of its own. Washington retaliates by putting import duties on the $325bn of Chinese goods it has yet to target.Beijing then starts to make it more difficult for US companies to operate in China and says that if Trump doesn’t back off, it will stop buying US treasury bonds. The White House says it has no intention of doing so and events are set in train that lead remorselessly to the doomsday outcome nobody wanted.",Could doomsday be nearing as US-China trade war heats up?,2019-05-10/18:25:09,the economic conflict that has been simmering between the us and china has entered a new and dangerous phase without question the world is closer to a full blown trade war than it has been since the s the issue now is whether the two sides can step back from the brink so far financial markets think the standoff is akin to the cuban missile crisis of october  the closest the us and the soviet union came to nuclear conflict during the cold war seen this way donald trump is john f kennedy xi jinping is nikita khrushchev and the goods that have just left chinese ports on their way to the us are the soviet missiles en route to cuba that trump s decision to increase tariffs from  to  on bn bn of goods only applies to items leaving china after the measure was announced just reinforces the historical parallel as there was time for khrushchev to back down so there is time for washington and beijing to do a deal while the ships are crossing the pacific china has more to lose from a trade war it exports far more to the us than it imports the chinese economy is slowing and there are only a limited number of additional us products to which tariffs could be applied in the event the tit for tat protectionism continues what s more china is more to blame for the hotting up of the trade cold war than the us the us thought a  page draft agreement was the basis for a comprehensive deal only to find beijing had filleted the document of its concessions in contentious areas such as the theft of us intellectual property rights now china has met with firm us resistance the expectation is xi will back down as khrushchev did since trump has no desire to see a meltdown on wall street both sides will seek to avoid the mutually assured destruction a full blown trade war would involve but what if the idea that sense will prevail is wrong what if neither side is prepared to back down then this is not  but the summer of  after the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand trump and xi both self styled hardmen with an aversion to backing down are not kennedy and khrushchev but kaiser wilhelm ii and tsar nicholas ii politically trump is seeking to make capital out of the fact he is prepared to stand up to china in contrast to the views of most economists he thinks protectionism is good for the us and plays well in swing states for his part xi says he would prefer to talk but he is prepared to fight if that s what the us wants nationalism plays well in china so beijing says reluctantly it has no choice but to respond to trump s tariffs with equivalent action of its own washington retaliates by putting import duties on the bn of chinese goods it has yet to target beijing then starts to make it more difficult for us companies to operate in china and says that if trump doesn t back off it will stop buying us treasury bonds the white house says it has no intention of doing so and events are set in train that lead remorselessly to the doomsday outcome nobody wanted ,US China Trade War,0.20074640214443207
1657,"Donald Trump has insisted that there is “no rush” to secure a deal with China despite growing business and Wall Street fears that the ratcheting up of US tariffs risks a full-blown trade war between the world’s two economic superpowers.US shares, which were falling for much of the day, staged a late rally on Friday night after Trump tweeted that trade talks “will continue” after the hiking of tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.China’s vice-premier Liu He left talks with US Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer after just 90 minutes in Washington, adding to speculation that the gap between the two sides was large.Trump had earlier prompted a warning from the International Monetary Fund that the tariff war posed a threat to the global economy, but the president subsequently used a series of tweets to insist that tariffs were good for the US economy.Beijing has yet to respond to the new US duties – which have been raised from 10% to 25% on $200bn of new Chinese imports into the US – with tariffs of its own but has insisted that it will take retaliatory measures. Meanwhile, Trump threatened to expand tariffs to all Chinese imports into the US.Traders seized on Trump’s later comments over talks, and remarks from Mnuchin that negotiations had been “constructive”. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 114 points, or 0.4% to close at 25,942, earlier it had fallen by more than 300 points.Trump sounded a defensive note after coming under fire from business lobby groups fearful that higher import costs would force US companies and farmers to lay off workers.Trump tweeted: “Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also, much easier & quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted, or go to new source!”Ignoring concerns that purchasing US goods and food and then dumping them on developing world countries could put local firms and farmers out business, he said: “With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in, we will buy agricultural products from our Great Farmers, in larger amounts than China ever did, and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance.“In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!,” he added.China’s ministry of commerce said in a statement just after the scheduled tariffs went into effect: “The Chinese side deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures”.“It is hoped that the US and the Chinese side will work together to resolve existing problems through cooperation and consultation,” it said, noting that “high-level economic and trade consultations” were underway. The increased tariffs apply only to goods leaving China after Friday’s deadline and will go into effect only once shipments reach the US, which could take two or three weeks, leaving room still for negotiations.However, investors now face the prospect of a damaging trade war which many fear could destabilise the already slowing global economy and escalate tensions between the two superpowers over flash points such as the South China Sea and industrial espionage. Higher tariffs act like a tax, raising prices and cutting the spending power of consumers.Trump has also said he is preparing the “paperwork” for tariffs of 25% on an additional $325bn worth of Chinese imports, which would mean almost all Chinese goods exported to the US would be levied. Chinese exports to the US accounted for about $540bn last year.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – leaving a trade deficit of $419.2bn.The president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where Trump is seeking changes to Beijing’s trade policy.Tariffs have been imposed by Washington on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year. They came on top of broader tariffs used by Trump that have hit China and other trading partners such as the EU, Canada and Mexico, on goods including steel and aluminium.In May 2019 the US president further ratcheted up existing import tariffs of 10% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods sold in the US to 25%, hitting everything on a long list of products. Trump has previously warned that 25% tariffs could be slapped on a further $325bn of goods in future – which would mean all Chinese imports being covered by tariffs.Richard Partington and Jasper JollyThe US action followed several days in which Trump had lambasted China for backtracking on a deal negotiated over the past five months by making extensive changes to a draft 150-page agreement. Analysts say Beijing may have believed the US was in a weaker bargaining position, based on Trump’s calls to cut interest rates.After several days of near silence on Trump’s threats – state media did not report the president’s comments and social media platforms censored images of his tweets – China has now started to take a more strident stance.Commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday: “The US side has given many labels recently: ‘backtracking,’ ‘betraying,’ ... China sets great store on trustworthiness and keeps its promises, and this has never changed”.An editorial published by a government-affiliated Wechat account said: “If you are willing to talk, we’ll talk.

1679,"Donald Trump has raised the stakes in the simmering US-China trade war, imposing higher tariffs on $200bn (£154bn) of Chinese goods. Here are the answers to key questions about the dispute between the world’s two largest economies.The US president has ratcheted up existing import tariffs of 10% on certain Chinese goods sold in the US to 25%.The increase came into effect on Friday on a long list of products shipped after 12.01am EDT.There was no breakthrough in talks in Washington between the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the Chinese vice-premier Liu He before the midnight deadline.Trump has warned 25% tariffs could be imposed on a further $325bn of goods in future, which would mean all Chinese imports being covered by tariffs.The short answer is, we do not know. Geng Shuang, at China’s foreign ministry, told reporters to “stay tuned” about any retaliation.In a statement shortly after the tariff increase came into effect, China’s commerce ministry said it “deeply regrets” the need to take “necessary countermeasures”.What is clear is that Beijing will not be able to impose reciprocal tariffs, because China’s imports from the US are less than $200bn. But it does have other options, including raising existing tariffs, restricting US companies in China and making it tougher for Americans to qualify for visas.That said, China has also expressed hope both sides could reach an agreement.Recent stock market moves had been relatively muted as negotiations continued, but Trump’s escalation of tensions at the start of the week prompted a major selloff. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average had its worst one-day drop since January.However, there was little reaction in European markets on Friday morning, with all investors firmly focused on the talks.Investors also took heart from the unofficial grace period offered by Washington, which means goods that set off from China to the US before the midnight deadline will still be taxed at 10%.These are only the latest tariffs imposed in the tit-for-tat dispute. Washington has put tariffs on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year. They are on top of broader tariffs used by Trump that have affected China and other trading partners such as the EU, Canada and Mexico, on goods including steel and aluminium.The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese tech goods in June 2018, covering aerospace, automobiles, communications and robotics, in an attempt to hinder Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” initiative aimed at strengthening its manufacturing and technology base.The White House then imposed tariffs of 10% on $200bn of goods in September, on a wider range of products including food ingredients, construction materials, bike parts and burglar alarms. These are the tariffs that have been increased to 25%.China has retaliated to previous measures with $110bn of tariffs on US goods, including agricultural produce such as soya beans, as well as cars, luggage, electronics, housewares and food.The roots of the dispute are Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’s position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. According to US Census Bureau data, Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – a trade deficit of $419.2bn.The US president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks in which Trump is seeking changes to Beijing’s trade policy.Trump has sold the tariffs as a boon for US workers (and voters) that will bring back employment to “rust belt” industrial areas that have lost jobs to China. However, the overwhelming economic consensus is that tariffs are mostly passed on via higher prices – ultimately paid by those same workers.Shipping times between the US and China mean the majority of price increases are likely to be passed on in two to four weeks’ time – enough time for a deal that would avoid higher prices and potentially dodge a significant blow to economic growth.Trump is well known for ramping up the rhetoric in trade talks and has previously said he can only secure new trade deals by threatening or imposing tariffs on trading partners. Having said that, the White House has confirmed talks between the two sides would resume on Friday, with hopes a deal could still be reached.Trump said on Thursday he had received a “beautiful letter” from China’s president, Xi Jinping. He quoted Xi as saying: “Let’s work together, let’s see if we can get something done.”",US-China trade war: all you need to know about Trump's tariffs,2019-05-10/11:45:59,donald trump has raised the stakes in the simmering us china trade war imposing higher tariffs on bn bn of chinese goods here are the answers to key questions about the dispute between the world s two largest economies the us president has ratcheted up existing import tariffs of  on certain chinese goods sold in the us to  the increase came into effect on friday on a long list of products shipped after  am edt there was no breakthrough in talks in washington between the us trade representative robert lighthizer and the chinese vice premier liu he before the midnight deadline trump has warned  tariffs could be imposed on a further bn of goods in future which would mean all chinese imports being covered by tariffs the short answer is we do not know geng shuang at china s foreign ministry told reporters to stay tuned about any retaliation in a statement shortly after the tariff increase came into effect china s commerce ministry said it deeply regrets the need to take necessary countermeasures what is clear is that beijing will not be able to impose reciprocal tariffs because china s imports from the us are less than bn but it does have other options including raising existing tariffs restricting us companies in china and making it tougher for americans to qualify for visas that said china has also expressed hope both sides could reach an agreement recent stock market moves had been relatively muted as negotiations continued but trump s escalation of tensions at the start of the week prompted a major selloff on tuesday the dow jones industrial average had its worst one day drop since january however there was little reaction in european markets on friday morning with all investors firmly focused on the talks investors also took heart from the unofficial grace period offered by washington which means goods that set off from china to the us before the midnight deadline will still be taxed at  these are only the latest tariffs imposed in the tit for tat dispute washington has put tariffs on some chinese goods sold in the us for about a year they are on top of broader tariffs used by trump that have affected china and other trading partners such as the eu canada and mexico on goods including steel and aluminium the trump administration imposed  tariffs on bn of chinese tech goods in june  covering aerospace automobiles communications and robotics in an attempt to hinder beijing s made in china  initiative aimed at strengthening its manufacturing and technology base the white house then imposed tariffs of  on bn of goods in september on a wider range of products including food ingredients construction materials bike parts and burglar alarms these are the tariffs that have been increased to  china has retaliated to previous measures with bn of tariffs on us goods including agricultural produce such as soya beans as well as cars luggage electronics housewares and food the roots of the dispute are trump s america first project to protect the us s position as the world s leading economy while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the us and to manufacture products there trump complains of a large trade deficit with china which he views as a symbol of the us s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse according to us census bureau data chinese imports to the us totalled  bn last year while  bn was sold the other way a trade deficit of  bn the us president has accused beijing of unfair trade policies including allowing the theft of us companies intellectual property the threat of import tariffs on chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks in which trump is seeking changes to beijing s trade policy trump has sold the tariffs as a boon for us workers and voters that will bring back employment to rust belt industrial areas that have lost jobs to china however the overwhelming economic consensus is that tariffs are mostly passed on via higher prices ultimately paid by those same workers shipping times between the us and china mean the majority of price increases are likely to be passed on in two to four weeks time enough time for a deal that would avoid higher prices and potentially dodge a significant blow to economic growth trump is well known for ramping up the rhetoric in trade talks and has previously said he can only secure new trade deals by threatening or imposing tariffs on trading partners having said that the white house has confirmed talks between the two sides would resume on friday with hopes a deal could still be reached trump said on thursday he had received a beautiful letter from china s president xi jinping he quoted xi as saying let s work together let s see if we can get something done ,US China Trade War,0.31164881587028503
1701,"Investors were hopeful of a breakthrough in talks between the US and China as negotiators worked to prevent an escalation in tit-for-tat tariffs that threaten a full-scale trade war between the world’s two largest economies.Amid rising concerns that President Donald Trump would unilaterally raise tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods on Friday, Beijing scrambled to assure Washington that it was sincere in wanting to reach a deal.President Xi Jinping sent a message to Trump that he would talk to his US counterpart ahead of the deadline of 0500 GMT, which Trump has said could also trigger tariffs on a further $325bn of goods, covering almost the total volume of Chinese imports to the US. A full-blown trade war between Washington and Beijing would send shockwaves through the global economy – investors registered their concern by posting steep declines in stock markets this week.Trump said on Thursday he had received a “beautiful letter” from Xi as negotiations on a trade deal between the two countries continued in Washington.“He just wrote me a beautiful letter. I’ve just received it and I’ll probably speak to him by phone,” said Trump. Later he quoted Xi as saying in the letter: “Let’s work together, let’s see if we can get something done.” The US president added he believed a deal could be done this week, but accused China of sabotaging recent talks by seeking a renegotiation.“We’re getting very close to a deal then they started to renegotiate the deal. We can’t have that. We can’t have that,” said Trump.It is understood a day of talks with China’s vice-premier, Liu He, had made progress, but it was unclear whether the two sides were close to reaching an agreement.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse.

Hong Kong’s main benchmark fell 2.4% and the Shanghai composite index lost 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones index was down 0.6% on Thursday afternoon.Analysts said the modest losses were an indication that investors expected the two sides to reach a deal, though the volatile path of trade negotiations meant an escalation was possible before one could be signed.Earlier in the day, the US trade representative’s office filed the paperwork in preparation for a tariff hike, giving Trump the authority to increase tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200bn of goods including food, chemicals and building materials.The move followed a breakdown in talks last weekend when the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, accused China of going back on commitments previously made in talks.Officials close to the talks said they got an inkling of China’s second thoughts about prior commitments during talks last week in Beijing, but that the backsliding became even more apparent in exchanges over the weekend. Neither side has provided details of specific issues involved, although the clashes are thought to include differences over intellectual property theft and requiring US companies operating in China to share technology with Chinese counterparts.The US is keen to open up Chinese markets to US businesses and protect them from being forced to hand over technology and go into partnership with Chinese firms. Lighthizer has also stressed Beijing must agree to a transparent dispute resolution regime.But Trump has appeared more concerned with trying to bring down the US’s huge trade deficit with China. Unfortunately for the White House, his tactics so far have depressed trade with China but failed to halt Washington’s growing trade deficit with the rest of the world.Figures show the US trade deficit – the difference between US exports and imports – hitting a record $621bn in 2018, with China accounting for $419.2bn of that.Marianne Schneider-Petsinger, a trade analyst at the thinktank Chatham House, said: “The Chinese response so far has been quite measured, knowing that Trump is playing to a domestic audience and with his re-election looming needs a strong US economy.“Even with this latest escalation, both sides have a strong interest in striking a deal,” she said.Some Chinese commentators said Beijing was ready for a fight with the US.“China is not afraid of conflict,” said the Global Times, a newspaper published by the ruling Communist party’s People’s Daily, which is known for its nationalist tone. It said Beijing had measures in place to minimise losses for its companies.“Mentally and materially, China is much better prepared than its US counterpart,” the newspaper said.However, factories in Chinese coastal regions have suffered declines of up to 40% in sales to the US, increasing the pressure on Xi to find a way to sign a deal.In April, Chinese exports to the US plunged 13% compared with a year ago, and are down 9.7% since the start of 2019. Total Chinese exports fell 2.7% in April. Imports of American goods tumbled 26%.

1737,"Donald Trump has accused China of “breaking” a deal it had reached in trade talks with the US, as the two countries moved to within 36 hours of a full-scale trade war and the US trade representative’s office filed the formal paperwork needed to increase duties on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods.Speaking at a rally in Florida on Wednesday night, the US president said: “By the way, you see the tariffs we’re doing? … Because they broke the deal. They broke the deal. So they’re flying in, the vice premier tomorrow’s flying in – good man – but they broke the deal. They can’t do that, so they’ll be paying.”The president added: “If we don’t make the deal, nothing wrong with taking it over $100bn a year – $100bn, we never did that before.”Beijing said it would be forced to impose “necessary countermeasures” if the increases take effect on Friday, though it gave no details of what that would entail. “China deeply regrets that if the US tariff measures are carried out, China will have to take necessary countermeasures,” said the commerce ministry in a statement.The last-minute sparring came after Washington published a list of imported products that will face higher tariffs from Friday.Trump earlier held out the prospect that China would make concessions at an 11th-hour meeting in Washington but financial markets – unsettled by the most serious threat of protectionism since the 1930s – were downbeat about a breakthrough. China has threatened to retaliate against any step up in US action.Share prices have been rising since the turn of the year on hopes that the world’s two biggest economies would settle their differences.But the mood has darkened in the past week after the Trump administration accused Beijing of backtracking on measures the US believed had been agreed. These included addressing issues such as the theft of US intellectual property and trade secrets; the forced transfer of technology; competition policy; access to financial services and currency manipulation.After a fall of almost 500 points on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed with little change on Wednesday but the jittery mood led to investors seeking out traditional safe havens such as gold.Washington said China was seeking to renege on its commitments, rendering the 150-page draft agreement worthless. The US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has been insisting China make changes to its domestic laws to prove it would not renege on the deal.But the US found in each of the seven chapters of the draft trade deal, China had deleted commitments, raising doubts in Washington about whether Beijing would comply. As a result, Trump has said he will end the moratorium on higher tariffs on Chinese imports that has been in place since a truce was called at the end of 2018.The US president said he hoped a Chinese delegation – due to arrive in the US on Thursday and led by vice-premier Liu He – would do a deal in this week’s talks but also made it clear Washington was prepared to ratchet up tariffs.Trump tweeted: “The reason for the China pullback & attempted renegotiation of the Trade Deal is the sincere HOPE that they will be able to “negotiate” with Joe Biden or one of the very weak Democrats, and thereby continue to ripoff the United States (($500 Billion a year)) for years to come.“Guess what, that’s not going to happen! China has just informed us that they (Vice-Premier) are now coming to the US to make a deal. We’ll see, but I am very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers...great for U.S., not good for China!”The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – leaving a trade deficit of $419.2bn.The president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where Trump is seeking changes to Beijing’s trade policy.Tariffs have been imposed by Washington on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year. They came on top of broader tariffs used by Trump that have hit China and other trading partners such as the EU, Canada and Mexico, on goods including steel and aluminium.In May 2019 the US president further ratcheted up existing import tariffs of 10% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods sold in the US to 25%, hitting everything on a long list of products. Trump has previously warned that 25% tariffs could be slapped on a further $325bn of goods in future – which would mean all Chinese imports being covered by tariffs.Richard Partington and Jasper JollyThousands of Chinese products, including fruit, vegetables and manufactured goods, would be affected by a decision to raise tariffs, while the US has indicated that it would also be prepared to target the $325bn of imports that are not subject to higher duties.Analysts said any escalation in the trade war would hurt China more than the US. Jennifer McKeown, of Capital Economics, said goods exports to the US accounted for 3.2% of China’s national output, while exports to China made up only 0.6% of US gross domestic product. So far, McKeown added, tariffs had knocked 0.4 points off China’s growth and 0.2% off US growth.“We think that the direct effect of an increase in the tariff on the $200bn list to 25% would be to hit Chinese GDP by around another 0.1 percentage points. If the 25% tariff were extended to the rest of Chinese exports to the US that might knock a further 0.3 percentage points off GDP. The effects on the US would probably be minimal, due to the lesser importance of trade with China and the fact that China would struggle to retaliate as it is running out of imports to tax.”Liam Fox, the UK’s trade secretary, said he understood the Trump administration’s frustration with China over issues such as forced technology transfers and the dumping of goods on global markets but the

1808,"China’s chief trade negotiator will travel to Washington this week, according to the commerce ministry, tempering fears that talks to resolve a protracted trade war between the US and Beijing had been scuppered.Liu He, a vice-premier, will hold negotiations in Washington on Thursday and Friday, according to the Chinese ministry, which did not elaborate on the agenda.Beijing has been largely muted in its response to Donald Trump’s threat on Sunday to raise tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods by the end of the week. On Monday, the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, said China had gone back on commitments previously made in talks.Speaking on Tuesday at a regular press briefing, Geng Shuang, the foreign ministry spokesman, said: “Adding tariffs can’t resolve any problem. Talks are by their nature a process of discussion. It is normal for both sides to have differences. China won’t shun problems and is sincere about continuing talks.”While the official Chinese stance has remained restrained, an editorial published in state media outlets including the People’s Daily and Xinhua took a stronger line, calling out the US for attempting to place “extreme pressure” on China.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – leaving a trade deficit of $419.2bn.The president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where Trump is seeking changes to Beijing’s trade policy.Tariffs have been imposed by Washington on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year. They came on top of broader tariffs used by Trump that have hit China and other trading partners such as the EU, Canada and Mexico, on goods including steel and aluminium.In May 2019 the US president further ratcheted up existing import tariffs of 10% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods sold in the US to 25%, hitting everything on a long list of products. Trump has previously warned that 25% tariffs could be slapped on a further $325bn of goods in future – which would mean all Chinese imports being covered by tariffs.Richard Partington and Jasper Jolly“The US needs to recognise the situation and see where its best interest[s] lie … before that day, maintaining strength is the most important factor in dealing with the Sino-US issue. No matter what the situation is, the pace of our development will not change and cannot change,” said the editorial, published under the WeChat account Taoran Notes.“Things we believe are advantageous for us, we will do without anyone asking. Things that are unfavourable to us, no matter how you ask, we will not take any step back. Don’t even think about it,” the editorial said, adding that the Chinese economy’s recent recovery shows the country’s resilience.Bai Ming, the deputy director of the commerce ministry’s international market research institute, told the state-run Global Times on Monday: “The US should know by now that China will never give in to pressure.”Despite signalling its resolute stance, the fact that China is still sending a delegation may be a sign of Beijing’s eagerness to reach a deal.Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics, said: “China needs a deal more than the US, and the last thing it wants is to see tariffs go up to 25%” She pointed out the resumption of talks is a cause for optimism. “This is a positive sign, although it doesn’t mean there won’t be more nasty bumps along the road to a deal,” Choyleva said.On Tuesday, Germany’s economy minister and France’s finance minister both called on the US and China to resolve the trade war. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said: “For us at the IMF, it’s imperative that trade tensions are resolved in a way satisfying for everyone, because clearly tensions between the US and China are the threat to the global economy.”",China confirms vice-premier Liu He will visit US for trade talks,2019-05-07/12:13:48,china s chief trade negotiator will travel to washington this week according to the commerce ministry tempering fears that talks to resolve a protracted trade war between the us and beijing had been scuppered liu he a vice premier will hold negotiations in washington on thursday and friday according to the chinese ministry which did not elaborate on the agenda beijing has been largely muted in its response to donald trump s threat on sunday to raise tariffs from  to  on bn bn of chinese goods by the end of the week on monday the us trade representative robert lighthizer said china had gone back on commitments previously made in talks speaking on tuesday at a regular press briefing geng shuang the foreign ministry spokesman said adding tariffs can t resolve any problem talks are by their nature a process of discussion it is normal for both sides to have differences china won t shun problems and is sincere about continuing talks while the official chinese stance has remained restrained an editorial published in state media outlets including the people s daily and xinhua took a stronger line calling out the us for attempting to place extreme pressure on china the roots of the dispute come from us president donald trump s america first project to protect the us position as the world s leading economy while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the us and to manufacture their products there trump complains of a large trade deficit with china which he views as a symbol of the us s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse chinese imports to the us totalled  bn last year while  bn was sold the other way leaving a trade deficit of  bn the president has accused beijing of unfair trade policies including allowing the theft of us companies intellectual property the threat of import tariffs on chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where trump is seeking changes to beijing s trade policy tariffs have been imposed by washington on some chinese goods sold in the us for about a year they came on top of broader tariffs used by trump that have hit china and other trading partners such as the eu canada and mexico on goods including steel and aluminium in may  the us president further ratcheted up existing import tariffs of  on bn bn of chinese goods sold in the us to  hitting everything on a long list of products trump has previously warned that  tariffs could be slapped on a further bn of goods in future which would mean all chinese imports being covered by tariffs richard partington and jasper jolly the us needs to recognise the situation and see where its best interest s lie before that day maintaining strength is the most important factor in dealing with the sino us issue no matter what the situation is the pace of our development will not change and cannot change said the editorial published under the wechat account taoran notes things we believe are advantageous for us we will do without anyone asking things that are unfavourable to us no matter how you ask we will not take any step back don t even think about it the editorial said adding that the chinese economy s recent recovery shows the country s resilience bai ming the deputy director of the commerce ministry s international market research institute told the state run global times on monday the us should know by now that china will never give in to pressure despite signalling its resolute stance the fact that china is still sending a delegation may be a sign of beijing s eagerness to reach a deal diana choyleva the chief economist at enodo economics said china needs a deal more than the us and the last thing it wants is to see tariffs go up to  she pointed out the resumption of talks is a cause for optimism this is a positive sign although it doesn t mean there won t be more nasty bumps along the road to a deal choyleva said on tuesday germany s economy minister and france s finance minister both called on the us and china to resolve the trade war christine lagarde the head of the international monetary fund said for us at the imf it s imperative that trade tensions are resolved in a way satisfying for everyone because clearly tensions between the us and china are the threat to the global economy ,US China Trade War,0.306030809879303
1856,"Donald Trump has escalated the trade war with China by announcing plans to hike the tariff imposed on $200bn of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on Friday.The US president also threatened to impose tariffs on all Chinese trade with America, a move that could further destabilise relations between the two economic powers.The move prompted sharp falls in stocks in Asia Pacific on Monday with China’s blue chip stock index dropping 4% – its biggest fall for two months – while the Hang Seng fell 2.5%. Fears that Trump’s comments could sink the trade talks were compounded when the editor of China’s Global Times newspaper said on Monday that China’s vice premier Liu He was now “very unlikely” to go to the United States this week.“Let Trump raise tariffs. Let’s see when trade talks can resume,” Hu Xijin said in a tweet.Trump announced the move on Twitter, complaining that negotiations between the two countries were proceeding too slowly.He tweeted: For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods. These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results. The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday. 325 Billions Dollars....The move will affect more than 5,000 products made by Chinese farms and factories, from fresh and frozen food to chemicals, textiles, metalwork, building materials, electronics and consumer goods.Trump originally imposed a 10% tariff on these goods last September in an attempt to cut America’s trade deficit with China and force concessions on issues such as intellectual property rights. It had been scheduled to jump to 25% in January but the president held back while talks between the two sides continued.Currently, almost half of China’s sales to America are affected by tariffs and Trump is now aiming for the remaining $325bn.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse.

2235,"As China fetes its Belt and Road initiative at a summit this week, Chinese officials will be working hard to defend the flagship project from growing international criticism.The three-day forum starting on Thursday is meant to promote Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s “project of the century”, a foreign policy initiative launched in 2013 to revive ancient trading routes between Asia and Europe, as well as build new links in the Middle East, Africa, and South America.But in contrast to its first summit two years ago, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) takes place in a much less welcoming environment. Critics say the initiative is an effort to cement Chinese influence around the world by financially binding countries to Beijing by way of “debt trap diplomacy”.“The ‘Belt and Road initiative’ (BRI) is not a geopolitical tool but a platform for cooperation,” Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said last week, ahead of the forum “We welcome all parties to take part in it.”This week’s event is especially important for Beijing, which uses the forum as a way to convince the international community, as well as its own citizens, of the success of the project.Beijing is likely to laud the memoranda of understanding signed at the event, which will conclude with a joint communique.“The overall purpose of the Belt and Road initiative is to generate legitimacy for the Chinese leadership and the Chinese Communist Party more broadly,” said Thomas Eder, a research associate at the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies.“Such prestige is bolstered by every government signing a BRI memorandum of understanding and every head of government attending a grand BRI summit in Beijing. These countries allow Xi Jinping to then tell Chinese citizens that the entire world is endorsing his policies and that he is the one to have put China firmly back at the centre of the global stage,” Eder said.The event is to be attended by 37 leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte, UK chancellor Philip Hammond, Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan and the heads of state of the 10 Asean (Association of South-east Asian Nation) states. The US is reportedly sending low-level delegates, and India is not attending.Countries that previously attended but have chosen not to come this year include Turkey, which has publicly criticised China over is treatment of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority, Poland, Spain, Fiji, Sri Lanka, and Argentina, according to the Eurasia Group, citing geopolitical issues as a possible reason.Critics have also called for China to institutionalise the Belt and Road initiative, so that the project is not seen as entirely Chinese-led. Others have cited environmental concerns, as Chinese companies build coal power projects around the world. Coal projects accounted for as much as 42% of China’s overseas investment in 2018, according to the China Global Energy Finance database.“For the sake of the planet, for people who could be breathing in pollutants from coal plants and for the long-term economic health of many developing countries, let’s hope BRI quits coal,” said Wawa Wang, senior adviser at VedvarendeEnergi in Denmark.Ahead of the forum, China has scored some key wins for the project. Italy is now the first G7 country to endorse the initiative, after signing up for Belt and Road in March, despite criticism from the US. This month, Malaysia agreed to continue a $10.7bn rail project, previously cancelled.So far, China has signed more than 170 agreements with 125 countries, according to Chinese state media. Between 2013 and 2018, these deals totalled more than $90bn in Chinese investment.Beijing has also begun to take some steps to soothe concerns. Officials are reportedly drafting rules on which projects can be called “Belt and Road”, to prevent the initiative’s brand from being diluted by unsuccessful projects. Chinese ambassadors in Kenya and Mexico have published editorials in local media defending the initiative.On Friday, Xi will give a keynote address, where he is likely to strike a similar tone. “The Belt and Road is an initiative for economic cooperation, instead of a geopolitical alliance or military league, and it is an open and inclusive process rather than an exclusive bloc or ‘China club’,” Xi said in remarks given at a symposium in August.",Belt and Road forum: China's 'project of the century' hits tough times,2019-04-25/01:29:14,as china fetes its belt and road initiative at a summit this week chinese officials will be working hard to defend the flagship project from growing international criticism the three day forum starting on thursday is meant to promote chinese leader xi jinping s project of the century a foreign policy initiative launched in  to revive ancient trading routes between asia and europe as well as build new links in the middle east africa and south america but in contrast to its first summit two years ago the belt and road initiative bri takes place in a much less welcoming environment critics say the initiative is an effort to cement chinese influence around the world by financially binding countries to beijing by way of debt trap diplomacy the belt and road initiative bri is not a geopolitical tool but a platform for cooperation chinese foreign minister wang yi said last week ahead of the forum we welcome all parties to take part in it this week s event is especially important for beijing which uses the forum as a way to convince the international community as well as its own citizens of the success of the project beijing is likely to laud the memoranda of understanding signed at the event which will conclude with a joint communique the overall purpose of the belt and road initiative is to generate legitimacy for the chinese leadership and the chinese communist party more broadly said thomas eder a research associate at the mercator institute for chinese studies such prestige is bolstered by every government signing a bri memorandum of understanding and every head of government attending a grand bri summit in beijing these countries allow xi jinping to then tell chinese citizens that the entire world is endorsing his policies and that he is the one to have put china firmly back at the centre of the global stage eder said the event is to be attended by  leaders including russian president vladimir putin italian prime minister giuseppe conte uk chancellor philip hammond pakistan s prime minister imran khan and the heads of state of the  asean association of south east asian nation states the us is reportedly sending low level delegates and india is not attending countries that previously attended but have chosen not to come this year include turkey which has publicly criticised china over is treatment of the uighurs a muslim minority poland spain fiji sri lanka and argentina according to the eurasia group citing geopolitical issues as a possible reason critics have also called for china to institutionalise the belt and road initiative so that the project is not seen as entirely chinese led others have cited environmental concerns as chinese companies build coal power projects around the world coal projects accounted for as much as  of china s overseas investment in  according to the china global energy finance database for the sake of the planet for people who could be breathing in pollutants from coal plants and for the long term economic health of many developing countries let s hope bri quits coal said wawa wang senior adviser at vedvarendeenergi in denmark ahead of the forum china has scored some key wins for the project italy is now the first g country to endorse the initiative after signing up for belt and road in march despite criticism from the us this month malaysia agreed to continue a  bn rail project previously cancelled so far china has signed more than  agreements with  countries according to chinese state media between  and  these deals totalled more than bn in chinese investment beijing has also begun to take some steps to soothe concerns officials are reportedly drafting rules on which projects can be called belt and road to prevent the initiative s brand from being diluted by unsuccessful projects chinese ambassadors in kenya and mexico have published editorials in local media defending the initiative on friday xi will give a keynote address where he is likely to strike a similar tone the belt and road is an initiative for economic cooperation instead of a geopolitical alliance or military league and it is an open and inclusive process rather than an exclusive bloc or china club xi said in remarks given at a symposium in august ,US China Trade War,0.18346986174583435
2805,"Donald Trump has threatened to impose US tariffs on $11bn (£8.4bn) of goods from the EU, raising the stakes in the transatlantic trade dispute between the world’s two largest economic superpowers.The Trump administration announced the additional levies on EU goods – including roquefort and stilton cheese, wine and aircraft parts – as a response to subsidies for Airbus, the European aerospace and defence group, which it said were harmful to the US.The latest threat by the White House to slap higher import tariffs on a major trading partner comes after a long-running dispute between the US and the EU over their state subsidy support for Airbus and Boeing, the world’s two biggest civil aerospace firms.The tit-for-tat battle stretches back almost 15 years, with both sides arguing their case at the World Trade Organization, the global arbiter of trading disputes, to set the size of any appropriate countermeasures to state subsidies.Trump tweeted on Tuesday complaining about the tariffs.The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products! The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!The Trump administration released a 14-page list of EU goods that could attract a higher tariff, including several symbolic targets such as “French cheese”, roquefort cheese, wine, champagne, olive oil and seafood such as oysters.Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the US to slap tariffs on EU goods. An Airbus spokesman said it had taken measures to comply with “relatively minor” outstanding requirements required by the WTO and that US talk of $11bn worth of damage from EU subsidies to Airbus was excessive.EU officials have also started to prepare retaliatory measures in relation to subsidies given to Boeing by the US government, according to Reuters.The dispute comes at an increasingly delicate time for world trade, which is slowing in part because of concerns over Trump’s protectionist policies. Washington has placed tariffs of 10% on $200bn of Chinese imports in a dispute with Beijing, although the two sides are due to resume talks to agree a deal later this month.There are also fears the US could impose tariffs on EU cars, which would have a far greater impact on the European economy at a time when growth is already slowing in the eurozone.",Trump threatens tariffs on $11bn of EU imports such as food and wine,2019-04-09/19:20:16,donald trump has threatened to impose us tariffs on bn  bn of goods from the eu raising the stakes in the transatlantic trade dispute between the world s two largest economic superpowers the trump administration announced the additional levies on eu goods including roquefort and stilton cheese wine and aircraft parts as a response to subsidies for airbus the european aerospace and defence group which it said were harmful to the us the latest threat by the white house to slap higher import tariffs on a major trading partner comes after a long running dispute between the us and the eu over their state subsidy support for airbus and boeing the world s two biggest civil aerospace firms the tit for tat battle stretches back almost  years with both sides arguing their case at the world trade organization the global arbiter of trading disputes to set the size of any appropriate countermeasures to state subsidies trump tweeted on tuesday complaining about the tariffs the world trade organization finds that the european union subsidies to airbus has adversely impacted the united states which will now put tariffs on  billion of eu products the eu has taken advantage of the u s on trade for many years it will soon stop the trump administration released a  page list of eu goods that could attract a higher tariff including several symbolic targets such as french cheese roquefort cheese wine champagne olive oil and seafood such as oysters airbus said it saw no legal basis for the us to slap tariffs on eu goods an airbus spokesman said it had taken measures to comply with relatively minor outstanding requirements required by the wto and that us talk of bn worth of damage from eu subsidies to airbus was excessive eu officials have also started to prepare retaliatory measures in relation to subsidies given to boeing by the us government according to  the dispute comes at an increasingly delicate time for world trade which is slowing in part because of concerns over trump s protectionist policies washington has placed tariffs of  on bn of chinese imports in a dispute with beijing although the two sides are due to resume talks to agree a deal later this month there are also fears the us could impose tariffs on eu cars which would have a far greater impact on the european economy at a time when growth is already slowing in the eurozone ,US China Trade War,0.23673823475837708
3644,"The rise of online platforms for buying and selling goods has fuelled a rapid increase in fake merchandise sold around the world, the value of which has reached $590bn (£384.4bn) a year, according to a report.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Union’s intellectual property office (EUIPO) found illicit goods, from designer handbags to luxury watches, accounted for as much as 3.3% of total international trade in 2016, up from 2.5% ($461bn) in 2013.The surge, identified using the latest available customs seizure data from the EU and several other border forces around the world, came even as global trade volumes fell over the same period, suggesting a rapid escalation in trading of fake goods.Customs officials noted the most frequently seized imported fakes were items of footwear, followed by clothing, leather goods and IT equipment, with postal parcels the most popular way to ship counterfeit and pirated products.Other items seized included counterfeit guitars, jewellery, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, spare parts, luxury watches, food and drink, and medical equipment.The boom in fakes comes as technology makes it easier to buy and sell goods online, with the report highlighting “digital platforms which help connect supply and demand globally” as having a particular impact.It also said there had been a “dramatic increase in the number of parcels crossing borders” as the sale of fake goods moved from bulk road, air and sea deliveries to smaller packages.The report pinpointed China as by far the biggest country of origin for fake goods, and at the centre of a complex web of other countries used for shipping illicit goods. India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam were also identified as major sources of illicit goods, although considerably behind China.China was the top producer of fake goods in nine out of 10 categories, including the most popular category, footwear, where as much as 27% of all goods seized could be traced back to the country, according to the report.The alleged theft of intellectual property is among the biggest gripes of Donald Trump, the US president, in his trade dispute with China.Almost 24% of the $590bn of goods seized in the study were subject to intellectual property rights held by US owners. Other rights holders in France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and the UK were also affected.The findings are likely to understate the true scale of the trade in illicit merchandise around the world, as items are likely to slip through the net, while the figures do not include domestically produced and consumed items, and pirated digital content.Marcos Bonturi, the OECD’s public governance director, said: “Counterfeit trade takes away revenues from firms and governments and feeds other criminal activities. It can also jeopardise consumers’ health and safety.”","Online retail fuelling rapid rise in sales of fake goods, says OECD",2019-03-18/18:09:38+0000,the rise of online platforms for buying and selling goods has fuelled a rapid increase in fake merchandise sold around the world the value of which has reached bn  bn a year according to a report the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd and the european union s intellectual property office euipo found illicit goods from designer handbags to luxury watches accounted for as much as   of total international trade in  up from   bn in  the surge identified using the latest available customs seizure data from the eu and several other border forces around the world came even as global trade volumes fell over the same period suggesting a rapid escalation in trading of fake goods customs officials noted the most frequently seized imported fakes were items of footwear followed by clothing leather goods and it equipment with postal parcels the most popular way to ship counterfeit and pirated products other items seized included counterfeit guitars jewellery pharmaceuticals chemicals spare parts luxury watches food and drink and medical equipment the boom in fakes comes as technology makes it easier to buy and sell goods online with the report highlighting digital platforms which help connect supply and demand globally as having a particular impact it also said there had been a dramatic increase in the number of parcels crossing borders as the sale of fake goods moved from bulk road air and sea deliveries to smaller packages the report pinpointed china as by far the biggest country of origin for fake goods and at the centre of a complex web of other countries used for shipping illicit goods india malaysia pakistan thailand turkey and vietnam were also identified as major sources of illicit goods although considerably behind china china was the top producer of fake goods in nine out of  categories including the most popular category footwear where as much as  of all goods seized could be traced back to the country according to the report the alleged theft of intellectual property is among the biggest gripes of donald trump the us president in his trade dispute with china almost  of the bn of goods seized in the study were subject to intellectual property rights held by us owners other rights holders in france italy switzerland germany and the uk were also affected the findings are likely to understate the true scale of the trade in illicit merchandise around the world as items are likely to slip through the net while the figures do not include domestically produced and consumed items and pirated digital content marcos bonturi the oecd s public governance director said counterfeit trade takes away revenues from firms and governments and feeds other criminal activities it can also jeopardise consumers health and safety ,US China Trade War,0.15959031879901886
4446,"China’s ambassador to the UK has fired an unmistakable warning shot in the direction of the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, accusing him of “resurrecting the cold war and gunboat diplomacy”, after the cabinet minister said the UK would send an aircraft carrier to the Pacific to challenge China.Writing in the Guardian, Liu Xiaoming did not name Williamson but accused “a certain British politician” of hyping up the “China threat”.In a speech this month, Williamson announced that the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth would be sent to the Pacific, where Beijing has been involved in a dispute over territorial claims in the South China Sea, for its first operational cruise, expected to be in 2021. He said the UK was prepared to use lethal force to deter countries that flouted international law, in an apparent reference to Chinese expansion.In a clear response to Williamson, the Chinese ambassador writes: “In an age when hot and cold wars should be long gone, resurrecting the cold war and gunboat diplomacy from the grave, as this certain politician did, was anachronistic and risks disrupting the progress of China-UK relations.”It is understood that a trade trip to China, due to be undertaken by the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, was cancelled in the wake of the offence caused by the Williamson speech.The defence secretary’s remarks were also sharply criticised by George Osborne, the former chancellor and a firm advocate of a close British-China relationship. Osborne described the remarks as “gunboat diplomacy of a quite old-fashioned kind”.There is a lively debate inside the UK government about whether the UK needs to take a more combative approach towards China, including at the United Nations and in Africa.The Chinese ambassador sets out in his article the clear parameters of a future relationship, saying: “China and the UK must resist this disruption and keep the larger picture in mind.”Calling for the two countries to act in harmony, he writes: “China and the UK rely on mutual respect and mutual trust to keep us in tune and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation.”Without mentioning Brexit, he also points out the potential price of disharmony for the UK, saying: “China is the fastest growing market for UK exports and the UK’s second largest trading partner outside the EU.”He adds: “An open, innovative and inclusive UK is an internationally recognised brand name, and I hope that the UK will continue to provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies including Huawei. This will win more respect, trust and cheers for a ‘global Britain’.”The US is leading a global campaign to keep the Chinese-owned firm Huawei out of the superfast 5G network, but so far UK intelligence chiefs have said the risk posed by the Chinese accessing the phone network is manageable.Australia, New Zealand and the US – all close UK security partners – have decided to exclude Huawei, fearing China will use the access to conduct both industrial and political espionage. The National Cyber Security Centre said on Monday that it had “a unique oversight and understanding of Huawei engineering and cybersecurity”.The ambassador also seeks to position China as an advocate of multilateralism, in unstated contrast to America. Urging the UK to “reject the chaotic disruption of rigidity and narrow-mindedness”, he claims: “Both China and the UK support multilateralism, free trade and rule-based international trade system. Both are permanent members of the UN security council and countries with global influence. We have a responsibility to oppose unilateralism and protectionism and build an open world economy.”A Ministry of Defence source stressed that Williamson’s speech had been signed off by Downing Street and the Foreign Office, and he made no specific mention of the South China Sea in the speech, only to the Pacific.Asked about the Chinese ambassador’s comments, Williamson said it was important to work with other nations in the region “in order to uphold international law”.Additional reporting by Caroline Davies",Chinese envoy hits back at Williamson's 'gunboat diplomacy',2019-02-26/14:01:59+0000,china s ambassador to the uk has fired an unmistakable warning shot in the direction of the defence secretary gavin williamson accusing him of resurrecting the cold war and gunboat diplomacy after the cabinet minister said the uk would send an aircraft carrier to the pacific to challenge china writing in the guardian liu xiaoming did not name williamson but accused a certain british politician of hyping up the china threat in a speech this month williamson announced that the aircraft carrier hms queen elizabeth would be sent to the pacific where beijing has been involved in a dispute over territorial claims in the south china sea for its first operational cruise expected to be in  he said the uk was prepared to use lethal force to deter countries that flouted international law in an apparent reference to chinese expansion in a clear response to williamson the chinese ambassador writes in an age when hot and cold wars should be long gone resurrecting the cold war and gunboat diplomacy from the grave as this certain politician did was anachronistic and risks disrupting the progress of china uk relations it is understood that a trade trip to china due to be undertaken by the chancellor phillip hammond was cancelled in the wake of the offence caused by the williamson speech the defence secretary s remarks were also sharply criticised by george osborne the former chancellor and a firm advocate of a close british china relationship osborne described the remarks as gunboat diplomacy of a quite old fashioned kind there is a lively debate inside the uk government about whether the uk needs to take a more combative approach towards china including at the united nations and in africa the chinese ambassador sets out in his article the clear parameters of a future relationship saying china and the uk must resist this disruption and keep the larger picture in mind calling for the two countries to act in harmony he writes china and the uk rely on mutual respect and mutual trust to keep us in tune and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation without mentioning brexit he also points out the potential price of disharmony for the uk saying china is the fastest growing market for uk exports and the uk s second largest trading partner outside the eu he adds an open innovative and inclusive uk is an internationally recognised brand name and i hope that the uk will continue to provide a fair transparent and non discriminatory business environment for chinese companies including huawei this will win more respect trust and cheers for a global britain the us is leading a global campaign to keep the chinese owned firm huawei out of the superfast g network but so far uk intelligence chiefs have said the risk posed by the chinese accessing the phone network is manageable australia new zealand and the us all close uk security partners have decided to exclude huawei fearing china will use the access to conduct both industrial and political espionage the national cyber security centre said on monday that it had a unique oversight and understanding of huawei engineering and cybersecurity the ambassador also seeks to position china as an advocate of multilateralism in unstated contrast to america urging the uk to reject the chaotic disruption of rigidity and narrow mindedness he claims both china and the uk support multilateralism free trade and rule based international trade system both are permanent members of the un security council and countries with global influence we have a responsibility to oppose unilateralism and protectionism and build an open world economy a ministry of defence source stressed that williamson s speech had been signed off by downing street and the foreign office and he made no specific mention of the south china sea in the speech only to the pacific asked about the chinese ambassador s comments williamson said it was important to work with other nations in the region in order to uphold international law additional reporting by caroline davies,US China Trade War,0.14468416571617126
4449,"A certain British politician’s hyping up of the “China threat” in a recent speech struck a discordant note with the mainstream view in the UK that the country has a strong and constructive relationship with China. It has led me to think about how much could be learned from the world-class concerts by London’s leading symphony orchestra that I have attended, the beauty of which comes from the harmony of various sounds and the coordination between the players. If the China-UK relationship were compared to a symphony, its success would depend on close coordination between the two countries and a firm resistance to interruptions and noises.In this symphony, China and the UK rely on mutual respect and trust to keep us in tune, and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation.This year marks the 65th anniversary of the establishment of a China-UK diplomatic relationship at the level of chargé d’affaires. The past 65 years have not been all plain sailing: when there was mutual respect and equality, the bilateral relationship leapt forward. Otherwise, the relationship has had to battle against strong headwinds, or even back-pedal. In an age when hot and cold wars should be long gone, resurrecting the cold war and gunboat diplomacy from the grave, as this politician did, was anachronistic and risks disrupting the progress of China-UK relations.Both countries must resist this disruption and keep the larger picture in mind. To do that, they need to view each other’s development as an opportunity rather than a challenge, still less a threat. In particular, we should respect each other’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, core interests and major concerns; we should build mutual trust, expand strategic consensus and handle differences properly so as to ensure that the China-UK relationship develops in the right direction.In the symphony of these relations, mutual benefit, not the pursuit of a zero-sum game, creates consonance. China-UK cooperation has never been deeper and more extensive, and the interests of the two countries have never been more intertwined. This is not only reflected by the £11bn contracts signed during prime minister Theresa May’s visit to China early last year and the first China International Import Expo. It is also reinforced by the fact that China is the fastest-growing market for UK exports and UK’s second largest trading partner outside the EU.Last year, our bilateral trade totalled more than $80bn and UK exports to China increased by 6.9%, much higher than its GDP growth rate. Chinese investment in the UK tops $20bn now and maintains a robust growth momentum, with Chinese companies having invested more over the past five years than the previous 30 years.The bond between the Chinese and British people has never been closer. With the opening of seven new direct flight routes between London and Chinese cities last year, the total number of flights linking the two countries increased to 168 a week, facilitating 1.5m mutual visits every year.Going forward, deeper reform and further opening up in China will create more opportunities for China-UK cooperation, including the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and the second China International Import Expo to be held in China this year. An open, innovative and inclusive UK is an internationally recognised brand name, and I hope that it will continue to provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies, including Huawei. This will win more respect, trust and cheers for a global Britain.The symphony of China-UK relations should also play a rising crescendo of mutual learning and cooperation, and reject the chaotic disruption of rigidity and narrow-mindedness. Both China and the UK support multilateralism, free trade and rule-based international trade system. Both are permanent members of the UN security council and are countries with global influence. We have a responsibility to oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and build an open world economy. We should deliver our consensus on addressing global challenges such as climate change, terrorism, cybersecurity and wildlife protection, and promoting reform of the global governance system. We should enhance exchanges and mutual learning between different civilisations with a view to building a community with a shared future for mankind. I hope and believe that an independent, rationally minded and down-to-earth UK will work with China in the spirit of win-win cooperation to create a better future for our two countries and the rest of the world.Amid profound changes of a kind the world has not seen in a century, a sound, stable, mutually reinforcing and mutually beneficial China-UK relationship is not only in the interests of the two countries and their people, but also a contribution to world peace and development. China and the UK have the strategic vision, political wisdom and creative spirit to seize opportunities, resist disruptions and create a China-UK golden era: a symphony both beautiful and harmonious.

4869,"New Zealand has become the latest target of a propaganda campaign in China’s state-run media, with the English language Global Times newspaper claiming that tourists are cancelling their holidays in retaliation for the country banning Huawei from being involved in the 5G rollout.In November national telecommunications company Spark was temporarily banned from using Huawei equipment in the rollout after New Zealand’s spy agency warned it would pose “significant national security risks”.A report in the English-language Global Times newspaper, a tabloid arm of the Communist party’s official newspaper group, quoted a Beijing resident identified as “Li”, saying that as a result he planned to cancel his holiday to the country and go elsewhere instead.“Is it a kind of robbery? New Zealand stabbed us in the back but asks for our money? This is double-faced,” the paper quoted him as saying.The report, which was picked up by New Zealand media, comes amid a period of unusually tense relations between the two nations. Over the past month a major tourism event between the two countries was put indefinitely on hold, an Air New Zealand plane was turned back from Shanghai, and telecommunications company Huawei launched a high-profile advertising blitz, aimed at pressuring the government to sign off on its participation with the nation-wide 5G rollout.A visit by the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to Beijing was cancelled late in 2018 with no new date confirmed.Associate Professor Jason Young, the director of the New Zealand contemporary China research centre at Victoria university, said he had not been able to find an equivalent of the Global Times article in the Chinese-language press – strongly suggesting the piece was aimed at a New Zealand audience only.The Huawei ban and the Pacific “reset” – New Zealand’s strengthening of ties in the Pacific region to counter growing Chinese influence – have made the New Zealand–China relationship “much bumpier” than under the previous National government, Young says.Other, smaller stressors, have added to the tension. “China’s relationship with a number of western countries over the last couple of years have been quite rocky, especially with the United States. For New Zealand, we’re not immune to such international trends, but we also have a long relationship and there’s a lot of good things continuing,” Young said.New Zealand had close to half a million Chinese tourists in 2018, make it the second-largest source of visitors after Australia.The opposition National party’s leader, Simon Bridges, said the government’s “steadily deteriorating relations” with China were putting the valuable trading relationship at risk. But Ardern said that while the two countries had their “challenges” their ties remained robust.",Huawei ban: Chinese state media claims tourists avoiding New Zealand,2019-02-15/04:46:23+0000,new zealand has become the latest target of a propaganda campaign in china s state run media with the english language global times newspaper claiming that tourists are cancelling their holidays in retaliation for the country banning huawei from being involved in the g rollout in november national telecommunications company spark was temporarily banned from using huawei equipment in the rollout after new zealand s spy agency warned it would pose significant national security risks a report in the english language global times newspaper a tabloid arm of the communist party s official newspaper group quoted a beijing resident identified as li saying that as a result he planned to cancel his holiday to the country and go elsewhere instead is it a kind of robbery new zealand stabbed us in the back but asks for our money this is double faced the paper quoted him as saying the report which was picked up by new zealand media comes amid a period of unusually tense relations between the two nations over the past month a major tourism event between the two countries was put indefinitely on hold an air new zealand plane was turned back from shanghai and telecommunications company huawei launched a high profile advertising blitz aimed at pressuring the government to sign off on its participation with the nation wide g rollout a visit by the new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern to beijing was cancelled late in  with no new date confirmed associate professor jason young the director of the new zealand contemporary china research centre at victoria university said he had not been able to find an equivalent of the global times article in the chinese language press strongly suggesting the piece was aimed at a new zealand audience only the huawei ban and the pacific reset new zealand s strengthening of ties in the pacific region to counter growing chinese influence have made the new zealand china relationship much bumpier than under the previous national government young says other smaller stressors have added to the tension china s relationship with a number of western countries over the last couple of years have been quite rocky especially with the united states for new zealand we re not immune to such international trends but we also have a long relationship and there s a lot of good things continuing young said new zealand had close to half a million chinese tourists in  make it the second largest source of visitors after australia the opposition national party s leader simon bridges said the government s steadily deteriorating relations with china were putting the valuable trading relationship at risk but ardern said that while the two countries had their challenges their ties remained robust ,US China Trade War,0.12841740250587463
5402,"As tensions between China and the US mount over trade and the extradition of a senior Huawei executive, Beijing has reserved its most colourful language for America’s allies.On Tuesday, China’s ministry of foreign affairs called on Canada to “stop pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the US” after the unsealing of a 13-count indictment against the Huawei chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada in December. An editorial in the state-run Global Times put it more bluntly: “You cannot live the life of a whore and expect a monument to your chastity … If Canada insists on wrong practice, it must pay for it.”Analysts say China is trying to isolate the US by going after its allies. Two Canadians remain in detention in China over unspecified allegations of endangering national security and a third was sentenced to death for drug smuggling after a sudden retrial — cases widely believed to be retaliation for Ottawa’s arrest of Meng at the request of the US.“China is trying to divide and conquer. It wants to put maximum pressure on individual countries and not have them band together,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington.Canada is not the only US ally to get on the wrong side of Beijing. Chinese state media called Poland an “accomplice of the US”, saying Warsaw “must pay for the offence” after Polish authorities arrested a Huawei employee on suspicions of espionage.And an Australian-Chinese writer, Yang Hengjun, was detained in China just weeks after Australia voiced concern over China’s detention of Canadian citizens. Australian officials say they do not believe Yang’s arrest is related to the Huawei case.“One tactic the Chinese Communist party appears to be using is to attempt to drive wedges between the US and its allies, with the goal of forcing countries to make a choice between the US and China,” said Samantha Hoffman, an analyst on Chinese security.Under President Xi Jinping, China has departed from a decades-long policy of keeping a low profile, to assert itself more on the international stage. China is wooing more countries with economic projects such as the  “belt and road” initiative, a massive global investment and trade push that will involve more than 70 countries and more than a third of global GDP.As China’s economic presence grows worldwide, its lobbying efforts have expanded to Nato allies and other US partners previously outside the traditional range of US-China competition, according to Rorry Daniels, an Asia security expert and consultant.“What Beijing has done is to give US allies a stake in China’s continued economic growth and to use those economic ties as leverage to reward or punish allies in accordance with China’s interests,” Daniels said.Some say Beijing’s efforts are part of a larger goal of undermining alliances altogether, as the US under Donald Trump has cast doubt on the international system. Over the past year, president Trump has questioned the common defence principle of Nato, which maintains that an attack on one member is an attack on all.“Beijing is taking advantage of an opportunity presented by Washington,” Daniels said. “Beijing has long seen US alliances as a constraint on its ability to use its power to advance its national interests and would like to see these relationships weakened or ended.”In addition to carrots in the form of economic incentives, observers worry Beijing is deploying increasingly larger sticks. Both Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, were detained within 10 days of Meng’s arrest in Canada.That same month, a court suddenly ordered the retrial of Canadian Robert Schellenberg, previously sentenced to 15 years of prison for drug smuggling, in a case that took more than three years to settle.“The Chinese government is making it very difficult for democratic governments to respond. Liberal democracies certainly cannot respond reciprocally to the PRC’s tactics without undermining their own political systems. Governments are also being forced into an ethical dilemma,” Hoffman said.Such efforts could prove counterproductive, with more countries opting to take a harder line against China and blocking Huawei products and services. Germany is considering banning Huawei 5G equipment. New Zealand and Australia have already barred the use of its equipment, while BT in the UK said it had removed Huawei kit.Others point out that China’s efforts are no different from the lobbying and diplomatic campaigns of most countries. “At the very least, they want more people to hear China’s views,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor at Renmin University and expert on US-China relations.“What China is doing is natural, it’s not about exerting pressure. This hasn’t worked in the short term, but in the long term it will — along as China uses appropriate methods and language.”",'Divide and conquer': China puts the pressure on US

interests daniels said some say beijing s efforts are part of a larger goal of undermining alliances altogether as the us under donald trump has cast doubt on the international system over the past

6000,"China has accused the US of trying to suppress its tech companies, as US prosecutors reportedly investigate allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from US businesses.Adding to pressure on the Chinese telecoms firm, US lawmakers have proposed a ban on selling US chips or components to the company.“The real intent of the United States is to employ its state apparatus in every conceivable way to suppress and block out China’s high-tech companies,” said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the foreign affairs ministry, at a regular news briefing on Thursday.She said the reported investigation would be not only “a violation of free and fair business competition but a violation rule of law.”The state-run Global Times called the latest pressure on Huawei a form of “technological McCarthyism” aimed at politicising and blocking Chinese businesses. Hu Xijin, the editor of the paper, said he believed US attitudes toward China had reached a level of “hysteria”.“By escalating its crackdown on Huawei, the US sets a bad precedent of applying McCarthyism in high-tech fields. It deprives a high-tech company of the rights to stay away from politics, focus on technology and market. It is imposing a political label on a Chinese company,” Hu wrote on Twitter.According to the Wall Street Journal, which cited anonymous sources, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) is in the advanced stages of a criminal inquiry that could result in an indictment of Huawei.The newspaper said the DoJ was looking into allegations of theft of trade secrets from Huawei’s US business partners, including a T-Mobile robotic device used to test smartphones.Huawei and the DoJ declined to comment directly on the report.Huawei said: “Huawei and T-Mobile settled their disputes in 2017 following a US jury verdict finding neither damage, unjust enrichment nor wilful and malicious conduct by Huawei in T-Mobile’s trade secret claim.”The move would further escalate tensions between the US and China after the arrest last year in Canada of Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the company’s founder.The case of Meng, under house arrest awaiting proceedings, has inflamed US-China and Canada-China relations.Two Canadians have been detained in China since Meng’s arrest and a third has been sentenced to death on drug trafficking charges – moves observers have seen as attempts by Beijing to pressure Ottawa over her case. China appears to have briefly detained a third Canadian on Wednesday. Ti-Anna Wang was detained at the Beijing airport as she transited from Seoul to Toronto. Chinese police boarded the plane and removed Wang, her husband and infant daughter.“It was a shocking, terrifying and senseless ordeal with no purpose but to bully, punish and intimidate me and my family,” she told The Globe and Mail. She was reportedly separated from her family for two hours. Wang was sent back to Seoul by Chinese authorities, unable to complete her journey home to Toronto. Previously, Wang had been denied entry into China last week, despite having a visa, as she sought to visit her father, a jailed political dissident.Only months ago, Canada and China were eagerly discussing the prospects of a free trade deal.On Wednesday, following a high-level meeting of cabinet ministers and ambassadors, Canada’s minister of foreign affairs Chrystia Freeland once again rebuked China, calling its behaviour “a threat to all countries”.Canada has sought to recruit allies in its fight to win both the release of two detained Canadians and clemency for a third citizen currently facing the death penalty.“Our government has been energetically reaching out to our allies and explaining that the arbitrary detentions of Canadians are not just about Canada. They represent a way of behaving which is a threat to all countries,” said Freeland.China’s vice-premier and economic czar, Liu He, will be traveling to the US on 30 and 31 January for the next round of trade talks between the two countries, the ministry of commerce has said.Huawei, the second-largest global smartphone maker and biggest producer of telecommunications equipment, has for years been under scrutiny in the US over purported links to the Chinese government.Huawei’s reclusive founder Ren Zhengfei, in a rare media interview on Tuesday, forcefully denied accusations that his firm engaged in espionage on behalf of the Chinese government.The tensions came against a backdrop of Donald Trump’s efforts to get more manufacturing on US soil and apply hefty tariffs on Chinese goods for what the US president has claimed are unfair trade practices by Beijing.In a related move, US politicians introduced a bill to ban the export of American parts and components to Chinese telecoms companies that were in violation of US export control or sanctions laws – with Huawei and ZTE the likely targets.The Republican senator Tom Cotton, one of the bill’s sponsors, said: “Huawei is effectively an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist party whose founder and CEO was an engineer for the People’s Liberation Army.”The Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen said in the same statement: “Huawei and ZTE are two sides of the same coin. Both companies have repeatedly violated US laws, represent a significant risk to American national security interests and need to be held accountable.”Last year Trump reached a deal with ZTE that eased tough financial penalties on the firm for helping Iran and North Korea evade American sanctions. Trump said his decision in May to spare ZTE came following an appeal by China’s president, Xi Jinping, to help save Chinese jobs.",China accuses US of suppressing its high-tech

6343,"In China, Kim Jong-un is regarded not only as North Korea’s supreme leader, he is a millennial. As Kim arrived in Beijing on Monday for a three-day visit, Chinese media went out of their way to flatter the young leader.“The millennial who commands the wind and clouds has arrived in Beijing,” wrote Liu Hong, the Chinese editor of a Xinhua affiliate, on his public WeChat account. “To come to China for a heart-to-heart ahead of such momentous change is a sign of the complexity of the situation and the ability of the millennial to seize the moment.”Other publications republished Liu’s commentary.Chinese state media have often highlighted Kim’s age. In 2010, as it became clear Kim would be the successor to his father, Kim Jong-il, People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist party, dedicated a page to Kim, describing him as world’s “the most extraordinary millennial”. In 2012, a CCTV special on Kim hailed him for bringing in younger officials into his government.But referring to Kim as a millennial, specifically a balinghou, or post-80s, a generation in China who grew up in the relative comfort of China’s reform era, is not entirely complimentary. In China, they are often described as self-indulgent, spoiled, and lacking resilience. Among netizens Kim is often referred to as zuiniudebalinghou or “the most badass millennial.”For Kim, the emphasis on his youth serves as a veiled insult in a country where the average age of senior officials was 63 in 2012, the most recent leadership transition. Ties between Pyongyang and Beijing, its closest ally, deteriorated after Kim took office.“It’s serving a dual purpose, both to suggest that based on his youth he could be the right kind of reformer, and as a bit of a put-down,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat.“[Beijing is] happy to be positive toward Kim and North Korea, as long as they establish a hierarchical relationship. They don’t want to put Kim on equal terms with Xi,” he said.Kim’s trip to Beijing this week follows three visits to China last year, a sign ties may be improving, but the relationship remains complicated.“Underlying everything is the fact that North Korea resents being so dependent on Beijing and China wishes North Korea would be a more pliable, less provocative vassal state that embraces the Chinese model of economic reform,” Oba said.",'Most extraordinary millennial' - why does China focus on Kim Jong-un's age?,2019-01-08/08:21:24+0000,in china kim jong un is regarded not only as north korea s supreme leader he is a millennial as kim arrived in beijing on monday for a three day visit chinese media went out of their way to flatter the young leader the millennial who commands the wind and clouds has arrived in beijing wrote liu hong the chinese editor of a xinhua affiliate on his public wechat account to come to china for a heart to heart ahead of such momentous change is a sign of the complexity of the situation and the ability of the millennial to seize the moment other publications republished liu s commentary chinese state media have often highlighted kim s age in  as it became clear kim would be the successor to his father kim jong il people s daily the official newspaper of the communist party dedicated a page to kim describing him as world s the most extraordinary millennial in  a cctv special on kim hailed him for bringing in younger officials into his government but referring to kim as a millennial specifically a balinghou or post s a generation in china who grew up in the relative comfort of china s reform era is not entirely complimentary in china they are often described as self indulgent spoiled and lacking resilience among netizens kim is often referred to as zuiniudebalinghou or the most badass millennial for kim the emphasis on his youth serves as a veiled insult in a country where the average age of senior officials was  in  the most recent leadership transition ties between pyongyang and beijing its closest ally deteriorated after kim took office it s serving a dual purpose both to suggest that based on his youth he could be the right kind of reformer and as a bit of a put down said mintaro oba a former us diplomat beijing is happy to be positive toward kim and north korea as long as they establish a hierarchical relationship they don t want to put kim on equal terms with xi he said kim s trip to beijing this week follows three visits to china last year a sign ties may be improving but the relationship remains complicated underlying everything is the fact that north korea resents being so dependent on beijing and china wishes north korea would be a more pliable less provocative vassal state that embraces the chinese model of economic reform oba said ,US China Trade War,0.1999601423740387
6376,"US and Chinese officials held their first face-to-face negotiations since a 90-day truce was declared in a trade war between Washington and Beijing, in the hope of ending a bruising confrontation between the world’s two largest economies.Hopes that the sixth round of negotiations between the two sides could yield a breakthrough helped Asian shares rise on Monday, combined with optimism about the state of the global economy on the back of strong US jobs figures on Friday.In Tokyo, the Nikkei soared more than 3% and there were also strong positive moves in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney.Talks among mid-level US and Chinese trade representatives were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. Chinese vice-premier and economic czar Liu He unexpectedly attended the talks, according to Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources.After failing to reach an agreement in December when Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met, both sides agreed to suspend tariff increases while holding discussions on technology transfers, as well as intellectual property theft and cybersecurity. If no agreement is reached, US tariffs on $200bn (£160bn) of Chinese goods will increase in March to 25% from the current 10%.Trump said on Sunday that China was under pressure to do a deal amid signs of a slowdown in its economy. “I think China wants to get it resolved. Their economy’s not doing well. I think that gives them a great incentive to negotiate,” he said.Analysts believe the talks were unlikely to produce a major breakthrough but will lay important groundwork for an agreement that both sides appear increasingly eager to reach.“The situation now is that both sides are facing some economic problems. China is facing an export pressure and a likely economic downturn. The US is facing a falling stock market. Thus, both sides are willing to talk and are expecting a deal,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “I think it’s possible to reach a deal before March if both sides talk and move fast,” he said.China’s leaders in particular are under pressure to end a trade war that is exacerbating an already slowing Chinese economy in which exports, factory output, and consumer confidence have all declined.“China’s slowdown is occurring across the board, affecting almost every industry and region,” said Scott Kennedy, a trade expert focused on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Resolving the trade war or at least finding some common ground with Washington will be needed to fully restore confidence,” he said.The delegation, led by the US deputy trade representative, Jeffrey Gerrish, does not include any top US officials from the administration, a sign the talks will be a precursor to higher-level meetings.Chinese vice-premier Liu He, may travel to Washington in February and Trump may meet the Chinese vice-president, Wang Qishan, at the World Economic Forum in Davos near the end of this month, according to reports.The US delegation includes officials from the Treasury, and energy and agriculture departments, as well as the State Department and the White House, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.“It promises to be the first time that the core of the agenda will centre around the problems caused by Chinese industrial policy and the need to marketise China’s economy,” said Kennedy.“If they can make sufficient progress on identifying the key issues and narrowing in on the possible solutions, that will pave the way for Chinese vice-premier Liu He to visit Washington in the coming weeks,” he added.Key US exports including soya beans, corn and pork, as well as liquefied natural gas, are currently subject to retaliatory tariffs from China. China’s industrial policy, “Made in China 2025”, which the US argues violates World Trade Organization rules, is likely to be a topic of discussion.China is likely to raise the issue of the telecoms firm Huawei, whose global ambitions have been thwarted by a US ban on its products. The arrest in Canada of a senior Huawei official, Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US has spiralled into a diplomatic incident, which includes two Canadians still detained in China.Gerrish, the head of the US delegation, is likely to follow the lead of the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, one of the most hawkish members of the Trump administration. Gerrish has previously described Lighthizer as one of his “incredible mentors”.Observers say that beyond reaching an agreement, a major sticking point will be over how to confirm that both sides uphold it. Chinese officials have reportedly indicated a willingness to establish such a mechanism.“The big issue is not just that an agreement is reached, but verifiability – that China is living up to their end of the bargain,” said Christopher Balding, a former associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC business school in Shenzhen, who writes about the Chinese economy.In recent weeks, Beijing has made some conciliatory gestures, including drafting new rules that would ban forced technology transfers. China has promised to buy more US goods as well as cut tariffs, and improve market access for foreign companies in China. Still, these concessions and economic pressures both sides face may not be enough to bring both sides to a deal.“The US is very wary of Chinese changes as simply being paper reforms that change little on the ground. That perception will be very difficult to overcome,” said Roland Rajah, the director of the international economy programme at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. He said that any agreement is likely to be framed as part of ongoing negotiations, with the threat of tariffs kept in place.He said: “The broader relationship has been deteriorating quite rapidly, meaning neither side want to cave in too much on the substantive issues as they see it as part of a broader and longer term strategic battle.” ",US and China resume trade talks with both eager for

6540,"The Solomon Islands’ government has voted to sever its longstanding ties with Taiwan and take up diplomatic relations with Beijing.The move is a huge blow to self-ruled Taiwan, which has lost six allies since 2016, and to Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January amid rising tension with China. It has sparked protests in the Solomon Islands, according to local media.The Solomon Islands, a country of about 600,000 people in the south Pacific, is the latest country to switch allegiance to China since Tsai came to office in 2016, following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, São Tomé and Príncipe, Panama and El Salvador.Taiwan announced it was severing ties with the Solomon Islands immediately after learning the Pacific nation had decided to switch diplomatic recognition to China, which it said was “extremely regrettable”.“We sincerely regret and strongly condemn their government’s decision to establish diplomatic relations with China,” said President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday.Tsai said Taiwan would close its embassy on Tuesday, lowering its flag at 11:30am local time and recall all technical and medical personnel stationed there.“It is indeed regrettable that their unfinished cooperative projects must come to an end, and it is a loss for Solomon Islands people. However, this is the choice that Solomon Islands’ government has made, leaving us with no other option but to respond in this way,” she said.Tsai accused China of engaging in “dollar diplomacy” in the region in order to undermine Taiwan.“Over the past few years, China has continually used financial and political pressure to suppress Taiwan’s international space,” she said.China’s foreign ministry spokesman welcomed the decision, saying: “The Chinese side highly appreciates the Solomon Islands government’s decision to ... sever the so-called ‘diplomatic relations’ with Taiwan authorities.”Taiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China still views the island as its territory and has vowed to bring it under central control.Over the decades, dozens of countries, including the US and most western nations, have switched recognition to Beijing, leaving just a handful of countries loyal to Taiwan, largely in Latin America and the Pacific.The decision of the Solomon Islands to switch allegiance followed the recommendation of a taskforce commissioned by the Solomon Islands’ government to investigate the benefits to the country of switching ties. The report, released on Friday, advised that the government switch ties to China and invite it to establish a diplomatic mission in the capital, Honiara, on the island of Guadalcanal.“The findings reveal that Solomon Islands stands to benefit a lot if it switches and normalises diplomatic relations with PRC [People’s Republic of China],” the taskforce said.The diplomatic switch reduces the number of countries that recognise Taiwan to 16.The south Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where formal ties with six island nations made up more than a third of its total alliances, though China has in recent years been expanding its influence in the region.The Solomon Islands was by far the largest remaining Pacific ally for Taiwan. Its population of 600,000 is larger than all of Taiwan’s remaining allies in the region – Palau, Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati and Marshall Islands – combined. The nation has had diplomatic relations with Taiwan for 36 years, during which time it has received considerable financial support from Taiwan.“This is a hugely significant win for China,” said Anna Powles, a senior lecturer in security studies from Massey University in New Zealand. “The Pacific has increasingly been a bastion of Taiwanese diplomatic support as its allies elsewhere have switched recognition. The Solomon Islands was the largest of these allies and the question is: who will be the next cab off the rank?

6719,"New Zealand’s opposition leader has been accused of hijacking the government’s foreign policy after displaying what China experts describe as an “alarming” attitude during a visit to Beijing, and meeting a politburo member believed connected to the secret police.Simon Bridges spent five days in China last week and among his engagements was a meeting with politburo member Guo Shengkun, who was previously responsible for the ministry of public security. Guo is secretary of the powerful Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which oversees all law enforcement, including the secret police.In a television interview with Chinese state-owned media organisation CGTN, Bridges said his impression of China’s progress and development was one of “amazement”. “It was always changing … it keeps developing, you can feel the prosperity.”“The last 70 years in China has seen the most remarkable economic transformation in history, it has taken more people out of poverty than ever before.”“All in all it’s an amazing story and it’s one I think New Zealanders relate to because we have been direct beneficiaries of it as well.”Bridges later wrote on Facebook: “Today the economy has been transformed and they are rightly proud of the hundreds of millions who have been lifted out of poverty.”Professor Anne Marie Brady of Canterbury university, an expert on Chinese politics, described Guo as “in charge of China’s secret police”.You can feel the prosperityShe said the Communist party used links with other parties to form bridges with other governments, and in return offered “status, trips to China & BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] events, as well as access to CCP [Chinese Communist party] leaders for business opportunities.”Brady’s alarm at the meeting was echoed by other New Zealand China experts. Stephen Noakes, a senior lecturer in Chinese politics at Auckland university tweeted: “Bridges’ comments re Xi’s China are bonkers.” David Capie, director of the centre for strategic studies at Victoria University of Wellington described Bridges’ comments to CGTN as “extraordinary”.“Alarming to have such a big gap between govt & opposition views/language concerning such a critical relationship.” Capie tweeted.A privilege to be at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to meet with Guo Shengkun to discuss the many areas our countries have in common and how we can strengthen ties. pic.twitter.com/HpX5yNaI2sBridges was also questioned about the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong, and appeared to veer from the New Zealand government’s cautious position by again praising China and failing to mention the democratic right to protest.“We understand and accept China’s sovereignty in Hong Kong. We want to see the peaceful resolution. I think the recent step around the extradition bill, to remove it, that’s been very positive,” Bridges said.A spokesperson for Bridges refused to say if the opposition leader was aware of Guo’s links to secret police, but said the visit to China was paid for out of the leader’s budget.Bridges told New Zealand media that his meetings in China had been overblown mischaracterised and the superpower was a valuable trading partner. Bridges emphatically denied he had had any dealings with the secret police.“You’re coming in about this guy, he’s the secret police guy, what he is is one of the leaders of China – in the top 25 – who is their justice and law and order spokesperson. I’d say with the greatest respect, be a bit responsible”,” Bridges said.Foreign minister Winston Peters has been contacted for comment.",New Zealand opposition leader criticised for 'alarming' stance on China,2019-09-11/03:00:24,new zealand s opposition leader has been accused of hijacking the government s foreign policy after displaying what china experts describe as an alarming attitude during a visit to beijing and meeting a politburo member believed connected to the secret police simon bridges spent five days in china last week and among his engagements was a meeting with politburo member guo shengkun who was previously responsible for the ministry of public security guo is secretary of the powerful central political and legal affairs commission which oversees all law enforcement including the secret police in a television interview with chinese state owned media organisation cgtn bridges said his impression of china s progress and development was one of amazement it was always changing it keeps developing you can feel the prosperity the last  years in china has seen the most remarkable economic transformation in history it has taken more people out of poverty than ever before all in all it s an amazing story and it s one i think new zealanders relate to because we have been direct beneficiaries of it as well bridges later wrote on facebook today the economy has been transformed and they are rightly proud of the hundreds of millions who have been lifted out of poverty professor anne marie brady of canterbury university an expert on chinese politics described guo as in charge of china s secret police you can feel the prosperityshe said the communist party used links with other parties to form bridges with other governments and in return offered status trips to china bri belt and road initiative events as well as access to ccp chinese communist party leaders for business opportunities brady s alarm at the meeting was echoed by other new zealand china experts stephen noakes a senior lecturer in chinese politics at auckland university tweeted bridges comments re xi s china are bonkers david capie director of the centre for strategic studies at victoria university of wellington described bridges comments to cgtn as extraordinary alarming to have such a big gap between govt opposition views language concerning such a critical relationship capie tweeted a privilege to be at the great hall of the people in beijing to meet with guo shengkun to discuss the many areas our countries have in common and how we can strengthen ties pic twitter com hpxynaisbridges was also questioned about the ongoing unrest in hong kong and appeared to veer from the new zealand government s cautious position by again praising china and failing to mention the democratic right to protest we understand and accept china s sovereignty in hong kong we want to see the peaceful resolution i think the recent step around the extradition bill to remove it that s been very positive bridges said a spokesperson for bridges refused to say if the opposition leader was aware of guo s links to secret police but said the visit to china was paid for out of the leader s budget bridges told new zealand media that his meetings in china had been overblown mischaracterised and the superpower was a valuable trading partner bridges emphatically denied he had had any dealings with the secret police you re coming in about this guy he s the secret police guy what he is is one of the leaders of china in the top  who is their justice and law and order spokesperson i d say with the greatest respect be a bit responsible bridges said foreign minister winston peters has been contacted for comment ,US China Trade War,0.12642472982406616
7379,"Even by Donald Trump’s standards his Twitter rant attacking China on Friday was extraordinary. In a series of outbursts Trump “hereby ordered” US companies to stop doing business with China, accused the country of killing 100,000 Americans a year with imported fentanyl and stealing hundred of billions in intellectual property.The attack marked a new low in Sino-US relations and looks certain to escalate a trade war already worrying investors, manufacturers and economists who are concerned that the dispute between the two economic superpowers could trigger a recession.Not so long ago Trump called China’s president, Xi Jinping, “a good friend”. Now he is an “enemy”. How did we get here?On the campaign trail Trump railed against China accusing it of pulling off “one of the greatest thefts in the history of the world” and “raping” the US economy.Trump repeated the word China so often it spawned a viral video of him saying it over and over again. The attacks were a hit with voters and helped get him elected. He has continued lambasting China – to cheers – at rallies ever since.His main beef? The trade deficit.The US imported a record $539.5bn in goods from China in 2018 and sold the Chinese $120.3bn in return. The difference between those two numbers – $419.2bn – is the trade deficit.That deficit has been growing for years as manufacturing has shifted to low-cost China and, according to Trump, it explains the hollowing out of US manufacturing.For Trump, and especially for his adviser Peter Navarro, who once described China as “the planet’s most efficient assassin”, trade deficits represent an existential threat to US jobs and national security. China makes up the largest part of the US trade deficit but those fears are also behind his disputes with the EU, Canada and Mexico.His detractors argue these deficit worries are hyperbole and a result of the US’s stronger economy, which allows consumers to buy goods at cheaper prices.The truth is probably somewhere in between.While it’s true that unemployment is at record lows and consumers continue to prop up the economy, manufacturing jobs have been lost (automation is also to blame for this) and with them wage growth (although the hollowing out of unions plays a part here).But it is not just deficits that concerns Trump.China has a deserved reputation for intellectual property theft. On Friday, Trump estimated China robs the US of “hundreds of billions” a year in ideas.In March, a CNBC poll found one in five US corporations had intellectual property stolen from them within the last year by China.According to the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, the theft costs $600bn a year.Like Tesla, Nio, a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company, is suffering as subsidies for EVs are phased out. Unlike Tesla, Nio has Xi. China is pumping $1.5bn into the company to keep it on the road, the latest in a series of handouts that the Trump administration believes are unfair.Cheap steel and aluminium, subsidized by the Chinese government, are the origins of this trade dispute. According to the White House, last year alone China dumped and unfairly subsidized goods including steel wheels, tool chests and cabinets and rubber bands on to the US market.To be fair the US too is more than willing to bail out its industries (see: the banks or the automakers) at the taxpayers’ expense. But at this point “fair” is not up for discussion.Earlier this month the US officially accused China of manipulating its currency “to gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade”.It was the first time since 1994 that such a complaint has been made official and comes as the dollar has strengthened against world currencies. The dispute adds another layer of tension to a complex situation.China disputed the charge accusing the US of “deliberately destroying international order” with “unilateralism and protectionism”.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears to be on China’s side, arguing the devaluation of the yuan is largely in line with worsening economic conditions in China.The US has now slapped billions of dollars on tariffs on Chinese goods. China retaliated, again, on Friday with more levies on US goods. China’s economic growth has slowed to levels unseen since 1992; US economic forecasts have also been cut. American farmers were the first to feel the result, as China has canceled orders, and manufacturers are increasingly gloomy. So far US consumers have not felt the pinch but JP Morgan estimates the average US household will end up paying an extra $1,000 a year for goods if the latest set of tariffs go through.The unanswerable question is whether any of this will sway Trump. If his supporters continue to see a trade war with China – and the pain it will cause – as the necessary price to Make America Great Again, then the answer is probably no.",Here are the reasons for

7761,"A number of global brands have apologised to Chinese customers for implying that Taiwan and Hong Kong are independent countries, as tensions mount between Hong Kong and Beijing.The Coach and Givenchy luxury labels, the sports brand Asics, the Calvin Klein clothing line and the Fresh beauty brand issued apologies on Monday after Chinese netizens launched online campaigns against them for implying that Taiwan and Hong Kong are not part of China on company websites and on T-shirts.Mass protests in Hong Kong over Beijing’s growing control over the city have fuelled a wave of nationalism on Chinese social media as netizens criticise companies seen as not supporting the one-China principle, that there is only one China represented by the government in Beijing.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongHong Kong is a semi-autonomous territory under Chinese sovereignty, meant to maintain a range of freedoms under the terms of a handover agreement between China and the UK. Beijing claims Taiwan, where a rival government was set up in 1949 and has operated independently since, is still part of China.On Monday, as demonstrators filled Hong Kong’s airport, a popular blogger posted images of a 2018 T-shirt made by Coach, listing Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries separate from China, prompting an online campaign to call out other brands for similar behaviour. The hashtag #CoachinsultedChina soon become the top trending topic on the microblog Weibo and other brands were quickly targeted.“Coach respects and supports China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are fully aware of the severity of this error and deeply regret it,” Coach later wrote in a statement posted on Weibo.Givenchy said in a statement that it “has always respected China’s sovereignty and firmly adhered to the one-China principle”. It said it would take “immediate precautions” to fix mistakes of “human negligence”. Asics, a Japanese corporation, said it supported “Hong Kong and Taiwan as an inseparable part of China’s territory”.Companies increasingly find themselves in the crossfire of tensions over the protests in Hong Kong, which are now entering their third month. Shares in the Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific fell 4% on Monday after Chinese authorities ordered it to suspend any staff supporting the protests from operations in the mainland.On Sunday, Donatella Versace apologised after an online outcry over one of the label’s T-shirts, which had Hong Kong and Macau, another semi-autonomous region of China, as separate countries.Public figures have been making their positions known on social media. The Chinese model Liu Wen said she would be terminating her relationship with Coach, as did two other Chinese celebrities, the actors Guan Xiaotong and Ren Jialun.“I didn’t choose the brand wisely and this has hurt the feelings of Chinese people.

He says in the video, translated and circulated by activists on Saturday: “I am currently being held in Doha airport, about to be deported to Beijing, China. I need the world’s help. I am originally from Hotan.”PLEASE SHARE, A MAN’S LIFE HANGS IN THE BALANCE.‘Ablikim Yusuf’ a #Uyghur from Hotan prefecture of #Xinjiang aka #EastTurkestan.

They said he had left Pakistan on 31 July and was stopped while trying to reach Bosnia. He was brought to Doha International airport, where he was told he would be deported.A representative for Qatar Airways confirmed that Ablikim was booked for a flight departing Doha for Beijing at 11:20am local time on 3 August.“Sending Ablikim back to China would most definitely mean sending him to either concentration camps or prison or worse, his death,” said Salih Hudayar, the founder of the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement, a political and human rights group based in the US.He and other activists were camped outside the Qatari embassy in Washington in the early hours of Saturday morning.“It would also encourage other countries that China is pressing to deport Uighurs, which in turn would encourage China to continue its brutal campaign of persecution. We are shocked that Qatar would even consider this, given it claims to be a defender of Muslim rights,” he said.On Thursday, a senior Xinjiang official said the majority of those kept in the camps, which China describes as voluntary vocational training centres, had been released. Uighurs with relatives still in Xinjiang expressed incredulity and anger.Critics said such statements obscured the fact that ex-detainees had been shifted into forced labour, kept in other forms of police custody, and continued to be heavily surveilled.",Activists scramble to prevent Uighur man's deportation to China,2019-08-03/17:12:13,human rights activists are scrambling to prevent the imminent deportation of a uighur man to china where they say he faces torture ablikim yusuf  who has been living in pakistan posted a desperate video on facebook asking for help from the overseas uighur community he says in the video translated and circulated by activists on saturday i am currently being held in doha airport about to be deported to beijing china i need the world s help i am originally from hotan please share a man s life hangs in the balance ablikim yusuf a uyghur from hotan prefecture of xinjiang aka eastturkestan currently he is being held by qatar authorities at doha airport and he is to be deported to china where he ll likely face a severe punishment pic twitter com elvpwzfjafter the video was shared widely on social media and the campaign gathered momentum ablikim was given leave to stay in qatar for an additional  hours said his lawyer kimberley motley however he still faces the threat of deportation to china on sunday we are desperately trying to convince another government to accept him she said china has come under growing international pressure for its treatment of uighurs and other muslim minorities in the far western region of xinjiang where as many as   million have been detained in secretive internment and re education camps according to activists advocating for ablikim he left xinjiang in  for pakistan they said he had left pakistan on  july and was stopped while trying to reach bosnia he was brought to doha international airport where he was told he would be deported a representative for qatar airways confirmed that ablikim was booked for a flight departing doha for beijing at  am local time on  august sending ablikim back to china would most definitely mean sending him to either concentration camps or prison or worse his death said salih hudayar the founder of the east turkistan national awakening movement a political and human rights group based in the us he and other activists were camped outside the qatari embassy in washington in the early hours of saturday morning it would also encourage other countries that china is pressing to deport uighurs which in turn would encourage china to continue its brutal campaign of persecution we are shocked that qatar would even consider this given it claims to be a defender of muslim rights he said on thursday a senior xinjiang official said the majority of those kept in the camps which china describes as voluntary vocational training centres had been released uighurs with relatives still in xinjiang expressed incredulity and anger critics said such statements obscured the fact that ex detainees had been shifted into forced labour kept in other forms of police custody and continued to be heavily surveilled ,US China Trade War,0.13753676414489746
8084,"Global stocks fell sharply on Friday after Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $300bn (£247.6bn) of Chinese goods in a rapid escalation of the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump is applying pressure to try to force China to narrow the trade deficit – the gap between imports and exports – between the two countries. He complains that China buys fewer US goods than the US buys from China, a gap worth $419.5bn last year. He has also accused Chinese firms of stealing US companies’ intellectual property and called for Beijing to alter its rules.Tariffs are border taxes imposed by one country or economic bloc on goods shipped from a trading partner. The idea is to drive up the cost of those goods to make them less attractive to consumers than domestic produce. The taxes are paid by buyers of goods when they cross the border into the country imposing the tariff.Trump is threatening tariffs of 10% on $300bn of Chinese imports. The White House already levies tariffs of 25% on $250bn of Chinese goods. Adding both together would mean roughly all Chinese imports to the US face higher taxes. China sold $539.7bn of goods to the US last year.Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of up to 25% on US goods worth $113bn. China is constrained by how much further it can go, given that total imports from the US were worth $120.1bn last year. However, the trade war has extended beyond tariffs before, with rules to make life difficult for US or Chinese companies, such as the US blacklisting the Chinese technology company Huawei.The International Monetary Fund has said the US-China trade war is dragging on global growth. Last month it said the conflict would cut growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2019 and 2020 from its April forecasts, at 3.2% and 3.5% respectively. International trade growth has stalled and business investment has been paused because of the uncertainty over trade. Factory output has stalled in several countries including the UK, Germany and Italy, with a knock-on impact on growth. Central banks including the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are under pressure to cut interest rates as a consequence.The escalation from Trump was a surprise and China has said it will not be intimidated – a sign that the conflict will not dissipate quickly. Economists believe tariffs could just be a negotiating tactic and the US president has flip-flopped before, raising hopes of a resolution. Trump could also expand his trade war to involve other nations, as well as the EU. He has tariffs on car imports in his sights, ostensibly to protect the US auto industry.

9065,"Today, 5 July, marks 10 years since the far western Chinese region of Xinjiang exploded into violence between Uighurs, a majority-Muslim group living there, and Han, China’s dominant ethnic group. The incident left at least 196 dead, countless injured, and a government determined to push the Uighurs to the brink.These events have ultimately led to the largest mass arbitrary detention since the second world war – with estimates of about 1 million individuals, possibly more, held against their will. There have been have multiple reports of mistreatment, torture and mysterious deaths at facilities designed to erode ethnic identity that resemble nothing so much as internment camps. At the same time, the region itself has been transformed into a surveillance state not seen anywhere else on Earth.Though 2009 undoubtedly represented a turning point, the current crackdown has deep roots. China asserts that the Xinjiang region has always been an inalienable part of its territory, though Uighurs typically see their rule as illegitimate. Unmistakable colonial practices such as the transfer of Han Chinese to the region have been coupled with policies aimed at asserting Han culture as self-evidently superior.It was the 9/11 attacks and the US-led response to them that offered the Chinese government a new framing for the Xinjiang conflict: it was subsequently portrayed as a struggle against terrorism, despite the fact that the limited separatist movement in Xinjiang bore very little resemblance to the transnational terrorism propagated by the likes of Osama bin Laden.But back to 2009. At a factory in Shaoguan, Guangdong province, six Uighur men were accused of raping two Chinese women. Rioting broke out and at least two Uighurs were killed. Shortly thereafter, video surfaced appearing to show Uighurs being beaten to death by Chinese co-workers. The initial allegations turned out to be false, but this did little to cool tensions. Shaoguan became the spark that lit a powder keg of resentment and hostility between Uighurs and Han, particularly in the regional capital, Urumqi, where the most significant numbers of Han had relocated – incentivised with lucrative employment opportunities.Young Uighurs marched towards the centre of the city in initially peaceful protests that escalated into violent rioting. Groups of young Uighurs attacked Chinese residents, killing many. There were retaliatory attacks in the following days.Amnesty International conducted interviews with eyewitnesses and concluded that security forces made liberal use of live ammunition. Human Rights Watch counted 43 verified cases of enforced disappearance of Uighurs arrested in the aftermath – a number that is likely much higher in reality.In the years after 2009, China went to great lengths to silence those seeking answers about their lost relatives. A noticeable security presence remained for months and was followed by the installation of an extensive network of security cameras and surveillance equipment.Five years on, after a spate of violent attacks including knifings and suicide bombings killed dozens of people inside and outside the region, came the “Strike Hard” campaign.Amendments to national religious regulations imposed further restrictions on religion, followed by legislation on counter-terrorism in 2015 and a deeply problematic law on “de-extremification” in 2017 – which UN experts have called “neither necessary nor proportionate”.China took surveillance to new levels, with mass DNA collection, the installation of street checkpoints where people’s phones were inspected and the use of facial recognition technology.The response from the international community throughout this period was notably muted, including recently, as more evidence of grave abuses has emerged: from the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, who merely “raised the plight of Muslims in Xinjiang” with the Chinese president in April, to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which openly commended China for “providing care to its Muslim citizens” in March, to a growing list of states that have already rolled over to please their (often) biggest trading partner.States need to be reminded that China is not the immovable object that many make it out to be. Chinese leaders have shown themselves remarkably sensitive to criticism.You can trace this in Beijing’s constantly shifting narrative on the camps, indicating that greater scrutiny has had a real effect. From complete denial, to a hastily organised defence, to what we see today – an aggressively offensive propaganda push to refute and reframe reality – China has been forced to develop its counter-narrative.It is now clear that Chinese leaders are concerned that their Orwellian experiment in Xinjiang will come undone if it is met with broad censure from the international community.Until now we haven’t seen anywhere near adequate pushback, given that credible voices argue that China’s action in Xinjiang may constitute crimes against humanity.But if China responds to even the mildest of pressure, imagine what a strong, collective and coordinated response could achieve.• Peter Irwin is programmes manager for the World Uyghur Congress",The world needs to pressure China over the

9182,"Donald Trump has threatened fresh tariffs on $4bn (£3.2bn) of European products including cheese, scotch whisky and olives, ratcheting up pressure on the EU in a long-running row over aircraft subsidies.The US trade representative’s office released a list of 89 additional items – including olives, Italian and Dutch cheese, Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, pasta, coffee and ham – that could face tariffs. These join products worth $21bn that were announced as potential targets for tariffs in April, which included roquefort cheese, wine, champagne, olive oil and seafood such as oysters. The latest list also includes a number of copper products and other metals.The move came days after a truce was reached in the trade war between the US and China.The US and the EU have both threatened to impose tariffs on planes, tractors and food in a tit-for-tat trade row that was sparked by aircraft subsidies given to US aircraft maker Boeing and its European rival, Airbus.Trump imposed a 25% tariff on European steel and 10% on aluminium imports that came into effect in May 2018, as he claimed  “trade wars are good”. The EU responded in February by imposing limits on steel imports.Tariffs are border taxes charged on foreign imports. Importers pay them upon entry to the customs agency of the country or bloc imposing them.Tariffs can be levied in different ways. It can be a flat-rate tariff linked to weight, or calculated as a proportion of the overall value of the goods. It can also be a mixture of both. A country can set a quota, enabling a certain volume of a product to flow in before a higher tariff rate kicks in.Tariffs raise money for governments, but are primarily used to raise the price of foreign goods, protecting domestic producers from global competition.Countries signed up to the World Trade Organization (WTO) must impose tariffs at the same level for all other WTO-member trading partners under the organisation’s “most favoured nation” rule – unless they secure alternative deals with particular countries or trading blocs.Richard PartingtonThe World Trade Organization has found that Boeing and Airbus, the world’s two largest aircraft makers, received billions of dollars of subsidies, in the world’s largest-ever corporate trade dispute. The WTO is expected to rule on the US sanctions request over the summer, although this could be postponed to September.However, during the Paris Air Show in mid-June, Reuters reported that the US could be open to negotiations on an “enforceable mechanism” that would allow Airbus to receive government funding on commercial terms. As part of the deal, the US would make tax incentives provided to Boeing compliant with trade rulings.",Donald Trump threatens new tariffs on $4bn of EU products,2019-07-02/10:23:26,donald trump has threatened fresh tariffs on bn  bn of european products including cheese scotch whisky and olives ratcheting up pressure on the eu in a long running row over aircraft subsidies the us trade representative s office released a list of  additional items including olives italian and dutch cheese scotch whisky irish whiskey pasta coffee and ham that could face tariffs these join products worth bn that were announced as potential targets for tariffs in april which included roquefort cheese wine champagne olive oil and seafood such as oysters the latest list also includes a number of copper products and other metals the move came days after a truce was reached in the trade war between the us and china the us and the eu have both threatened to impose tariffs on planes tractors and food in a tit for tat trade row that was sparked by aircraft subsidies given to us aircraft maker boeing and its european rival airbus trump imposed a  tariff on european steel and  on aluminium imports that came into effect in may  as he claimed trade wars are good the eu responded in february by imposing limits on steel imports tariffs are border taxes charged on foreign imports importers pay them upon entry to the customs agency of the country or bloc imposing them tariffs can be levied in different ways it can be a flat rate tariff linked to weight or calculated as a proportion of the overall value of the goods it can also be a mixture of both a country can set a quota enabling a certain volume of a product to flow in before a higher tariff rate kicks in tariffs raise money for governments but are primarily used to raise the price of foreign goods protecting domestic producers from global competition countries signed up to the world trade organization wto must impose tariffs at the same level for all other wto member trading partners under the organisation s most favoured nation rule unless they secure alternative deals with particular countries or trading blocs richard partingtonthe world trade organization has found that boeing and airbus the world s two largest aircraft makers received billions of dollars of subsidies in the world s largest ever corporate trade dispute the wto is expected to rule on the us sanctions request over the summer although this could be postponed to september however during the paris air show in mid june  reported that the us could be open to negotiations on an enforceable mechanism that would allow airbus to receive government funding on commercial terms as part of the deal the us would make tax incentives provided to boeing compliant with trade rulings ,US China Trade War,0.20710501074790955
10118,"In the end, it was not the ceaseless lying, the Muslim ban, the alleged obstruction of justice, the pandering to white supremacists, the demonization of immigrants, or the climate change denialism that most outraged Donald Trump’s party. The norm-shattering president finally became too much for Republican politicians when he threatened to do something else entirely – impose tariffs on Mexican imports.On Tuesday, Republican senators emerged enraged from a meeting with Trump, unwilling to stomach his threat to level tariffs as high as 25% on Mexican goods in retaliation for migrants crossing the border. Even Senator Ted Cruz, the former Trump punching-bag (“Lyin’ Ted”) who has since become a reliable Trump ally, railed against the proposed tariffs, calling them “new taxes” on Texas farmers, manufacturers and small businesses. Otherwise spineless Republican senators are having this change of heart because of an important political reality: tariffs will make goods more expensive in the states they need to capture in 2020.Like Texas, Michigan would be hit hard by a trade war. Thanks to the automobile industry’s complex supply chains, it is the state most dependent on imports from Mexico – and, as Republicans know all too well, crucial to Trump’s re-election prospects. He is already running 12 points behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders there, according to one recent poll.Trump’s ongoing trade war with China has cost him political capital throughout the midwest, where farmers depend on imports and exports. His approval rating in Iowa has dropped a staggering 21 points since he took office. In Wisconsin, he’s lost 19 points, and in Ohio, 18. Trump’s base alone cannot carry him, especially with so many Democrats motivated to drive him out of office.US President Donald Trump Trump has often repeated that China pays for US tariffs on its goods. 'We have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our treasury; now we have billions coming in' he said on 24 January 2019. On 5 May he tweeted: 'For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA.' But that is not how tariffs work.China's government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by US-registered firms to US customs for the goods they import into the United States. Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of US tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer US importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher US duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if US importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that 'both sides will suffer on this' contradicting the president. This is the only kind of math Republican lawmakers understand, because it speaks to their survival. The most ravenous Republicans will never desert Trump, and his approval rating among party regulars remains strong, but his 2016 success hinged on razor-thin margins in a handful of midwestern states. There is no path to victory without them. Conservatives beyond the cult of Trump comprehend this – that their dear leader is not infallible, that his 30-year obsession with combating trade deficits could be his undoing.He lashes out at allies and trading partners around the globe, a jingoistic braying with no true end-gameTrump, more through instinct than any kind of sober economic analysis, has long understood that the free-trade agreements of the 1990s hastened globalization, punished the American worker, and allowed jobs to flee elsewhere. He violated the GOP’s orthodoxy on free trade and still commandingly won a primary. He knew tacking left on trade wasn’t going to cost him votes.But Trump’s hatred of a globalized world that would cheapen the value of labor is not tied up in any defense of the American worker. If it were, he would embrace strong labor unions, consumer protections, universal healthcare and cheap housing for America’s precarious working class. He rejects actual uplift in favor of lashing out at allies and trading partners around the globe, a jingoistic braying with no true endgame. He says his Mexican tariffs will begin on Monday. And then what?If Trump doesn’t get the immigration concessions from Mexico that he wants, and overrides Republican opposition to impose tariffs starting at 5% on imports, how far will Republicans in Congress go to oppose him?So far, they have been the most pliant class of lawmakers in recent history, tolerating his rank incompetence in the hope he implements enough of the conservative agenda to set Democrats back a generation. Denying science or catering to white supremacists was not enough to foment any kind of rebellion among Republicans in Congress – they, too, reject the reality of climate change and refuse to ostracize the most hateful elements of their base – but tariffs could do the trick, if only because they pose an electoral challenge for Trump 2020.There is no Trump economic policy or Trump government as much as the man himself, executing ill-informed policy on instinct. Dissenting voices have been excised. How far Trump goes with his tariffs will be up to Trump. If Trump is defeated next year, it will be because of Trump – his motives, his decisions, his rage.

10300,"The arrival of three Chinese warships in Sydney harbour was not a surprise, Scott Morrison has said, despite the fact that the government did not announce the visit in advance.On Monday an army frigate, an auxiliary replenishment ship and an amphibious vessel from the People’s Liberation Army were docking at Garden Island for a four-day stopover.It comes on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and only a week after reports of Chinese military tailing Australian navy vessels transiting through the South China Sea.Speaking in the Solomon Islands, the prime minister said the government had “known about that for some time”.“This was an arrangement, a reciprocal visit because Australian naval vessels have visited China,” he said. “They were returning after a counter drug-trafficking operation in the Middle East.“That is a further demonstration of the relationship that we have and this had been in train for some time. It may have been a surprise to others but it certainly wasn’t a surprise to the government.”Asked whether the arrival of the ships was appropriate given the anniversary of the massacre, Morrison said: “No, I think any reading into timing could be subject to a bit of over-analysis.”In the lead up to the anniversary, a Chinese government minister defended the bloody crackdown on student protesters, with the defence minister, General Wei Fenghe, telling a regional security forum in Singapore on Sunday it was the “correct” policy.Morrison said the country’s rare acknowledgement of the event was “not a new position”, but said Australia would “express its views through the foreign minister on that matter” in the coming days.Morrison’s visit to the Solomon Islands is the first by an Australian prime minister since 2008. On Monday he announced a $250m grants program for the country and an easier path for islanders to get work in Australia as part of Australia’s attempts to counter China’s increasing role in the Pacific.China is now the largest trading partner of the Solomon Islands, and is actively courting the country’s leaders to abandon ties with Taiwan and join Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative.The country’s prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, has said he is reviewing the relationship with Taiwan.On Monday, Morrison refused to weigh in, saying it was a decision for the Solomon Islands.“Our relationship, our family relationship with the Solomon Islands is to support them in the decisions that they take as an independent sovereign government and so they will work through their process on that issue,” he said.The US has accused China of undermining stability on issues ranging from the South China Sea to Taiwan. On Monday Morrison warned against viewing China and US relations through a “binary prism”.“I think we have to be careful not to see what are ongoing and upgrading relationships here for Australia and the Pacific through those binary terms of the United States and China,” he said.“They have their interests in the region, as do others. Our relationship with the Solomon Islands, our relationship with the Pacific transcends all of that.“There is a great risk and a great danger in an analysis that only can see the world through those – through such a binary prism.“I certainly don’t. Australia certainly doesn’t. Australia welcomes the economic growth and advancement of China with their economy.”",Three Chinese warships arrive in Sydney Harbour for four-day stopover,2019-06-03/03:30:26,the arrival of three chinese warships in sydney harbour was not a surprise scott morrison has said despite the fact that the government did not announce the visit in advance on monday an army frigate an auxiliary replenishment ship and an amphibious vessel from the people s liberation army were docking at garden island for a four day stopover it comes on the eve of the th anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre and only a week after reports of chinese military tailing australian navy vessels transiting through the south china sea speaking in the solomon islands the prime minister said the government had known about that for some time this was an arrangement a reciprocal visit because australian naval vessels have visited china he said they were returning after a counter drug trafficking operation in the middle east that is a further demonstration of the relationship that we have and this had been in train for some time it may have been a surprise to others but it certainly wasn t a surprise to the government asked whether the arrival of the ships was appropriate given the anniversary of the massacre morrison said no i think any reading into timing could be subject to a bit of over analysis in the lead up to the anniversary a chinese government minister defended the bloody crackdown on student protesters with the defence minister general wei fenghe telling a regional security forum in singapore on sunday it was the correct policy morrison said the country s rare acknowledgement of the event was not a new position but said australia would express its views through the foreign minister on that matter in the coming days morrison s visit to the solomon islands is the first by an australian prime minister since  on monday he announced a m grants program for the country and an easier path for islanders to get work in australia as part of australia s attempts to counter china s increasing role in the pacific china is now the largest trading partner of the solomon islands and is actively courting the country s leaders to abandon ties with taiwan and join beijing s belt and road initiative the country s prime minister manasseh sogavare has said he is reviewing the relationship with taiwan on monday morrison refused to weigh in saying it was a decision for the solomon islands our relationship our family relationship with the solomon islands is to support them in the decisions that they take as an independent sovereign government and so they will work through their process on that issue he said the us has accused china of undermining stability on issues ranging from the south china sea to taiwan on monday morrison warned against viewing china and us relations through a binary prism i think we have to be careful not to see what are ongoing and upgrading relationships here for australia and the pacific through those binary terms of the united states and china he said they have their interests in the region as do others our relationship with the solomon islands our relationship with the pacific transcends all of that there is a great risk and a great danger in an analysis that only can see the world through those through such a binary prism i certainly don t australia certainly doesn t australia welcomes the economic growth and advancement of china with their economy ,US China Trade War,0.13880842924118042
10647,"Over the last week, China’s state media outlets have called the US government delusional, compared it to apes shouting on a river bank, and offered to teach the Americans a Chinese idiom: diandao heibai, “to invert black and white”, or deliberately distort the truth.As trade tensions mount between the US and China, Beijing faces the difficult task of appealing to national pride to shore up confidence in the leadership while also keeping public anger in check.As US-China ties have deteriorated over the last year, Chinese officials and state media have been relatively restrained. Official statements refer to “trade frictions” with the US, rather than a “trade war”, and have been careful not to name Donald Trump directly or criticise the country as a whole.“They want to send the message that they are being firm, that they are in control, that China’s economy is healthy and capable of self-sufficiency,” said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, a research programme affiliated with the University of Hong Kong.“I believe the thinking here is not to directly antagonise Trump, not to escalate and makes things too personal. Because at some point, for all the talk of self-reliance and preparing for a new ‘long march’ and so on, China wants to get back to the table,” he said.After the breakdown of trade talks and US moves to list Huawei and potentially other Chinese companies on a trade blacklist, voices within Chinese state and private media are growing more strident.An editorial in the People’s Daily on Wednesday accused the US of “bullyism”, while a bulletin on the state broadcaster CCTV said the US was “delusional” if it believed “technological bullying” could contain China. “This shows some American politicians are extremely narrow-minded and cannot tolerate the normal pursuit of development and progress of other countries,” the announcer said.The harsher sentiments appear to be resonating with the public. Earlier in the week, a song written by a former Chinese official about the trade war, set to the tune of a fight song featured in an anti-Japanese wartime film, had been viewed thousands of times on WeChat.A clip of a CCTV news segment from last week promising that China would “fight to the end” was one of the top viewed posts on the microblogging site Weibo. And last weekend, a CCTV film channel aired a series of documentaries about the Korean war, when Chinese and US forces clashed. “We are using movies to echo the current era,” the broadcaster said on its Weibo account on Saturday.But Mao-era levels of mobilisation or overzealous nationalism could turn into something difficult for authorities to control. In 2012, anti-Japanese riots erupted across Chinese cities over rights to disputed islands in the East China Sea.The CCTV segment from Wednesday night garnered more than 1,100 comments, with many commentators supporting a harder government line. “Less slogans, more real strength,” one said.“For China’s leadership, nationalism is a very useful part of a coherent super-narrative about China’s return to greatness under the leadership of the party,” Bandurski said. “But the party is insistent on keeping the party at the very centre of national pride.“Anti-Americanism could very easily become a force the party cannot control.”",'We'll fight to the end': China's media ramps up rhetoric in US trade war,2019-05-23/11:06:14,over the last week china s state media outlets have called the us government delusional compared it to apes shouting on a river bank and offered to teach the americans a chinese idiom diandao heibai to invert black and white or deliberately distort the truth as trade tensions mount between the us and china beijing faces the difficult task of appealing to national pride to shore up confidence in the leadership while also keeping public anger in check as us china ties have deteriorated over the last year chinese officials and state media have been relatively restrained official statements refer to trade frictions with the us rather than a trade war and have been careful not to name donald trump directly or criticise the country as a whole they want to send the message that they are being firm that they are in control that china s economy is healthy and capable of self sufficiency said david bandurski co director of the china media project a research programme affiliated with the university of hong kong i believe the thinking here is not to directly antagonise trump not to escalate and makes things too personal because at some point for all the talk of self reliance and preparing for a new long march and so on china wants to get back to the table he said after the breakdown of trade talks and us moves to list huawei and potentially other chinese companies on a trade blacklist voices within chinese state and private media are growing more strident an editorial in the people s daily on wednesday accused the us of bullyism while a bulletin on the state broadcaster cctv said the us was delusional if it believed technological bullying could contain china this shows some american politicians are extremely narrow minded and cannot tolerate the normal pursuit of development and progress of other countries the announcer said the harsher sentiments appear to be resonating with the public earlier in the week a song written by a former chinese official about the trade war set to the tune of a fight song featured in an anti japanese wartime film had been viewed thousands of times on wechat a clip of a cctv news segment from last week promising that china would fight to the end was one of the top viewed posts on the microblogging site weibo and last weekend a cctv film channel aired a series of documentaries about the korean war when chinese and us forces clashed we are using movies to echo the current era the broadcaster said on its weibo account on saturday but mao era levels of mobilisation or overzealous nationalism could turn into something difficult for authorities to control in  anti japanese riots erupted across chinese cities over rights to disputed islands in the east china sea the cctv segment from wednesday night garnered more than   comments with many commentators supporting a harder government line less slogans more real strength one said for china s leadership nationalism is a very useful part of a coherent super narrative about china s return to greatness under the leadership of the party bandurski said but the party is insistent on keeping the party at the very centre of national pride anti americanism could very easily become a force the party cannot control ,US China Trade War,0.16362722218036652
10755,"A few years ago, as part of a western delegation to China, I met Xi Jinping in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. When addressing us, Xi argued that China’s rise would be peaceful, and that other countries – namely, the US – need not worry about the “Thucydides trap”, so named for the Greek historian who chronicled how Sparta’s fear of a rising Athens made war between the two inevitable. In his 2017 book Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?, Harvard University’s Graham Allison examines 16 earlier rivalries between an emerging and an established power, and finds that 12 of them led to war. No doubt, Xi wanted us to focus on the remaining four.Despite the mutual awareness of the Thucydides trap – and the recognition that history is not deterministic – China and the US seem to be falling into it anyway. Though a hot war between the world’s two major powers still seems far-fetched, a cold war is becoming more likely.The US blames China for the current tensions. Since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has reaped the benefits of the global trading and investment system, while failing to meet its obligations and free riding on its rules. According to the US, China has gained an unfair advantage through intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, subsidies for domestic firms and other instruments of state capitalism. At the same time, its government is becoming increasingly authoritarian, transforming China into an Orwellian surveillance state.For their part, the Chinese suspect that the US’s real goal is to prevent them from rising any further or projecting legitimate power and influence abroad. In their view, it is only reasonable that the world’s second-largest economy (by GDP) would seek to expand its presence on the world stage. And leaders would argue that their regime has improved the material welfare of 1.4 billion Chinese far more than the west’s gridlocked political systems ever could.Regardless of which side has the stronger argument, the escalation of economic, trade, technological, and geopolitical tensions may have been inevitable. What started as a trade war now threatens to escalate into a permanent state of mutual animosity. This is reflected in the Trump administration’s national security strategy, which deems China a strategic “competitor” that should be contained on all fronts.Accordingly, the US is sharply restricting Chinese foreign direct investment in sensitive sectors, and pursuing other actions to ensure western dominance in strategic industries such as artificial intelligence and 5G. It is pressuring partners and allies not to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s massive programme to build infrastructure projects across the Eurasian landmass. And it is increasing US Navy patrols in the East and South China Seas, where China has grown more aggressive in asserting its dubious territorial claims.The global consequences of a Sino-American cold war would be even more severe than those of the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union. Whereas the Soviet Union was a declining power with a failing economic model, China will soon become the world’s largest economy, and will continue to grow from there. Moreover, the US and the Soviet Union traded very little with each other, whereas China is fully integrated in the global trading and investment system, and deeply intertwined with the US, in particular.A full-scale cold war thus could trigger a new stage of deglobalisation, or at least a division of the global economy into two incompatible economic blocs. In either scenario, trade in goods, services, capital, labour, technology and data would be severely restricted, and the digital realm would become a “splinternet,” wherein western and Chinese nodes would not connect to one another. Now that the US has imposed sanctions on ZTE and Huawei, China will be scrambling to ensure that its tech giants can source essential inputs domestically, or at least from friendly trade partners that are not dependent on the US.In this Balkanised world, China and the US will both expect all other countries to pick a side, while most governments will try to thread the needle of maintaining good economic ties with both. After all, many US allies now do more business (in terms of trade and investment) with China than they do with America. Yet in a future economy where China and the US separately control access to crucial technologies such as AI and 5G, the middle ground will most likely become uninhabitable. Everyone will have to choose, and the world may well enter a long process of deglobalisation.Whatever happens, the Sino-American relationship will be the key geopolitical issue of this century. Some degree of rivalry is inevitable. But, ideally, both sides would manage it constructively, allowing for cooperation on some issues and healthy competition on others. In effect, China and the US would create a new international order, based on the recognition that the (inevitably) rising new power should be granted a role in shaping global rules and institutions.If the relationship is mismanaged – with the US trying to derail China’s development and contain its rise, and China aggressively projecting its power in Asia and around the world – a full-scale cold war will ensue, and a hot one (or a series of proxy wars) cannot be ruled out. In the 21st century, the Thucydides trap would swallow not just the US and China, but the entire world.• Nouriel Roubini, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates, was senior economist for international affairs in the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration.

557,"  - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTAS) said Wednesday it is reviving a long-stalled effort to overhaul the five-star crash rating program for all new vehicles. In 2015, under President Barack Obama, NHTSA proposed requiring automakers to add crash avoidance technologies to gain top, five-star ratings as part of its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). Those changes were set to start in the 2019 model year but have been on hold as the auto safety agency held additional public hearings. NHTSA’s acting chief, James Owens, said in a statement Wednesday the agency would propose “propose significant updates and upgrades” in 2020 “by creating additional market-based incentives for automakers to continue investing in innovative safety technologies that will save lives and prevent injuries.” On Thursday, a group plans to hold a press conference in Washington criticizing NHTSA’s failure to update the ratings. The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended pedestrian collision avoidance systems and forward collision avoidance systems to be added to the program. Critics note the vast majority of new vehicles achieve four or five-star ratings, making it difficult for consumers to differentiate between vehicles. NHTSA said potential changes include “new test procedures, updates to vehicle labeling, advancements in crash-test dummies... and new technologies tied to the safety of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users such as cyclists.” The 2015 proposal sought to prod automakers to add advanced technologies including forward collision warning, lane departure warning, blind-spot detection, lower beam head lighting, semi-automatic headlamp beam switching, amber rear turn signals, rear automatic braking and pedestrian automatic emergency braking and to factor those in to setting the ratings of up to five stars. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and others, told NHTSA last year “it is important that any new additions to NCAP significantly increase real-world safety. If not, they will only increase vehicle cost without any commensurate real-world safety benefit.” Automakers covet five-star ratings, so new rules could effectively require manufacturers to make technology currently offered as pricey options on some vehicles standard equipment on all vehicles. NHTSA in 2015 proposed adding a new frontal crash test, new pedestrian crashworthiness testing and add two new advanced crash test dummies. The tests are only to set crash ratings included on new car window stickers - not for crash tests needed for U.S. vehicles to be legally sold.

819,"MELBOURNE   - An Australian farmer has launched a legal action against Bayer AG’s agricultural chemicals unit Monsanto after being diagnosed with a type of cancer he says was caused by its weedkiller, a lawyer for the man said on Friday. New South Wales farmer Ross Wild was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma last year after using the weedkiller Roundup on his farming property near the border of NSW and Victoria since 1976, according to his lawyer Tony Carbone, of Melbourne-based Carbone lawyers. Wild says long-term exposure to Roundup’s active ingredient, glyphosate, was to blame, Carbone told Reuters, adding that he has had enquiries from more than 100 more people with the disease. A Bayer spokesman said the company was aware of media reports regarding a statement claim about glyphosate but had not yet been served a writ. “We have great sympathy for any individual with cancer, but the extensive body of science on glyphosate-based herbicides over four decades supports the conclusion that Roundup does not cause Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL),” he said in a statement. Glyphosate had been extensively studied by scientists and regulators, and research had confirmed it was not carcinogenic, the spokesman said. “We firmly stand behind the safety of glyphosate-based products, and as a company devoted to life sciences, assure Australians that their health and the environment are our top priority.” Glyphosate is the world’s most widely used weedkiller. Monsanto’s Roundup was the first glyphosate-based weedkiller but is no longer patent-protected and many other versions are now available. Bayer does not provide sales figures for the product.  The company said in a statement that as of July 11, it faced lawsuits brought by roughly 18,400 U.S. plaintiffs who say glyphosate caused cancer. A trial over the weedkiller scheduled to begin on Oct. 15 in Missouri had been delayed, Bayer said this month. The lawsuit is the latest of several to be put on hold as mediator Ken Feinberg tries to negotiate a settlement between the company and U.S. plaintiffs after a California jury in August last year found that Monsanto should have warned of alleged cancer risks.

1530,"  - Gap Inc (GPS.N) said on Thursday it plans to hire more than 30,000 seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday season, lower than the 65,000 target the apparel retailer had set for 2018. The holiday season, which includes Black Friday, Christmas and New Year, is the busiest time of the year for retailers and brings in a majority of their total sales. A Gap spokeswoman said total seasonal hiring is lower this year to give current employees the opportunity to pick up more hours.  Hiring plans often indicate sales expectations of retailers and come against the backdrop of a softening retail environment and a prolonged U.S.-China trade war that has threatened to increase costs for retailers. Big-box retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) said earlier this month that it planned to hire more than 130,000 store employees for the holiday season, a roughly 8% rise from last year, but much lower than the 20% increase in 2018 and a 43% jump in 2017. Retail jobs contracted for a seventh straight month in August to hit their lowest since January 2016, which hinted at softer U.S. consumer spending going into the Christmas season.   Gap said on Thursday it would host a one-day event on Oct. 5 at all its stores, as well as select distribution and customer centers across the United States and Canada to hire as many as 5,000 work associates as part of the holiday hiring plan.

1566,"WASHINGTON   - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits rose moderately last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Sept. 21, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 212,00 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for Puerto Rico were estimated last week. Despite trade tensions, which have weighed on business investment and manufacturing, layoffs remain low. That is helping to underpin consumer spending, which is largely driving the economy. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 750 to 212,000 last week. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 15,000 to 1.65 million for the week ended Sept. 14, the lowest level since October 2018. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims decreased 12,750 to 1.67 million. Continuing claims data covered the week during which households were surveyed for September’s unemployment rate. The four-week average of claims fell 32,500 between the August and September household survey weeks suggesting some improvement in the jobless rate, which is currently at 3.7%. The economy created 130,000 jobs in August. Economists say it is unclear whether the loss of momentum in hiring is due to ebbing demand for labor or a shortage of qualified workers. While job growth has slowed to an average of 158,000 per month this year from 223,000 in 2018, it remains above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population.

1599,"  - Elliott Management Corp on Wednesday urged Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) to split into three companies, saying it would boost shareholder value by as much as $40 billion, three years after the activist hedge fund asked the refiner to consider spinning off businesses. Shares of Marathon, which has a market capitalization of about $36 billion, were up 8.1% at $59.97. Elliott said its call to separate Marathon’s retail, refining and midstream assets was prompted by the company’s failure to deliver on past promises and “chronic underperformance.” The company’s shares have fallen 6% this year, compared with a 7.4% gain in the S&P oil and gas refining and marketing index. At the year’s low of $43.96 in August, its shares touched 2016 levels. Under Elliott’s latest plan, Marathon’s transportation and storage business will become MPLX, a company with an enterprise value of more than $50 billion. Its refining business will be the “New Marathon” with an enterprise value of $29 billion, while its retail business will become Speedway worth about $18 billion.  Marathon said it was focused on increasing shareholder value and would “thoroughly evaluate” Elliott’s proposal.  The hedge fund, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, said on Wednesday it had accepted a “compromise” last time around after “extensive” talks in which Marathon agreed to simplify its midstream business and undertake a strategic review of its Speedway assets. After the review, the refiner chose to keep its Speedway retail arm, a decision then backed by Elliott.  Marathon later bought rival Andeavor to become the top U.S. refiner and earlier this year completed the merger of midstream units MPLX (MPLX.N) and Andeavor Logistics LP (ANDX.N) in a $9 billion deal. Elliott, which owned 0.7% of Marathon as of June 30, according to Refinitiv data, said it estimated a $22 billion boost to shareholder value from the split and another $17 billion if refining, retailing and marketing operations were to be improved after the separation.      Shareholder DE Shaw, which has a stake of about 0.9% in Marathon, according to Refinitiv data, has backed Elliott’s call to split the company, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Marathon Chairman and Chief Executive Gary Heminger could become a target for disgruntled shareholders, given he has overseen the company since Marathon Petroleum was separated from Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) in 2011. Heminger’s membership of Marathon’s board of directors is due up for shareholder vote in 2020, according to Marathon’s 2019 proxy statement. At the 2018 annual meeting, shareholders rejected a proposal to create an independent chairman position. “At this stage, Elliott’s going to have a lot of support, and it is going to be harder for Marathon to fight this,” said Matthew Blair, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering & Holt. The energy brokerage, which has a “buy” rating and a $69 price target on the stock, had called for the sale of one of Marathon’s refineries and the gathering and processing business of MPLX.  Blair called Elliott’s demands unsurprising, although the proposal to split the company into three was “a little bit more extreme” than expected.

1623,"FRANKFURT   - German authorities have raided Deutsche Bank’s (DBKGn.DE) Frankfurt headquarters in search of information related to Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO) and a money laundering scandal, Frankfurt prosecutors said on Wednesday. They are investigating whether Germany’s biggest bank facilitated money laundering and whether it failed to alert authorities about suspicious transactions quickly enough, the prosecutors said.  Danske Bank is under investigation in several countries, including the United States, Denmark, Britain and Estonia, over suspicious payments totalling 200 billion euros ($220 billion) moved through its tiny Estonian branch. Deutsche Bank acted as a correspondent bank for Danske. The search, which began on Tuesday and concluded on Wednesday evening, involved three prosecutors and nine agents from Germany’s federal criminal police.  Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating. “Deutsche Bank has comprehensively examined the facts of the matter and has voluntarily provided the requested documents as far as possible,” the bank said in a statement.  Prosecutors said the period in question is 2014 to 2018, and that there was a suspect who worked at the bank during that period. Deutsche Bank had alerted authorities to 1.1 million suspicious transactions, prosecutors said.  Prosecutors also said that a double-digit number of transactions, with a volume of 12.5 million euros, were either registered by Deutsche too late with authorities, or the bank should have blocked them from the start. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung was the first to report the raid on Deutsche. Deutsche Bank has previously faced issues over money laundering and the controls in place to prevent it. Last year, dozens of police raided six Deutsche Bank offices in and around Frankfurt over money laundering allegations linked to the “Panama Papers”. Germany’s financial market watchdog BaFin last year ordered Deutsche to do more to prevent money laundering.  In 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $700 million for  artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that could have been used for money laundering. An investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice is still ongoing.

1657,"  - The collapse of British travel operator Thomas Cook  left hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers abroad and forced governments and insurers to coordinate a huge operation to get them home. The company ran hotels, resorts and airlines ferrying 19 million people a year to 16 different countries. Here is a summary of the impact of the collapse in different countries and efforts to salvage parts of the group: Thomas Cook’s German tour business filed for insolvency on Wednesday in a move aimed at separating its brands and operations from its failed parent, and it said it was in talks with potential new investors. The German government is planning to guarantee a 380 million euro ($418 million) bridging loan for the group’s German airline, Condor, to keep it flying. The German regional state of Hesse, which is also providing help to Condor, said it stood ready to offer financial assistance to Thomas Cook GmbH, and would discuss the matter with the federal government. Thomas Cook has said there are roughly 140,000 holidaymakers currently traveling with its German units. The Dutch unit of Thomas Cook canceled all travel booked through Thomas Cook Netherlands and subsidiary Neckermann. A Dutch court on Wednesday granted Thomas Cook Nederland B.V., a Netherlands-based subsidiary, protection from creditors. It employed roughly 200 staff. Thomas Cook’s Polish unit, Neckermann Polska, said on Wednesday that it has filed for insolvency. Poland regional authorities says around 3,600 customers of Neckermann Polska are still abroad. Thomas Cook’s Belgian unit ceased carrying passengers on Tuesday and liquidated two businesses, seeking protection from creditors and ultimately a buyer for Thomas Cook Retail Belgium. It still has some 13,400 customers on holidays abroad. Several planes operated by Thomas Cook Scandinavian Airlines have not been able to take off because their leasing contracts remained with the British parent, Danish subsidiary Spies said. It was not immediately clear how the situation would be resolved. Thomas Cook’s Nordic business said on Monday it would continue to operate as it is a separate legal entity from its London-listed parent and added that it was looking for new owners. The Nordic business consists of two legal entities, Thomas Cook Northern Europe and Thomas Cook Scandinavian Airlines, and is also known as Ving Group. The business operates under several brands: Ving in Norway, Spies in Denmark, Tjäreborg in Finland, as well as Ving and Globetrotter in Sweden.  Emergency flights had brought 14,700 people back to the United Kingdom on 64 flights on Monday, and around 135,300 more were expected to be returned over the next 13 days, Britain’s aviation regulator said.     More than 70 flights were scheduled to operate on Wednesday to bring back 16,500 people.   The collapse of British travel firm Thomas Cook will not have a “significant impact” on Mexico’s tourist industry as it only represents about 0.4% of the sector’s foreign income, the Mexican tourism ministry said on Tuesday. Thomas Cook’s collapse poses a serious challenge to Bulgarian tourism, with dozens of Black Sea hotels facing losses totaling tens of millions of dollars as negotiations for the next summer season take place, its tourism minister said on Tuesday.  Tunisian tourism minister Rene Trabelsi told Reuters that 4,500 Thomas Cook customers are still on holiday in Tunisia.  The British government repatriated about 1,200 tourists via planes sent to Tunisa’s Enfidha airport, and another 4,000 still in Tunisia will return after their holidays. The French arm of the business said on Tuesday it was asking the French commercial court of Nanterre for creditor protection Thomas Cook France will hold a meeting of its works council on Thursday about a plan to declare insolvency and to start a recovery procedure. French organization Entreprises de Voyage said that about 10,000 French tourists could be affected by the bankruptcy. The collapse has affected 53,000 Britons in Spain, Spanish Acting Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto told reporters. The ministry has been in touch with German and Swedish authorities to ensure Thomas Cook subsidiaries continue to operate at least for the winter season, she added.     A Greek tourism ministry official told Reuters that about 50,000 tourists were affected. Cyprus says 15,000 Thomas Cook customers were stranded on the island.  Thomas Cook’s Hungarian unit Neckermann Magyarorszag said it was continuing its operations and all passengers would be able to return from abroad as planned.  It said its financial situation was stable and its assets were sufficient guarantee that its passengers would not suffer any financial damage. It said passengers should contact its offices directly about upcoming flights.  Thomas Cook’s Russian tour operator subsidiary, Intourist, said the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook will have no impact on clients, Executive Director Sergei Tolchin told Interfax. The Turkish Ministry of Tourism said it will provide support for local companies affected by the Thomas Cook collapse. The head of the country’s Hotelier Federation said about 45,000 tourists from the UK and elsewhere in Europe are in the country. Morocco’s tourism ministry said it had created a crisis unit to handle the fallout from Thomas Cook’s collapse. Thomas Cook operated two flights to Marrakesh a week. No official numbers were given.  Thomas Cook operator Blue Sky Group said that 25,000 reservations in Egypt booked up to April 2020 had been canceled. Blue Sky currently has 1,600 tourists in Egypt’s Hugharda resort.

1679,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt for defying congressional subpoenas related to the U.S. census. The measure, which passed 230-198, was a response to the cabinet members’ failure to produce documents requested by House Democrats as part of an investigation into whether the Trump administration attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census that would discriminate against racial minorities.  Four Democrats voted against the measure, while no Republicans supported it. Justin Amash, an independent congressman from Michigan who recently left the Republican Party, voted in favor of the resolution.  The criminal contempt vote against the two Trump cabinet members is likely to be little more than symbolic since the charges would be referred to Barr’s Justice Department. Still, the maneuver intensified a Democratic assault on President Donald Trump’s stonewalling of congressional probes.  Earlier on Wednesday, Barr and Ross urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to delay the vote, saying she should “allow the constitutionally mandated accommodation process to continue.” “House Democrats never sought to have a productive relationship with the Trump administration, and today’s PR stunt further demonstrates their unending quest to generate headlines instead of operating in good faith with our department,” Ross said in a statement. The U.S. Supreme Court last month blocked Trump’s initial effort to add the citizenship question. He then planned an executive order to add it to the census, but later dropped the idea. “Holding any cabinet secretary in criminal contempt of Congress is a serious and somber matter - one that I have done everything in my power to avoid,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which is conducting the census investigation. “But in this case, the attorney general and Secretary Ross have blatantly obstructed our ability to do congressional oversight into the real reason Secretary Ross was trying - for the first time in 70 years - to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census,” he added. Wednesday’s vote marked the first time Trump administration officials have been held in criminal contempt of Congress since Democrats took control of the House in January. Prior to the vote there had been only one other instance in U.S. history of Congress holding a sitting cabinet official in contempt. In 2012, congressional Republicans held then President Barack Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt over his refusal to produce documents relating to the “Operation Fast and Furious” gun trafficking investigation.

1701,"TUNIS   - About 45 hotels have been affected in Tunisia after the collapse of Thomas Cook, and the government will help the hotels with soft loans, Tunisia’s tourism minister said on Tuesday. Tourism is a vital sector of Tunisia’s economy and a key source of foreign exchange earnings. It accounts for around 8% of economic output and employs 400,000 people. The collapse of Thomas Cook, one of Britain’s oldest companies, has stranded more than half a million tourists around the world. It ran hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year in 16 countries. Thomas Cook owes Tunisian hotels 60 million euros ($66 million)for stays in July and August, Tourism Minister Rene Trabelsi told Reuters earlier on Monday. On Tuesday, Trabelsi held a crisis meeting with the British ambassador in Tunisia and hotel owners over Thomas Cook’s debt. He said that the British government has pledged to pay Thomas Cook’s debt but had not set a fixed term. About 45 Tunisian hotels deal exclusively with Thomas cook. “We have a proposal to open a line of financing of the affected hotels...we will call for  ministerial council to study how we can help them,” Trabelsi said. The British government repatriated about 1,200 tourists via planes sent to Tunisa’s Enfidha airport, and another 4,000 still in Tunisia will return after their holidays. Major European tour operators only started to return to Tunisia last year after militants in 2015 killed 39 tourists, mostly British, in an attack on a beach in Sousse and 21 people in the Bardo National Museum in the capital Tunis. Tunisia had expected to receive a record 9 million tourists by the end of 2019, up from 8 million last year.

1737,"ZURICH   - Private detectives from security firm Investigo, hired to shadow a former Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) manager Iqbal Khan, took defensive action when Khan tried to photograph one of them with his mobile phone, an Investigo memo seen by Reuters said. Credit Suisse hired security firm Investigo to tail former International Wealth Management boss Iqbal Khan, who left the bank in July, to try to ensure he did not poach any colleagues before starting a new job next month at rival UBS (UBSG.S), two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Credit Suisse declined to comment on Tuesday.     Khan filed a criminal complaint last week alleging threats and coercion after a confrontation on Sept. 17, during which Swiss media reported that Investigo detectives sought to take Khan’s mobile phone after he tried to take a photo of their car. A spokesman for Khan declined to comment on the incident. Khan’s spokesman denied that Khan tried to poach Credit Suisse staff for his new employer, calling such suspicions “absurd.”     Prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible threats or coercion. Credit Suisse on Monday said an internal inquiry was under way. The Investigo memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday, which referred to the alleged confrontation with Khan, said the detectives were taking defensive action. “Our employee acted as per instructions defensively,” the Investigo memo, seen by Reuters, stated. An Investigo representative said he could not comment on the memo or any details of the incident prior to the release of other parties’ statements, but said it was very unlikely that one of the firm’s detectives would act in such a way.  “I can’t imagine that any of the employees, as I know them, would pull the phone out of Mr Khan’s hands,” he said. “That would be one of the most ill-advised actions you could take.” Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner and CEO Tidjane Thiam had earlier pointed to “significant inaccuracies” in media reporting of the incident, which they said in a staff memo “sensationalised” the facts and events.  Three employees of the security firm were detained by authorities over the incident last week, Investigo’s representative said, but were released the same day.

1856,"LONDON   - The British government has plans in place to bring home stranded holidaymakers if Thomas Cook TCG.L goes out of business, an event that would likely spark chaotic scenes at resorts and airports around the world. The bosses of the world’s oldest travel company were still meeting lenders and creditors in London on Sunday to try to thrash out a last-ditch deal to keep the company afloat. The company’s board will then meet in the early evening to decide the company’s fate, with the business potentially going into administration in the early hours of Monday.   Running hotels, resorts and airlines, Thomas Cook has 600,000 customers on holiday, meaning governments and insurance companies could be forced to step in and bring them home if the company goes out of business.  Unions and the opposition Labour party have urged the government to stump up the cash, but the foreign secretary appeared to dismiss that idea on Sunday.  “We don’t systematically step in with the taxpayers’ money when businesses are going under unless there’s a good strategic national interest,” Dominic Raab told the BBC, adding that plans were in place to prevent anyone from being stranded. The company, founded in 1841, has been fighting for its survival after its lenders threatened to pull the plug on a rescue deal that has been months in the making.  Hurt by high levels of debt, online competition and geopolitical uncertainty, Thomas Cook needs to find another 200 million pounds on top of a 900 million pound package it had already agreed, to see it through the winter months when it has less cash coming in and needs to pay hotels for summer services. That has sparked fears among customers on social media that some hotels, yet to be reimbursed by Thomas Cook, could ask holidaymakers to leave if the company collapses. Some British tourists were briefly detained in a hotel in Tunisia by staff who wanted to know if they had been paid. The Thomas cook customers have since left and flown home, according to their social media postings [L5N26D0FR].     At the meeting on Sunday the company was asking its lenders to restructure or lower their demands. It has also asked credit card companies to release 50 million pounds that they hold as collateral against the company’s bookings.   The company’s largest shareholder, China’s Fosun (1992.HK), was due to take a central role in the restructuring.   A person familiar with the situation told Reuters there was still a possibility they could strike a deal. The person declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.   Were Thomas Cook to fail, it would spark the biggest peacetime repatriation effort in British history. The government and the aviation regulator have drawn up a plan to step in and use other airlines to bring Britons home if needed. The person familiar with the situation put the cost of that move at around 600 million pounds.   On top of the British holidaymakers, some 460,000 other customers are also abroad, with many coming from Germany or Scandinavia.  An official from Germany said under that country’s rules, it would fall to insurance companies to help get customers home.  Condor, a German airline owned by Thomas Cook, said in a statement that its parent company was doing everything it could to secure fresh funds. “Negotiations with all key stakeholders are complex and ongoing. The Condor flights are currently being operated on a regular basis.” News of Thomas Cook’s potential demise has sparked alarm not just across the holiday resorts and poolside bars where customers are using social media to obtain updates, but among suppliers and future customers who are losing faith. That is draining the company of the liquidity it needs to keep operating and ramping up the pressure on one of Britain’s oldest and much-loved companies. According to figures from the UK-based aviation consultancy IBA Group, all but a handful of its 116 aircraft are leased rather than owned directly. So far there are no visible signs that leasing companies are demanding their planes back, preferring to sit out the refinancing talks. “Hi Annie, I understand your father might be unsettled by all the news surrounding Thomas Cook and our business recently but our flight operations continue to operate as normal,” the company said in response to one worried customer.  British foreign minister Raab also sought to reassure holidaymakers that they would not end up stuck overseas. “We ... hope that it (Thomas Cook) can continue but in any event, as you would expect, we’ve got the contingency planning in place to make sure that in any worst-case scenario we can support all those who might otherwise be stranded,” he said.  At the board meeting, the company will have to decide whether in the short term it has enough cash to pay its debts, and whether it has a reasonable prospect of paying its liabilities in six to 12 months’ time, which is predicated on its securing a deal. At the earlier meeting the lenders will have to decide whether they want to continue supporting a company that has 19 million customers a year, spread across 16 countries.  While it once pioneered package holidays and mass tourism, in recent years it has struggled to pay the interest on its 1.7 billion pound debt, while navigating events such as a coup in Turkey, a heatwave in Europe, fluctuating oil prices and the aggressive summer pricing of low-cost airlines like Ryanair and easyJet.

2235,"TOKYO   - U.S. President Donald Trump has said Washington and Tokyo have reached an initial trade deal that he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are expected to sign in New York later this month. Top Japanese officials, however, said a deal had yet to be clinched. Full details of the agreement have not been disclosed. Below are some key elements that are known - and unknown - about the pending agreement. Trump’s announcement has left unanswered questions over whether the agreement would deliver Japan one of the main prizes of its negotiations: a U.S. pledge not to impose national security tariffs of up to 25% on Japanese vehicles and auto parts under Section 232 of U.S. trade law. Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, who is in charge of talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, told a news conference he wanted to reconfirm at the final stage of talks that the tariffs would not be imposed. Japanese officials from Abe on down have said that under a September 2018 agreement, the United States would not impose added auto tariffs while trade talks were under way. Japanese auto exports account for about two-thirds of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan and the added tariffs would deal a blow to the country’s trade-reliant economy. A preliminary deal announced on Aug. 25 included reduced U.S. tariffs on unspecified industrial products but Lighthizer said these did not include autos. Tokyo has sought removal of a U.S. 2.5% tariff on autos and auto parts. Japan is expected to agree to cut tariffs on imports of U.S. beef and pork to within levels granted to signatories of the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) pact, officials have said. That would allow Trump to please U.S. farmers ahead of next year’s presidential election. The farmers had been disadvantaged in Japan’s market after the United States withdrew from TPP after Trump took office in 2017. It would also let Abe keep a pledge to domestic producers. Lighthizer said last month that wheat, dairy products, wine and ethanol would also benefit from the deal. Washington, meanwhile, will make it easier for Japan to increase U.S.-bound beef exports by scrapping a 200-ton annual low-tariff quota, affording Japan the same beef trade status as Australia, New Zealand and Canada, Japanese media reported. JAPAN-BOUND CORN PURCHASES In announcing the initial agreement last month, Trump made reference to Japan’s decision to front-load planned purchases of U.S. feed corn imports to cope with damage to its crop from an armyworm infestation.   However, Japanese officials said the country’s total feed corn imports wouldn’t increase under the deal, which simply front-loads three months’ worth of roughly 2.75 million tons of imports. Private companies have the final say in how much feed corn they import. Japan has agreed to phase out tariffs on U.S. wine imports over five to seven years, about the same as the eight-year TPP time-frame, media said, potentially cutting the cost of U.S. wine by about 13% for wine distributors. However, the amount of U.S. rice that will be allowed to enter Japan tariff-free under the bilateral deal would be much less than the 70,000 metric tons accepted under the TPP, the Mainichi newspaper said.  Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said that a currency provision aimed at preventing competitive devaluation would not be included in the final deal.  That demand by U.S. lawmakers would tie Japan’s ability to intervene in currency markets should the yen spike and threaten the country’s export-reliant economy. U.S. technology industry officials say they expect a digital trade agreement with Japan to be closely aligned with provisions in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which follow the U.S. model for internet development. Those provisions aim to ensure the free flow of data across borders without taxation, prohibit data server localization requirements and limit governments’ ability to demand companies disclose their source code.

2805,"MILAN   - Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) will invest almost one billion euros ($1.1 billion) to start production of the new Alfa Romeo compact SUV Tonale and of the light hybrid version of its Panda small car at its Pomigliano plant, unions said on Wednesday. The investment is part of a FCA’s plan announced last year to spend 5 billion euros in Italy up to 2021 to help the group launch its first electric and hybrid models and to fill capacity utilization at its Italian plants. FCA will start building the new production line for the Tonale at the start of next year, metal mechanic unions FIM, UILM, FISMIC, UGLM and AQCF said in a statement after meeting FCA.  A FCA spokesman confirmed the unions’ statement, adding the investment for the two models would be “closer to 1 billion than 500 million euros”. He said a “premium compact SUV” would be produced in the southern-Italy Pomigliano plant, near Naples, along with hybrid Panda, but did not confirm it was the Alfa Romeo Tonale. The company has already begun investing to prepare the plant near Naples for production. The plant already produces traditional Panda cars. The production of the hybrid Panda is expected to start in the first half of next year, while that of the Tonale in the first half of 2021. Earlier this year, FCA said it was investing 700 million euros to start building the production line for the new Fiat 500 electric in its historic Mirafiori plant in Turin, as the carmaker moved on from its failed $35 billion bid to merge with France’s Renault (RENA.PA).  Production will start in the second quarter of 2020.  Hybrid versions of Jeep models Compass and Renegade and of Maserati’s Levante SUV are also expected to hit the market next year.

3644,"NEW YORK   - Novartis AG  said on Wednesday it replaced the two top research and development executives at its Avexis unit after some data was manipulated from early testing of a gene therapy for infants that costs more than $2 million. Avexis’ Chief Scientific Officer Brian Kaspar and Senior Vice President of Research and Development Allan Kaspar have not been involved in any operations at Avexis since early May 2019, Novartis said in a statement.  The Kaspars are brothers. Brian Kaspar was a founder and key executive at Avexis and made more than $380 million from the company’s 2018 acquisition by Novartis, according to SEC filings. The Kaspars could not immediately be reached for comment. Page Bouchard has taken on both those roles at Avexis as of Aug. 5, Novartis said. The Swiss drugmaker said last week that it was in the process of “exiting” the Avexis scientists responsible for the manipulation of data on gene therapy Zolgensma. A Novartis spokesman said on Wednesday that a few other scientists beyond the Kaspars were no longer at the company but did not give any further details.  Novartis has not said who is responsible for the manipulated data. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last week that Novartis had notified regulators in June - more than a month after Zolgensma had been approved - that some of the early testing data had been manipulated. The company had been aware of the problems for as many as two months before the drug’s U.S. approval, the FDA said, and it could face criminal or civil penalties.  Novartis said last week that it learned of allegations of data manipulation in mid-March and finished a preliminary investigation into the allegations in early May, confirming data discrepancies and raising data integrity concerns.  U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley sent a letter to Novartis last week asking the company to provide details about the manipulation by Aug. 23. Novartis acquired Avexis last year, paying $8.7 billion for the maker of the rare-disease treatment, which is expected to bring in billions of dollars in sales. Zolgensma - the world’s most expensive drug - was approved as a one-time treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in late May. The disease often leads to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death within months for babies born with the most serious Type I form. SMA affects about one in 10,000 live births, with 50% to 70% having Type I disease, and is the leading genetic cause of death in infants.

4446,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was unhappy with a deal struck by congressional negotiators on border security that denied him funds for his promised U.S.-Mexican border wall, but did not reject it outright as fellow Republicans urged his support. Trump’s demand in December for $5.7 billion from Congress to help build a wall on the southern border triggered a 35-day closure of about a quarter of the federal government. But he remains undecided about whether he will support the agreement reached on Monday night that includes $1.37 billion for border fencing. Nevertheless, Trump said he did not expect another shutdown, while continuing to insist he could find a way to bypass Congress and build a wall without lawmakers. Trump posted on Twitter that he had been briefed by Republican Senator Richard Shelby and was reviewing the measure.  The Republican president repeated his insistence that if Congress did not provide the funding, he would press forward with building a wall, writing: “Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!” White House aides are considering having Trump sign the compromise deal but also try to move money that has already been allocated for other programs to instead build the wall, one official said. Trump may need approval from Democrats in the House to be able to do so.  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and a host of other agencies is due to end on Saturday after the expiration of a stopgap measure that ended the longest federal shutdown in U.S. history. Monday’s tentative funding agreement would keep the government open until Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. “I have to study it. I’m not happy about it,” Trump told reporters at the White House about the deal, which would need to be passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives and Republican-controlled Senate and signed by him. The House could vote late on Wednesday at the earliest, according to a senior aide. Congress must pass the measure by Friday’s midnight deadline. Congressional Republicans have shown little appetite for another shutdown after taking heavy criticism over the prior one. “I hope he’ll decide to sign it,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy also touted the deal. But the most conservative members of the House are unhappy with the deal, a sign it could face trouble if some liberal Democrats also defect over border fencing funding and concerns about the number of beds in immigrant detention facilities. “Most conservative members are having real heartburn today,” Republican Representative Mark Meadows said on Fox News. “I can tell you it’s the Democrats that are walking around here on Capitol Hill with a smile on their face today, not Republicans.”     Congressional sources said the agreement includes $1.37 billion for new fencing - about the same as last year - along 55 miles (90 km) of the border but only with currently used designs such as “steel bollard” fencing. It also addresses capacity at immigration detention facilities, specifically the number of beds for people awaiting possible deportation. Trump previously threatened to declare a “national emergency” if Congress did not provide money specifically for the wall, an action under which he might redirect other funds already provided by Congress to pay for wall construction. Fellow Republicans have told Trump such a step would almost certainly draw opposition, both in Congress and in the courts. On Tuesday, Trump signaled possible unilateral action. “The bottom is on the wall: We’re building the wall,” Trump said, adding: “We’re supplementing things, and moving things around, and we’re doing things that are fantastic and taking, really, from far-less-important areas.” Republican James Inhofe, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that he urged Trump weeks ago not to raid Pentagon accounts to build a wall. Inhofe indicated Trump could try to use Army Corps of Engineers funds. Trump made the wall a central 2016 campaign promise, calling it necessary to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He said Mexico would pay for it, but Mexican officials rejected that. Democrats have called a wall expensive, ineffective and immoral. McConnell, who had counseled Trump against the previous shutdown, said Democrats had abandoned “unreasonable” demands. McCarthy told CNBC that Democrats had caved by allowing the new border fencing. The border barrier funding was far short, however, of the $5.7 billion in wall money Trump wanted and was less than Trump could have had in compromise legislation passed in December by the Senate. Senior Democrats threw their weight behind the deal and said both sides gave ground. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said: “I strongly urge the president to sign this.” Trump retreated last month when he agreed to end the shutdown without getting wall money. The shutdown roiled financial markets and left hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors without pay. Democrats oppose the wall, but support border security efforts. The number of beds in detention facilities was a contentious part of the negotiations because it can either constrain or expand the administration’s ability to aggressively deport more immigrants, including those seeking asylum. Congressional aides on Tuesday gave differing accounts on the number of beds the deal permitted, with some saying it would drop to 40,520 by later this year and others saying it could rise to 58,500. Democrats had sought to limit the number.

4449,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. economic growth in 2018 missed the Trump administration’s 3% target by any measure, which could renew criticism of the White House’s $1.5 trillion in tax cuts.  The Commerce Department said on Friday that gross domestic product increased at a 2.9% rate last year, confirming an estimate which was published in March. The department’s annual revisions to GDP data also showed the economy growing 2.5% in the 12 months through the fourth quarter of 2018, down from the previously reported 3.0%. President Donald Trump had highlighted the year-on-year growth figure as proof that the tax cuts and a government spending blitz, which have helped to swell the federal government deficit, had put the economy on a sustainable path of strong growth. The White House and Republicans have argued that the massive tax cuts, which included slashing the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, would pay for themselves through strong economic growth. Democrats assailed the tax cuts as benefiting wealthy Americans at the expense of the middle-class.  The updated GDP data, and signs that the economy shifted into lower gear in the second quarter after receiving a boost from exports and an accumulation of unsold goods in the first three months of 2019, are undercutting that argument. Trump likes to showcase the economy as one of the biggest achievements of his first term in office, declaring last July that his administration had “accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions.” On the campaign trail, Trump boasted he could boost annual GDP growth to 4%. The downgrade to the 2018 year-on-year measure to below 3% may well irk a commander-in-chief who has been quick to blame the U.S. Federal Reserve in particular for actions he sees as stymieing his growth agenda. The Fed meets on interest rates next week, and Trump has already been jawboning policymakers to cut borrowing costs, which he says would allow the economy to take off “like a rocket ship.” Economists, though, have long cautioned that the 3% growth target was unrealistic, given low productivity among other factors. Economists estimate the economy’s growth potential, or the pace at which it can expand without generating too much inflation, at around 2%.  An alternative measure of economic growth, gross domestic income (GDI), rose 2.5% in 2018. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased 2.7% in 2018. The updated Commerce Department data also showed growth in the second and third quarters of last year was not as robust as previously estimated, and the economy grew much more slowly in the fourth quarter than had been reported in March.  Still, the economy’s performance in 2018 was an acceleration from the 2.4% growth notched in 2017. It matched the performance in 2015 during the Obama administration. The economy grew 2.8% in the 12 months through the fourth quarter of 2017. The data also showed growth in consumer spending peaking in the second quarter and decelerating sharply in the final three months of 2018.  Growth in the first quarter of 2018 was revised up to a 2.5% annualized rate from 2.2%. Second-quarter growth, which prompted Trump’s mission accomplished declaration, was cut to a 3.5% pace from a 4.2% rate. Growth in the third quarter was slashed to a 2.9% rate from a 3.4% pace. Fourth-quarter GDP growth was lowered to a 1.1% pace from a 2.2% rate.  The downward revisions to the three quarters largely reflected downgrades to business investment, suggesting corporations likely did not plow their tax windfall back into their businesses. Some companies like Apple (AAPL.O) used their windfall for share buybacks. But the lower taxes boosted savings last year. The saving rate was raised to 7.7% from 6.7%, reflecting upward revisions to repatriated profit from the rest of the world. Corporate profit estimates were, however, marked down in both 2017 and 2018.

4869,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. business inventories rose moderately in May as sales rebounded, suggesting that inventory accumulation could have been a drag on economic growth in the second quarter. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that business inventories increased 0.3% after advancing 0.5% in April. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. May’s reading was in line with economists’ expectations. Retail inventories increased 0.4% in May instead of  rising 0.5% as estimated in an advance report published last month. Motor vehicle inventories rose 0.7% in May, rather than advancing 0.8% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.3% as reported last month.  Economists expect inventories subtracted from GDP growth in the second quarter after contributing 0.55 percentage point to the economy’s 3.1% annualized growth pace in the January-March period. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 1.4% rate in the second quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP next week.  The accumulation in inventories reflects tepid domestic demand early in the year. A trade war between the United States and China has also added to the inventory bloat as businesses stocked up in an effort to get ahead of the tariff fight. Wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in May. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.2%. Most of the inventory overhang is in the automobile industry, which is experiencing a slowdown in sales, contributing to weak production at factories. Business sales rebounded 0.2% in May after falling 0.2% in the prior month. At May’s sales pace, it would take 1.39 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from April.  The motor vehicle inventory-to-sales ratio was unchanged at 2.35 months in May.

5402,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday defended his surprise decision to declare victory over Islamic State militants in Syria and completely withdraw U.S. troops from the country, amid criticism from some Republicans and concern from allies and some U.S. military commanders. In early morning tweets, Trump said he was fulfilling a promise from his 2016 presidential campaign to leave Syria. Echoing a central plank of his foreign policy - that he seeks to stop the United States being taken advantage of - he said the United States was doing the work of other countries, including Russia and Iran, with little in return. “Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight,” he tweeted. The United States is also ending its air campaign against the militants in Syria, U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday.     Trump had pledged to withdraw from Syria if elected, but the abrupt announcement on Wednesday to withdraw the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria caught U.S. lawmakers and others by surprise. The White House declined to offer a timeline for the departure.     Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans strongly criticized the move, saying they were not briefed ahead of time and that the move strengthened the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told Reuters that U.S. commanders on the ground are also concerned about the impact of a quick withdrawal and were surprised by the decision.   Trump’s move also drew criticism from some U.S. allies, including Britain and France, which said Islamic State militants had not been defeated and that its troops would remain in Syria. The void left by the U.S. withdrawal could undermine diplomatic efforts to end Syria’s eight-year civil war and undercut the United States’ leverage in the region as well as leave it few options if Islamic State surges again.  “ISIS hits us they are doomed!” Trump tweeted, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Islamic State, which declared its so-called caliphate in 2014 after seizing large areas of Syria and Iraq, was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held in Syria and has no territory in Iraq, a senior U.S. official last week. But U.S. officials have warned that retaking territory is not the same as defeating the militants. In a campaign to defeat the group in Syria, former President Barack Obama ordered air strikes from September 2014 and then troops into the country the following year. Some U.S. lawmakers, including some Democrats, backed Wednesday’s announced withdrawal but said Congress needed to play a larger role in overseeing such military operations.  Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday welcomed Trump’s decision and said he largely agreed that Islamic State had been defeated.  Trump, however, said Russia - as well as Iran and Syria - were unhappy about the U.S. withdrawal “because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us.” Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Murphy said Trump’s statements appeared in conflict: “Wait a minute... I thought we defeated ISIS. Why would Russia, Iran and Syria have to fight them if they’re defeated?” he tweeted in reply to Trump.

6000,"  - Wall Street surged on Tuesday and the S&P 500 approached a record high after Washington rekindled trade talks with Beijing, boosting sentiment along with growing investor confidence that the Fed will cut interest rates this year. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit later this month, and said talks between the two countries would restart after a recent lull. Global stock markets have rallied and retreated repeatedly in recent months in reaction to comments from Trump about progress - or lack of progress - in negotiating an end to the trade conflict. Trump’s statement on Tuesday pushed trade-sensitive industrials up 1.9% and technology stocks gained 1.7%. Together, they were the biggest boost to the benchmark index.  Chip companies, which have a sizable revenue exposure to China, led the rally in tech stocks, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index surging 4.3%. “We can’t discount how big a deal it is for China and the U.S. not to go into a prolonged trade spat. I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet, though,” said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.  “I’d wait for the G20 meeting to see actual discussions coming out of that before we go back into a risk-on mode,” he said.  The U.S.-China trade war and its impact on economic growth have investors increasingly expecting the Federal Reserve will cut rates to preserve the U.S. economic expansion, which would be the longest on record this summer. The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its two-day policy meeting that ends Wednesday, while laying the foundation for a cut later this year. The Fed is scheduled to release its statement at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference shortly after. The S&P 500 has gained 6% so far this month, and is only about 1% from the all-time high hit in early May.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.35% to end at  26,465.54 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.97% to 2,917.75. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.39% to 7,953.88. Comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi  indicating the possibility of fresh rate cuts or asset purchases also lifted sentiment. Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp rose between 0.8% and 2.4%, with the tech triumvirate contributing more than any other stocks to increases in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Boeing Co jumped 5.4%, buoying the Dow, after the planemaker received an order for its 737 MAX jets valued at more than $24 billion at list prices; the 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two deadly crashes.     The utilities, real estate and consumer staples sectors, all of which are viewed as defensive, were the only decliners. With about two weeks left in the second quarter, analysts on average expect second-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share to increase by 0.2%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In early April, that estimate stood at 2.8% growth. The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 46 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.0 billion shares, compared to the 6.8 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

6343,"SEOUL   - Yanolja’s gentrification of South Korean love hotels has brought the company a valuation of more than $1 billion from investors keen to capitalize on the globalization of a novel approach to short-stay accommodation, its chief executive told Reuters. The budget hotel and online booking platform operator reached the valuation having secured $180 million from U.S. peer Booking Holdings Inc and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd, Yanolja confirmed on Tuesday.  It aims to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) as early as next year, CEO Kim Jong-yoon said in an earlier interview. “I can proudly say we transformed the industry.” Yanolja’s emergence comes at a time of flux among hoteliers with legislators at loggerheads with market disruptors such as Airbnb Inc - through which private homeowners can let rooms for short-term stay - while a government campaign to reduce working hours promises to free up more leisure time for short breaks. Love hotels have occupied a peculiar space in the broader market, offering privacy for as little as a few hours at minimal cost for, for instance, young couples living with their parents. However, a popular association with extramarital affairs, prostitution and hidden cameras has sullied their reputation, exacerbated by their often garish decor and muted lighting. Yanolja - meaning “Hey, let’s play” - sought to dispel any stigma with its bright, modern franchised budget hotels, targeting millennial couples but also budget tourists seeking short-term accommodation.  “Previously, many people were not able to go to motels out of embarrassment,” Kim said. “But we’ve drawn in guests even for travel. That’s the biggest change.” The firm, which began as an online search portal for love hotels, also lists hotel, pension and guest house rooms on its website at prices ranging from 50,000 won ($41.86) a night at budget hotel Ben-Hur to 200,000 won at five-star Hyatt. It has entered a strategic partnership with Booking whereby the latter’s Agoda brand can list Yanolja accommodation, while Yanolja customers will be able to book worldwide through Agoda and other Booking brands, Yanolja said in a Tuesday statement. Booking and GIC were not immediately available for comment. Yanolja has become the eighth South Korean unicorn to have valuation of more than $1 billion, in a country dominated by large conglomerates like Samsung and Hyundai.  “It’s a unique example which breaks away from the traditional notion of love hotels,” said tourism professor Lee Hoon at Hanyang University in Seoul. “But the domestic market is not big enough. Yanolja can survive only if it goes global and scales up,” Lee said. Yanolja aims to expand in hotels in Southeast Asia where it invested $15 million in ZEN Rooms last year, bringing it into competition with Indian budget hotel operator Oyo, backed by Airbnb and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. “We are very keen to go global,” said Kim. Yanolja was founded in 2005 by former love hotel housekeeper and valet Lee Su-jin, whose search portal evolved into an advertising platform for love hotel operators seeking to replace customers lost after the 2004 passing of an anti-prostitution law. A decade later, Yanolja claimed to be the first company to offer a reservation platform for mobile phones for its own and others’ love hotels, a major shift in an industry which relied on walk-in customers. The platform allowed it to expand its target guests to shoe-string travelers from home and abroad, in a country where Airbnb-type options are limited to foreign guests. Listings later ballooned as hoteliers turned to Yanolja to fill rooms after a political dispute caused a drop in Chinese demand. South Korea’s online travel sales nearly doubled in five years through 2018 to $21.8 billion, Euromonitor data provided to Reuters showed. Sales by mobile made up nearly half of the total, the third-biggest proportion globally, Euromonitor said.

6376,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING   - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was ready to impose another round of punitive tariffs on Chinese imports if he cannot make progress in trade talks with China’s President at a Group of 20 summit later this month. Since two days of talks to resolve the U.S.-China trade dispute last month in Washington ended in a stalemate, Trump has repeatedly said he expected to meet President Xi Jinping at the June 28-29 summit in Osaka, Japan. China has not confirmed any such meeting. Trump said last week he would decide after the meeting of the leaders of the world’s largest economies whether to carry out a threat to impose tariffs on at least $300 billion in Chinese goods.  In comments to reporters on Monday, Trump said he still thought the meeting with Xi would happen. “We are scheduled to talk and to meet. I think interesting things will happen. Let’s see what happens,” Trump told reporters at the White House. The United States has already imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods.  China’s foreign ministry said on Monday that China is open to more trade talks with Washington but has nothing to announce about a possible meeting. Tensions between Washington and Beijing rose sharply in May after the Trump administration accused China of having reneged on promises to make structural economic changes during months of trade talks. The United States is seeking sweeping changes, including an end to forced technology transfers and theft of U.S. trade secrets. It also wants curbs on subsidies for Chinese state-owned enterprises and better access for U.S. firms in Chinese markets. On May 10, Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods up to 25% and took steps to levy duties on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on a revised list of $60 billion in U.S. goods. The U.S. government has also angered China by putting Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on a blacklist that effectively bans U.S. companies from doing business with the Chinese firm, the world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker. Investors worry China will retaliate by putting U.S. companies on a blacklist or banning exports to the United States of rare earth metals, which are used in products such as memory chips, rechargeable batteries and cell phones. Fitch Ratings said on Monday any such move would be disruptive to the U.S. technology sector and could hurt some Chinese sectors as well, though it added that it was too early to assess potential credit implications. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said the Huawei dispute could be addressed as part of a trade deal with China. The escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies has unnerved financial markets with worries that it could further disrupt global manufacturing and supply chains and push an already slowing global economy into recession. On Sunday, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said resolving the current trade tensions should be the top priority for G20 economies. China reported on Monday its exports unexpectedly grew 1.1 percent in May from a year ago despite the higher U.S. tariffs, but imports fell the most in nearly three years. Some analysts suspect Chinese exporters may have rushed out shipments to the United States to avoid potential new U.S. tariffs. Many U.S. business groups oppose the tariffs, with companies worried about slowing demand as they pass higher prices along to consumers and manufacturers across a range of products. Late last month Trump said he would impose tariffs on Mexican goods if Mexico did not agree to take strong steps to curb the flow of mostly Central American migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Washington and Mexico City reached a deal on Friday to avert the tariffs, removing for the time being at least the prospect that the United States would find itself in trade wars with two of its three largest trading partners. Global equities rose on Monday and the U.S. dollar gained against a basket of currencies. The Mexican peso rose more than 2% against the greenback, reversing most of its losses from the past couple of weeks.  Trump, who has embraced protectionism as part of an “America First” agenda, said on Monday the tariff threat on Mexico would be reinstated if Mexico’s Congress did not ratify another part of the migration pact.

6540,"NEW YORK   - Major world stock indexes and oil prices jumped on Thursday as investor optimism grew following a report that the United States is considering a delay in imposing tariffs on Mexican imports. The Mexican peso also surged after the Bloomberg News report, which cited unidentified sources saying that U.S. President Donald Trump could put off implementing the tariffs he has threatened to impose on Mexican goods as soon as Monday. Adding to investor bullishness was a Washington Post report on the outlines of an immigration deal being discussed by U.S. and Mexican officials to thwart the threatened tariffs. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey, said that while investors are viewing the tariff delay news as a positive, they are likely to remain guarded when it comes to trade-related news. “When you have a fluid situation in terms of the tariffs, it calls for caution and patience on the part of investors,” she said.  After the closing bell, a White House spokeswoman said the Monday deadline for tariffs on Mexico has not changed, and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Mexico has to take decisive action on immigration to avoid tariffs. Earlier in the day, Trump said he would decide on whether to levy more tariffs on China “probably right after the G20,” which is being held on June 28-29. That came after his overnight threat to put tariffs on “at least” another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. On Wall Street, Thursday was the first time since mid-May that the three major indexes gained ground for three sessions in a row. Hopes of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve have helped to support the market amid the trade tensions and mixed economic data that has rekindled worries about the health of the world’s top economies. Friday brings the closely watched monthly U.S. jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 181.09 points, or 0.71%, to 25,720.66, the S&P 500 gained 17.34 points, or 0.61%, to 2,843.49, and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.08 points, or 0.53%, to 7,615.55. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.02% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.33%. Mexico’s peso gained as much as 1.2% from where it was trading before the Bloomberg report on the Mexico tariffs. Earlier, it suffered a double whammy of trade woes with the United States and a downgrade of the country’s credit rating. In late trading, the Mexican peso lost 0.57% versus the U.S. dollar to 19.71. The dollar index fell 0.28%, with the euro up 0.49% to $1.1274. Oil prices jumped on the U.S.-Mexico trade report. U.S. crude rose 2.73% to $53.09 per barrel. The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened as the European Central Bank committed to leaving interest rates alone into the first half of 2020. The gap between two-year and 10-year yields narrowed by 4.4 basis points to 23.30 basis point. The ECB’s move disappointed traders who had bet on a rate cut, but most yields ended the day higher in the wake of the Bloomberg report on tariffs. In late U.S. trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were up 0.80 basis point at 2.131%. (GRAPHIC-Asia stock markets link: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4).

6719,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump engaged in tax schemes that included cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions of dollars in taxes, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. The Times investigation, which the White House said was “misleading,” showed Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father’s real estate business.  The Times, citing a “vast trove” of confidential tax returns and financial records, reported that much of that fortune came to Trump because he helped his parents evade taxes, setting up a fake corporation with his siblings to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents.  Trump promoted himself during his presidential campaign as a self-made real estate mogul who started out with only a “very small” loan from his businessman father, Fred Trump. Reuters has not been able to verify the report. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called the story “misleading” and said in a statement “many decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on these transactions.” Trump’s lawyer Charles Harder told the Times: “President Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters.” “The affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law,” Harder said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter late on Tuesday: “I’ve directed NYC’s Department of Finance to immediately investigate tax and housing violations and to work with NY State to find out if appropriate taxes were paid.” James Gazzale, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, said earlier the department “is reviewing the allegations in the New York Times article and is vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation.” The U.S. Internal Revenue Service did not reply immediately to a request for comment. The Times, citing tax experts, reported it was unlikely Trump would face criminal prosecution because the acts were past the statute of limitations. There is no time limit, however, on civil fines for tax fraud, according to the paper. It reported that its findings were based on more than 200 tax returns from Fred Trump, his companies and various Trump partnerships and trusts. The records did not include Donald Trump’s personal tax returns. Unlike other White House candidates and presidents in recent decades, Trump has declined to release his tax returns. The Times said the report was also based on interviews with Fred Trump’s former employees and advisers and more than 100,000 pages of documents describing the inner workings of his business empire. “The investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records - bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks,” it said.

7761,"  - Impossible Foods, which makes a meatless plant-based burger and is backed by celebrities like Serena Williams and Katy Perry, said on Monday it has raised $300 million in the latest round of funding ahead of a possible initial public offering. The fundraising underscores the growing appeal in plant-based food that tries to taste like meat with fewer environmental or health risks. Shares of competitor Beyond Meat Inc, which debuted on Nasdaq on May 2, have more than tripled. The latest round for Impossible Foods brings the Silicon Valley-based startup’s total raised to more than $750 million. Despite encouraging signs from investors, it is not in a hurry to go public, Chief Financial Officer David Lee told Reuters. “We believe in self-reliance. Being ready to go public is a priority for the company because we need to be operating at the highest level of rigor,” Lee said. “But we are not in a rush, nor are we announcing an IPO filing.” Celebrities have jumped on the investor bandwagon, including Jay-Z, Will.i.am, Jaden Smith and Katy Perry, who recently wore a vegan burger outfit to New York’s annual Met Gala, making reference to Impossible Foods. Star athletes including Serena Williams, National Football League quarterback Kirk Cousins and National Basketball Association star Paul George have also opened their wallets. Institutional investors include Khosla Ventures, Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates, Google Ventures, Horizons Ventures, UBS, Viking Global Investors, Temasek, Sailing Capital, and Open Philanthropy Project. The fifth equity funding round since its launch in 2011 values Impossible Foods at $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter. By comparison, Beyond Meat had a market capitalization of just under $1.5 billion in its IPO but now tops $4 billion.  Lee said Beyond Meat’s successful IPO did not change Impossible plans or timing to go public but was a “validation.” “I think their (Beyond Meat) IPO indicates that retail investors along with retail consumers are ready for something better than the meat they’ve been eating for decades,” Lee said. Impossible launched its first faux meat patty over two years ago. A genetically modified yeast creates the key ingredient, called heme, which makes the patties appear to be bloody and juicy and taste like real meat unlike conventional veggie burgers. Ingredients include wheat, soy and potato proteins.  Fast-food chain Burger King has said it will launch “Impossible Whopper,” which uses Impossible Foods’ plant-based patties, nationwide after a successful trial at limited locations. Impossible Burger is sold at more than 7,000 restaurants worldwide including White Castle, Qdoba and Red Robin and at Disney theme parks. Impossible plans to launch its products in retail outlets in the second half of this year. Lee declined to give a more specific timetable or identify those partners but said the company is actively talking with “top grocery chains in the nation.” Beyond Meat’s products are already sold at Whole Foods and Safeway stores. As consumer appetites grow, competition is heating up in the global meat-substitute market, which is projected to reach $5.81 billion by 2022, according to a 2018 study by Grand View Research.     Tyson Foods, the largest meat processor in the United States, will roll out meatless protein products in the coming months while McDonald’s Corp began selling vegan burgers in Germany. “We don’t lead with the source of guilt that meat eaters have globally. We lead with what they want positively which is craveability with better options for the environment and their health,” Lee said. “It’s the craveability that makes meat eaters find their own reason to come back for Impossible Burger.” ",Exclusive: Impossible Foods raises $300 million with investors eager for bite of meatless burgers,"May 13, 2019 /  10:18 AM ", impossible foods which makes a meatless plant based burger and is backed by celebrities like serena williams and katy perry said on monday it has raised  million in the latest round of funding ahead of a possible initial public offering the fundraising underscores the growing appeal in plant based food that tries to taste like meat with fewer environmental or health risks shares of competitor beyond meat inc which debuted on nasdaq on may  have more than tripled the latest round for impossible foods brings the silicon valley based startup s total raised to more than  million despite encouraging signs from investors it is not in a hurry to go public chief financial officer david lee told  we believe in self reliance being ready to go public is a priority for the company because we need to be operating at the highest level of rigor lee said but we are not in a rush nor are we announcing an ipo filing celebrities have jumped on the investor bandwagon including jay z will i am jaden smith and katy perry who recently wore a vegan burger outfit to new york s annual met gala making reference to impossible foods star athletes including serena williams national football league quarterback kirk cousins and national basketball association star paul george have also opened their wallets institutional investors include khosla ventures microsoft corp co founder bill gates google ventures horizons ventures ubs viking global investors temasek sailing capital and open philanthropy project the fifth equity funding round since its launch in  values impossible foods at  billion according to sources familiar with the matter by comparison beyond meat had a market capitalization of just under   billion in its ipo but now tops  billion lee said beyond meat s successful ipo did not change impossible plans or timing to go public but was a validation i think their beyond meat ipo indicates that retail investors along with retail consumers are ready for something better than the meat they ve been eating for decades lee said impossible launched its first faux meat patty over two years ago a genetically modified yeast creates the key ingredient called heme which makes the patties appear to be bloody and juicy and taste like real meat unlike conventional veggie burgers ingredients include wheat soy and potato proteins fast food chain burger king has said it will launch impossible whopper which uses impossible foods plant based patties nationwide after a successful trial at limited locations impossible burger is sold at more than   restaurants worldwide including white castle qdoba and red robin and at disney theme parks impossible plans to launch its products in retail outlets in the second half of this year lee declined to give a more specific timetable or identify those partners but said the company is actively talking with top grocery chains in the nation beyond meat s products are already sold at whole foods and safeway stores as consumer appetites grow competition is heating up in the global meat substitute market which is projected to reach   billion by  according to a  study by grand view research tyson foods the largest meat processor in the united states will roll out meatless protein products in the coming months while mcdonald s corp began selling vegan burgers in germany we don t lead with the source of guilt that meat eaters have globally we lead with what they want positively which is craveability with better options for the environment and their health lee said it s the craveability that makes meat eaters find their own reason to come back for impossible burger ,US China Trade War,0.2374754250049591
8050,"HANOI   - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday urged North Korea to follow the example of Vietnam, saying President Donald Trump believed Pyongyang could replicate Hanoi’s path to normal relations with Washington and to prosperity. But for that to happen, its leader Kim Jong Un needed to seize the moment. Speaking to business executives in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi, Pompeo said he hoped the United States could one day share the same level of partnership with North Korea as it did with Vietnam, a long-time former enemy.   His comments followed two days of frosty talks in Pyongyang aimed at persuading Kim to give up nuclear weapons, which prompted North Korean accusations he had used “gangster-like” diplomacy. Pompeo said on Sunday that, on the heels of those talks,  Trump believed North Korea could replicate the path taken by Vietnam, whose leaders had realized their country could reform and build relationships without threatening its sovereignty and form of government. He said the key to Vietnam’s rise was post-Vietnam War engagement with the United States, which began in 1985, when the countries started working together to repatriate remains of U.S. service members lost in Vietnam. As part of his talks with North Korea, Pompeo has been seeking the return of remains from the 1950-53 Korean War and  officials from the two sides are due to meet next week to discuss details of this.

8084,"LONDON/FRANKFURT   - Vodafone stepped up its battle to gain regulatory approval for its Liberty Global deal on Tuesday by offering rival Telefonica Deutschland access to its enlarged high-speed broadband network. The world’s No.2 mobile operator agreed a year ago to pay $22 billion for Liberty’s cable networks in Germany and central Europe, seeking increased fixed-line heft to better compete with German market leader Deutsche Telekom. Seeking to increase competition in the German market and defuse criticism of the deal, Vodafone on Tuesday said that Telefonica Deutschland would be able to offer super-fast services over Vodafone and Liberty’s Unitymedia cable networks in Germany if the deal is approved.  The networks will cover 23.7 million households and would help Telefonica Deutschland to move up from its distant third position in fixed-line broadband, behind Deutsche and Vodafone.  Telefonica Deutschland Chief Executive Markus Haas said the agreement would enable it to connect millions of additional households in Germany with high-speed internet.  “By adding fast cable connections, we now have access to an extensive infrastructure portfolio and can offer to even more O2 customers attractive broadband products – including internet-based TV with O2 TV – for better value for money,” he said.     Telefonica Deutschland has nearly a quarter of the German mobile market, second to Deutsche and ahead of Vodafone, according to a 2018 estimate by VATM, which represents independent telecom firms. But it has long trailed rivals in the fixed-line broadband market, with just 5.9 percent. U.S.based Liberty Global, which has extensive international operations, has already sold its Austrian business and is now seeking to exit Switzerland as well as Germany and central Europe in what would be its biggest ever divestment. It had 13 million subscriptions and made revenue of $700 million in Germany in the first quarter of this year. CEO Mike Fries said in a statement on Monday night he was confident the deal could be completed this summer. “We have crossed a number of key milestones and the European Commission is currently in the final stages of its review,” he said. Tuesday’s announcement was designed to win over regulators in Brussels who are reviewing the proposed merger with Liberty, before a decision by July 9. Liberty Global was last year given the green light by Brussels to buy Dutch cable operator Ziggo when it agreed to several conditions over access to its network.   Vodafone and Unitymedia, Liberty’s German business, operate in different parts of the country and do not compete head to head. Nick Read, CEO of Vodafone Group, said the deal would be transformational, offering high speeds for consumers and renewed competition in the four markets.  But a merged entity would have a very strong position in cable and broadband, in particular to multi-family apartment blocks, leading competitors to urge regulators to step in and ensure that they also have ‘last-mile’ access to households. Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges initially clashed with Vodafone’s then-CEO Vittorio Colao over the Liberty deal last year, saying it was unacceptable because it would create a cable TV monopoly in Germany. Hoettges later softened his criticism, instead calling for the regulatory burden to be eased on Deutsche Telekom which is required to open up its German fixed-line network to competitors at controlled prices.  Deutsche Telekom said on Tuesday the Vodafone offer to open its network showed the British company was desperate to keep its deal alive. The proposal would not lead to a single additional broadband cable being laid in Germany, it added, and could even slow work to build out super-fast fibre-optic networks - a government priority. Jefferies analyst Ulrich Rathe said the offer was only a proposed remedy at this stage, and would still need to be accepted.  “This would improve the ability of mobile-centric Telefonica Deutschland to address convergence tactics by Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone,” he said. “For Deutsche Telekom, this spells downside to otherwise expected wholesale revenue from Telefonica.” The European Commission opened a full-scale probe into the deal in December. Sources, however, said last month it had not raised any major concerns about the impact of the deal on Germany’s cable market.   Shares in Vodafone rose 1 percent by 1050 GMT, while Telefonica Deutschland gained 2.5 percent. Deutsche Telekom was up almost 1 percent.

9065,"  - United Airlines on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected jump in first-quarter profit as it sold more tickets and cut costs, standing by its 2019 profit target even as its Boeing Co 737 MAX jets remain grounded. Chicago-based United has removed its 14 MAX aircraft, which were suspended worldwide in March following two fatal crashes, from its flying schedule through early July, eating into U.S. airlines’ peak summer travel season.  Still, the airline’s parent United Continental Holdings Inc reiterated its estimate for adjusted earnings of $10 to $12 per share in 2019, and said its strategy for scheduling more flights out of its hubs was continuing to win customers. Adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.15 in the first quarter, ending March 31, from 49 cents a year earlier, overcoming a U.S. government shutdown and severe winter weather earlier this year that curtailed flights. Wall Street analysts on average had forecast 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its shares rose 2.8 percent in after-hours trading. United has largely avoided canceling MAX flights by servicing those routes with larger aircraft, but President Scott Kirby warned last week that the strategy could not last indefinitely. The airline, which has been adding seats at a faster pace than rivals, trimmed its 2019 capacity growth target to between 4 percent and 5 percent from 4 percent to 6 percent previously, but did not say whether the decision reflected the effect of the grounded MAX.  Total operating revenue rose 7.1 percent to $8.73 billion in the quarter, while closely watched revenue per available seat mile rose 1.1 percent. In the second quarter, United said it expects unit revenue to rise between 0.5 percent and 2.5 percent while unit costs, which fell 1.8 percent in the first quarter, were expected to be flat to 1 percent higher. The No. 3 U.S. carrier is the first of three U.S. 737 MAX operators to report first-quarter results. Southwest Airlines Co and American Airlines Group Inc, which have removed their MAX jets from schedules into August, report on April 25 and April 26 respectively. A Federal Aviation Administration review board said on Tuesday that it found a Boeing software update for the MAX to be “operationally suitable,” suggesting the lengthy regulatory process to get the planes back in the air was underway. Rival Delta Air Lines Inc, which does not operate the 737 MAX, lifted its 2019 revenue forecast last week after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit.

9182,"MONTREAL/SINGAPORE/SHANGHAI   - Gulfstream Aerospace and Bombardier are trotting out their longest-range business jets at an Asian air show this week, as they compete for orders from China’s growing elite, despite the country’s slowing economy.  The Asian Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition, (ABACE) opens Tuesday in Shanghai under a cloud of economic uncertainty, amid slowing Chinese growth, the U.S.-China trade dispute, and Beijing’s crackdown on debt risks that has led funding to dry up in certain industries, brokers said. “The biggest factor that impacted the business jet market was pessimism and uncertainty which stalled purchase intentions or forced those marginal owners to reconsider keeping their business jets,” said Jeffrey Lowe, managing director of Hong Kong-based Asian Sky Group. Still, Canada’s Bombardier sees its new $73 million Global 7500 business jet making inroads in Greater China against market leader Gulfstream’s $65 million-plus G650 family.  The plane and train maker said on Sunday it secured firm orders for four Global 7500 planes that were converted from options taken by Hong Kong-based business jet management company HK Bellawings in 2018.  Greater China’s number of billionaires has been growing yearly by 10 percent over the past three years, and the Global 7500’s long range will help to “seize market share and to withstand any economic uncertainty in the region,” said Bombardier Business Aircraft President David Coleal by email. Both Gulfstream’s 650ER and the Global 7500 connect far-flung cities like New York and Tokyo, an allure for elite Asian buyers who want to fly non-stop to Western hubs. “You don’t need a G7500 to fly three or four hours. But when you do need (longer) range you can use this jet,” said Thomas Flohr, founder and chairman of Vista Global and a Global 7500 customer. Gulfstream, a division of General Dynamics, which brought its large-cabin G500 jet into service last year, delivered 68 new corporate aircraft between 2015 and 2018 in the region, more than double the 32 planes delivered by its Canadian competitor, according to Asian Sky.  On Monday, Gulfstream announced the sale of a G650 to Chinese manufacturing and metal distribution company Jiachen Group. Gulfstream President Mark Burns said by email the U.S. company is seeing more optimism in the region and is “starting to see more activity as trade talks appear to be progressing and becoming more specific.”  The Asia Pacific region, nevertheless, accounted for only about 8 percent of the 3,478 business jets delivered globally over the last five years, compared with 2,122 jets delivered to North America, according to Cirium Fleets Analyzer data.   And the number of Chinese-owned second-hand business jets sold outside the country rose to 20 in 2018, compared with an annual average of 10 from 2014 to 2017, according to the Cirium data. Jackie Wu, president of JetSolution Aviation Group, said weaker business jet sales have prompted her Hong Kong company to launch its first charter service using the supermidsized Embraer Legacy 600. “We are an industry that very much reflects the health of an economy, or the world economy,” said Jetcraft Asia president David Dixon, adding he nevertheless sees greater demand from other Asian countries like Indonesia and Malaysia.

10118," (In March 26 story, modifies paragraph 13 to show that Reuters could not independently verify Huawei’s ownership structure; corrects paragraph 20 to show that Huawei is the No. 3 vendor of smartphones) By Jonathan Weber and Sijia Jiang SHENZHEN/HONG KONG   - The U.S. campaign against China’s Huawei is having little impact on the company’s sales and it is unlikely many countries will follow the United States in banning Huawei from building next-generation mobile networks, its rotating Chairman Eric Xu said. “Recently we are seeing a large number of countries making their own decisions,” Xu said during an interview at Huawei Technologies’ headquarters in Shenzhen.  While Australia has banned Huawei from 5G networks over security concerns, European Union countries such as Germany and France have indicated they are likely to ignore the U.S. call to shut out the telecoms giant. “Maybe it’s only Australia,” Xu told Reuters reporters after a tour of the campus. Xu affirmed that Huawei’s revenue jumped 36 percent over the first two months of 2019 and was set for a 15 percent annual spike to $125 billion, underlining strength in its smartphone business and sales of computing and communications networks. Huawei has been facing mounting scrutiny, led by the United States, amid worries its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. The company, however, says the concerns are unfounded.  Xu said he does not expect the United States to intensify its attack on the company by barring sales of U.S. components to Huawei, a move that almost put its compatriot ZTE Corp out of business last year before U.S. President Donald Trump lifted the ban.  Huawei is the world’s third-largest buyer of computer chips, many of which come from U.S. companies, and a sales ban would be disruptive to the global tech industry, Xu said.  Xu’s comments come at a time when Huawei has sued the U.S. government over a law that restricts its market access. In Canada, lawyers for Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, have sued the government over her Dec. 1 arrest at the behest of the United States. She was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran. Huawei, a privately held firm that offers few details about its internal operations, has in recent months offered media interviews and invited journalists to tour its facilities as part of a counter-attack against the allegations of spying.  Reuters reporters were invited on Monday to peruse files in Huawei’s “share registry room” where it keeps records on tens of thousands of employee shareholders.  Huawei said the records show that the firm is owned by its employees and that its 74-year-old founder Ren owns just over 1 percent of the company. Reuters could not independently verify the ownership structure.  Much of the global scrutiny of Huawei stems from Ren’s background with China’s People’s Liberation Army, where he was a civilian engineer for nearly a decade until his departure in 1983 after helping to build its communications network.     Reuters also toured Huawei’s new campus in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, that features buildings modeled on European cities including Paris and Heidelberg, connected by a special train imported from Switzerland.  However, there was little activity on the campus, which is designed to house 18,000 workers, save a couple of black swans flitting about a lake. In contrast, another Huawei facility nearby bustled with workers assembling smartphones on automated production lines.  Huawei’s growth is mainly being driven by its booming smartphone business and sales of computing and communications networks to government and business customers.  Future growth will also come “primarily” from these, Xu said, with sales of equipment to telecom carriers growing at single digit rates. Huawei is the world’s top producer of telecoms equipment and third-biggest maker of smartphones. On Huawei’s semiconductor operations, HiSilicon, Xu said the unit produced more than $7.5 billion worth of chips last year. That compares with an estimated $21 billon of chips that Huawei acquired from outside vendors. HiSilicon produces chip designs for Huawei’s equipment mainly, with the manufacturing handled by so-called “foundry” companies such as Taiwan’s TSMC.  It does sell chips to others for use in video cameras, television set-top boxes and some low-cost internet-connected devices, Xu said. Huawei will report its 2018 financial results at a press briefing on Friday, which over a hundred journalists are expected to attend, far more than in past years.  “The United States should take quite a lot of the credit for making advertisements for Huawei,” Xu quipped.

10300,"CHICAGO/WASHINGTON   - Teams from the three U.S. airlines that own 737 MAX jets headed to Boeing Co’s factory in Renton, Washington, to review a software upgrade on Saturday, as U.S. regulators prepared to receive and review the fixes in coming weeks.     The factory visits indicated Boeing may be near completing a software patch for its newest 737 following a Lion Air crash that killed 189 people in Indonesia last October. This month, a second deadly crash involving an Ethiopian Airlines MAX in Addis Ababa triggered the fleet’s worldwide grounding.  Timing for when passenger flights will resume remained uncertain. Boeing has come under global scrutiny along with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the agency that must approve the software fix and new training. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines Co, the world’s largest operator of the MAX, began parking its fleet at a facility in Victorville, California, at the southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert, to wait out the global grounding. Southwest has 34 of the jets; United Airlines has 14 and American Airlines has 24. Acting administrator Dan Elwell told lawmakers last week that the FAA expected Boeing would complete its upgrade as early as March 25, kicking off the approval process. An FAA spokesman said Saturday that the agency expects to receive the software fix early next week. A U.S. official briefed on the matter Saturday said the FAA has not yet signed off on the upgrade and training but the goal is to review them in coming weeks and approve them by April. It remained unclear whether the software upgrade, called “design changes” by the FAA, will resolve concerns stemming from the ongoing investigation into the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash, which killed all 157 on board.      The U.S. official said planned changes included 15 minutes of training to help pilots deactivate the anti-stall system known as MCAS in the event of faulty sensor data or other issues. It also included some self-guided instruction, the official added. The Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents American Airlines pilots, said it has been in talks with Boeing, the FAA and airlines to get the airplanes flying again as soon as possible with an acceptable level of safety. “Right now we’re in wait-and-see mode to see what Boeing comes up with,” said Captain Jason Goldberg, spokesman for the APA, part of a delegation of airline safety experts and pilots set to test the upgrade. “We’re hopeful, but at the same time the process can’t be rushed.” Boeing said on Saturday it was continuing to schedule meetings with all 737 MAX operators. Southwest and United said they would also review documentation and training associated with Boeing’s updates on Saturday.

10647,"TOKYO   - The external committee tasked with improving governance at Nissan Motor Co believes the firm can deepen ties with Renault SA without overhauling the broader alliance agreed nearly two decades ago, a person familiar with the matter said. At the committee’s latest meeting held late last week, members were at a “near consensus” to recommend stronger roles for outside directors and establishing committees for board member nominations, auditing and determining executive pay, the person who has direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The person was speaking on condition of anonymity given that final recommendations have yet to be announced. A spokeswoman for the committee declined to comment on the discussions. The two automakers are retooling their partnership to create a more equal footing and avoid the all-encompassing power wielded by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn before his November arrest in Japan on financial misconduct charges. Last week, Nissan (7201.T), Renault (RENA.PA) and junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) established a new joint board comprising separate executives of all three automakers to oversee operations and governance, dismantling the previous structure which in practice had placed control of the alliance with Ghosn.  Executives at all three automakers said the new structure was not intended to replace or change their master agreement, which was drawn up in 2002 and gives biggest stakeholder Renault the right to appoint Nissan executives and directors. The external committee tasked by Nissan to propose ways to bolster the firm’s corporate governance said on Sunday it would announce its final recommendations on March 27.

10755,"  - Corporate America’s biggest shareholders have traditionally been content with sharing their views on a company’s strategy privately with management. But now some mutual funds are beginning to rethink their stance, amid pressure from investors for them to justify the fees they charge and a push to boost the performance of their holdings. Wellington Management Company LLP’s decision last month to speak out against drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s proposed $74 billion acquisition of Celgene Corp, calling what would be the largest-ever pharmaceutical takeover too risky and expensive, sent ripples across the investment world. This is because these tactics have typically been the purview of activist hedge funds like Starboard Value LP and Elliott Management Corp, not a large institutional money manager like Wellington, with $1 trillion in assets under management. But in the case of Bristol-Myers, Starboard spoke out publicly against the deal one day after Wellington unveiled its stance publicly.  Wellington’s vocal opposition to the deal is the culmination of some mutual funds gradually feeling more emboldened to publicly challenge a company’s strategy, asset management executives and corporate governance experts say. “There has been a growing chorus among investors who want these firms to speak up. With Wellington speaking up, it is going to put pressure on the others to do the same,” said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors, which invests with Wellington funds.    In January, chemicals company Ashland Global Holdings Inc agreed to changes to its board after pressure from asset manager Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which has about $300 billion in assets under management. T. Rowe Price Group Inc, which manages close to $1 trillion in assets, has opposed several acquisitions, including Michael Dell’s offer to take his eponymous computer maker private, because it felt the proposed deal undervalued the company. Spurring on these funds to challenge companies publicly is the need to show their worth as so-called active money managers, picking stocks rather than just betting on indexes.  At a time their performance has been lackluster and many have struggled to keep up with their benchmark index, they are under pressure from index-tracking funds who are gaining more market share in asset management. These “passive” money managers charge investors far less, in part because they do not need the army of analysts and portfolio managers to make investments. “More funds are willing to agitate in search of returns,” Mark Shafir, Citigroup Inc’s co-head of global mergers and acquisitions, said on Thursday at the corporate law institute conference organized in New Orleans by the Tulane School of Law. Despite their deep pockets, taking a public stance on  corporate strategy does not come easily to many of these funds, in part because they are unaccustomed to readying the kind of presentations aimed at swaying other shareholders. For example, Wellington’s statement on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Celgene deal was just four sentences long. By contrast, Bristol-Myers published a 46-page document defending its deal.  The world’s biggest active mutual fund managers, including Fidelity Investments and Capital Group, have preferred to use their influence discretely, taking advantage of their access to management to gain insight into a company’s strategy and offer feedback behind closed doors. To stay on good terms with corporate management, large mutual funds have often been happy letting activist hedge funds agitate over a company’s perceived problems. To be sure, even passive investors have started to pressure companies behind the scenes, especially on social, governance or climate change issues that a younger generation of investors cares more about. For example, BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group voted against management at oil major Exxon Mobil Corp in 2017 over its reluctance to disclose the risks it faced from climate change, and pressured weapons manufacturer Sturm Ruger last year over its refusal to publish a report about the safety of its products.  “Corporate America had better take note because the folks who actually pick stocks have finally decided to flex their muscles,” wrote Don Bilson, head of Event Driven Research at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.

10921,"HOUSTON   - Iran has lost $10 billion in revenue since U.S. sanctions in November have removed about 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude from global markets, a U.S. State Department official said on Wednesday.  Brian Hook, the State Department’s special representative on Iran, said in remarks at the CERAWeek energy conference that due to a global oil surplus - in part due to record U.S. production - the United States is accelerating its plan of bringing Iranian crude exports to zero.  U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, two of the largest oil producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and production cuts by OPEC and Russia have boosted global oil prices to near four-month highs. Iran reached an agreement with world powers in 2015 over its nuclear program which led to the lifting of sanctions in 2016 but U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in May last year and reimposed restrictions in November. Trump “has made it very clear that we need to have a campaign of maximum economic pressure” on Iran, Hook said, “but he also doesn’t want to shock oil markets, he wants to ensure a stable and well-supplied oil market. That policy has not changed.” The global oil market is looking for signs that Washington may extend sanctions waivers for Iran’s key customers in early May. The United States surprised the market in November last year by allowing eight countries to keep importing Iranian oil - in part causing Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, to fall to near $50 a barrel in late December after surpassing $86 a barrel in October. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has projected that world supply will exceed demand in 2019 by 440,000 bpd, Hook said. “When you have a better supplied oil market it enables us to accelerate our path to zero. But we also know that there are a lot of variables that go into a well-supplied and stable oil market,” said Hook, a senior policy adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Washington sanctioned Venezuelan oil exports in January in an effort to oust President Nicolas Maduro and a massive power outage since last week halted crude exports from its primary port, essentially crippling the South American country’s principal industry. “We are aware that our diplomatic and economic pressure, the timing and the pace of that affects Venezuela’s oil industry,” Hook said. He said the United States is monitoring global supplies for impact from sanctions. “I’ve met a few times with (Saudi Energy Minister) Khalid al-Falih over the last year when we knew we were taking a lot of oil, we wanted to ensure that we’re doing this in a responsible way,” he said. Falih said on Sunday that OPEC’s production-curbing agreement likely would last until at least June. OPEC and its allies agreed late in 2018 to cut output by 1.2 million bpd.

11214,"PALO ALTO   - The Federal Reserve does not see problems in the U.S. economy that warrant an immediate change in its policy, and it will be careful not to shock financial markets as it stabilizes its bond portfolio, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday. The U.S. central bank is nearing a major milestone in its efforts to unwind economic stimulus measures enacted to fight the 2007-09 recession.  In a wide-ranging speech at Stanford University, Powell said the Fed was “well along” in discussions on a plan to end a runoff of its balance sheet, which ballooned during and after the recession. While there were “cross-currents” pointing to economic risks, none were flashing warning signals serious enough for the Fed to change its interest rate policy stance, he said.  “With nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures, the committee has adopted a patient, wait-and-see approach,” Powell said in prepared remarks, referring to the Fed’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. He said the Fed would soon communicate details of its plan to stop shrinking its $4 trillion balance sheet later this year. His remarks appeared aimed at reassuring financial investors that the Fed would take pains not to shock investors.  “As we feel our way cautiously to this goal, we will move transparently and predictably in order to minimize needless market disruption and risks to our dual-mandate objectives,” he said. The Fed’s dual mandate is for maximum employment and the maintenance of stable prices. Powell’s remarks were the last from any Fed policymakers until the conclusion of the Fed’s next policy-setting meeting, to be held March 19-20.  His remarks came after the Labor Department on Friday reported that U.S. employment growth almost stalled in February, a sign of a sharp slowdown in economic activity in the first quarter. The Fed had released a statement in January that suggested it was no longer sure if it would continue raising interest rates, after hiking rates four times in 2018. Markets may look to the Fed’s quarterly interest-rate-hike projections, to be released after the Fed’s upcoming March meeting, for clues of when it might continue with rate hikes. On Friday, however, Powell warned against reading too much into those forecasts, noting that in the past markets at times had misread them as policy promises. He said he asked a small panel of fellow Fed policymakers to figure out a better way to communicate their role. In December the rate-hike forecasts suggested policymakers expected two rate hikes this year. Markets currently expect none. Powell also called out the need for the Fed and other central banks to find better ways to deal with pervasive low inflation, and said that as the Fed reviews options this year, it ought to pay serious attention to strategies that would drive inflation higher to make up for past bouts of sluggish inflation.  But Powell said he sees a “high bar” for any fundamental changes to the Fed’s current approach because of the potential of inadvertently undermining the public’s confidence in the U.S. central bank’s commitment to fighting inflation.

11215,"NEW YORK   - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is launching a review of the main set of rules governing stock trading, opening the door to the biggest potential changes in a decade-and-a-half, the head of the agency said on Friday. The possible changes are aimed at making it easier to trade illiquid stocks, making more trading information available to investors, and improving the speed and quality of public data feeds needed for trading.     The SEC in 2005 adopted a broad framework called Regulation National Market System that was largely aimed at ensuring retail investors get the best price possible and preventing trades from being executed at prices that are inferior to bids and offers displayed on other trading venues. Since then, faster, more sophisticated technology has put a bigger focus on rapid-fire, high-speed trading. There has also been an influx of new electronic stock exchanges, fragmenting liquidity and increasing costs for brokers around exchange connectivity and market data needed to fuel algorithmic trading.   “It is clear that the market challenges we faced in the early 2000s are not the same as the issues that we confront over a decade later,” Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, said at an event in New York. To get a better grasp of current market issues, the SEC held a series of roundtable discussions with industry experts last year that led to potential rule-making recommendations around thinly-traded securities, combating retail fraud, and market data and market access, Clayton said. Some areas the SEC is looking at include:  - Increasing the speed of, and adding more stock price information to, public data feeds to help make them more competitive against the more expensive, private data feeds sold by most stock exchanges.  - Allowing thinly-traded securities to trade only on their listing market, rather than on all 13 U.S. stock exchanges.  - Improving disclosure around reverse mergers. - Adjusting the quote size of some high-priced stocks.  The 2019 review follows an active 2018 for the SEC.  The regulator adopted rules to increase transparency around broker-dealer stock order routing and private off-exchange trading venues. It also ordered a pilot program to test banning lucrative rebate payments that exchanges make to brokers for liquidity-adding stock orders.

11216,"  - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and two other drugmakers on Friday lost a bid to delay a landmark trial set for May in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit by Oklahoma’s attorney general accusing them of helping fuel an opioid abuse and overdose epidemic in the state. Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman’s decision was a win for the state, even as one of the lawyers for the state said Purdue had “threatened” to file for bankruptcy rather than face the first trial to result from around 2,000 lawsuits nationally. “This case needs to get to trial because people are dying every day,” Reggie Whitten, the lawyer for the state, said during a hearing in Norman, Oklahoma. Reuters, citing people familiar with the matter, on Monday reported that Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue, owned by members of the wealthy Sackler family, was exploring filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Doing so would allow it to address potential legal liabilities while halting the cases. Eric Pinker, Purdue’s lawyer, made no mention of a potential bankruptcy while arguing that the May 28 trial in the lawsuit brought by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter against it, Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd should be delayed. He said delaying the trial to Sept. 16 was necessary because the state belatedly turned over 1.6 million pages of records critical to Purdue’s defense. “This case is not at a posture where it can fairly and fully go to trial in May of this year,” Pinker said. But the judge said the drugmakers had not established the state’s actions had prejudiced them. Purdue in a statement said it “categorically” denies that the ruling will affect whether it files for bankruptcy. Purdue said it was “looking at all of its options” but had made no decisions. Opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The epidemic has prompted lawsuits by state and local governments accusing Purdue and other drugmakers of contributing to the crisis through deceptive marketing that downplayed the risks of addictive opioids. The companies deny wrongdoing, noting their drugs carried warning labels and pointing to others factors behind the epidemic. More than 1,600 lawsuits have been consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has pushed for a settlement ahead of the trial before him in October. Other cases, including Oklahoma’s, are pending in state courts.

11238,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump on Friday said he is confident the United States can forge a trade deal with China, but added that he thinks his country would do very well with or without an agreement with the world’s second-largest economy.  Asked if he was still confident he could get a deal with China: “Sure, I’m confident, but if we don’t make a very good deal for our country, I wouldn’t make a deal,” Trump said. Asked about a report that China was not positive about a trade deal and that a meeting with President Xi Jinping might not happen, Trump said “I haven’t heard that. I think we’re doing well ... We’ll do very well either way, with or without a deal.”   Speaking on Bloomberg TV, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the two countries could meet soon to continue hammering out a deal. “It could go into April ... We made a lot of agreements here in Washington two weeks ago ... Now it has to go back and clear the top level of President Xi and the politburo in Beijing ... That’s the key – not the timing, not even the place – we have to get it right so it’s in America’s interest,” Kudlow said. China’s exports tumbled the most in three years in February while imports fell for a third straight month, pointing to a further slowdown in the economy and stirring talk of a “trade recession”, despite a spate of support measures. The increasingly weak China data comes amid months of intense negotiations between Washington and Beijing aimed at ending their trade dispute. On Wednesday, the U.S. reported its goods trade deficit with China surged to an all-time high last year, underlining one of the key sticking points. Chinese shares fell more than 4 percent on Friday after the data showed exports contracting, pushing global equities to three-week troughs.

The commodities trading business was once one of Goldman’s largest, most active units and a significant driver of profits earned by the Wall Street bank until tighter regulation curbed the risks it could take on proprietary bets. Cuts were accelerated as competition with trading houses and oil majors increased and as profits shrank. Three out of the 10 people being let go held senior roles or managing director positions within the company’s commodities unit, a source with knowledge of the cuts said. The cuts are global and will involve merging the commodities unit’s metals trading desks, the source said. Banks do not disclose their commodities revenues but financial analytics firm Coalition estimates the top 12 banks generated commodities trading revenue of less than $4 billion in 2018, down from nearly $16 billion in 2008.  Fixed income, currencies and commodities revenues across all major investment banks dropped to their lowest levels seen since the financial crisis in the final quarter of 2018, the Coalition data showed, with oil trading suffering significant declines across the year.  Goldman launched a months-long review of the commodities division to evaluate its profitability and the use of capital. The review began under Goldman’s previous chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, who was once a commodity trader himself and was seen as a big supporter of the division, but was completed under the new chief, David Solomon, who has never traded commodities. The review showed the business was using too much capital for too little profit, the Wall Street Journal reported in February, citing people familiar with the matter. The Journal said Goldman was discussing pulling back in physical trading of iron ore, platinum and other metals. One of the sources told Reuters on Friday that Goldman was not exiting any commodity businesses and they would remain a large and important part of the bank’s securities division.

11348,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that trade talks with China were moving along well and predicted either a “good deal” or no deal between the world’s two largest economies. Washington and Beijing have been locked in intense negotiations to end a months-long trade war. Trump, citing progress in talks, last week delayed a planned tariff increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods. “They’re moving along well and we’ll see what happens,” the president said on Wednesday during a meeting in the Oval Office, referring to the trade talks. He said there would either be “a good deal or it’s not going to be a deal, but I think they’re moving along very nicely.” Trump’s comments after the Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the U.S. goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand fueled by lower taxes pulled in imports, despite the president’s tariffs and “America First” policies aimed at shrinking the trade gap. Talks are primarily taking place via video teleconference and going well, Ted McKinney, undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, told a press call.   “Right now, I think there’s just a lot of work in getting words down ... a contract or agreement, and that’s the current status,” he added. The United States has demanded that China make substantial changes to its laws and practices to protect U.S. intellectual property, end forced transfers of U.S. technology to Chinese firms, curb generous industrial subsidies and open the domestic market to U.S. companies. In addition, Washington has sought increased Chinese purchases of U.S. goods, including farm and energy commodities and manufactured products, to reduce a U.S. trade deficit with China that it estimates at more than $417 billion for 2018. People familiar with the talks told Reuters the two sides still had substantial work ahead to reach agreement on a way to ensure China follows through on any pledges. Talks could still collapse if a deal cannot be reached on enforcement of these “structural” issues.

11407,"NEW YORK   - A gauge of world stock markets recovered from early declines but was slightly lower on Tuesday as China cut its growth targets to a 30-year low but added more stimulus, while strong U.S. economic data sent the dollar to a two-week high. Stocks on Wall Street traded in a like fashion, with the benchmark S&P 500 a touch below the unchanged mark as investors looked for developments on trade between the United States and China. Positive retail earnings from Target Corp and data on the U.S. services and housing sectors helped provide support to the upside. The Commerce Department said sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose to a seven-month high in December while a reading from the Institute for Supply Management showed an acceleration in growth in the vast services sector in February. The S&P 500 index has struggled to hold above the 2,800 level, which has proven to be a stiff resistant point. Still, the index is up nearly 19 percent from its Dec. 24 low.  “When you are here at that important level in the S&P 500, it’s healthier to see the market slow down, pause, take account of the micro and the macro and absorb the good news,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  “To see the market pause right now, as opposed to a deep sell-off, is encouraging.”  European shares bounced between modest gains and declines, eventually closing slightly higher in the wake of China’s response to the lowered growth target of between 6.0 to 6.5 percent for 2019, which includes billions of dollars in planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending and a lack of news on the trade front. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13.02 points, or 0.05 percent, to 25,806.63, the S&P 500 lost 3.16 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,789.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.21 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,576.36.  Fatigue after a strong run higher for equities is playing a role in the recent pause. MSCI’s All Country World Index was down 0.07 percent, and has now risen more than 15 percent from its near two-year closing low on Dec. 24. The index is trading at 14.6 times expected earnings, on par with levels back in early October, when a global bear market began to take hold.     The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.15 percent. (GRAPHIC: Global stock valuations - tmsnrt.rs/2VHHkGL)  In currency markets, the greenback was lifted by the economic data and is now up nearly 0.9 percent over the past five sessions. The dollar index, tracking the unit against six major currencies, rose 0.16 percent, with the euro down 0.27 percent to $1.1306. Oil prices were little changed as the market wavered on expectations for an imminent trade deal between the United States and China while awaiting U.S. government crude stocks data. U.S. crude settled down 0.05 percent at $56.56 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.86, up 0.29 percent on the day.

11616,"NEW YORK   - Wall Street’s main indexes fell slightly on Thursday as support from better-than-feared U.S. GDP data was countered by concerns about earnings and U.S.-China trade relations. Also on Thursday, President Donald Trump said he had walked out of his Vietnam summit with Kim Jong Un because of demands from the North Korean leader to lift U.S.-led sanctions.      Commerce Department data on Thursday showed that while the U.S. economy missed a 3 percent annual growth target for 2018, a better-than-expected fourth quarter pushed gross domestic product up 2.9 percent for the year. But investors were cautious, nothing that the S&P has risen 11 percent year-to-date at the same time as expectations for current quarter earnings have turned negative. That’s a “disconnect that needs to be reconciled” said Terry Sandven, portfolio manager and chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank in Minneapolis.  Wall Street analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to fall 1.1 percent compared with Jan. 1 estimates for 5.3 percent growth, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “This week we’ve lacked directional drivers. Fourth quarter earnings is coming to a quick close and there’s been no news on the U.S.-China trade negotiations. On balance, we’re due for a period of consolidation and retrenchment,” said Sandven. Investors were also unimpressed by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow’s assurance Thursday that U.S.-China trade negotiations were moving forward after “fantastic” progress made last week. “Unlike a month ago, where a statement by an official was probably sufficient to push stocks higher, it no longer is. It’s time for concrete progress,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.  “What’s pushing markets down and counterpointing GDP is the concern about corporate earnings.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 69.16 points, or 0.27 percent, to 25,916, the S&P 500 lost 7.89 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,784.49 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.98 points, or 0.29 percent, to 7,532.53. The S&P and Dow both registered their third straight day of losses on Thursday.  Of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, the materials sector was the biggest percentage decliner with a 1.27 percent drop, while the energy sector was the second biggest percentage loser, with a 0.97 percent fall. [O/R] The healthcare sector fell 0.3 percent with drags from UnitedHealth, down 3 percent on concerns about the potential for a single-payer U.S. healthcare system. Also, Celgene Corp fell 8.6 percent after activist investor Starboard Value LP said it will vote against drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s proposed $74 billion acquisition of the biotech company. Bristol-Myers rose 1.4 percent.  Booking Holdings Inc fell 10.96 percent after missing quarterly earnings expectations and was the biggest single-stock drag on the S&P. Also dragging on the S&P was HP Inc, which plunged about 17.3 percent after it reported revenue that missed analysts’ estimates. Monster Beverage Corp jumped 8.7 percent, making it the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P, after it beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 34 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.22 billion shares, compared to the 7.34 billion-share average for the last 20 sessions.

11629,"STOCKHOLM   - The U.S. embassy in Sweden has asked the country’s financial watchdog FI for a meeting to discuss allegations about Swedbank’s involvement in a Baltic money-laundering scandal. The move raises questions whether the U.S. authorities will seek to investigate Swedbank. A FI spokesman said on Thursday it had received a letter on Feb. 27 from the embassy asking to discuss Swedbank in relation to the money laundering allegations, and that the watchdog was “taking care of the matter according to our routines”. Swedish and Estonian financial watchdogs opened a joint investigation this month following a media report linking Swedbank to the Baltic money laundering scandal involving Danske Bank. Danske is being investigated in five countries, including the United States, over some 200 billion euros ($227.62 billion) of suspicious payments from Russia, ex-Soviet states and elsewhere that were found to have flowed through its Estonian branch. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DoJ) are running parallel probes into Danske over the suspicious payments. Analysts have said an investigation by the U.S. authorities could put Swedbank shares under more pressure. The bank’s shares have lost a fifth of their in value since the report first surfaced. Swedbank, the U.S. embassy in Stockholm and the SEC declined to comment, while the DoJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      Swedish daily Dagens Industri, which first reported on the U.S. embassy letter on Thursday, quoted it as saying that the meeting was for a briefing on Swedbank and the watchdog’s actions. The FI spokesman declined to comment on this.  Swedbank is the largest bank in the Baltics with around 3.3 million retail customers and around 300,000 corporate customers. The Baltics accounted for just under a fifth of Swedbank’s revenue in 2018.

11720,"CHICAGO   - Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) on Wednesday reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings, helped by its acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods. Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents a share in the second quarter ended Jan. 27, beating the average analyst estimate of 70 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Campbell’s shares jumped 5 percent in premarket trading. Net sales rose 24 percent to $2.71 billion, while organic sales were flat. In 2017, Campbell agreed to buy pretzels and Cape Cod chips maker Snyder’s-Lance Inc for $4.87 billion, and organic soup maker Pacific Foods for $700 million. Like other packaged food companies, Campbell has been struggling to attract young, increasingly health-conscious consumers. It has tried to make its portfolio healthier, and launched a cost-cutting and divestment plan in August. Campbell reported a net quarterly loss, hurt by higher restructuring costs and a $346 million writedown of its troubled fresh food business. This is the fourth time Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell has written down the value of its fresh unit since September 2016, knocking about $1.35 billion off its value in total. The unit, which was put up for sale in August after a months-long strategic review, includes Bolthouse Farms. The business has struggled in recent years, with issues ranging from farming missteps to the recall of 3.8 million bottles of protein shakes. Campbell said on Tuesday that it expects to name buyers for Bolthouse and its international business by the end of its fiscal year in July. The company also said it had agreed to sell salsa maker Garden Fresh Gourmet to a unit of Fountain of Health USA, which makes hummus, dips and prepared salads. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Sources told Reuters in December that Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) were among those bidding for Campbell’s international business, which includes Australian cookie brand Arnott’s and Danish baked snacks maker Kelsen Group. The net loss attributable to Campbell was $59 million, or 20 cents per share, compared with earnings of $285 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier.

11721,"  - Mylan NV shares slid 10 percent on Wednesday after the generic drug maker predicted poor 2019 earnings that led some Wall Street analysts to wonder if its finances would worsen further. Mylan said on Tuesday its lower-than-expected profit outlook was due to rising costs related to marketing and research and development. It added that product launches should offset revenue declines for existing products this year as prices of generic drugs remain under pressure due to increased competition. “Even with the approvals and launches of Copaxone, Neulasta and Advair these approvals are only providing some relief, but are not altering the systemic problems inherent with the generic model,” Cowen & Co analyst Ken Cacciatore said in a report to clients. Mylan this month launched its generic version of GlaxoSmithKline’s blockbuster asthma treatment Advair at a price 70 percent lower than the branded medicine. Five brokerages cut their 12-month targets on Mylan’s share price, and analysts at Cowen & Co were the most negative with a $25 target, a third lower than the median Wall Street price target. “Clearly spending roughly $15 billion on product and company acquisitions and having flat cash generation over 4-5 years should be alarming,” Cacciatore said. Generic drug prices in the United States have been declining as regulators approve more cheaper, copycat drugs, spurring competition and weighing on the profits of generic drug makers like Mylan and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Additionally, manufacturing troubles at Mylan’s Morgantown plant in West Virginia is hurting profits. The market would have to see evidence that the company’s increased investments in 2019 are translating to higher revenue before Mylan’s stock price recovers, said JPMorgan analyst Chriss Schott. A “lack of earnings visibility makes it hard to tell if Mylan is still built to last,” Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said. Eleven of 16 Wall Street analysts covering Mylan have positive ratings, while five have neutral or “hold” ratings, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

11726,"  - Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said on Thursday she opposed the possible nomination of Manhattan’s interim top federal prosecutor, Geoffrey Berman, to permanently fill the post, citing concerns over his independence from President Donald Trump.  Gillibrand, the junior U.S. senator from New York, said in an emailed statement to Reuters that she found “deeply disturbing” reports the president personally interviewed Berman for the post of Manhattan U.S. attorney, whose jurisdiction includes Trump’s home, offices and real estate holdings in New York. “If this meeting took place it shows a lack of judgment that (Gillibrand) believes her colleagues should view as disqualifying as a nominee,” the statement said. Gillibrand said it was especially troubling in light of reports that Trump had asked former FBI director James Comey for a pledge of loyalty in a one-on-one meeting. Politico and other media outlets reported in October that Berman and at least two other candidates for U.S. attorney were personally interviewed by Trump. Presidents have not typically met with U.S. attorney nominees, and some Democrats have suggested it was inappropriate from Trump to do so, especially for the Manhattan position.  The Manhattan U.S. attorney is one of the nation’s top law enforcement posts, well known for terrorism cases and prosecutions of Wall Street financial crimes and government corruption The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has not denied that the interviews took place. Other former government lawyers from both parties have said they would not have been improper on their face. Berman, who was a member of Trump’s transition team, was sworn in on Thursday as one of 17 interim U.S. attorneys appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to serve in jurisdictions around the country.  The interim posts are for 120 days unless those holding them are re-appointed by a court or officially nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate. The statement from Gillibrand is potentially significant because she could try to block Berman’s nomination through the “blue slip” process by which senators have traditionally held veto power over nominees in their home state. Chuck Schumer, the senior senator from New York and also a Democrat, did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Berman, who was an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan from 1990 to 1994, was a partner at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, another supporter of Trump’s presidential run in 2016, practices at the same firm. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, tweeted his disapproval of Berman on Tuesday. “Trump’s appointment of a prosecutor - after a personal interview - who may well be prosecuting him is absolutely abhorrent to the rule of law,” he wrote. New York lawyer Robert Fiske, who served as Manhattan U.S. attorney from 1976 to 1980 and worked with Berman early in Berman’s career, called the concerns about the meeting a “red herring” and said the president was entitled to meet with someone he was going to nominate.

11731,"WASHINGTON   - The Fed’s policy statements grew so complicated after the recession that standard gauges of readability suggested people needed four years of university or more to understand them. That is changing under the Fed’s new leadership, a Reuters analysis has found. Since Fed Chairman Jerome Powell took the helm in February 2018, statements have grown less complex and opening remarks at the central bank’s news conferences have become easier to follow. While the change in remarks reflects Powell’s effort to simplify the Fed’s communications, less complex statements appear at least in part to result from the central bank phasing out the exotic instruments deployed during and after the 2007-09 recession, including bond purchases and forward guidance on policy, and replacing them with more conventional tools. While experts say more clarity might help reduce financial market volatility, some of Powell's comments appeared to have had an opposite effect, a sign being plain-spoken also carries risks. In January, readers needed about three years of college to easily parse the Fed’s policy statement, according to the Reuters analysis, which used a standard readability index known as the Flesch-Kincaid grade-level formula.  The formula calculates a text’s reliance on big words and long sentences. Reading-grade levels for Fed policy statements rose after the recession and peaked in late-2013 at around 20 - equivalent to a PhD - as the Fed detailed complex tools like purchases of government bonds and asset-backed securities. The scores declined in 2014, the first year under Janet Yellen, Powell’s predecessor. During Yellen’s last three years the scores averaged around 16, roughly equivalent to a four-year university degree. Under Powell, that average has eased to about 15, above a high-school reading level but close to scores from before the recession. Researchers have found evidence in the past that more complex Fed communications led to larger market swings. It is not clear, though, whether the recent drop in statement complexity has improved the public’s understanding of Fed actions and how financial markets interpret the statements. “You would expect less volatility from a drop in complexity,” said Charles Calomiris, an economist and text mining expert at Columbia University, referring to the drop in the Flesch-Kincaid scores identified by Reuters. Calomiris stressed, however, that deciphering market movements and measuring what role recent changes in Fed’s language played was a complex task. Market volatility has actually increased in recent months as investors grew less certain about the direction of the global economy and Fed policy. For example, in December, Powell effectively reiterated past Fed guidance when he said the Fed’s plan to trim bond holdings was on “automatic pilot,” Still, stocks sank on disappointment that he did not indicate more flexibility. The reading grades calculated by Reuters closely tracked those found in a 2016 research paper by Dallas Fed economists who analyzed policy statements from 1994 through early 2014. They found larger market moves after statements with higher reading grade levels. David-Jan Jansen, an economist at the Dutch central bank, found evidence medium-term interest rates were less volatile after easier-to-read congressional testimonies by Fed chairmen. ""It's not just what you say. It's how you say it,"" said Jansen. Yet Jansen and Calomiris both noted one limitation of the readability analysis: It does not consider the meaning of the words being analyzed. Some researchers are trying to do this by counting word combinations associated with tighter or looser monetary policy. This research has focused on larger collections of texts, such as policy meeting minutes and speeches by central bankers.  A Fed spokesman declined to comment. Powell said on Feb. 6 that while policymakers try to craft the policy statement in language understood by Wall Street he fashioned his own remarks to be understood more broadly. “You just have to say it in a way that’s more accessible,” Powell said at a meeting with educators. Powell’s five opening statements have had an average reading grade level of 12, equivalent to the last year of U.S. high school. Yellen’s last five opening statements averaged about 14, or two years of college. Powell’s opening statement in September, which conveyed the view that the U.S. economy was simply strong and interest rates were set to rise, was easy enough for a U.S. 10th-grader. In January, however, Powell’s opening statement got more complex as he offered more nuanced views on the economic outlook and explained why the Fed decided to put rate increases on hold.

11789,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK   - U.S. senators called drug pricing practices “morally repugnant” and told drug company executives they do not want to hear them blame others for the high prices, taking an aggressive stance at a Senate hearing on the rising costs of prescription medicines.  Senators took aim in particular at Abbvie Inc Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez and his company’s rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira - the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. Executives from AstraZeneca PLC, Sanofi SA, Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co also answered questions from members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. The executives pointed to their companies’ records of developing lifesaving medications, saying profits generated in the lucrative U.S. market help them fund expensive research and development of future treatments.  “American research-based companies are leading the next wave of biomedical innovation to help patients whose diseases cannot be adequately treated with today’s medicines. We should work to ensure policies that support and reward these investments,” said Bristol-Myers CEO Giovanni Caforio. The executives also voiced support for plans to reform the industry-wide system of rebates that pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health insurers receive from drugmakers in exchange for preferential coverage of their medicines.   In his opening statement, Senator Ron Wyden, the Finance Committee’s top Democrat, tore into each company one-by-one for “profiteering and two-faced scheming.” “Drugmakers behave as if patients and taxpayers are unlocked ATMs full of cash to be extracted, and their shareholders are the customers they value above all else,” Wyden said.  Senators from both parties targeted AbbVie’s Gonzalez, with Wyden noting that the CEO’s bonus was partially tied to Humira sales, which reached nearly $20 billion globally last year. Republican Senator John Cornyn criticized the company’s web of more than 130 patents that protects Humira’s exclusivity. The drug has a list price of more than $60,000 a year, nearly double what it was in 2014, according to Rx Savings Solutions, which helps health plans and employers seek lower cost prescription medicines.  “I support drug companies recovering a profit based on their research and development and development of innovative drugs. But at some point, that patent has to end, that exclusivity has to end, to be able to get it at a much cheaper cost,” said Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican from Texas. Cornyn suggested that the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee should examine the U.S. patent system under which drug companies protect the exclusivity of their medicines. Congress has already held several hearings on rising prescription drug prices in both the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-led Senate, but Tuesday’s hearing is the first time drug company executives, most of them CEOs, will face lawmakers in more than two years. U.S. President Donald Trump has said drugmakers are “getting away with murder,” and his administration has made bringing down prescription medicine costs for U.S. consumers a top priority. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) last year rolled out a plan to lower drug prices and has introduced several modest proposals to curb medicine costs, but Democrats have said the Trump administration is not doing enough. HHS has proposed a rule to eliminate rebates for drugs paid for by Medicare and Medicaid, the government health insurance programs. Several drugmakers temporarily froze price increases last year after criticism from Trump, but they raised prices on more than 250 prescription drugs at the start of this year, albeit at lower levels than in years past.

11790,"WASHINGTON   - A Georgian-American businessman who met then-Miss Universe pageant owner Donald Trump in 2013, has been questioned by congressional investigators about whether he helped organize a meeting between Russians and Trump’s eldest son during the 2016 election campaign, four sources familiar with the matter said. The meeting at Trump Tower in New York involving Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign advisers is a focus of probes by Congress and Special Counsel Robert Mueller on whether campaign officials colluded with Russia when it sought to interfere in the U.S. election, the sources said. Russia denies allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the election and President Donald Trump denies any collusion. The Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees recently questioned behind closed doors Irakly Kaveladze, a U.S. citizen born in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the sources said. He is a U.S.-based representative of Azerbaijani oligarch Aras Agalarov’s real estate firm, the Crocus Group. The panels knew Kaveladze was at the June 9, 2016 meeting but became more interested in him after learning he also attended a private dinner in Las Vegas in 2013 with Trump and Agalarov as they celebrated an agreement to hold that year’s Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, the sources said.  Committee members now want to know more about the extent of Kaveladze’s contacts with the Trump family and whether he had a bigger role than previously believed in setting up the Trump Tower meeting when Trump was a Republican candidate for president. The White House declined to comment. Mueller’s office also declined to comment. Scott Balber, a New York lawyer who represents Kaveladze, confirmed that his client attended both the dinner in Las Vegas and the Trump Tower meeting but said he did not set up the second meeting. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, other Trump campaign aides, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya were also at that meeting. Lawyer Balber also said the committees were only seeking Kaveladze’s input as a witness and were not targeting him for investigation. “No-one has ever told me that they have any interest in him other than as a witness,” Balber said. Lawyers for Trump Jr. and Kushner did not respond to requests for comment about their contacts with Kaveladze. A lawyer for President Trump declined to comment. One photograph from the 2013 dinner, when Trump still owned the Miss Universe pageant, shows Agalarov and his pop singer son Emin along with Trump, two Trump aides and several other people at the dining table. Another shows Kaveladze standing behind Trump and Emin Agalarov as they speak. The pictures were found by a University of California at Irvine student and blogger Scott Stedman, who posted them on Nov. 22. Aras Agalarov is a billionaire property developer in Russia who was awarded the Order of Honor by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mueller’s team and the committees are looking for any evidence of a link between the Trump Tower meeting and the release six weeks later of emails stolen from Democratic Party organizations. They are also trying to determine whether there was any discussion at the New York meeting of lifting U.S. economic sanctions on Russia, a top priority for Putin, the officials said. Rob Goldstone, a British publicist, told Trump Jr. ahead of the New York meeting that Russian lawyer Veselnitskaya would be bringing damaging information about donations to a charity linked to Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to emails later released by Trump Jr. Trump Jr. initially said the meeting was about Russian adoptions but later said it also included Veselnitskaya’s promises of information on the donations to the Clinton charity. He said he ultimately never received the information, although it was later posted on the Internet. In a statement issued after meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 7, Trump, Jr. said Goldstone and Veselnitskaya were in a conference room with him as well as Kaveladze and a translator. Balber said Kaveladze attended expecting to serve as a translator, although he did not do so in the end because Veselnitskaya brought her own.

11794,"WASHINGTON   - Walmart Inc will consolidate advertising sales for its stores and websites, it said on Tuesday, aiming to boost profits from an untapped business as the world’s largest retailer competes with marketing titans Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc. Walmart’s suppliers, such as Procter & Gamble Co, Unilever Plc and Mondelez International Inc, can deal with one inhouse ad team instead of different groups within and outside the retailer, company executives said. Walmart will inform suppliers of the change at its annual meeting with them on Tuesday. The move comes as rival Amazon is boosting profits by letting merchants pay for high placement in its search results. Its ad sales and other revenue jumped 95 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. About 300 million shoppers visit Walmart’s stores every month, and millions make online purchases on its website, according to Forrester Research. The retailer draws in more shoppers than Amazon, Facebook and Google, the research firm estimates. At Walmart’s investor conference in October, Chief Executive Doug McMillon said its ad business was “tiny” and “it could be bigger.” He said the company’s data has not been monetized. Walmart also said this month its online losses are likely to widen this year due to investments to expand the business, and the advertising push could offset some of that. “We have a unique opportunity to leverage our first-party shopping data from online and offline purchases to reach our customers and influence their purchase decisions,” Walmart Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies said in an interview. The retailer is consolidating teams into a single group for ad sales and operations, Bratspies said. “It can be as simple banner ads on the website ... to in-store capabilities on our TV network,” he said. Walmart is bringing its digital ad business inhouse and ending its relationship with Triad, a unit of WPP, which sells advertising space on websites. Triad did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    The challenge for companies and marketers often is gauging whether their investments are yielding a return. Walmart will address that challenge by connecting data from stores and online and offering a pitch that is “much more effective than many others can,” Bratspies said. Trade marketing, typically used by packaged goods manufacturers to target shoppers, are moving to Amazon, according to analysts. U.S. trade marketing totals an estimated $178 billion a year and makes up most of Amazon’s U.S. ad dollars, Morgan Stanley analysts estimated.

11795,"  - Macy’s Inc, the largest U.S. department store chain, said on Tuesday it would cut 100 senior management positions to reduce costs and improve profitability, and reported holiday same-store sales growth short of Wall Street’s expectations. A multi-year program will also help the Cincinnati-based company improve its supply chain and tightly control its inventory, it said. The job cuts, at the vice presidential level and higher, combined with its supply chain and inventory actions, are expected to yield annual savings of $100 million, starting in the current fiscal year, 2019. “The steps ... will allow us to move faster, reduce costs and be more responsive to changing customer expectations,” Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said.       Last month, Macy’s tempered expectations for the holiday season by slashing its fiscal 2018 revenue and profit forecast on weak demand for women’s sportswear, seasonal sleepwear, fashion jewelry, fashion watches and cosmetics. Its shares plunged 18 percent. Department stores in recent quarters had shown signs they were finding ways to cope with declining mall traffic and tough competition from online seller Amazon.com Inc, helped by a robust economy and strong consumer spending in 2018.     In 2019, Macy’s said it would invest in categories where the company already has strong market share such as dresses, fine jewelry, women’s shoes and beauty, as well as revamp 100 stores, up from the 50 stores it remodeled last year. It also plans to build out its off-price Backstage business to another 45 store locations. Shares of the company were roughly flat at $24.27 in morning trading, after rising as much as 5 percent earlier. Macy’s, which has closed more than 100 locations and cut thousands of jobs since 2015, reported a smaller-than-expected 0.7 percent rise in holiday quarter same-store sales on Tuesday,  below the company’s own expectations. “Core EPS guidance came in a bit lighter than we were expecting, but no worse than buy-side fears,” said Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom. “Inventory levels are heavier than normal for Macy’s, but the company appears to have done a good job clearing through excess levels following a softer holiday period,” he said. The company now forecasts adjusted profits for fiscal 2019 between $3.05 to $3.25 per share, below analysts estimates of $3.29.

11810,"LONDON   - British high street chain Marks & Spencer (M&S) is in talks with Ocado to form a joint venture that would give M&S a full online food delivery service for the first time, sending shares in both companies surging on Tuesday.  Britain’s best known store group and the online supermarket pioneer released short statements confirming discussions after London’s Evening Standard newspaper said M&S was set to pay 800 to 900 million pounds ($1.05-$1.19 billion) for a 50 percent stake in a combined online retail business. One source with knowledge of the situation indicated the cost to M&S would be lower. It is unclear how M&S, which in November reported net debt of 1.78 billion pounds, would finance any deal. The 135-year-old M&S is a mainstay of Britain’s shopping streets, but has been struggling to cope in recent years with the rise of fast fashion, discounters and online shopping.  The firm currently sells wine, flowers and clothes online, but does not offer a full delivery service for its upmarket foods, putting it at a disadvantage to rivals such as John  Lewis-owned Waitrose and Britain’s biggest supermarket Tesco. “We believe the food of M&S (ready meals, quality food) is perfectly suited for this more upmarket convenience shopping,” said Bernstein analysts in a research note.  M&S shares jumped as much as 4.3 percent to a three month high on the news, while Ocado’s shares leapt as much as 12.5 percent to a three week high.  At 1555 GMT, Ocado’s shares were up 10 percent at 975.4 pence, while M&S’s were up 3.3 percent at 303.5 pence. However, some analysts questioned whether M&S might be in danger of paying a large amount of money to join a highly competitive market too late.  “We would be wary of the ability for the M&S brand to support a basket size of the magnitude required to make the online economics work (given its natural bias to convenience and events),” Jefferies analysts said in a research note. Only last month M&S Chief Executive Steve Rowe said the firm’s basket size was not appropriate for a full online grocery service, noting 41 percent of M&S customers shop for “today/tonight”. For Ocado, however, analysts said news of the talks was a relief following a devastating fire this month at its flagship robotic distribution center that hit its shares. “Ocado’s current share price is still lofty, and that means investors are expecting big things, considering the group is yet to make a meaningful profit,” said Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Sophie Lund-Yates. Ocado has a 1.3 percent share of Britain’s grocery market, according to Kantar Worldpanel data, while M&S has 3.6 percent according to Nielsen data Ocado, founded by three Goldman Sachs bankers 18 years ago, has been transformed in the last year after it struck major deals to sell its technology to international retailers such as U.S. group Kroger Co and France’s Casino. While the focus on technology has boosted its share price, the deal as mooted with M&S would enable Ocado to keep a stake in its British retail business rather than selling it completely to focus on tech deals. The cash from M&S would also enable it to invest further in the online distribution centres it is building. “In our view a 50/50 JV makes a lot of sense for Ocado today,” Bernstein analysts said. “It is too early to lose their retail business as it is an essential and unbeatable part of the sales pitch to global customers (i.e. they are not just selling you some hardware/software, they operate it very successfully in the most competitive grocery ecommerce market in the world).”  The Evening Standard report suggested Ocado would use M&S as a supply partner for its British customers. Many of the products that Ocado currently sells are supplied by Waitrose, and it was not clear what the M&S talks would mean for that arrangement.  Ocado’s deal with Waitrose ends in September 2020. Ocado is required to give 18 months notice if it does not intend to extend the contract. Waitrose, which has built up an online food business in parallel with its partnership with Ocado, declined to comment.

11826,"JIAXING, China/NEW YORK   - When Kevin Chiu left his job in 2012 to try his luck at starting an online apparel business in a rural Chinese city, his main goal was to carve out more time to spend with his wife and newborn child. It never entered his mind that his Orolay puffer jacket would become a huge hit, celebrated as the ‘Amazon Coat’ in U.S. social and traditional media - and held up as a budding rival to premium brand Canada Goose.  Using duck down sourced from China’s Hebei and Anhui provinces, the polyester coats are priced between $80 and $139. By contrast, Canada Goose jackets start from about $575 in the United States. “We made more money in January than we did for the whole of 2017,” Chiu, 32, told Reuters at his factory in the eastern Chinese city of Jiaxing. He estimates his firm made $5 million in sales last month and expects to bring in $30-$40 million this year. U.S. sales - almost all of which are sold through Amazon.com Inc - account for 70 percent of total revenue. Orolay’s success is, however, not just a tale of competitive pricing and a design that found favor with U.S. consumers. Chiu is among a wave of Chinese merchants that have benefited from measures introduced by Amazon in recent years that have made it easy for overseas vendors to sell on its site. That’s provoked concerns among U.S. sellers on Amazon that they are being outgunned. And in industries such as apparel, experts say brick-and-mortar retailers cannot ignore the threat posed by the influx of small brands, many of which are based in China.  “It’s the impact, collectively, that’s happening in the industry from all of these brands. When you add them up, they’re just all taking market share,” said Robert D’Loren, chief executive of Xcel Brands Inc, whose merchandise is sold at Macy’s Inc and on Amazon.com. Amazon declined to comment on the view that U.S. firms are being undercut by Chinese merchants using its site. It does not break down the number of sellers on its sites by country. The number of Chinese merchants on Amazon is set to grow further as fierce competition and rising costs have made it less attractive to sell on local e-commerce sites like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Tmall, analysts say. Indeed, Chiu no longer sells in China. Orolay’s other markets are Europe, Japan, Taiwan and Australia.  “We did sell on Alibaba in the early days...but competition in China is stiffer,” he said, adding that increased costs to use local sites was also a factor. In addition to fees to use Chinese e-commerce sites, sellers also face other costs such as investing in customer service teams. Alibaba declined to respond to Reuters questions about whether costs for vendors had increased. Analysts say the number of Chinese merchants selling on Amazon’s U.S. site began to pick up over the last five years after it introduced measures that allowed sellers worldwide to store products at Amazon warehouses and provided help shipping those goods to customers. Late last year, the retail giant also started a program that refers China-based sellers to local lenders. By comparison, Amazon offers loans to selected U.S., UK and Japan-based small businesses that sell on its site. Chiu credits Amazon for much of the firm’s success but is thinking of branching out, saying offers from retailers include invitations to sell online from Walmart Inc and U.S. shopping site Rue La La. A Walmart spokeswoman said the firm had no agreement in place with Orolay. Rue La La did not respond to requests for comment. Expansion plans include extending Orolay’s product line to cotton clothing and men’s outerwear. But for now, Chiu is still marveling at how his business has become so successful in a market he barely knows. “I went to New York for vacation twice last year, and was so excited to see that people on the street are wearing our jackets,” he said. “I was very eager to ask them how they like our jackets, but didn’t do it because I don’t speak much English.” ","Chinese firm behind the 'Amazon Coat' hits jackpot in U.S., eschews China","February 24, 2019 /  11:14 PM ",jiaxing china new york when kevin chiu left his job in  to try his luck at starting an online apparel business in a rural chinese city his main goal was to carve out more time to spend with his wife and newborn child it never entered his mind that his orolay puffer jacket would become a huge hit celebrated as the amazon coat in u s social and traditional media and held up as a budding rival to premium brand canada goose using duck down sourced from china s hebei and anhui provinces the polyester coats are priced between  and  by contrast canada goose jackets start from about  in the united states we made more money in january than we did for the whole of  chiu  told  at his factory in the eastern chinese city of jiaxing he estimates his firm made  million in sales last month and expects to bring in   million this year u s sales almost all of which are sold through amazon com inc account for  percent of total revenue orolay s success is however not just a tale of competitive pricing and a design that found favor with u s consumers chiu is among a wave of chinese merchants that have benefited from measures introduced by amazon in recent years that have made it easy for overseas vendors to sell on its site that s provoked concerns among u s sellers on amazon that they are being outgunned and in industries such as apparel experts say brick and mortar retailers cannot ignore the threat posed by the influx of small brands many of which are based in china it s the impact collectively that s happening in the industry from all of these brands when you add them up they re just all taking market share said robert d loren chief executive of xcel brands inc whose merchandise is sold at macy s inc and on amazon com amazon declined to comment on the view that u s firms are being undercut by chinese merchants using its site it does not break down the number of sellers on its sites by country the number of chinese merchants on amazon is set to grow further as fierce competition and rising costs have made it less attractive to sell on local e commerce sites like alibaba group holding ltd s tmall analysts say indeed chiu no longer sells in china orolay s other markets are europe japan taiwan and australia we did sell on alibaba in the early days but competition in china is stiffer he said adding that increased costs to use local sites was also a factor in addition to fees to use chinese e commerce sites sellers also face other costs such as investing in customer service teams alibaba declined to respond to  questions about whether costs for vendors had increased analysts say the number of chinese merchants selling on amazon s u s site began to pick up over the last five years after it introduced measures that allowed sellers worldwide to store products at amazon warehouses and provided help shipping those goods to customers late last year the retail giant also started a program that refers china based sellers to local lenders by comparison amazon offers loans to selected u s uk and japan based small businesses that sell on its site chiu credits amazon for much of the firm s success but is thinking of branching out saying offers from retailers include invitations to sell online from walmart inc and u s shopping site rue la la a walmart spokeswoman said the firm had no agreement in place with orolay rue la la did not respond to requests for comment expansion plans include extending orolay s product line to cotton clothing and men s outerwear but for now chiu is still marveling at how his business has become so successful in a market he barely knows i went to new york for vacation twice last year and was so excited to see that people on the street are wearing our jackets he said i was very eager to ask them how they like our jackets but didn t do it because i don t speak much english ,US China Trade War,0.15908771753311157
11898,"  - Warren Buffett on Saturday appeared to fault U.S. President Donald Trump for taking too much credit for the nation’s economic growth, while acknowledging that market conditions are making it tough for his Berkshire Hathaway Inc to find more big companies to buy. Buffett lamented these states of affairs in his widely read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders. Accompanying the letter was more bad news, that sinking stock prices and a big writedown for the company’s Kraft Heinz Co investment fueled a $25.39 billion fourth-quarter net loss, and caused Berkshire to post its lowest annual profit since 2001. But many of Berkshire’s more than 90 businesses, such as the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad, performed well, and quarterly operating profit rose 71 percent. Buffett uses his shareholder letters to focus on Berkshire’s operating businesses, tout the strength of the U.S. economy, and criticize thinking and business practices that get in the way. The 88-year-old said Berkshire’s success has been in part a product of “the American tailwind” that has enabled the country to enjoy “almost unbelievable prosperity.” He said that since he began investing in 1942, that prosperity has been overseen by seven Republican and seven Democratic presidents, through times of war and financial crisis, and gained in a bipartisan manner. Trump often takes credit for upbeat news on the economy and stock market, sometimes tying them to his economic policies.  Buffett, who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in her 2016 White House run, said no one person should claim credit when things go well. “It is beyond arrogance for American businesses or individuals to boast that they have ‘done it alone,’” Buffett wrote. Buffett also made a possible oblique criticism of Trump’s bragging about U.S. economic performance, including relative to other countries such as China, where Berkshire invests in electric car maker BYD Co.  The United States, according to Buffett, should “rejoice” when other countries have bright futures. “Americans will be both more prosperous and safer if all nations thrive,” he wrote. “At Berkshire, we hope to invest significant sums across borders.” The White House was not immediately available for comment. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and longtime Berkshire investor, said: “It sent an extraordinarily strong message about how open markets and free trade end up helping all participants do better.”  Part of the reason Buffett may be looking to invest abroad is that he is struggling to find big investments at home, and does not expect that to change soon. Berkshire has not make a major acquisition since paying $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts in January 2016. Buffett said the near-term prospects for more acquisitions were “not good,” because prices are “sky-high” for businesses that had decent long-term prospects. While Buffett said the thought of an “elephant-sized” acquisition causes his heart to beat faster, the “disappointing reality” was that Berkshire would likely in 2019 use some of its $111.9 billion of cash to buy more stocks. Berkshire ended 2018 with $172.8 billion of equities, but many of these suffered double-digit price declines in the quarter, including a 30 percent slide in its largest holding, iPhone maker Apple Inc. Those declines were a major factor in Berkshire’s huge quarterly loss, and its 91 percent drop in full-year net income to $4.02 billion from $44.94 billion the prior year, when it benefited from a lower corporate tax rate. Accounting rules require Berkshire to report unrealized stock gains and losses with net income, causing huge quarterly swings that Buffett says are usually meaningless. Operating profit in the quarter totaled $5.72 billion, or $3,484 per Class A share, topping analyst forecasts, and for the year rose 71 percent to $24.78 billion. The operating businesses are overseen by Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, freeing Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 95, to focus on capital allocation. Results also were hurt by a $3.02 billion writedown for intangible assets that Buffett said was “almost entirely” attributable to Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire owns a 26.7 percent stake.      The packaged food company on Thursday shocked investors when it reported a $15.4 billion writedown for Kraft, Oscar Mayer and other assets, slashed its dividend, and said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was examining its accounting practices. While dated Saturday, Buffett’s shareholder letter is written well in advance, and did not discuss Kraft Heinz’s travails or the day-to-day management of that company by 3G Capital, the Brazilian firm and Buffett business partner.

11905,"  - Two bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of an Amazon Prime Air cargo plane that nosedived into a bay outside Houston on Saturday, and a search was ongoing for a third victim, authorities said. All three people aboard the Boeing 767 cargo jetliner operated by Atlas Air Worldwide died in the crash as it approached Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Atlas and Boeing Co said in statements on Sunday. Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne told a news conference on Sunday that two bodies had been recovered and the search continued for the third person as well as the plane’s black boxes. The sheriff's office released a video bit.ly/2E7Xlyf showing fragments of the aircraft and cargo littering mudflats after the tide went out in the bay, exposing more of the crash site. U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt said the agency obtained about five seconds of security video from a local jail that showed the crash. “The aircraft is in the video as it’s descending in a steep descent, a steep nose down attitude,” Sumwault told the press briefing, adding that there was no distress call. Asked by a reporter if the incident was “anything more than a plane crash,” Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Perrye Turner said, “that’s what we have right now.”  The plane crashed at the north end of Trinity Bay near the small city of Anahuac, about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of the airport around 12.40 p.m. (1340 EST) after taking off from Miami. “This is a sad time for all of us,” Bill Flynn, Atlas Air’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “Our team continues to work closely with the NTSB, the FAA and local authorities on the ground in Houston.” Atlas Air Worldwide has been operating Boeing 767 freighters on behalf of Amazon following a 2016 deal. Boeing said in a statement that it had sent a team to provide technical assistance to the NTSB as it conducted its investigation.

11947,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission vote on Thursday to roll back net neutrality rules could galvanize young voters, a move Democrats hope will send millennials to the polls in greater numbers and bolster their chances in next year’s elections. Democrats are hoping to paint the repeal of the rules by the FCC, which is now chaired by President Donald Trump appointee Ajit Pai, as evidence Republicans are uninterested in young people and consumer concerns at large. “The American public is angry,” said FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat. She added that the actions of the Republican majority have “awoken a sleeping giant.”  Attitudes toward “net neutrality,” or rules that prevent internet providers from limiting customers’ access to certain websites or slowing download speeds for specific content, are largely split along party lines in Congress. The heated debate has turned into the kind of election issue that Democrats think will help them. Studies show young people disproportionately use the internet compared with older Americans and polls have shown they feel passionately about fair and open internet access. Democrats believe the issue may resonate with younger voters who may not be politically active on other issues like taxes or foreign policy. U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, said on Twitter “young people need to take the lead on net neutrality. It’s possible for Millennial political leadership to make a real difference here.”      The scrapping of the Obama administration’s rules is likely to set up a court battle and could redraw the digital landscape, with internet service providers possibly revising how Americans view online content. The providers could use new authority to limit or slow some websites or offer “fast lanes” for certain content. Republicans on the FCC have sought to reassure young people that their ability to access the internet will not change after the rules take effect. People who favor the move argue that after users realize that little or nothing has changed in their internet access, it will not resonate as a political issue.   Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist, said polls have found young people are favoring Democrats in the most recent elections and that the net neutrality issue could be used to gather support in the 2018 midterm congressional elections. He said while older voters tend to care about Medicare, polls are finding that younger voters are motivated by net neutrality. “Net neutrality is the latest data point for voters that the administration is more interested in doing what big companies want them to do, than what people think is in their interest,” Ferguson said. “That’s a narrative that is politically toxic for Republicans.”  In November 2018, all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives will be up for grabs, as will 34 seats in the Senate. Democrats hope to gain control of one or both chambers by capitalizing on the unpopularity of Trump. Republicans currently control both chambers as well as the White House. To regain power, Democrats will need a strong showing of support among young voters, who traditionally have not shown up in large numbers for elections held in years when there is no presidential contest.  Liberal groups are using net neutrality as an issue to criticize Republican incumbents.  Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, echoed that sentiment, telling Reuters on Thursday that net neutrality will have “huge political legs ... This is something that everyone across the country understands - the importance of the internet.” The group End Citizens United announced last week a $35 million advertising campaign targeting 20 Republican House members for their stances on issues that relate to business, including net neutrality. Democrats facing difficult election battles next year are already weighing in strongly in favor of net neutrality rules. Senator Bill Nelson likely will face a difficult battle in Florida and sent a letter earlier in the week opposing the change in net neutrality rules. Several Democratic candidates are sending campaign fundraising appeals citing net neutrality. The changes could also become issues in a number of House races across the country, where Democrats will need to win more than 25 seats to control the chamber. Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also publicly opposed the rule changes, a sign that she wanted to be sure to stake a Democratic position on the issue.

11952,"  - Intel Corp executives said on Friday its 5G modem chips will not appear in mobile phones until 2020, raising the possibility its biggest customer, Apple Inc, will be more than a year behind rivals in delivering a device that uses the faster networks.  Sandra Rivera, who oversees Intel’s networking chip business, said at a media event in Palo Alto, California, that sample 5G modem chips will ship to customers this year but that Intel does not expect consumer “products in the market” until 2020. Intel has said its 5G modem chip will be available later this year, but it never indicated when it believed products will arrive for consumers. Rivera said non-consumer 5G products, such as networking gear, will appear later this year. It was unclear whether Intel’s timing on modem chips means that Apple will not have an iPhone with 5G capabilities in 2019. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple would not have a 5G iPhone ready until 2020. Apple executives have held talks with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and MediaTek Inc over 5G modem chips for iPhones to be released this year, but the outcome of those talks is unknown. Reuters reported on Feb. 7 that Apple earlier this year moved its modem engineering efforts into the same division that makes its proprietary processor chips. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While Apple remains Intel’s only major modem chip customer now, Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan said the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker plans to pursue other lines of business, such as selling modems to carmakers. He also said that modems could appear in a range of other devices, such as network gear, alongside Intel’s computing chips as 5G networks proliferate. But Intel executives declined to comment on whether Intel would combine its modem and processors into a single chip the way that rivals such as San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc have done. Swan said Intel did not plan to generate patent licensing revenue from its 5G technology like its Southern California competitor does. “Our model relative to other California-based players is just completely different,” Swan said. “Ours is not a licensing based model. “Royalty streams that are charged against the cost of the entire device, that’s a model that as you know has caused quite a bit of friction in the market,” Swan continued, alluding to Qualcomm’s legal battles with Apple and other phone makers over the San Diego firm’s patent practices. “Friction for others is opportunity for us.” (The story is refiled to add missing “s” from “talks” in paragraph five.)

11962,"  - AutoNation Inc said on Friday it has chosen insurance and financial services executive Carl Liebert to succeed longtime Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson and lead the largest U.S. auto dealership chain at a challenging time, when the domestic vehicle market has been slowing. AutoNation reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue as it sold fewer new vehicles and gross profits on new vehicle sales declined. The company’s shares were down 3.9 percent in early afternoon trading. AutoNation’s profits have been under pressure as overall new vehicle sales have weakened. The company’s shares have fallen roughly 25 percent over the past year, and Jackson has launched restructuring actions to cut $50 million from annual costs. Liebert will take charge on March 11. He comes from USAA, where he was executive vice president for operations at the company, which provides insurance and financial services for members of the U.S. armed forces and veterans.  While Liebert’s career has been outside the auto industry, he said his interest in the car business was fueled by working at a southern Indiana drag racing strip owned by his family. He told Reuters one focus will be to develop AutoNation’s ability to use customer data to expand services beyond selling a vehicle. “We can do that digitally, and through data,” Liebert said.  AutoNation’s results illustrate the challenges facing the U.S. auto industry as the long recovery from the 2008-2009 financial crisis tops out. Rival publicly held dealership chains Group 1 Automotive, Penske Automotive and Sonic Automotive Inc all have suffered steep share price declines over the past year, though the three smaller chains have outperformed AutoNation since the beginning of this year.  AutoNation, which has 325 U.S. locations, said net income from continuing operations fell to $92.9 million, or $1.02 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $151.5 million, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier, when it had a $41 million benefit related to U.S. tax reform. Analysts on average expected the company to earn $1.14 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue fell to $5.41 billion from $5.68 billion, missing analysts’ estimates of $5.63 billion. Quarterly revenue per vehicle rose 2 percent, but gross profit per vehicle fell nearly 6 percent. Sales in California fell 9 percent, and sales of premium vehicles fell 13 percent.     Jackson, who will stay on as executive chairman, told Reuters that when service and other after-sale profits are factored in, “our yield per vehicle is up. We continue to work on it diligently. It is a difficult challenge.” Tesla Inc  and its electric vehicles are a challenge  to established luxury vehicle brands like those AutoNation sells, Jackson said. But by 2021 and beyond, Jackson said he expects a “juggernaut” of premium electric vehicles from established automakers. “I see the pipeline from the traditional manufacturers. It’s very exciting. We will be in the electric vehicle game in a very meaningful way - 2020 is the tipping point.” For an interactive graphic on annual percentage rates (APRs) on car loans over ten years in the U.S., click: tmsnrt.rs/2V4im3M ",AutoNation names new CEO as slowing auto sales hit results,"February 22, 2019 /  12:07 PM ", autonation inc said on friday it has chosen insurance and financial services executive carl liebert to succeed longtime chief executive officer mike jackson and lead the largest u s auto dealership chain at a challenging time when the domestic vehicle market has been slowing autonation reported lower than expected quarterly profit and revenue as it sold fewer new vehicles and gross profits on new vehicle sales declined the company s shares were down   percent in early afternoon trading autonation s profits have been under pressure as overall new vehicle sales have weakened the company s shares have fallen roughly  percent over the past year and jackson has launched restructuring actions to cut  million from annual costs liebert will take charge on march  he comes from usaa where he was executive vice president for operations at the company which provides insurance and financial services for members of the u s armed forces and veterans while liebert s career has been outside the auto industry he said his interest in the car business was fueled by working at a southern indiana drag racing strip owned by his family he told  one focus will be to develop autonation s ability to use customer data to expand services beyond selling a vehicle we can do that digitally and through data liebert said autonation s results illustrate the challenges facing the u s auto industry as the long recovery from the   financial crisis tops out rival publicly held dealership chains group  automotive penske automotive and sonic automotive inc all have suffered steep share price declines over the past year though the three smaller chains have outperformed autonation since the beginning of this year autonation which has  u s locations said net income from continuing operations fell to   million or   per share for the fourth quarter ended dec  from   million or   per share a year earlier when it had a  million benefit related to u s tax reform analysts on average expected the company to earn   per share according to ibes data from refinitiv revenue fell to   billion from   billion missing analysts estimates of   billion quarterly revenue per vehicle rose  percent but gross profit per vehicle fell nearly  percent sales in california fell  percent and sales of premium vehicles fell  percent jackson who will stay on as executive chairman told  that when service and other after sale profits are factored in our yield per vehicle is up we continue to work on it diligently it is a difficult challenge tesla inc and its electric vehicles are a challenge to established luxury vehicle brands like those autonation sells jackson said but by  and beyond jackson said he expects a juggernaut of premium electric vehicles from established automakers i see the pipeline from the traditional manufacturers it s very exciting we will be in the electric vehicle game in a very meaningful way  is the tipping point for an interactive graphic on annual percentage rates aprs on car loans over ten years in the u s click tmsnrt rs vimm ,US China Trade War,0.14519216120243073
12011,"WASHINGTON   - In backing Roy Moore in Alabama’s U.S. Senate race even though the candidate faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, President Donald Trump made a risky bet - and lost big.  The victory by Democrat Doug Jones over the Republican Moore in the Alabama special election on Tuesday was a catastrophe for Trump, portending a Democratic wave next year that could cost Republicans control of one or both houses of Congress. The stakes in Alabama were that high. Democrats already were confident they had a strong chance to retake the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s congressional elections. Jones’ narrow victory increases their once-long odds of retaking control of the Senate as well. If Democrats were to recapture both chambers, they would serve as a check on Trump’s agenda and might even initiate impeachment proceedings against him.  “That Republicans lost in one of the most Republican states in the nation is a wake-up call no matter how flawed their candidate was,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.  Democrats never expected to have a chance in Alabama, where they had not won a U.S. Senate race in 25 years. But the combination of Trump’s unpopularity, the sexual misconduct allegations that erupted against Moore in November, and Trump’s enthusiastic support of him anyway gave them the opportunity, experts said. “Trump was the one who got Jones within firing range, and Moore allowed Jones to win,” said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia. Even as Democrats lost several special congressional elections this year, they consistently showed higher levels of turnout and engagement, which is attributable to Trump, Kondik said.   The Alabama race showed there were limits both to Trump’s endorsement power and his judgment.  Even as senior Republicans urged Trump to abandon Moore, the president decided instead in the campaign’s final days to throw the full weight of his office behind him. In the end, that was not enough, and early turnout reports suggested that many Republicans stayed home.  Moreover, despite the sexual misconduct allegations against Moore, the race near the end increasingly seemed to become about the president. Moore’s camp this week said the contest was specifically a referendum on Trump and his presidency.  “It is Donald Trump on trial in Alabama,” Dean Young, a strategist for Moore, told ABC News. Trump congratulated Jones on Twitter “on a hard fought victory” and added: “Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.” The loss was also a body blow to Steve Bannon, Trump’s former top strategist, who backed Moore in the primary against the Republican incumbent, Luther Strange, because he viewed Moore as a more reliable ally. Bannon also frequently characterized the race as less about Alabama and more about furthering Trump’s economic nationalist agenda. Bannon is looking to wage an insurgency against the Republican establishment in the 2018 congressional elections, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who condemned Moore after several women accused him of unwanted sexual contact when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s. Moore, 70, has denied the allegations, and Reuters has not independently verified them. ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT Beyond Moore, Bannon is supporting anti-establishment candidates such as Kelli Ward in Arizona, Danny Tarkanian in Nevada and Kevin Nicholson in Wisconsin, all of whom oppose McConnell staying on as Senate leader.  Bannon also may ultimately support challenges against sitting Republicans in Mississippi and Wyoming. But Moore’s loss seems certain to dampen that effort, and Republicans who fear losing control of Congress may be even less likely to back outsider candidates who may turn off mainstream voters.  It is now an open question whether Trump will inject himself into more Republican primaries, given his setback in Alabama. “When you nominate candidates who are unqualified and an embarrassment to the party, you run the risk of ruining your entire brand,” said Josh Holmes, a Republican consultant and close ally of McConnell.  Bannon’s supporters say rank-and-file Republican voters are more likely to blame McConnell, not Bannon, for the loss in Alabama, arguing that McConnell and his well-resourced Senate Leadership Fund did nothing to help Moore. McConnell “actively opposed the Republican candidate in Alabama and threatened our Senate majority by helping to put a liberal Democrat in that seat,” said Andy Surabian, a former Bannon protégé who now advises a pro-Trump advocacy group, Great America Alliance. Even with the Alabama win, Democrats face a significant challenge next year if they are to take control of the Senate. They must defend 10 incumbents in states that were won by Trump and they must gain two seats currently held by Republicans. Their best opportunities to secure those seats lie in Arizona and Nevada, and perhaps Tennessee. Democrats need 24 seats to retake the House, but that is viewed as a more realistic goal because of the number of congressional districts where they are competitive, particularly in suburban areas.  Brian Walsh, president of another pro-Trump group, America First Policies, said Trump could not be blamed for Moore’s loss, arguing that the president’s late endorsement almost won the race for Moore, a deeply flawed candidate. “He was trying to push a boulder up a hill,” Walsh said.

moore the president decided instead in the campaign s final days to throw the full weight of his office behind him in the end that was not enough and early turnout reports suggested that many republicans stayed home moreover despite the sexual misconduct allegations against moore the race near the end increasingly seemed to become about the president moore s camp this week said the contest was specifically a referendum on trump and his presidency it is donald trump on trial in alabama dean young a strategist for moore told abc news trump congratulated jones on twitter on a hard fought victory and added republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time the loss was also a body blow to steve bannon trump s former top strategist who backed moore in the primary against the republican incumbent luther strange because he viewed moore as a more reliable ally bannon also frequently characterized the race as less about alabama and more about furthering trump s economic nationalist agenda bannon is looking to wage an insurgency against the republican establishment in the  congressional elections particularly senate majority leader mitch mcconnell who condemned moore after several women accused him of unwanted sexual contact when they were in their teens and he was in his s moore  has denied the allegations and  has not independently verified them anti establishment beyond moore bannon is supporting anti establishment candidates such as kelli ward in arizona danny tarkanian in nevada and kevin nicholson in wisconsin all of whom oppose mcconnell staying on as senate leader bannon also may ultimately support challenges against sitting republicans in mississippi and wyoming but moore s loss seems certain to dampen that effort and republicans who fear losing control of congress may be even less likely to back outsider candidates who may turn off mainstream voters it is now an open question whether trump will inject himself into more republican primaries given his setback in alabama when you nominate candidates who are unqualified and an embarrassment to the party you run the risk of ruining your entire brand said josh holmes a republican consultant and close ally of mcconnell bannon s supporters say rank and file republican voters are more likely to blame mcconnell not bannon for the loss in alabama arguing that mcconnell and his well resourced senate leadership fund did nothing to help moore mcconnell actively opposed the republican candidate in alabama and threatened our senate majority by helping to put a liberal democrat in that seat said andy surabian a former bannon protégé who now advises a pro trump advocacy group great america alliance even with the alabama win democrats face a significant challenge next year if they are to take control of the senate they must defend  incumbents in states that were won by trump and they must gain two seats currently held by republicans their best opportunities to secure those seats lie in arizona and nevada and perhaps tennessee democrats need  seats to retake the house but that is viewed as a more realistic goal because of the number of congressional districts where they are competitive particularly in suburban areas brian walsh president of another pro trump group america first policies said trump could not be blamed for moore s loss arguing that the president s late endorsement almost won the race for moore a deeply flawed candidate he was trying to push a boulder up a hill walsh said ,US China Trade War,0.22870326042175293
12030,"BREMEN, Germany   - Ariane 6, Europe’s next-generation space rocket, is expected to win its first two commercial launch orders in coming weeks, company officials said, a key milestone as the European launcher vies for orders against Elon Musk’s U.S. competitor SpaceX. Operator Arianespace faces increased competition from SpaceX and Blue Origin, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Japan and India also pose a growing challenge. Ariane 6 has three institutional orders in hand from the European Commission and France and is close to signing deals with two commercial customers, said Mathias Spude, spokesman for ArianeGroup, a joint venture of Airbus and Safran, that is the majority stakeholder in Arianespace. ArianeGroup has invested 400 million euros of its own funds in the 3.4-billion-euro development of Ariane 6 - a project key to ensuring Europe’s independent access to space and a market valued at over $1 trillion by 2040. Manufacturers say the rocket will be more versatile than Ariane 5, able to carry out missions from placing as many as 90 small satellites in low-earth orbit to taking classic spy satellites to far higher perches in geostationary orbit. But the business case depends on drumming up enough commercial business to augment the 5-6 institutional launches expected in Europe annually in coming years, about a quarter of those planned in the United States. European governments also face industry pressure to use Ariane 6 even if they could get cheaper rides using SpaceX. “Europe continues to need its own access to space - the market of the future,” said Matthias Wachter with the BDI German Federation of Industry. “It doesn’t make sense to use European tax money to develop our own rocket but then launch satellites     with competitors from the United States or Asia.” Ariane 6, due for a first launch in 2020, was designed to save significant costs compared to Ariane 5, but industry experts say it will still cost around 70 million euros per launch - well above the rate offered by SpaceX, which uses reusable rocket technology and can count on larger U.S. orders. Ariane 6’s designers insist innovative production techniques will favor the European launcher when the commercial market recovers from a recent slump. “When it wakes up ... we will be on the market with a rocket that is 40 percent cheaper, and will continue to reduce costs after that,” Spude told Reuters at the Ariane 6 production site. Still, experts say SpaceX is widely credited with jolting the overall market with a keen focus on cutting costs, forcing Europe to shake up its launch industry.

12080,"SAN FRANCISCO   - Google has a new cloud computing boss and big ambitions to someday produce more revenue from that business than from advertising. Now comes the hard part: winning over big-spending customers. Alphabet Inc’s cloud computing division remains a distant third behind Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in terms of global revenue, according to analysts’ estimates. A few major companies manage their data on Google’s servers. But Google has nowhere near the vast customer base of Amazon, according to a new Reuters analysis of company regulatory filings. Businesses generally are not required to disclose their cloud vendors. Reuters found 311 out of about 5,000 worldwide that did so in 2018. While not comprehensive, the data provide a window into Google’s challenge. Thirty five of those companies named Google as a cloud provider. The largest by market capitalization were oil major Total SA and bank HSBC Holdings Plc. Graphic: Amazon's cloud dominance - tmsnrt.rs/2BMpryP        Amazon Web Services led with 227 clients, including travel company Expedia Group Inc and industrials giant Siemens AG. Microsoft’s Azure cloud had 69 firms, among them weapons maker Axon Enterprise Inc and business data firm Dun & Bradstreet Co. Thirty four of the companies cited multiple clouds.  The previously untracked data show the work ahead for Thomas Kurian, who is weeks on the job as chief executive of Google Cloud. Kurian has vowed to double down where Google has seen promising results. Specifically, he plans to target governments and top companies in retail, manufacturing, healthcare, media and finance. “A lot of our focus as we go forward is making sure that our sales organization has the background and the ability to sell to large, more traditional companies,” Kurian said at a Goldman Sachs investor conference last week. “There’s enormous appetite in those companies to consider Google.” Google declined to comment or make Kurian available for an interview. Graphic: Why cloud vendors get disclosed - tmsnrt.rs/2BKFoFP     People familiar with his plans said he is looking to reshape his division’s culture. A key part is developing or acquiring easy-to-use, industry-specific corporate applications, an area that Amazon and Microsoft do not dominate.  “It’s about the on-ramp onto their cloud,” said Daniel Ives, a New York-based financial analyst following the cloud industry for Wedbush Securities. “The main way to get that is through applications.” A 22-year veteran of Oracle Corp, Kurian gave the database company fresh life as the product leader behind its move to selling cloud services. His hire is already making potential customers reconsider Google, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a Monta Vista, Calif.-based firm that helps businesses negotiate cloud deals. “They’ve worked with him,” Wang said. “There’s a trust factor that wasn’t there before.” Kurian also must reassure some investors bewildered by Google’s cloud ambitions: Diversifying revenue beyond advertising is a plus, but it is not coming cheap. Google, Microsoft and Amazon combined spent nearly $53 billion on capital expenses last year, driven by data center projects to house their clouds.  With gross margins of 20 percent or less, selling cloud storage or tools for which customers need specialized staff is less lucrative for a small vendor, industry experts said. But margins on the type of software Kurian likely wants to offer can top even the 60 percent of Google’s ad business. “The next wave of growth is going to have to come from the heavy hitting applications,” said Kerry Liu, chief executive at Rubikloud, which helps retailers with cloud projects. Google got serious about the cloud around 2016, five years after Amazon Web Services had become a multibillion-dollar behemoth. But Google’s reputation for limited customer support has attracted mostly newer businesses or those with significant tech know-how. Mike Fisher, Etsy Inc’s chief technology officer, said Google’s superior AI tools helped win over the New York-based crafts marketplace. Fisher expects data-crunching algorithms to account for 25 percent of its server use this year, up from 10 percent last year. “We’ve been more pleasantly surprised than we thought,” Fisher said of the cloud’s benefits.  Advertising software company OpenX recently agreed to spend at least $110 million on Google Cloud over five years. The Pasadena, Calif. firm bet its clients would benefit from transacting on the same infrastructure as Google’s ads system.  “It’s a bit more of a geeky, techy platform, but we’re that kind of company,” said Chief Technology Officer Paul Ryan.  Graphic: Battle for large cap customers - tmsnrt.rs/2BMyzTY To attract more traditional corporate clients, Google Cloud will need to do some handholding, executives at its partners and rivals said.  Kurian is well-suited to the role. Two of his former colleagues said his follow-up and candid disclosures about product limitations helped seal deals at Oracle. An early riser, Kurian impressed staff with his meticulous preparation for morning meetings as well as his recall of the tiniest details of clients’ systems from years before. Kurian also managed billions of dollars in acquisitions at Oracle, including the purchases of software firms BEA Systems and Taleo.  Applications could come through similar deals and internally: Google is testing product recommendation software for shopping apps, a person familiar with the project said, to  add to its small set of specialized tools. Kurian told the investor conference that “you will see us continue to expand our footprint there.” (The story corrects job title in eighth paragraph)     ","Google's new cloud boss has big task to

12103,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee on Thursday cleared the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee of charges that he had disclosed classified information, potentially clearing the way for him to resume leadership of the panel’s Russia investigation. Republican Representative Devin Nunes, who had consistently  denied wrongdoing, thanked the committee for its finding, but said the probe had taken too long and the accusations against him were politically motivated. Nunes stepped aside from leading the intelligence committee’s investigation of Russia and the 2016 U.S. presidential election in April as the Ethics panel said it was investigating allegations that he had disclosed classified information. The accusations against Nunes arose after President Donald Trump tweeted in March, without giving evidence, that former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had wiretapped him as he competed for the presidency. Two and a half weeks later, Nunes, a Trump ally, told reporters that an unidentified source had shown him intelligence reports containing “unmasked” names of Trump associates swept up in foreign surveillance, prompting accusations that Nunes had disclosed classified information to provide cover to Trump. Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress have frequently raised the “unmasking” issue during the investigation of allegations that Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump’s chances of defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton and whether Trump associates colluded with Russia. Russia had denied the accusations, and Trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. Some Republicans contend that the potential surveillance of Americans and release of their names, possibly for political purposes, should be addressed by investigators. Former Obama administration officials have denied such accusations and labeled the issue a distraction from serious investigations of U.S. election integrity. Nunes criticized the ethics panel for taking “an unbelievable eight months” to dismiss the matter, and called on the panel to publicly release all transcripts related to his case. Ethics committee staff could not immediately be reached for comment. In a statement, the panel said intelligence experts had concluded the information Nunes disclosed was not classified, so it would take no further action and the matter was closed. It was not clear whether Nunes would formally resume  leadership of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation. His spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Republican Representative Mike Conaway has been leading it since April. Nunes has remained chairman of the intelligence panel.

12115,"  - The Pentagon’s acquisition chief said on Wednesday she wants to cut the time for major procurements to 12 months from an average of 2.5 years, speaking during a congressional hearing on the reorganization of the Defense Department’s procurement system. The Pentagon typically takes months and often years to make procurement decisions, especially for major weapons programs. A more rapid procurement process could accelerate the pace of orders for weapons makers like Lockheed Martin Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp. During the hearing of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, panel chairman Senator John McCain called the Pentagon’s buying program a “system of organized irresponsibility.” The Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Ellen Lord, was asked her goal for cutting back time for weapons procurement and she responded “12 months for major programs.” Lord, who began working at the Pentagon in August, was formerly chief executive of defense contractor Textron Systems, an aerospace and defense company that makes drones and missiles. If the acquisition process is shortened it would be good for larger weapons makers because time is money, Byron Callan, a defense analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, said in an interview. The move could also increase competition from smaller companies that often lack the financial resources to wait out lengthy Pentagon procurements, he said.  The Pentagon’s weapons procurement process generally begins by soliciting proposals from industry, often includes a competitive process to find a vendor, as well as product testing before delivery and final payment. Critics say the decision-making part of the current procurement process takes too long and could be reduced. Mark Esper, Secretary of the Army, said his office was examining a way to reduce the requirements development process, where the military articulates the concept of what it needs, to 12 months from five years. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) changed the structure of the Pentagon’s Office of Acquisition by splitting it into two new positions, an undersecretary for research and engineering focusing on innovation, and an undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment focusing on program management.  That process is still unfolding, but during the hearing testimony showed the initial effect was that decision making for some procurement processes had moved to individual branches of the U.S. military.

12116,"WASHINGTON   - The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation defended his  employees on Thursday against a growing chorus of accusations by Republicans, including President Donald Trump, that its agents were allowing political bias to seep into their investigations. In testimony before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Christopher Wray said he believed the reputation of the FBI was not, as Trump recently wrote on Twitter, “in tatters.” “The agents, analysts and staff of the FBI are big boys and girls. We understand we will take criticism from all corners,” Wray said.  “My experience has been that our reputation is quite good.” Republicans had in recent weeks stepped up criticism of the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump campaign aides had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The move is widely seen as a tactic to undermine Mueller’s investigation, which has so far led to criminal charges against four people from Trump’s inner circle. It comes as Republicans prepare to head into a potentially challenging midterm 2018 congressional election cycle. Republicans have sought to re-litigate questions relating to the FBI’s handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, and questioned whether Justice Department officials gave her preferential treatment in their decision not to charge her with a crime. They have criticized former FBI Director James Comey for publicly announcing a decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution and asked whether the decision-making was politically tainted.  Wray took over the helm of the FBI after Trump abruptly fired Comey earlier this year.     Most recently, Republicans got fresh ammunition against Mueller and the FBI, after media reports said FBI agent Peter Strzok was removed from the Russia probe because he had exchanged private text messages that disparaged Trump and supported Clinton. Strzok was involved in both the Clinton email and Russia investigations.  Wray acknowledged Thursday that Strzok was removed from Mueller’s investigation, but said he was reassigned, not disciplined. “We cannot afford for the FBI - which has traditionally been dubbed the premier law enforcement agency in the world - to become tainted by politicization or the perception of a lack of even-handedness,” Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said.

12164,"NEW YORK   - U.S. stocks gained ground on Tuesday as upbeat results from Walmart boosted investor sentiment and high-level U.S.-China trade talks resumed in Washington.  All three major U.S. equity indexes closed higher, with the Nasdaq ending its seventh consecutive day in the black.  Stocks have recovered broadly from their year-end selloff, with the Nasdaq up almost 21 percent from its Dec. 24 low and the S&P 500 more than 18 percent. More stocks are making 52-week highs than at any time since Wall Street was taking those indexes to records in August and September.  Stocks pared their gains late in the session, however, after a Reuters story quoted New York Fed President John Williams saying a different economic outlook would be necessary for the U.S. Federal Reserve to resume its interest rate hikes.   “(Williams) did say (the Fed was) going to be drawing down the balance sheet for some time,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “Perhaps that caused some concern in the markets.” Consumer discretionary stocks, led by Amazon.com, provided the biggest lift to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while Walmart Inc headed up the blue-chip Dow’s advance. Walmart reported a better-than-expected jump in same-store sales during the holiday quarter, sending shares of the world’s largest retailer up 2.2 percent.   “Walmart is the big story today,” said senior market strategist for Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. “You take a look at what we had last week with weaker-than-expected retail sales, and now Walmart’s coming in saying they had the best Christmas season in some time. “It provides reassurance to the market.” A fresh round of high-level trade talks between the United States and China began in Washington, with U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice president Myron Brilliant expressing hope that “the two sides will reach a comprehensive, bold and significant trade agreement.” On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is slated to release minutes from its January policymaking meeting. The minutes are expected to reaffirm the central bank’s statement last month that it would be “patient” with respect to further rate hikes after markets swooned late in December on fears of an economic slowdown. Indeed, in the quarters ahead, analysts see a slowdown in corporate profit growth. While fourth-quarter profits are expected to have increased by 16.3 percent, the outlook going forward grows cloudier. First-quarter 2019 earnings are now seen dropping by 0.6 percent from last year, which would mark the first annual decline since the earnings recession that ended mid-2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.07 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,891.32, the S&P 500 gained 4.16 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,779.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.36 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,486.77. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but healthcare and industrials closed in positive territory. Amazon ended the session up 1.2 percent, bouncing back from a two-day sell-off following news that the e-commerce giant’s China unit is in merger talks with Chinese shopping site Kaola. Shares of Freeport McMoRan jumped 6.6 percent after Citigroup raised the stock to “buy” from “neutral.” Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.63-to-1 ratio favored advancers. Between the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, 287 stocks hit 52-week highs, the most since September 21. The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 97 new highs and 20 new lows.

12195,"BRUSSELS   - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivered a message of support to European allies in Brussels on Tuesday but their concerns about President Donald Trump’s foreign policy have created a rift on a host of issues. European allies are troubled by Trump’s “America first” rhetoric, his decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal, his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and now plans to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.  Tillerson told Europe’s foreign ministers at the European Union and NATO that the U.S. government remains committed to transatlantic ties that Trump has previously questioned.  Tillerson also sought to reassure U.S. diplomats posted abroad that his ideas to revamp the country’s foreign service were bearing fruit, saying he would reveal a modernization plan for the U.S. State Department soon. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said his visit showed “the strong commitment the U.S. has to the European alliance, the important role that the European alliance plays in our shared security objectives.” Before a lunch with EU foreign ministers, Tillerson stressed “shared values, shared objectives for security and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.” Trump visited the U.S.-led NATO alliance in May to admonish European leaders on their low defense spending. During his visit on Tuesday, Tillerson offered a more generous appraisal and gave an “unwavering” U.S. commitment to NATO’s mutual defense clause, which considers an attack on one ally as an attack on all. Tillerson ignored questions from reporters about whether he would be ousted from the White House, while his senior adviser R.C. Hammond said no EU or NATO foreign ministers raised the issue of whether Tillerson’s job was secure. In his first substantive public comments since reports last week of a White House plan for CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace him, Tillerson said despite “a little criticism”, he was on top of his job. “While we don’t have any wins on the board yet, I can tell you we’re in a much better position to advance America’s interests around the world than we were 10 months ago,” he told senior U.S. diplomats and U.S. embassy staff at the U.S. mission to Belgium in Brussels.  Tillerson’s trip will also take him to Vienna and Paris. While Trump said last week he was not leaving and Tillerson said the reports were untrue,, Trump has also said he alone determines U.S. foreign policy, saying in a tweet on Friday: “I call the final shots.”  Tillerson told U.S. diplomats gathered at the embassy in Belgium that it had been “a bit of a shock” to meet Trump for the first time when he was approached as a possible secretary of state late last year.   Diplomats said EU governments face a dilemma because Tillerson’s views are more closely aligned with theirs but may not reflect those of Trump. Foreign ministers had been open about sharing disagreements with the United States on various issues, Hammond said. One EU diplomat said it was “fairly predictable” given tensions on issues, including Trump’s handling of the North Korea nuclear crisis and his threat to “totally destroy” the secretive country. “Allies have been very frank today in sharing some of their views,” Hammond said, although he said it was important to be honest, adding that: “dialogues only work if they go two ways.” In a speech in Berlin before flying to Brussels, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned that the European Union could no longer rely on the United States as its closest ally. “The withdrawal of the United States under Donald Trump from its reliable role as a guarantor of Western-led multilateralism accelerates a change of the world order with immediate consequences for German and European interests,” Gabriel said. Standing next to Tillerson on the podium at the EU headquarters in Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini also warned the Trump administration about a possible plan to the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Trump is considering recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which Gabriel also said could unleash turmoil. “A lot of member states, including us, are concerned that the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel will not calm the conflict but rather inflame it,” Gabriel said at NATO after the EU ministers’ lunch with Tillerson. The European Union, as the Palestinians’ biggest aid donor and Israel’s top trade partner, says it has a right to make its voice heard in any U.S. initiatives in the Middle East.

12196,"LONDON   - The chief executive of mining group BHP has no plans to quit and will focus on the “nuclear level of safety” needed to avoid any repeat of the Vale dam collapse in Brazil, as well as on transforming his own company. Speculation about the future of CEO Andrew Mackenzie, 62, has swirled since 2017 when activist investor Elliott Advisors began campaigning for change and Ken MacKenzie was appointed as chairman. Asked about how long he planned to stay, Mackenzie, in the role since 2013, said he was not thinking about moving on. “I’ve got a lot to do right now and I’ve got a lot to do on tailings dams,” he told reporters in London. As the tailings disaster in Brazil in January overshadows the mining industry, BHP has the experience to lead change as its Samarco joint venture with Vale was involved in a previous dam collapse in November 2015 that left 19 dead. Following Samarco, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) issued updated guidelines to try to safeguard tailings dams that store waste from mining operations. But the ICMM is industry-led and Mackenzie has called for an independent body to oversee dams. “We have to acknowledge the deficiencies in the scientific and technical understanding,” the Scotsman said. “You need to think about this with the best possible science and engineering in the world. It has to have a nuclear level of safety now.” Mackenzie said mining companies were needed to provide society with resources and to support a transition to a low carbon economy that will spur demand for minerals such as copper, used in electrification. After the commodities crash of 2015-16, the mining industry has repaired balance sheets and handed cash to shareholders. The next steps are less obvious as old ore bodies become depleted and new assets are often in politically unstable countries. BHP on Tuesday said its first-half underlying profit was down 8 percent from the same period a year ago and it cut its forecast for productivity gains to flat for the financial year, mainly because production outages meant $460 million in savings was not achieved. Mackenzie said he was excited to be leading a “transformation agenda” to help with the next phase of growth and maximize the productivity of operations. “The transformation agenda is the biggest lever we have got to play. It’s reporting direct to me. I’m getting a lot out of it,” Mackenzie said.

12197,"HONG KONG/LONDON   - HSBC warned it may have to delay some investments this year as Europe’s biggest bank missed 2018 profit forecasts due to slowing growth in its two home markets of China and Britain. Its shares fell 3 percent and analysts cut their forecasts as HSBC reported a drop in fourth-quarter revenue amid tumbling stock markets that sapped customer’s confidence in investing. The results spoke to a wider problem for European banks, which are struggling to return to growth after a decade of post-crisis restructuring due to a worsening global economic outlook.       At the end of his first year in charge, Chief Executive John Flint said HSBC may have to delay investment plans in order to avoid missing a key target known as ‘positive jaws’ - which tracks whether the bank is growing revenues faster than costs - for a second straight year. “We will be proactive in managing costs and investment to meet the risks to revenue growth where necessary, but we will not take short-term decisions that harm the long-term interests of the business,” Flint said on Tuesday, after HSBC reported a lower-than-expected 16 percent rise in 2018 profit before tax. In June, Flint had said HSBC would invest $15-$17 billion over three years in areas including technology and China, while keeping profitability and dividend targets little changed.  “The key thing is just to moderate the pace of  investments ... not to cancel it or change the shape of the investments,” Flint told Reuters. The bank said it failed to achieve positive jaws in 2018 due to the weakness of markets in the fourth quarter. A combination of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in former hot spots wiped 10 percent off MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index last year, its first double-digit loss in any year since the 2008 global financial crisis. Flint’s comments come as an economic slowdown in China challenges HSBC’s strategy of pouring more resources into Asia where it already makes nearly 90 percent of its profits. China’s economic growth slowed to 6.6 percent in 2018, the weakest in 28 years, weighed down by rising borrowing costs and a clampdown on riskier lending that starved smaller, private companies of capital and stifled investment. Pressure on the world’s second-largest economy could increase if Beijing and Washington do not reach a deal soon to end their year-long trade dispute, which is taking a growing toll on export-reliant economies from Asia to Europe. HSBC’s profits in Asia grew by 16 percent to $17.8 billion last year, accounting for 89 percent of group profit. “Clearly our customers are really more cautious and are more thoughtful around this trade war with the U.S.,” Flint said. “It’s possible that we’ll see a slightly lower growth rate this year but we are still going to see a growth rate.” Since taking over from Stuart Gulliver last February, Flint has largely stuck to the same China-focused strategy as his predecessor while attempting to revive HSBC’s ailing U.S. franchise and putting less emphasis on its investment bank. HSBC set aside $165 million against possible future bad loans in Britain, which it said reflected the increased risks of a potential economic hit from Britain’s departure from the European Union, scheduled for next month. HSBC joined UK peer Royal Bank of Scotland in warning that uncertainties related to Brexit could also drive businesses under. “The longer we have the uncertainty the worse it’s going to be for the customers. Customers are absolutely postponing investment decisions ... and that’s been the part of this slowdown that we have seen in the UK,” Flint said. HSBC reported a profit before tax of $19.9 billion for 2018, versus $17.2 billion the year before, but below an average estimate of $22 billion, according to Refinitiv data based on forecasts from 17 analysts.

12205,"WASHINGTON   - The special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on Monday accused President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, of working with a Russian colleague to draft an opinion piece about his political work for Ukraine. In court filings, a prosecutor working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team said Manafort was working on the article as recently as Nov. 30. Had it been published, prosecutors say it would have violated a Nov. 8 court order not to discuss the case publicly.  The Russian colleague who was working with Manafort allegedly to shape public opinion about his work for a Ukrainian political party has ties to Russian intelligence agencies, according to the filing.  Manafort ultimately never published the opinion piece, after prosecutors reached out to his attorneys to alert them, they said in the filing.  Due to Manafort’s actions, prosecutors said the judge should reject his request to modify his bail conditions.  Manafort has proposed an $11.65 million bail package in exchange for lifting him from house arrest and electronic monitoring.   As part of that deal, he would forfeit four of his real estate properties if he violated his bail conditions. “Even if the ghost-written op-ed were entirely accurate, fair and balanced, it would be a violation of this court’s November 8 order if it had been published,” wrote prosecutor Andrew Weissmann.  A spokesman for Manafort did not have any immediate comment.  Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates were both indicted in October in a 12-count indictment by a federal grand jury. They face charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. Initially, Manafort’s lawyers had said in their court filing that the special counsel’s office was willing to accept the proposed terms of his release.  But prosecutors wrote that they can no longer trust Manafort, and cannot accept his proposed terms. “Because Manafort has now taken actions that reflect an intention to violate or circumvent the court’s existing orders, at a time one would expect particularly scrupulous adherence, the government submits that the proposed bail package is insufficient,” the filing said.

12268,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON   - The United States and China will resume trade talks next week in Washington with time running short to ease their bruising trade war, but U.S. President Donald Trump repeated on Friday that he may extend a March 1 deadline for a deal and keep tariffs on Chinese goods from rising. Both the United States and China reported progress in five days of negotiations in Beijing this week. Trump, speaking at a White House news conference, said the United States was closer than ever before to “having a real trade deal” with China and said he would be “honored” to remove tariffs if an agreement can be reached. But he added that the talks were “very complicated.” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Friday the two economic superpowers “will continue working on all outstanding issues in advance of the March 1, 2019, deadline.  “These detailed and intensive discussions led to progress between the two parties. Much work remains, however,” Sanders said about the Beijing talks. She added that the two countries agreed to state any commitments they make in a memorandum of understanding. China’s Vice Premier and chief trade negotiator Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would be leading the talks in Washington, a White House source said. U.S. duties on $200 billion in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no deal is reached by March 1 to address U.S. demands that China curb forced technology transfers and better enforce intellectual property rights.  Trump, asked whether he would grant Beijing a 60-day extension to the deadline, said: “There is a possibility that I will extend the date. But if I do that - if I see that we’re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction - I would do that at the same tariffs that we’re charging now, I would not increase the tariffs.” Trump also said he would consider bringing top U.S. Democrats - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer - into the final stages of the talks to minimize their dissent with the deal. Spokespersons for the two lawmakers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The conclusion of the Beijing talks prompted optimism on Wall Street, where major stock indexes ended higher. The U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies doing business in China, applauded the announcement that the two sides would put specific language in a memorandum of understanding and said its existence could cause the Trump to push back deadline. “It does appear that enough progress has been made to possibly extend the deadline,” said Craig Allen, president of the Washington-based group. “The memorandum of understanding might not finish all the details, but if it contained the final picture ... that would be a huge step forward.” Chinese state news agency Xinhua said on Friday that China and the United States had reached a “consensus in principle” on some key issues, adding they had a detailed discussion on a memorandum of understanding on trade and economic issues. It gave no details. The countries focused this week on technology, intellectual property rights, agriculture, services, non-tariff barriers and currency, and discussed potential Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and services to reduce a “large and persistent bilateral trade deficit,” Sanders said.  Chinese President Xi Jinping met Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday after a week of talks at senior and deputy levels, and called for a deal both sides could accept, Chinese state media said. After talks on Thursday, Mnuchin said on Twitter that he and Lighthizer had held “productive meetings” with Xi’s top economic adviser, Liu He.  “The consultations between the two sides’ teams achieved important step-by-step progress,” Xi said, according to state television. “I hope you will continue efforts to advance reaching a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement,” Xi said at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. He added that China was willing to take a “cooperative approach” to settling bilateral trade frictions. Lighthizer told Xi the senior officials had “two very good days” of talks.  “We feel that we have made headway on very, very important, and very difficult issues. We have additional work to do but we are hopeful,” Lighthizer told Xi in a pool video shown to foreign media. Neither country has offered new details on how they might de-escalate the tariff war that has roiled financial markets and disrupted manufacturing supply chains. Although Trump said this week that an extension of the tariff deadline was possible if a “real deal” was close, Larry Kudlow, director of the U.S. National Economic Council, has said the White House had made no such decision.  But several sources informed about the meetings told Reuters there was little indication negotiators had made major progress on sticking points to pave the way for a potential meeting between Xi and Trump in coming weeks to hammer out a deal. “Stalemate on the important stuff,” said one source. All of the sources requested anonymity because the talks are confidential.  “There’s still a lot of distance between parties on structural and enforcement issues,” said a second source. “I wouldn’t quite call it hitting a wall, but it’s not a field of dreams either.” A third source told Reuters the White House was “irate” over earlier reports that the Trump administration was considering a 60-day extension of the tariff deadline.

12269,"SHANGHAI   - Chinese state media on Saturday expressed cautious optimism over trade talks between the United States and China, a day after President Xi Jinping said a week of discussions had produced “step-by-step” progress. Xi made the comments at a meeting on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing, after a week of senior- and deputy-level talks. The People’s Daily, the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, said in a commentary that Xi’s meeting with U.S. negotiators had affirmed progress made in previous talks and “injected new impetus into the next stage of the development of Sino-U.S. trade relations.” The talks “have made important progress” for the next round of negotiations in Washington next week, the paper said in its domestic edition. “It is hoped that the two sides will maintain the good momentum of the current consultations and strive to reach an agreement within the set time limit,” it said. U.S. duties on $200 billion in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if there is no deal by March 1 to address U.S. demands that China curb forced technology transfers and better enforce intellectual property rights. In its overseas edition, the People’s Daily said “zero-sum thinking and games where you lose and I win can only create losses for both. Only on a basis of mutual respect and equal treatment, through dialogue and consultation, can we find a solution acceptable to both sides.” An English-language editorial in the Global Times, which is published by the People’s Daily, said news that China had consulted on the text of a memorandum of understanding “shows the two sides have made unprecedented progress.” “The MOU and next week’s talks both show that the seemingly endless China-U.S. trade negotiations, like a marathon, are making a final sprint,” it said. The newspapers cautioned that any agreement would have to be in the interests of both the United States and China. “There are still obstacles to be overcome, and no one should underestimate how daunting a task the two sides face trying to resolve all the differences that have long existed between them in one clean sweep,” the official English-language China Daily said in an editorial.

12289,"NEW YORK   - Wall Street rallied on Friday, with the Dow and the Nasdaq posting their eighth consecutive weekly gains as investors grew hopeful that the United States and China would hammer out an agreement resolving their protracted trade war. All three major U.S. indexes ended the session higher, and for the fourth straight session, the S&P 500 held above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level. Talks between the United States and China will resume in Washington next week, with both sides saying progress has been made toward resolving the two countries’ contentious trade dispute. Tariff-vulnerable industrials provided the biggest lift to the blue-chip Dow, led by bellwethers Boeing Co, 3M Co, United Technologies Inc and Caterpillar Inc. “This may be just false hope with the tariff situation as thorny details still need to be agreed upon,” said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. “It’s good news but its not over yet.” Indeed, the trade row’s effects were reflected in Deere & Co’s earnings report, which came in below analyst estimates in part because of slowing international trade. The agricultural equipment manufacturer’s shares fell 2.1 percent. “Solving the trade issue could give global growth the boost it needs,” Carter added. “Absent a tariff solution, growth will continue to slow.” With nearly 80 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported, fourth-quarter earnings season is largely in the rearview mirror. Analysts now see a profit increase of 16.2 percent for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Going forward, however, the outlook continues to worsen. First quarter earnings are currently seen falling by 0.5 percent, the first year-on-year decline since mid-2016.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 443.86 points, or 1.74 percent, to 25,883.25, the S&P 500 gained 29.87 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,775.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.46 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,472.41. All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in the black. The rate-sensitive financial sector led the S&P 500’s advance, bouncing back from Thursday’s sell-off as U.S. Treasury yields crept back up. Shares of PepsiCo were up 3.1 percent even after the snack and beverage company forecast a surprise drop in full-year profit. Nvidia Corp rose 1.8 percent following the company’s forecasts for its current fiscal year topped Wall Street expectations. The chipmaker gave the second-largest boost to the closely-watched Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index, which was up 0.5 percent. The index has jumped nearly 18 percent so far this year. Amazon.com shares were down 0.9 percent after scrapping its plans for a New York headquarters. In fact, each of Amazon’s fellow FAANG members, a group of momentum stocks which also includes Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc also ended the session in the red. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 86 new highs and 16 new lows.

12319,"LONDON   - The world economy is caught in a “delicate equilibrium” between stabilization and a further downturn, according to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, and that balance could look even shakier over the next few days. Early measures of factory activity from Asia, Europe and the United States – which typically give signals of momentum in the overall economy - will be scrutinized by investors, many of whom fear that the sudden weakness of late 2018 is intensifying. Trade tensions have weighed heavily on factories around the world, something that is likely to be high on the minds of negotiators from the United States and China when they resume their talks to avert an escalation of their tariff war. Things looked very different a year ago. The world economy seemed to have finally kicked into a higher gear, nearly a decade after the financial crisis of 2007-08, with all regions joining in the upswing. But a combination of U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive stance on trade and worries about the impact of central banks raising interest rates - the U.S. Federal Reserve increased borrowing costs four times in 2018 - has raised fears that the world could be heading back into recession. Carney, in a speech on Feb. 12, said he believed growth was likely to stabilize at its new slower pace, helped by central banks scaling back their plans for removing the massive levels of stimulus they have held in place for a decade. “But this is a judgment, not a guarantee. The world is in a delicate equilibrium,” Carney warned. The most recent signs from the world economy have not been promising. U.S. retail sales for December were far weaker than expected and Germany avoided a recession by the narrowest of margins. Britain - weighed down by the uncertainty about Brexit as well as the global weakness - is heading for its slowest year of growth since 2009, according to the BoE, while China’s economic growth last year was the weakest in 28 years. In the next few days, a string of surveys of manufacturing will give a fresher sense of whether the slowdown of last year is dissipating or getting worse. Purchasing manager indexes (PMIs) for the euro zone, the United States and Japan are due on Feb. 21 and there will be other measures of factory output in the form of U.S. durable goods data and industrial orders in Japan and Italy. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit which publishes the PMIs, said that in late 2017 only one country’s factory sector - Colombia’s - was shrinking. Now 11 of the 30 countries he covers are contracting, including those in China and Germany, from where problems are rippling out into Asia and eastern Europe respectively. “A lot of the anecdotal evidence that we get is blaming trade wars and tariff worries, and the gloom it is casting over the prospects for the year ahead,” Williamson said. Markit’s global export index had been in decline for five months, highlighting how the slowdown was led by weaker trade, although a slight pick-up in optimism among manufacturers around the world in January offered a hint of hope. Much of that optimism hinges on the chance of the United States and China finding a way to de-escalate their trade war. Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday that talks with the United States would continue in the coming days and he hoped the two sides will be able to reach a deal. But many investors want to see more definitive signs that the clouds hanging over the economy really are lifting. Toby Vaughan, chief investment officer with Brown Shipley, a British private bank and wealth management firm, said his team scaled back on equity holdings in October and have not yet raised their exposure back up. “The reality is, none of those factors have really changed. There are some encouraging signs, but it’s headlines and rhetoric with regard to U.S.-China for example,” he said. While Washington and Beijing are sounding positive about their trade stand-off, officials in Europe are worried that the Trump administration is preparing to hit European automobile exports with tariffs, citing national security grounds. “Such a development would likely be taken negatively by markets as it would risk a direct response of tariffs from the EU and a step up in tensions,” economists at ING said in a note to clients. “Businesses and consumers will face higher prices in such a scenario along with the likely disruption to supply chains -

12341,"SHANGHAI   - Starbucks Corp said on Friday it would launch a new all-day dining cafe in China which will serve a brunch menu and cocktails, as the world’s largest coffee chain seeks to expand its retail offering in the increasingly competitive market. The opening of the cafe in the city of Shanghai comes as Starbucks has been facing slowing sales growth in its second-largest market amid pressure from a growing number of independent coffee shops and Chinese startups such as Luckin Coffee which offer cheap delivery and big discounts.  “Today marks yet another significant milestone as we take everything we have learned around coffee and our relentless pursuit for food innovation, to create a new exciting all-day cafe dining and Italian aperitivo experience,” Starbucks China CEO Belinda Wong said in a statement. The Starbucks Reserve Bakery Cafe, which opens this weekend, is the firm’s first such store in China and will offer its premium coffees, freshly prepared food from its Princi Italian bakery and alcoholic drinks from a “mixology” bar”. The company also has similar cafes in the United States, where it has been pursuing an upscale strategy. Starbucks has benefited from a growing cafe culture in China but the trend has also given rise to a host of ambitious local competitors, including Luckin Coffee, which has said that it wants to open 2,500 new stores this year and overtake Starbucks as China’s largest coffee chain. Analysts say, however, that there are signs that Starbucks’ efforts to improve sales are gaining steam, with quarterly sales in China beating estimates last month, driven by new store openings and a delivery program that it launched with internet giant Alibaba last year.

12364,"NEW YORK   - The S&P 500 and the Dow slipped while the Nasdaq posted a slim gain on Thursday as investors struggled to square grim retail sales data with hopes that high-level talks in Beijing could resolve the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute. Paring earlier losses, the S&P 500 held above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level, for the third straight session. All three major U.S. stock indexes were held back by rate-sensitive financial stocks as U.S. Treasury yields fell on the weaker-than-expected economic data.  Talks to defuse the ongoing tariff dispute between the world’s two largest economies moved to a higher level as U.S.-China negotiations progressed in Beijing ahead of the March 1 deadline.  But trade optimism was undercut by a report from the U.S. Commerce Department showing retail sales in December suffered their biggest drop in more than nine years, stoking fears of an economic slowdown.   “The market has been climbing this wall of worry since Christmas,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “Some of that worry might turn into reality, and that’s what’s holding investors back.” “I wouldn’t say there’s a lot of conviction out there,” Ghriskey added.      With the fourth-quarter reporting season now more than three-fourths complete, analysts now see earnings growth of 16.2 percent for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data.  But first-quarter estimates are less favorable. They show a 0.3 percent year-on-year decline, which would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings recession that ended in 2016.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.88 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,439.39, the S&P 500 lost 7.3 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,745.73 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.58 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,426.96. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, 6 closed in negative territory, with consumer staples and financials showing the biggest percentage declines. Cisco Systems Inc rose 1.9 percent on the heels of a better-than-expected earnings report as the network gear maker benefited from strength in newer businesses and shrugged off the impact of the U.S.-China trade war. Shares of American International Group Inc slid 9.0 percent, marking its worst day in four years after the global insurer posted a quarterly loss. Coca-Cola Co shares fizzled, dropping 8.4 percent and providing the biggest drag on the Dow after its full-year profit forecast fell well below Wall Street expectations.

12379,"NEW YORK   - Barclays and J.P. Morgan on Thursday reduced their estimates on U.S. economic growth in the final quarter of 2018 following data that showed domestic retail sales took a 1.2 percent spill in December, which was its steepest monthly drop in nine years. U.S. gross domestic product likely grew at a 2.0 percent annualized pace in the final three months of last year based on the latest retail sales figures, slower than an earlier calculated rate of 2.6 percent, J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli wrote in a research note. The weaker outlook reflected a likely deceleration in consumer spending growth in the final three months of last year to 2.8 percent from an earlier view of 3.8 percent, he said. The latest retail sales report “was uniformly and, in some cases, shockingly weak,” Feroli wrote. “The most plausible economic explanation is that long-dormant wealth effects came back with a vengeance, and consumers slashed their holiday purchases when they saw their 401(k)’s going down the drain.”         Meanwhile, Barclays economists scaled back their view on fourth-quarter GDP to 2.1 percent from 2.8 percent.

12424,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING   - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday trade talks with China were “going along very well” as the world’s two largest economies try to resolve their seven-month tariff war ahead of a March 1 deadline for a deal. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China are scheduled to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if the two sides don’t reach a deal by then, increasing pain and costs in sectors from consumer electronics to agriculture. Trump told reporters at the White House his administration has a “big team of people, very talented people, over in China right now, negotiating on the China deal.” “It’s going along very well. We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s going along very well. They’re showing us tremendous respect,” Trump added. Trump’s comments echoed those of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who earlier told reporters in Beijing: “So far, so good,” when asked about the progress of talks. Mnuchin, along with U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer, arrived in the Chinese capital on Tuesday for meetings with Vice Premier Liu He, the top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping, on Thursday and Friday. Deputy-level officials started talks on Monday. The two U.S. cabinet officials will meet with Xi on Friday, the South China Morning Post reported, citing a source briefed on the arrangements. Representatives from the USTR’s office and Treasury could not immediately be reached to comment on the report. Trump met with Liu at the White House when a Chinese delegation came to Washington for talks at the end of January.  The U.S. president had said on Tuesday that the deadline for an agreement could “slide for a little while,” but he preferred not to do so. Trump added he expects to meet with Xi to close the deal at some point. Trump’s advisers have described March 1 as a “hard deadline,” but Trump told reporters a delay was possible.  Speaking to Fox News on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said: “we’ll see what happens on whether or not the president makes a move to change the deadline.”   She also raised the possibility of a meeting between the leaders of the two countries, saying Trump’s personal retreat at Mar-a-Lago in Florida would make a good venue. “It will ultimately take ... President Trump and President Xi sitting down face-to-face figuring that out and getting that final deal because they are the only two that’ll ultimately be able to nail that down,” Sanders said. Trump has said he did not expect to meet with Xi prior to March 1. U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Secretary Stephen Censky said on Wednesday the two presidents were expected to meet “sometime in March,” but no dates were set. “Hopefully they are going to be meeting and will be able conclude a deal,” Censky told a renewable fuels conference in Orlando, Florida. “Agriculture has to be part of it. It’s a necessary part of the deal.” A growing number of U.S. businesses and lawmakers hope the tariff increase is delayed while the two sides tackle the difficult U.S. demands for major structural policy changes by China. They include ending the forced transfer of American trade secrets, curbing Beijing’s industrial subsidies and enforcing intellectual property rights. The latest round of talks in Beijing kicked off on Monday at the deputy level to work out technical details, including a mechanism for enforcing any trade agreement. China’s Foreign Ministry referred questions on the talks to the Ministry of Commerce, which did not respond to a request for comment. James Green, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University, believes China is seeking a Xi-Trump meeting, hoping it would make a near-term deal on tariffs far more likely. “From their point of view, they would have dodged a bullet,” Green, who was USTR’s top official at the U.S. embassy in Beijing until mid-2018, told Reuters.

12432,"NEW YORK   - Wall Street closed higher on Wednesday as investor optimism was stoked over hopes the United States and China could iron out a trade deal, and benign inflation data suggested the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates steady in the near term. All three major U.S. stock indexes gained ground, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posting their fourth consecutive advances. For the second straight day, the S&P 500 closed above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level.  Stocks briefly pared gains following a late-morning tweet by U.S. Senator Marco Rubio saying he would introduce a bill to “tax corporate buybacks the same way as dividends.” In Beijing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said “so far, so good,” regarding ongoing talks aimed at resolving the U.S.-China trade dispute, adding he hoped for “productive” meetings in the days ahead. “The markets are extremely vulnerable to news,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton. “(Investors are) waiting and hoping for good news to come out of the trade negotiations with China, and for continued signs that the economy is still growing at a healthy pace without heating up inflation.” The U.S. Labor Department reported consumer prices were unchanged for the third consecutive month in January, in a sign the Fed could hold rates steady for the time being. Fourth-quarter earnings season is approaching the finish line, with more than two-thirds of the S&P 500 having reported.  While analysts now see fourth-quarter earnings growth of 16.6 percent, the outlook for the current quarter is less upbeat.

12463,"WASHINGTON   - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it was recalling about 1.48 million F-150 pickup trucks in North America due to a potential transmission downshift issue that could increase the risk of a crash. Ford said select 2011-2013 model year trucks with six-speed automatic transmission could experience an unintended downshift into first gear without warning, which could result in the loss of vehicle control. Ford is aware of five accidents, including one report of whiplash potentially related to the issue. The recall covers 1.26 million trucks in the United States and 221,000 in Canada. Dealers will update the powertrain control software and the company will notify customers next month. In March 2016, Ford recalled 153,000 U.S. 2011-2012 Ford F-150, Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator vehicles for a similar transmission downshift problem. Ford spokeswoman Monique Brentley said the root cause was different than in the new recall. In December 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into whether that recall should be expanded by nearly 1.4 million 2011-2013 vehicles after 123 complaints and two crashes but no reported injuries. The agency said an unexpected downshift “can cause the vehicle to slow down suddenly and without warning. This can also cause the rear tires to skid or lock up, increasing the risk of a crash.” The investigation is pending. Ford also said it is issuing two other recalls. One covers 28,200 2017-19 Lincoln Continental vehicles in North America for door latches that may not engage due to the buildup of silicon contamination and could result in the door opening while driving. Ford said it was not aware of any reports of accidents or injuries. Dealers will replace the door latch assemblies in all four doors.

12514,"  - Advisers to Venezuela’s self-declared president Juan Guaido have proposed he appoint six executives to a transitional board for U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp, Venezuela’s most important foreign asset, four people close to the talks said. The congress chief wants to secure control of the U.S. subsidiary of Venezuelan state-run energy firm PDVSA as he seeks to assemble an interim government. Controlling Citgo and other assets outside Venezuela, especially those that generate revenue, would provide him with much-needed funds.  PDVSA, Citgo and Venezuela’s oil ministry did not respond to requests for comments. Guaido invoked a constitutional provision to assume the presidency three weeks ago, arguing that the re-election last year of President Nicolas Maduro was a sham. Most Western countries, including the United States, have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, but Maduro retains control of state institutions. The proposed board would be composed of Venezuelans Luisa Palacios, Angel Olmeta, Luis Urdaneta and Edgar Rincon, all of whom are currently living in the United States, plus two American Citgo employees. They would be assigned specific tasks by Guaido’s team to secure operational and financial control while resolving internal disputes, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Guaido’s advisers have been recruiting from a wide range of Venezuelan energy executives in recent weeks, the people said. Some have declined to join his proposed board.  Palacios, who holds a doctorate from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, has been head of emerging markets and Latin American research at consultancy Medley Global Advisors. She did not respond to a request for comment.  Olmeta and Urdaneta were top executives at PDVSA and Citgo, and Rincon worked as senior vice president of operations at energy firm Nabors Industries Ltd, according to their LinkedIn profiles. They could not immediately be reached for comment.  Two top American executives currently working for Citgo, Vice President of Refining, Art Klein, and chief strategy officer, Rick Esser, also would join the board, the people said. They did not respond to requests for comment. Maduro calls Guaido’s claim to the presidency an attempted U.S.-backed coup and promised he will not allow Citgo to be “stolen.” “We have protected the nation’s assets and that is hurting them,” Guaido said in a speech on Tuesday, in reference to Maduro’s government. Citgo’s U.S. headquarters have been torn into factions by the political battle. PDVSA last week sought to remove U.S. citizens from its board and huddled over a legal strategy to block the expected appointments. Some Venezuelan executives have been recalled to Caracas, others dismissed, and some Maduro loyalists suddenly reappeared, people familiar with the company’s operations said.   Washington also has been closely involved in talks on the fate of Citgo, which owns about 4 percent of U.S. oil refining capacity. The unit runs refineries in Illinois, Texas, and Louisiana, operates fuel pipelines and terminals, and supplies a retail network of 5,500 gas station across 29 U.S. states. Esser has been making routine decisions as Citgo’s current president, Asdrubal Chavez, and his closest collaborators have run the company from the Bahamas, where a Citgo executive office was opened last year, three people at the Houston-based firm said.    The mechanics of how the new board would take over are unclear, and there are likely to be court challenges to the board’s authority, people familiar with the deliberations said. A long fight in U.S. courts could jeopardize Guaido’s attempt to control operation of Citgo’s refineries and gain access to the millions of dollars of dividends Citgo generates each year. The company has been barred from paying dividends to PDVSA and the cash is believed to have accrued on its books.     His plan for Citgo recently was revised to give the proposed board a timeline to act and specific directions, while offering candidates protection from liability over allegations linked to PDVSA, some of which are under investigation by U.S. authorities.

12546,"BRUSSELS   - Europe’s second-highest court will rule on Thursday whether a Belgian tax break which benefited some 35 large companies is illegal state aid, a judgment which could provide clues to other tax cases involving Apple, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. As part of its crackdown on tax avoidance, the European Commission three years ago ordered Belgium to recover some 700 million euros ($790 million) from the group, saying the companies’ “excess profit” tax plan gave them an unfair advantage vis-a-vis smaller firms. The scheme allowed the companies to claim deductions for  economies of scale, reducing their corporate tax base by 50-90 percent.  Dutch industrial company Magnetrol and Belgium subsequently challenged the Commission’s decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court. The largest beneficiaries were Wabco, Cellio, BP, BASF, Atlas Copco and Belgacom. Judges may also rule whether it qualifies as a scheme or are just individual tax rulings. The tax avoidance drive has included orders to Ireland to recover some 13 billion euros from iPhone maker Apple and Luxembourg to claw back up to 30 million euros from Fiat Chrysler, 250 million euros from Amazon and about 120 million euros from Engie.  The Netherlands has to recover between 20-30 million euros from Starbucks. All the major companies have challenged the EU rulings. At stake is whether the Commission is over-stretching its powers by using its state aid tool to address tax fairness concerns. The United States has criticized the cases against U.S. companies and notably in the Apple ruling it has accused the EU of grabbing revenue intended for U.S. coffers. The cases are T-131/16 Belgium v Commission and T-263/16 Magnetrol International v Commission.

12657,"WASHINGTON   - A senior administration official said on Friday that U.S. national security depends on affordable energy, and slammed cartels when asked if President Donald Trump would support a bill targeting the OPEC production group’s oil supply cuts. “The United States is firmly committed to open, fair and competitive markets for global energy trade,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We do not support market-distorting behavior, including cartels.” The House of Representatives’ Judiciary Committee on Thursday unanimously passed the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels, or NOPEC, bill. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who has supported NOPEC in the past, was reviewing the bill, an aide said, but there was no indication whether a vote in the full House would be scheduled. The legislation would change American antitrust law to revoke the sovereign immunity that has long protected OPEC members from U.S. lawsuits. It allows the U.S. attorney general to sue the oil producers group, any of its members, and countries it works with, on grounds of collusion. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate on Thursday by Senators Chuck Grassley, a Republican backer of the corn-based motor fuel ethanol, and Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who is expected to announce on Sunday whether she is running for president in 2020.  Senator John Cornyn of Texas has opposed NOPEC in the past. Other Texas lawmakers were also unlikely to support the bill as Motiva Enterprises LLC, a subsidiary of Saudi state oil company Saudi Aramco, operates a large refinery in the state, a policy analyst said.  The Vienna-based Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which includes the world’s top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, says it is not a cartel but rather a production group.  Trump has criticized the group for cutting supplies and urged it to produce more to lower global oil prices. But the president has taken no action on Saudi Arabia, a major buyer of U.S. weapons, even after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year. The bill has appeared in Congress in various forms over the last 20 years, and today’s oil prices are low compared to 2008, when the bill passed the House. Oil traded in New York fell 6 cents to $52.58 per barrel on Friday and was down about 4.9 percent for the week, the steepest decline this year, pulled down by worries about a global economic slowdown. The senior official’s comments were the furthest the Trump administration has gone in commenting on the bill, which also passed the House committee last year, but did not come up for a vote in the full chamber.  “Access to affordable and reliable energy underpins global economic growth and U.S. national security,” the official added. Trump supported NOPEC in his book “Time to Get Tough” published in 2011 before he became president, but he has not publicly commented on the bill while in office.  Last summer, OPEC cooperated with non-OPEC producer Russia to boost output before Trump reimposed sanctions on oil exports from Iran, Saudi Arabia’s archrival. But OPEC’s output fell in January by the largest amount in two years as its Gulf members over-delivered on a supply cutting plan to boost prices.  The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying group for U.S. oil and gas drilling, has opposed the NOPEC bill, saying it could expose diplomatic, business and military interests to retaliation. API President and Chief Executive Mike Sommers said in an interview the bill was “populist” and the group would work with the House and Senate leadership to tell them that the U.S. shale oil revolution, which has helped make the country the world’s top oil producer, has helped combat OPEC.  “We are no longer held hostage by the oil cartel in Vienna,” Sommers said. Barclays analyst Michael Cohen said in a research note that the appetite for advancing the bill was likely subdued while oil prices were low. But if it did pass, the legislation would threaten the sustainability of coordinated supply actions by OPEC, and OPEC plus Russia, and add more volatility to the market.   Another analyst said the bill’s future depends on the oil price. “The higher the price of crude goes, the higher the odds of NOPEC. It’s just that simple,” said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy, a consultancy.

12838,"  - When the lawyer for the former campaign manager of President Donald Trump attacked the money laundering charge brought against his client as flimsy, some legal experts say he may have pinpointed a potential weakness in the indictment by U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller. Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro-Russia former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich between 2006 and 2015 and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies, partnerships and bank accounts. In a court filing on Thursday, Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing said the money laundering count, the most serious facing his client with a 20-year maximum sentence, was based on a “tenuous legal theory” tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former Ukrainian leader.  Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment. The language of the filing and defiant statements Downing made outside the courthouse following Manafort’s arraignment on Monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges, the first to be made public from Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Kremlin has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on Monday. Downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant, according to an additional filing on Friday. Manafort’s Virginia home was raided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents over the summer. The money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of “specified unlawful activity.” According to the Manafort indictment, the unlawful activity was his violation of the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Though the money laundering statute includes FARA violations, Seattle tax lawyer John Colvin said the charge against Manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases. “It doesn’t fit the normal paradigm” of money-laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking, Colvin said. “It seems like a stretch to me.”  Downing said in his Thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating FARA in the last 50 years, producing only one conviction. By pointing out the lack of previous FARA prosecutions, former federal prosecutor Mark Lee, now a white-collar defense lawyer in Philadelphia, said Downing was likely trying to suggest Manafort may not even have known he was violating the law. The section cited by Mueller requires the FARA violation to be “knowing and willful.” Successfully casting doubt on whether Manafort intentionally violated FARA could knock out the money laundering charge, Lee said. “If you don’t have a (specific unlawful activity), you can’t by definition have a laundering,” said Lee. Former federal prosecutor Michael Padula, now a Miami defense lawyer, said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to “promote” an ongoing criminal enterprise. That may be hard to show in the Manafort case, where the proceeds went to purchase real estate, expensive suits and Range Rovers for the conspirator’s personal use. But other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding FARA would gain much traction. “The idea that somebody of Mr. Manafort’s background and sophistication would not understand that, if he did what he is alleged to have done, he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government, is, I think, laughable,” said Chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter. Several lawyers noted that, even without the money laundering counts, Mueller had strong charges based on the failure of Manafort and Gates to report their overseas accounts to the Internal Revenue Service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence. They also pointed out that Mueller could add more charges at a later date. “It’s an argument, not a get out of jail free card,” said Padula of Downing’s money laundering defense. “He’s still got a tough road ahead of him.”  ",Manafort money laundering charge in Russia probe may face challenges,"November 4, 2017 /  1:32 AM ", when the lawyer for the former campaign manager of president donald trump attacked the money laundering charge brought against his client as flimsy some legal experts say he may have pinpointed a potential weakness in the indictment by u s special counsel robert mueller paul manafort and his associate rick gates both pleaded not guilty on monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro russia former ukrainian president viktor yanukovich between  and  and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies partnerships and bank accounts in a court filing on thursday manafort defense lawyer kevin downing said the money laundering count the most serious facing his client with a  year maximum sentence was based on a tenuous legal theory tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former ukrainian leader downing did not respond to a request for comment mueller spokesman peter carr declined to comment the language of the filing and defiant statements downing made outside the courthouse following manafort s arraignment on monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges the first to be made public from mueller s probe into russian interference in the  presidential election the kremlin has denied meddling and trump has said there was no collusion neither trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on monday downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant according to an additional filing on friday manafort s virginia home was raided by federal bureau of investigation agents over the summer the money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of specified unlawful activity according to the manafort indictment the unlawful activity was his violation of the u s foreign agent registration act fara though the money laundering statute includes fara violations seattle tax lawyer john colvin said the charge against manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases it doesn t fit the normal paradigm of money laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking colvin said it seems like a stretch to me downing said in his thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating fara in the last  years producing only one conviction by pointing out the lack of previous fara prosecutions former federal prosecutor mark lee now a white collar defense lawyer in philadelphia said downing was likely trying to suggest manafort may not even have known he was violating the law the section cited by mueller requires the fara violation to be knowing and willful successfully casting doubt on whether manafort intentionally violated fara could knock out the money laundering charge lee said if you don t have a specific unlawful activity you can t by definition have a laundering said lee former federal prosecutor michael padula now a miami defense lawyer said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to promote an ongoing criminal enterprise that may be hard to show in the manafort case where the proceeds went to purchase real estate expensive suits and range rovers for the conspirator s personal use but other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding fara would gain much traction the idea that somebody of mr manafort s background and sophistication would not understand that if he did what he is alleged to have done he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government is i think laughable said chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor patrick cotter several lawyers noted that even without the money laundering counts mueller had strong charges based on the failure of manafort and gates to report their overseas accounts to the internal revenue service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence they also pointed out that mueller could add more charges at a later date it s an argument not a get out of jail free card said padula of downing s money laundering defense he s still got a tough road ahead of him ,US China Trade War,0.36653369665145874

12882,"  - Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada and faces possible extradition to the United States, is exploring a defense that claims U.S. charges against her are politically motivated, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on Monday. Meng, the chief financial officer of China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, is the central figure in a high-stakes dispute between the United States and China. Canada arrested Meng in December at the request of the United States and last month she was charged with wire fraud that violated U.S. sanctions on Iran. “The political overlay of this case is remarkable,” Richard Peck, lead counsel for Meng, told the Toronto newspaper in a telephone interview. “That’s probably the one thing that sets it apart from any other extradition case I’ve ever seen. It’s got this cloud of politicization hanging over it,” Peck added. The office of Canadian Justice Minister David Lametti said it could not speculate on Meng’s possible defences. “We are committed to a fair process unfolding before the courts and the steps undertaken by the Department of Justice Canada on this case have followed due process, in accordance with the Extradition Act, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and our Treaty with the United States,” a spokeswoman for Canada’s Department of Justice said in an e-mailed statement. Peck’s office did not respond to a request for comment. A Huawei spokesman declined comment. In December, U.S. President Donald Trump said in a Reuters interview he would intervene in the Justice Department’s case against Meng if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China. Canada fired John McCallum, its ambassador to China, in January after he said Meng could make a strong argument against being sent to the United States. “He [Mr McCallum] mentions some of the potential defenses - and certainly, I think any person that knows this area would see the potential for those defenses arising,” Peck told the Globe and Mail. Meng’s lawyers are also planning to challenge whether her alleged conduct would be deemed criminal under Canadian law, the Globe and Mail said.

12886,"WASHINGTON   - T-Mobile US Inc told the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Monday it would not increase prices for three years, with few exceptions, if it gets approval to buy rival Sprint Corp for $26 billion. In a letter to the FCC, T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere asked the government to move forward “expeditiously” in reviewing the merger of the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers, and attempted to allay fears the deal would mean higher prices. “While we are combining our networks over the next three years, T-Mobile today is submitting to the commission a commitment that I stand behind — a commitment that New T-Mobile will make available the same or better rate plans for our services as those offered today by T-Mobile or Sprint,” Legere wrote in the letter.  Consumer advocates have said that since Sprint and T-Mobile have a big market share in prepaid plans favored by the poorest wireless customers, they were likely to be disproportionately hurt by the planned deal.

The hearing is set for Feb. 13, and both Legere and Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure have agreed to testify.

12921,"MILAN   - An aging population and struggling state finances could turn into an unlikely boon for Italy’s banks, which have turned to a growing market for insurance to brighten their prospects. Intesa SanPaolo has marketed the move loud and clear since June last year, splashing white and green “Bank Insurance” stickers across its branches. The country’s biggest retail bank is leading a push to cross-sell to Italians who have traditionally shunned protection against medical bills or property damage, relying instead on their wealth, generous public health and tight family networks. That is changing, with shifts in society and state spending constraints expected to drive demand for property and casualty (P&C) insurance, an opportunity Italian banks can ill afford to miss. Battling loan losses and negative interest rates, Italian banks have also seen their asset management fees hurt by Italy’s latest economic woes, while technology is exposing the industry to outside competition in core areas such as payments. They have now identified a new potential source of revenues. Non-life insurance premiums accounted for 1.9 percent of Italy’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017, compared with 3.3 percent in France and Germany, industry lobby ANIA’s data shows. Excluding cars, where insurance is compulsory, premiums were 0.9 percent of Italian GDP versus 2.5 percent in Germany, even after the number of Italians with private health insurance more than doubled between 2010 and 2016, Professor Mario Del Vecchio of Milan’s SDA Bocconi said.   “We can see that some of our customers keep excess cash on their current accounts for rainy days ... we want them to understand they could invest some of it to buy protection,” Intesa Sanpaolo insurance head Nicola Fioravanti said. Although bank clients could find it useful to have a one-stop shop for both banking and insurance products, some have  raised questions about the potential for cross-selling as people move increasingly to mobile and online banking, while disputed insurance claims could also sour customer relationships. Intesa, which is already Italy’s biggest life insurer with 22.5 billion euros in gross premiums, flirted with taking over top insurer Generali in 2017 but it is now targeting its 12,000 customers and investing 300 million euros ($344 million) to move into segments like home and healthcare. It has trained 220 specialists to steer the business and retool 30,000 staff, aiming to become a leader in non-motor P&C by selling three contracts a day in each of its 4,400 branches. Its plan is to double the share of its clients who buy insurance products - known as its penetration rate - to 18 percent in three years’ time, boosting gross non-life premiums to 2.5 billion euros from 400 million in 2017.  “All insurers as well as other banks are watching Intesa’s moves very closely. ... There is room to expand the potential size of the market, it’s not a market share game,” said Emanuele Costa, Partner & Managing Director at Boston Consulting Group. MARKET SHAKE-UP  A top executive at another of Italy’s big banks, who asked not to be named, said it could follow Intesa’s lead in a few years to better serve its growing wealth management clientele.  The potential opportunity is attracting investors including billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate has built a 9 percent stake in insurer Cattolica and last month won a tender to take over small Genoa-based Faro, which is being liquidated. And Poste Italiane, which for years offered banking services through its network of almost 13,000 post offices, recently launched P&C policies to complement its life business. Meanwhile BPER Banca, which has a deal to sell products of its top shareholder insurer Unipol, recently revamped its bancassurance division and hired a former Munich RE executive to lead it. “It’s a natural move for banks looking to diversify,” said Diego Rossi, head of BPER’s Everyday Bank’s division.    “The need to buy protection is not keenly felt but that can also change quickly. Frequent earthquakes in recent years have made related insurance products hugely successful.”   Scale is key for the investment by Intesa and others to pay off, with a penetration rate of at least 10 percent of a bank’s client base estimated as necessary for the non-life business to be profitable. But relative to an insurer relying on a network of agents who are incentivised to sell life products due to the bigger upfront payment, a bank can set specific goals for its employees to sell casualty or property policies. Intesa clients told Reuters they had been offered insurance products, in one case in return for better terms on their current account. “They’re definitely very serious about it,” one said.

12937,"HONG KONG/TOKYO   - Japanese insurance companies have spent more than $50 billion on acquisitions over the past five years to become the world’s second-largest buyer of insurance assets, and the deals spree won’t be slowing down any time soon. The cashed-up insurers are expected to step up their hunt in new markets, with Asia, mainly China, at the top of their wish list, bankers and insurance sector sources said. Two sector giants - Nippon Life Insurance and Tokio Marine Holdings - said last month they were seeking more deals overseas, at a time when not many regional or global insurers have the appetite to splurge cash on assets. Japanese insurance firms have been busy scooping up assets in countries, from Australia to the United States, in the last few years, as they sought to cushion the impact of negative interest rates and a fast-maturing market at home. They struck M&A deals worth $6.1 billion last year, up 66 percent from 2017, Refinitiv data showed. Japanese insurers have spent $53 billion on deals since 2014, the second most by insurers of any country after the United States. The overseas push, however, largely excluded China, the world’s No.3 insurance market after the United States and Japan, due to foreign ownership curbs and fragile diplomatic relations between the two Asian economies. That will change with China set to allow foreigners to own majority stakes in domestic insurance joint ventures, and Beijing and Tokyo looking to forge closer business ties amid rising trade tensions with Washington, the bankers said. “Now finally with the easing of foreign shareholding, they would jump in,” said Linda Sun-Mattison, an Asian insurance analyst at Bernstein, referring to Japanese insurers. “China is probably the biggest opportunity in the life insurance sector.” (GRAPHIC: Acquisitions by Japanese insurance companies - tmsnrt.rs/2TofYEx)  China is in the process of easing foreign ownership curbs for life insurance joint ventures that will allow overseas firms to own 51 percent in those units compared to the current 50 percent. Foreign firms have already been allowed to operate wholly-owned non-life units in the country. Beijing has pledged to remove the foreign ownership limit in life insurance ventures completely in three years. In a sign of the growing interest in China, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, a unit of Japan’s MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc, agreed in May to buy Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s 37.5 percent stake in mid-sized BoComm Life for $477 million. Bankers who work with Japan insurers said firms including Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc and Sompo Holdings Inc were expected to step up their search for Chinese targets in the years ahead. “While you will see a few big deals happening in the U.S., the number of transactions will definitely be more in Asia ... where the Japanese insurers need to consolidate their position,” said a Hong Kong-based financials head at an investment bank. The banker said his firm was already working on a few possible acquisition deals by Japanese insurers in China. He declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media. “We do not have a plan in China during the current medium-term business plan period, but we will continue to study the market,” said a spokeswoman for Dai-ichi Life.  A Sompo spokesman said the company “will study strategies for emerging countries including China”. A Tokio Marine spokesman said: “At this moment, we have no deal decided in China.” A Nippon Life spokesman said the company is working to grow its Chinese joint venture Nissay-Greatwall Life Insurance.  Nippon Life and other Japan insurers including Tokio Marine that have operations in China have not been able to scale up there in competition with dominant local players and global rivals including Prudential and Sun Life. Top Chinese firms such as China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance Group collectively hold about 90 percent of the Chinese life insurance market. “China has not been an easy market for Japanese insurers, but it is a huge market still despite slower growth prospects,”     said Tokyo-based Goldman Sachs managing director Teppei Takanabe, who specializes in the financial sector. With a low life insurance market penetration of 3 percent of gross domestic product and a growing middle class, the easing of ownership curbs is set to make China the next battleground for insurers seeking growth outside their home markets. Fitch said in a December report that Japanese insurers’ M&A in the mature insurance markets of the United States, Britain and Australia would provide “only moderate growth”, forcing some of them to divest “unneeded” foreign units. For property-and-casualty insurers including Tokio Marine, Sompo and MS&AD, China’s opening up comes as they themselves are looking to diversify geographically. They are seeking income from new markets that can help offset the impact of enhanced payouts due to a series of natural disasters hitting Japan. As a result of the easing of foreign ownership rules in China, “we will not rule out the possibility of M&A deals by Japanese insurers, if they are looking for earnings growth and diversification in the longer term,” said Akane Nishizaki, associate director for insurance ratings at Fitch.

12966,"NEW YORK   - Delta Air Lines wants to sell its oil refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, after attempts to offer a partial stake in the plant late last year failed, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The Atlanta-based airline hired investment banks last year to organize the sale of a stake in its Monroe Energy refining subsidiary, signaling it wanted to share the risk of running an energy business. The offer failed to attract sufficient interest because a refinery on the East Coast is viewed as an undesirable asset given the rising costs of acquiring crude oil. The airline, the largest in the United States by market capitalization, now wants to sell the entire plant with an eye toward finding a buyer that would agree to a long-term contract with Delta to buy the plant’s jet fuel, the sources said.  Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant declined to comment on the potential sale and shift in strategy, but pointed to comments made by chief financial officer Paul Jacobson last month when asked for an update on the search for a partner in Monroe Energy. “We have continued with that process and have received some interest in having discussions with parties. There’s no update on the strategy broadly as we articulated,” Jacobson said in a January 15 earnings call. “We’re looking for ways to enhance the value and the strategic value to Delta of the refinery through a partnership and those discussions can be complicated,” he said.  The airline acquired the 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in 2012 for $150 million in a bet that it could lower its cost of jet fuel, among the highest expenses for any airline. The refinery also makes gasoline and diesel for profit. The U.S refining industry has been consolidating into larger players that can use scale to lower their cost of buying raw materials and paying for regular overhauls. This week, oil giant Chevron announced plans to buy a small Gulf Coast refinery to increase its crude processing capabilities.  Four refineries on the U.S. East Coast have closed in the past decade. East Coast refiners got a lifeline for a few years from the Bakken shale boom in North Dakota earlier this decade when high production forced producers to offer them steep discounts. The discounts have vanished in recent years as more pipeline capacity came online, however, reverting to the poor economics that hurt East Coast refiners a few years earlier. Delta has argued that keeping the refinery open by buying it was crucial. It said jet fuel prices would have risen across the Northeast if the facility had closed, hurting the airline’s results. More recently Delta has run the plant like a traditional refinery, choosing to make more of whatever refined product offered the highest margin.

12981,"  - Modernizing and maintaining the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the next 30 years will cost more than $1.2 trillion, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office. The report said current plans for the modernization of the aging planes, ships and missile silos that make up the U.S. nuclear arsenal would cost 50 percent more than if the U.S. only operated and maintained its current equipment in the field. The CBO study reviewed the Obama’s Administration’s plans for modernization of the nuclear arsenal. President Donald Trump in January directed Secretary of Defense James Mattis to conduct his own review the U.S. nuclear forces. The results could be published in the coming months.  U.S. House Armed Services Committee member Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, said of the Obama-era plan: “Congress still doesn’t seem to have any answers as to how we will pay for this effort, or what the trade-offs with other national security efforts will be.”  The report said costs would rise from $29 billion in 2017 to $47 billion in 2027, before peaking at around $50 billion a year through the early 2030s. Trump has said he wants to ensure the U.S. nuclear arsenal is at the “top of the pack,” saying the United States has fallen behind in its weapons capacity. U.S. officials have noted that America’s nuclear modernization is lagging behind Russia’s upgrade of its own nuclear triad. General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress in August he believed Moscow was already two-thirds of the way through its nuclear modernization process. In August, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue development work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system one leg of the nuclear triad.  Days later the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co separate $900 million contracts to continue work on a replacement for the AGM-86B air-launched nuclear cruise missile. That detailed development contract allows the companies to continue work on the long range standoff weapon yet another leg of the triad.

13158,"WASHINGTON   - Two units of China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd are to be arraigned on Feb. 28 in Seattle on a 10-count indictment on charges they conspired to steal T-Mobile US Inc trade secrets, according to court filings Tuesday. The Justice Department alleged that Huawei Device Co Ltd and Huawei Device USA Inc committed wire fraud and obstructed justice by stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile to test smartphones’ durability. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington said a corporate representative for Huawei would appear at the arraignment. Huawei did not immediately comment. Separately, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have also charged Huawei and its affiliates with bank and wire fraud on allegations that they violated sanctions against Iran. That separate 13-count indictment made public Monday. No arraignment date has been set in that case, which has added to Washington’s tensions with Beijing. T-Mobile had accused Huawei of stealing the technology, called “Tappy,” which mimicked human fingers and was used to test smartphones. Huawei has said the two companies settled their disputes in 2017. The charges add to pressure from the U.S. government on Huawei, the world’s biggest telecommunications equipment maker. Washington is trying to prevent American companies from buying Huawei routers and switches and pressing allies to do the same.

13195,"  - A U.S. judge rejected Yahoo’s proposed settlement with millions of people whose email addresses and other personal information were stolen in the largest data breach in history, faulting the Internet services provider for a lack of transparency. In a Monday night decision, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said she could not declare the settlement “fundamentally fair, adequate and reasonable” because it did not say how much victims could expect to recover. Yahoo, now part of New York-based Verizon Communications Inc, was accused of being too slow to disclose three breaches from 2013 to 2016 that affected an estimated 3 billion accounts. The settlement called for a $50 million payout, plus two years of free credit monitoring for about 200 million people in the United States and Israel with nearly 1 billion accounts. But the judge said the accord did not disclose the size of the settlement fund or the costs of the credit monitoring, and the proposed class may be too big because the number of “active” users that Yahoo disclosed privately to her was far lower. Koh also said the maximum $35 million of fees for the plaintiffs’ lawyers may be “unreasonably high,” saying the legal theories of the case were “not particularly novel.” A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. Verizon said: “While preliminary approval of the settlement was not granted, we’re confident that we can achieve a viable path forward.” Yahoo revealed the full scope of the breaches after having agreed in July 2016 in to sell its internet business to Verizon for $4.83 billion. The revelations prompted a cut in the purchase price to $4.48 billion. U.S. prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers in connection with one of the breaches in 2017. One hacker later pleaded guilty. Koh contrasted her decision with her approval last August of health insurer Anthem Inc’s $115 million settlement over data breaches affecting about 79 million victims.  The judge said Anthem, unlike Yahoo, timely disclosed the breaches, offered free credit monitoring even before settling, and committed to upgrading its data security.  “Yahoo’s history of nondisclosure and lack of transparency related to the data breaches are egregious,” Koh wrote. “Unfortunately, the settlement agreement, proposed notice, motion for preliminary approval, and public and sealed supplemental filings continue this pattern of lack of transparency,” she added.

13312,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Andrew Cawthorne CARACAS   - President Nicolas Maduro defended Venezuela’s “secure” election system on Tuesday as opponents struggled to present a united front over allegations of fraud in a nationwide vote surprisingly won by the ruling socialists.  Despite widespread anger over economic hardship, the Socialist Party confounded opinion polls to take 17 of 23 governorships in Sunday’s election.  Stunned by the defeat that undermines their aim to win the presidency in 2018, the opposition Democratic Unity coalition refused to acknowledge the results and called the election rigged, as did the United States. Though the coalition has complained of an unfair playing field - from abuse of state resources to last-minute moving of vote centers away from opposition strongholds - it has not given detailed evidence of ballot-tampering. Some opposition figures have acknowledged abstention by their supporters - disillusioned by the failure of street protests to dislodge Maduro earlier this year - was a big factor. Two losing opposition candidates, Henri Falcon in Lara state and Alejandro Feo La Cruz in Carabobo, have conceded defeat, breaking with the official coalition position. Both criticized “irregularities” in the vote but also lamented many demoralized opposition supporters stayed at home. “We need courage to recognize truth in adversity,” said Falcon. The strongest criticism of Sunday’s vote came from Washington, which slammed Maduro’s “dictatorship.” Several European nations also expressed concern, while 12 countries in the Americas from the so-called Lima Group condemned “obstacles, intimidation, manipulation and irregularities”. Washington is considering further sanctions on Venezuela, after various measures against top officials and the economy earlier this year, while the European Union is mulling the same. Government leaders have smarted at fraud accusations. “Venezuela’s election system is the most secure and audited in the world,” Maduro said on Tuesday. “President Donald Trump, I am not a dictator; I am a humble worker ... I have a moustache and look like Stalin, but I’m not him.” The Venezuelan leader invited EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to visit or receive him in Brussels to “open their eyes,” and told “stupid” Canada to stop meddling. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza later said on Twitter that Maduro had recalled Venezuela’s ambassador to Canada for talks. Heaping further humiliation on Venezuela’s opposition, the governors were due to be sworn in on Tuesday by a new legislative superbody elected controversially in July. The opposition boycotted that vote and has refused to recognize the entirely pro-government Constituent Assembly, which supersedes all institutions including the opposition-controlled congress. The opposition’s five governors-elect planned to boycott the swearing-in ceremony, defying Maduro’s threat to bar them from office for failing to accept the assembly as a higher authority. “We will not kneel to anyone,” said Juan Pablo Guanipa, who won the oil-rich western Zulia state.  Despite food shortages, runaway inflation and a tanking currency, Venezuela’s government retains significant bastions of support, especially in poorer, rural parts of the country. In his news conference, Maduro said the socialists also won Bolivar state, which would take its total to 18 governorships versus five for the opposition.  The government won a total of 54 percent of the votes overall, he added. The election board has not confirmed the Bolivar result or the overall vote figures. With the opposition coalition’s dozens of parties arguing over whether there was fraud, what went wrong, and where to go next, it will need to regroup and map strategy quickly heading into the 2018 presidential campaign. Its very future may even be in doubt, since many young activists who took to the streets for four straight months of protests and pitched battles with security forces earlier this year feel betrayed by their leaders. The unrest killed at least 125 people. Maduro has long accused opposition leaders of being behind violence, and on Tuesday called the new opposition governor of Zulia state a “fascist” while accusing his counterpart in Tachira of links to Colombian “paramilitaries.” The election aftermath appears to have sunk a government-opposition mediation effort that began last month in the Dominican Republic. Even though Maduro wants to resuscitate the talks, the opposition coalition has ruled that out. “We are the majority, the dictatorship is more-and-more illegitimate, popular and global condemnation grows daily against this regime,” it said in a communique late on Monday.

13398,"STUTTGART   - Daimler AG will deepen partnerships with Chinese auto suppliers since they often lead United States and European rivals in key technologies for electric cars and connected vehicles, Mercedes-Benz executive Wilko Stark said on Thursday.  Stark, who is currently head of Procurement and Supplier Quality at Mercedes-Benz said the shift toward electric and connected cars has made it more dependent on battery cell chemistry and connected vehicles expertise from outside the company. “We will think about partnerships in some areas. The role of partnerships as a whole will gain in importance,” Stark said during a news conference in Stuttgart to discuss the German carmaker’s procurement strategy. Mercedes-Benz will rely more on its suppliers to take a leading role in the area of research and development as well as to identify cost-cutting potential through process optimization, Stark said. “We will intensify scouting of Chinese suppliers. China is more advanced than the United States in many areas of digital innovation,” Stark said on Thursday.  “China will dramatically increase in importance,” Stark said referring to the raft of suppliers that Mercedes-Benz does business with.  China, a market where the luxury passenger car brand sold 674,125 cars last year, is setting the pace in terms of rolling out electric mobility and digital services like mobile phone-based payment systems, giving local suppliers an edge over European and United States competitors, Stark said. “In the area of connectivity services, the Chinese are ahead of the Americans; we have no choice but to deepen our relationship with these suppliers,” he said, naming China’s Alibaba and Tencent as leading players. Daimler is also thinking about a broader alliance on batteries in view of the challenge of trying to police potential ethical or human rights violations in mining of rare earth minerals - such as cobalt, which is often found in conflict zones, but is needed for electric car batteries. “But there are no formal decisions in this area,” Stark added. Mercedes is also scouting suppliers for innovations to see whether the German carmaker could make use of a more compact, lighter electric vehicle battery. Stark noted that denser, cheaper batteries with shorter recharging times could also allow Mercedes to bring down the cost of electric cars closer to their equivalent combustion-engined variants. “Overall volume and weight are as important as energy density,” Stark said, referring to battery cells.  By bundling orders for components for conventional and electric vehicles with the same supplier, Mercedes-Benz hopes to help its supplier base manage the transition between electric and non-electric cars. Separately, Stark said the replacement of Carlos Ghosn as Renault chairman will have no impact on an alliance between Renault and Mercedes. “We have a relatively stable cooperation and supply agreement with Renault-Nissan. This supply relationship is stable and will remain unchanged,” Stark said. Renault on Thursday appointed Michelin boss Jean-Dominique Senard as its new chairman after Carlos Ghosn was forced to resign in the wake of a financial scandal that has rocked the French carmaker and its partner Nissan.

13413,"FRANKFURT   - Deutsche Bank AG  has received an inquiry from two U.S. House of Representatives committees on the lender’s ties to President Donald Trump, it said on Thursday. Democrats now in control of the House had been working out which House panels would take the lead in investigating Trump’s business ties to Germany’s largest lender, lawmakers and aides familiar with the plans told Reuters last week. “The bank has received an inquiry from the House financial services and intelligence committees,” Deutsche Bank said in a statement. The committee leaders said in a joint statement Thursday that they were in talks with the bank and expect its cooperation in its inquiries. “The House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees are engaged in productive discussions with Deutsche Bank, and look forward to continued cooperation,” said Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Financial Services Committee Chairman Maxine Waters. Deutsche Bank said it is working with the two committees to “determine the best and most appropriate way of assisting them in their official oversight functions.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Since U.S. voters on Nov. 6 shifted majority control of the House from the Republicans to the Democrats, Democratic lawmakers have been promising to investigate the first two years of Trump’s administration and possible conflicts of interest presented by his hotel, golf course and other ventures. A 2018 financial disclosure form showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a unit of the German bank. They are for properties including the Trump International Hotel in a former post office in Washington. The Financial Services Committee has the broadest power to look into Trump’s relationship with Deutsche. When the Republicans still controlled the House, Waters tried in 2017 to request documents from the bank on its dealings with Trump and his businesses, as well as information about potential Russian money laundering through the bank. The bank told Congress that privacy laws prevented it from handing over such information without a formal subpoena and committee Republicans ignored Waters’ request.

13580,"NEW YORK   - The future of Sears Holdings Corp (SHLDQ.PK) and tens of thousands of its employees across the United States hung in the balance in the freezing pre dawn hours last Wednesday, as Wall Street lawyers and bankers sparred over the fate of the beleaguered retailer in a 50-story Manhattan office tower.  Working the phone from Miami, where he has an office and a 17,000-square-foot mansion, was Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert. The investor had to decide between boosting the $5 billion offer he had made a week earlier for most of the retailer’s remaining assets, or letting the 126-year-old company close its doors forever. A major sticking point: who would cover more than $200 million in costs that Sears had racked up since filing for bankruptcy in October. The company owed money for taxes and merchandise as well as fees charged by lawyers, bankers and other advisers. The advisers’ fees alone had eclipsed $20 million by the end of the November and were mounting with every billable hour. Sears did not have enough money to pay all of the expenses. Representatives for both Sears and Lampert occupied the 24th floor offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, the law firm retained by the company, in the General Motors Building near Central Park. They guzzled coffee like it was water to stay awake, some eating discarded food that was not necessarily theirs. After three days of round-the-clock negotiations, the conference rooms had begun to smell, one adviser said.   Time was running out. The auction Sears was holding as part of its bankruptcy proceedings had already blown past a midnight deadline set by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain. Besides Lampert, the only other bidders were either looking at small pieces of the company or vying to shut it down altogether and sell off its assets. Finally, at 2:30 a.m., in a conference room that had previously hosted discussions about the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers and General Motors, a deal was clinched. Lampert would pay more than $5.2 billion to rescue Sears, acquiring the company’s businesses and 425 stores and preserving about 45,000 jobs. It was the culmination of a battle - with Sears directors and advisers on one side and Lampert and his negotiators on the other - that had begun on the last Friday in December, when the billionaire, through his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, made an offer to take over the company. This account of those crucial three weeks, based on court documents, securities filings and interviews with nearly a dozen people familiar with the negotiations, shows how close Sears came to liquidation.  A Sears spokesman declined to comment, and a Lampert representative said he was unavailable for an interview. When Lampert combined Sears and rival chain Kmart almost 15 years ago, he heralded the formation of a retailer with more than $55 billion in annual sales, nearly 3,500 stores and more than 300,000 employees. But within a dozen years, annual revenues had plunged to $16.7 billion in the face of competition from the likes of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N). Lampert loaned Sears money over the years to keep it running, becoming the retailer’s largest creditor in addition to its biggest shareholder. Under his leadership, Sears also spun off clothing manufacturer Lands’ End, parted with 235 of its best stores for $2.7 billion to a company Lampert created called Seritage Growth Properties (SRG.N) and sold its Craftsman tools brand for $900 million. None of it worked. Sears has not turned a profit since 2010. In September, Lampert proposed a rescue plan, but a special committee of independent Sears directors spurned it. On Oct. 15, the storied retailer, which thrived with famous mail-order catalogs and once owned the tallest building in the world, filed for bankruptcy protection in White Plains, New York, federal court. Sears listed about $7 billion in assets, which included just under 700 stores. Liabilities were more than $11 billion, including $2.6 billion owed to Lampert. The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company by then employed about 68,000 people. Sears formed a restructuring committee of independent directors and appointed veteran turnaround specialist Mohsin Meghji as chief restructuring officer. They soon faced a difficult choice. On Dec. 28, Lampert came forward with a takeover offer: he would pay $4.4 billion to acquire various Sears businesses and 425 stores.  The offer would preserve up to 50,000 jobs. The company’s creditors, such as mall owners and vendors, pushed for liquidation, which would yield a pile of cash to pay the retailer’s bills, not to mention its debts to bankruptcy lenders.  The company faced a court-imposed Jan. 4 deadline to determine whether Lampert’s bid was good enough to compete in the looming auction. The deadline came and went. Sears directors and Lampert were at loggerheads. The retailer wanted another $80 million to cover bankruptcy expenses. Lampert refused. On Monday, Jan. 7, the deadlock appeared hopeless, said people involved in the discussions. Drain urged the two sides to keep negotiating, but talks into the night went nowhere.  Liquidation announcements were prepared by Sears and Lampert advisers, the people said. Sears tapped New Jersey-based Abacus Advisors Group LLC, whose chairman Alan Cohen was a longtime consultant to the company, to sell the chain’s vast inventories of tools, appliances and store fixtures. On Tuesday, Jan. 8, Drain delayed the start of a scheduled court hearing, allowing talks to continue. When it finally began, Ray Schrock, the Weil lawyer representing Sears, had an announcement: “We have what we believe is some very good news for Sears and its stakeholders,” he said.  Lampert had increased his bid to roughly $5 billion. He agreed to take on more than $600 million in additional Sears liabilities, mainly bills for merchandise and taxes, and employee severance benefits.  The following Monday morning, Jan. 14, advisers for Sears and Lampert entered the General Motors Building and rode elevators to Weil’s offices for the start of the auction with the recently enhanced bid in hand.   But that evening, Sears advisers at Weil’s offices made an aggressive move: a demand known in Wall Street deal negotiating parlance as “fill or kill.” The retailer wanted another $225 million to cover its bankruptcy costs, and Lampert needed to agree or abandon his takeover plan, people involved in the discussions said. “The goalposts have moved,” a lawyer for Lampert complained.  Nevertheless, the next morning, Lampert upped his bid. “This is not an ordinary moment,” said Sean O’Neal, a Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP lawyer representing Lampert. “The fate of an American icon and 50,000 employees hangs in the balance.”  The company rejected it, deciding the offer, though better, did not prove a better alternative to a liquidation, the people said. For the second time in a week, Sears prepared to go out of business.  That afternoon, Drain called. Cut a new deal, the judge told the advisers. Sears’ expenses did not necessarily have to be fully covered, he said. Drain set a midnight deadline. “You have no more time,” he said, citing rising Sears expenses. “There was a dying patient on the table,” said one adviser involved in the discussions. “Dr. Drain helped give it life.” The midnight deadline passed. Then Lampert placed a call to his team, people familiar with the development said. His advisers, including Kunal Kamlani, president at Lampert’s hedge fund, and Lawrence Chu, a Moelis & Co banker, soon had their breakthrough. Lampert would sweeten his bid by roughly $200 million. He agreed to take on one of the company’s bankruptcy loans, which debtors typically repay, in its entirety. He also kicked in extra cash. The $5.2 billion offer would free up yet more of Sears’ coffers for other expenses, including fees for advisers.  The new offer also resolved other contentious points. Lampert would be allowed to use $1.3 billion Sears owed him as currency in the offer, a maneuver known as a credit bid, which some creditors had opposed.  At 12:45 a.m., Schrock, the Weil lawyer for Sears, said the company’s board would consider the latest offer. At 2:30 a.m., he announced that Sears had accepted the bid.      Even then, some Sears directors had second thoughts, and discussions dragged another full day and night. Shortly after 3 a.m., on Thursday, Jan. 17, Sears approved Lampert’s takeover. The auction was over.

13609,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump’s tax reform plan came under new criticism on Tuesday from two towering Wall Street figures, including billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who called into question a Republican drive to slash the U.S. corporate rate.   With the White House and top Republicans in Congress already on the defensive over claims the plan would not cut taxes for many middle-class Americans, Buffett and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink suggested in separate interviews that the corporate rate may not have to be cut as deeply as proposed. “We have a lot of businesses... I don’t think any of them are non-competitive in the world because of the corporate tax rate,” Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), told CNBC. Fink said a corporate rate as high as 27 percent could satisfy U.S. businesses’ need for tax relief, while avoiding an increase in the federal deficit.  “What is being proposed is a pretty large expansion of our deficits,” Fink told Bloomberg TV. The Republican tax plan unveiled last month calls for slashing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from the current level of 35 percent, which many multinationals already avoid paying by taking advantage of abundant tax loopholes. The plan contains up to $6 trillion in tax cuts, according to independent analysts, which Trump and top Republicans say they would offset by eliminating loopholes, deductions and tax breaks and boosting annual economic growth. Hungry for legislative victory after repeated failures in their push to overturn Obamacare, many Republicans are now willing to accept a tax plan that raises the federal deficit, a fact that bothers some deficit hawks. “I feel like in some ways, since Election Day, we’ve moved into a party atmosphere. And that concerns me,” said Republican Senator Bob Corker, who has vowed not to vote for a tax bill that increases the deficit.  Republicans also insist that cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent will help workers by increasing jobs and raising salaries, though this claim is disputed by Democrats.    Senator Ron Wyden, the top Senate Democrat on tax policy, accused the Trump administration on Tuesday of removing a research paper from the U.S. Treasury’s website that showed workers would benefit only marginally from a corporate rate cut. “Apparently that mainstream economic analysis had to be purged because it basically didn’t jibe with the Trump team’s patter,” Wyden said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. A Treasury spokeswoman said the document was a dated analysis from the Obama administration that “does not represent our current thinking and analysis.”  An analyst who testified at the Senate hearing said only about 20 percent of the benefits of a corporate tax cut would directly help workers.  Buffett and Fink also criticized other Republican tax initiatives. Buffett said a proposal to repeal the estate tax would be “a terrible mistake” that would benefit the wealthiest Americans unnecessarily. Fink predicted tax legislation would not pass if it includes a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments.    “I don’t believe we’re going to get tax reform if there is the elimination of deductibility of state and local taxes,” he said.   Eliminating the state and local tax deduction would raise about one-quarter of the $4 trillion in revenues that some Republicans say they need to prevent tax cuts from creating a massive increase in the federal budget deficit. But eliminating that deduction is already opposed by Republican lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York and California, who say it helps their state governments pay for social programs, including public education.   House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady discussed the state and local tax deduction at dinner on Monday evening with about a dozen other House Republicans, including some New York lawmakers. At least one came away predicting there would be a compromise. “We kicked around six or eight or 10 different types of options,” Republican Representative Chris Collins, a staunch Trump ally from New York, told reporters.

13619,"FRANKFURT/LONDON   - Private equity firms Cinven and Advent have teamed up to bid in an auction that could value Nestle’s (NESN.S) skin health business at about 7 billion Swiss francs ($7 billion), three sources familiar with the matter said.  Private equity companies Blackstone (BX.N), KKR (KKR.N), Carlyle, CVC, EQT and Partners Group are also expected to bid and might look for partners, according to the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private. Nestle launched a review of the unit in September, as the maker of Nescafe coffee and Perrier water ditches underperforming businesses and fends off criticism from an activist investor who wants an overhaul. The fragmented consumer health sector is attractive for deals because of aging populations in many industrialized nations, increased interest in health and rising incomes, analysts say. Information memorandums on the skin health business sale, being run by Credit Suisse and Evercore, are expected to be sent by the end of January and first-round bids are likely to be submitted in early March, the sources said. Nestle and all the funds declined to comment. Merz Pharma, a private German company that sells wrinkle fillers and other skin treatments, has reached out to several private equity bidders to find a partner, the sources said. The move by Merz shows the strength of private equity in the auction, given they want the whole Nestle unit. Industry rivals are only expected to bid for parts of the business. Nestle Skin Health, which sells Cetaphil and Proactiv skin care products, Restylane wrinkle fillers and prescription dermatology medicines, had sales of 2.7 billion Swiss francs last year, accounting for about 3 percent of Nestle’s total. The sources said industry players which might take part in the auction included Beiersdorf (BEIG.DE), Allergan (AGN.N), Henkel (HNKG_p.DE), Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (JNJ.N), L’Oreal (OREP.PA), Pfizer (PFE.N) and Unilever (ULVR.L). They all declined to comment as well.  Sources previously estimated the unit could fetch 6 billion to 8 billion francs. On Monday, one source put the range at 7.5 billion to 8.5 billion francs, based on 2018 operating earnings of 500 million to 550 million francs. Another source said the price tag could reach more than 9 billion francs if the unit was broken up.   Nestle, the world’s largest packaged food maker, created the Skin Health unit in 2014 when it bought out L’Oreal’s stake in their Galderma joint venture. Under CEO Paul Bulcke, skin treatments were part of Nestle’s push into higher-growth health products to counter a slowdown in its traditional food business. But the unit has performed poorly, leading to one-off costs and restructuring.

13623,"DAVOS, Switzerland   - As central banks stock up on policy ammunition in the face of a worsening global economic outlook, they are having to reassess one of their most delicate weapons - the ‘forward guidance’ they use to flag their intentions to the markets. Forced to slash borrowing costs, in some cases below zero, to fight the global financial crisis, the big central banks relied heavily on verbal hints and signals to set expectations about the future path of rates. By promising to keep monetary conditions ultra-loose, they hoped to push down longer-term rates and spur growth. A decade on, they are again grappling for the right language as they wind down crisis-era measures while still facing an array of daunting risks, from the U.S.-China trade war to Brexit and slowing global growth. Conditions have not deteriorated to the point where central banks need to ponder reverting to extreme measures. The Fed can pause its rate hike cycle, the European Central Bank can go slow in raising rates and the Bank of Japan feels maintaining its current stimulus will be enough. But policymakers gathering in Davos for the World Economic Forum this week - including central bank chiefs Haruhiko Kuroda of Japan and Mark Carney of Britain - will be taking a hard look at what ammunition they have left to battle the next economic downturn. While shrugging off fears of an imminent global recession, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned policymakers on Monday to brace for a “serious slowdown” as trade protectionism, higher tariffs and financial market turbulence darken the outlook. “After two years of solid expansion, the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising,” Lagarde told reporters in Davos after the global lender cut its estimates for global economic growth this year and next. [L1N1ZL0BZ] The U.S. Federal Reserve has been weaning itself off forward guidance as it dials back crisis-mode policies, removing last year a phrase that policy will stay “accommodative” for some time. But other central banks, notably the BOJ, have been forced to maintain or even strengthen forward guidance to make up for a lack of alternative tools. Compared with other options, this  has the advantage that it only requires tweaking language. While central banks may eventually turn to radical means like quantitative easing (QE), depending on the severity of the situation, they could prepare such steps or complement them with forward guidance to buy time or maximize the stimulus effect. “Policymakers at both the Fed and the ECB will want to keep forward guidance as a tool of monetary stimulus in future,” said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, Macro Strategist at NatWest Markets. The BOJ could be among the major central banks most reliant on forward guidance. Already owning half of Japan’s government bond market, there are limits to how much more QE it can do. Rate cuts are also controversial as years of ultra-low rates have narrowed financial institutions’ margins, enough to draw concerns within the BOJ of the rising cost of prolonged easing. The BOJ could thus consider offering stronger forward guidance, such as binding itself to keep interest rates at current ultra-low levels until inflation approaches 2 percent, if it were to ramp up stimulus again, say sources familiar with the central bank’s thinking. “It’s definitely among tools the BOJ will consider when the economy is hit by a big shock,” one of the sources said, a view echoed by two other sources. Forward guidance could also come in handy for the ECB, as reverting to QE would be difficult given it has essentially run out of bonds to buy within its self-imposed role. The ECB has pledged to keep its deposit rate at minus 0.4 percent at least until the summer of 2019 but does not provide guidance beyond that. The likely response to any further economic slowdown would be to push out rate hike expectations even further, a relatively easy move. “Interest rate cuts and quantitative easing will likely remain the main instruments for reviving demand when the next recession strikes,” said Mohi-uddin of NatWest Markets. There is debate, however, on how well central bankers could steer market expectations without confusing investors. ECB President Mario Draghi sent bond yields soaring in September last year when he talked about a “vigorous” inflation rise, sparking expectations of an imminent lift-off. BOJ Governor Kuroda also jolted markets in late 2017 when he spoke of a “reversal rate,” or the rate at which the cost of easing exceeds the benefits, stoking fears his central bank would soon dial back stimulus. Market expectations on the Fed’s policy path whip-sawed after its chairman Jerome Powell gave conflicting signs on how quickly the Fed would hike rates and shrink its balance sheet. Striking the right balance between transparency and flexibility has also always been tricky. “Forward guidance is effective at times but not always. It needs to be realistic and credible. That’s not easy,” said Kazuo Momma, executive economist at Mizuho Research Institute and a former senior BOJ official with experience of drafting monetary policy. “It’s pretty hard to deal with various situations by forward guidance alone. If it’s too ambiguous, it doesn’t have punch. But if you’re too clear, the guidance could bind future policy.” Former BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai, who has worked with the IMF, said central banks need to be more creative on how to maximize the effect of forward guidance. “Forward guidance was effective after the Lehman crisis because it was something new and surprised people,” she said. “Now, everyone got used to it. That raises the hurdle for central banks to make forward guidance work.” Davos influence graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2HgY4lx ","As outlook darkens, central banks think hard about their language","January 21,

13625,"AMSTERDAM   - Tesla’s Model 3 has been given the green light to hit the road in Europe, clearing the final hurdle for the European introduction of the battery-powered sedan expected next month.  The Model 3 is a crucial project for Tesla as the U.S. electric vehicle maker known for its high-price luxury cars  tries to reach the mass market with a more affordable option.  The cheapest version of the Model 3 is on sale from 58,800 euros ($66,800), while the most basic version of the more exclusive Model S starts around 89,000 euros.   The Model 3 meets the requirements for approval on European roads, data published on the Netherlands Vehicles Authority’s (RDW) website showed. The RDW is one of the authorities in Europe tasked with licensing vehicles and vehicle parts. This stamp of approval comes at a pivotal time for Tesla, as it prepares for increasing competition, with established automakers planning to spend nearly $300 billion on electric vehicles and batteries in the coming years.

13638,"  - Following are five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. Another week closer to the date Britain leaves the European Union. Or are we? Given how crushingly Prime Minister Theresa May’s proposed Brexit agreement was defeated by lawmakers, there is little chance her Plan B — to be presented in coming days — will get away with just minor amendments. So markets now reckon the March 29 deadline will be extended to give parliament more time to negotiate the manner of exit or even to organize a second referendum.  The optimism has driven sterling to two-month highs against the dollar, with 4 percent-plus gains from Jan. 3 lows. Options markets too imply further pound strength over the three-month period that encompasses the deadline. Of course, market glee might be misplaced. If May fails to forge consensus within her party and with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and if parliament fails to agree an extension, Britain will crash out the EU without a deal. Corbyn wants a pledge from May to block a no-deal Brexit before joining cross-party talks, but May describes this as impossible. Her Plan B will be disclosed on Monday and voted on by parliament on Jan. 29. Sterling looks set for another volatile week. -UK in deadlock over Brexit ‘Plan B’ as May and Corbyn tussle - Better later: FX options signal more pound strength on Brexit delay signs - Brighter future for sterling seen if no-deal Brexit is averted Graphic: Sterling options - tmsnrt.rs/2T1hgW2 Data out on Monday showed China’s economy slowed in the fourth quarter, under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs. Growth for 2018 fell to its lowest in nearly three decades, putting pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a worse slowdown. Growing signs of weakness in China — which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years — are fuelling anxiety about risks to the world economy and weighing on profits for companies ranging from Apple to big carmakers. Other data just released shows investment and retail sales continued to languish, while the jobless rate edged higher. Beijing has offered a series of fiscal and monetary support measures. Unlike in 2015 or during prior slowdowns, the government has been careful to avoid simply throwing state money at the problem. As the Chinese proverb goes, mountains cannot turn, only rivers can. Be it household spending sops, tax cuts, infrastructure projects funded by local governments or money market operations, China seems determined not to turn its back on a commitment to deleveraging and market reform. That makes it difficult to say when the economy will rebound.  - WRAPUP 2-China’s 2018 growth slows to 28-year low, more stimulus seen -China cbank’s record $83 bln injection heightens worries over ailing economy – -China to set lower GDP growth target of 6-6.5 pct in 2019 – sources- Graphic: China GDP, exports, markets - tmsnrt.rs/2HhZgp3 3/DRAGHI-ING ON ECB bond-buying is officially over, but with economic data and inflation both continuing to underwhelm, the central bank has little time to relax.

This year though, with a government in shutdown, President Donald Trump has canceled Mnuchin’s Switzerland trip.   Trump is also economizing in other ways, including buying MacDonalds’ burgers for White House visitors. But anxiety is growing over how much the shutdown could hit U.S. growth and to what extent it will filter through to already stuttering world growth. So far, damage looks limited — jobless claims have continued to fall and the Philly Fed business outlook survey was above forecast.  But the longer it continues, the worse it gets. Not only are 800,000 government workers going without pay, a delay to tax refunds for other citizens will hit companies that rely on consumer spending. The government has until early March before the debt ceiling kicks in. It could then also miss some social security payments. But the Democrat-controlled House shows no sign of agreeing Trump’s demands for $5.7 billion to fund a border wall. And a House vote to fund the government through Feb. 28 was postponed to the coming week. Mnuchin meanwhile has declined to testify to the House about how the shutdown may affect the upcoming tax filing season. - On Day 28, no sign of end to U.S. partial government shutdown    - Shutdown clouds outlook for consumer-driven U.S. economic growth   - Treasury’s Mnuchin declines to testify before House panel on shutdown   Graphic: U.S. government shutdowns - tmsnrt.rs/2ASK2RN Yes, it is that time of year again!

13642,"PARIS   - Casino (CASP.PA) has agreed to sell 26 stores worth 501 million euros ($567 million) to Fortress Investment Group, the French supermarket retailer said on Monday, fulfilling an assets sale target set out last year as part of plans to reduce its debt. Casino said it would sell a portfolio comprising hypermarkets and traditional supermarkets to Fortress which will set up a vehicle to acquire and manage the assets. The company will receive an initial 392 million euros from the sale in the first half of 2019 and could get a further 150 million euros in the next few years, it said. The deal will allow Casino to achieve a target set out last year of 1.5 billion euros in asset sales and Casino said it would examine further steps to cut its debt. Casino shares were up 0.4 percent in early trade. “Their rapid execution on their disposal plan is to be commended,” wrote analysts at Bernstein, although Bernstein kept an “underperform” rating on Casino shares.  Casino had its credit rating cut to ‘junk’ by Standard & Poor’s in March 2016. Its shares fell nearly 30 percent in 2018, partly on concerns over its balance sheet and parent group Rallye’s (GENC.PA) ability to refinance its debt. However, the stock has risen by around 10 percent in 2019, helped by resilient sales figures last week which showed fourth quarter revenue of 9.9 billion euros that came in above market forecasts. Casino also said it would stick to its overall 2018 financial targets, even though revenue growth slowed slightly in the fourth quarter as anti-government protests in France impacted sales at its Geant hypermarkets.

13650,"LONDON   - The European Central Bank holds its first meeting of the year on Thursday as concern grows about weak economic growth at home and risks abroad from global trade tensions and Brexit. Having ended its stimulus scheme in December, ECB chief Mario Draghi is likely to be pressed on how the central bank will address further economic weakness. Here are some of the key questions on the radar for markets. 1. Will the ECB change its assessment of the risks facing the economy? A string of disappointing data, notably from powerhouse economy Germany, suggests a slowing of growth momentum is perhaps deeper than anticipated.  Draghi said last week the slowdown could last longer than expected and that the economy still needed support. But he added that the bloc was not heading for a recession. In December, the ECB tweaked its statement to reflect increased economic worries but kept a reference to balanced risks. Economists expect that wording to remain in place this week and add that a shift to say the balance of risks to growth points down is more likely in March, when the next set of economic forecasts are due.  While some argue that the balance of risk assessment could be downgraded, if this was done, markets would look for a policy response and none will come. So, the argument against changing the assessment is to keep expectations muted. For an interactive version of the chart below, click here tmsnrt.rs/2HmeskS. Graphic: German data disappoints - tmsnrt.rs/2Hm6jwL 2. What about the guidance that rates will stay on hold through the summer. Could that change? No immediate change is expected this week, but the rate guidance is clearly in focus given weak data and concern about the impact of developments outside the bloc such as a Chinese slowdown and Brexit. A government shutdown could also hurt the U.S. economy, adding to global growth worries.  Since the ECB last met, markets have reassessed the rates outlook for major central banks. Bets on U.S. rate hikes this year have been priced out. Euro zone money market pricing suggests investors do not expect the ECB to lift rates until well into 2020. In December, a 10 bps hike this year was anticipated. Economists have also shifted their views: ABN AMRO believes the ECB will signal that rates will be left on hold through 2019 by the June meeting. HSBC does not expect any change in the ECB’s deposit rate until at least the end of 2020.     Graphic: When will the ECB raise interest rates? tmsnrt.rs/2AQmxc2     3. When does the ECB expect inflation to move higher?     Easing inflation complicates the ECB’s rate-hike plan. Inflation in the bloc eased more than expected in December to 1.6 percent, moving away from the ECB’s just-under 2-percent target. Some comfort for the ECB, and perhaps something Draghi may focus on if questioned about inflation, is the pick-up in underlying price pressures as wage growth increases.  A dip in euro zone inflation and growth was anticipated so it is not enough to unravel expectations of a rate hike, Sabine Lautenschlaeger, the most prominent hawk on the ECB Executive Board, said in an interview last week.     Graphic: Easing inflation complicates ECB's rate hike plan - tmsnrt.rs/2AQuG03   4. Has the weak data encouraged the ECB to start discussing new multi-year loans to banks? Minutes from the ECB’s last meeting showed policymakers are likely to debate new multi-year loans to banks, a potent stimulus tool, in coming months as they navigate a “fragile and fluid” global context. Investors are keen for details on what a new set of loans to banks may look like. That means a question on new bank loans may  come up at the press conference even if analysts say it’s still early days for the ECB to give any details. The multi-year loans inject liquidity into the financial system by giving incentives to commercial banks to lend to companies and consumers. The previous four-year TLTROs expire in mid-2020 and lenders will need to start deciding about a year before their maturity on how to replace them.  Graphic: Gap between euro corporate bond and benchmark government yields - tmsnrt.rs/2RTOqcB   5. Is the ECB prepared for a no-deal Brexit? Britain’s March 29 deadline for leaving the European Union is fast approaching, but Prime Minister Theresa May’s exit deal has just suffered a resounding defeat in parliament. While a high degree of uncertainty remains, concerns about the UK leaving the EU without a deal have eased.  Risk reversals in the British pound suggest currency markets are less worried about prospects of a no-deal Brexit. While the popular market gauge, which shows the ratio of calls to puts on a particular currency, still highlights caution, it has recovered from the extreme bearishness on the pound in November. The financial sector is prepared to cope with any fallout from a no-deal Brexit, the ECB’s Francois Villeroy de Galhau said last week. “Draghi may be asked about what the ECB would do in the event of a no deal,” said Frederik Ducrozet, a strategistat Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva.  “...The path of least resistance would be to use the forward guidance to not hike rates this year at the minimum.” Graphic: Sterling risk reversals - tmsnrt.rs/2Hhc4vS ",Data dependent?

13663,"TOKYO   - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Panasonic Corp (6752.T) are set to launch a joint venture next year to produce batteries for electric vehicles (EV) in an effort to compete with Chinese rivals, a source familiar with the matter said. The joint venture, to be owned 51 percent by Toyota and the rest by Panasonic, could also provide batteries to Toyota’s EV technology partners Mazda Corp (7261.T) and Subaru Corp (7270.T), the source said on Sunday. The source declined to be identified because the talks on the joint venture are private. A joint venture would build on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement. A Toyota spokesman said the two companies have been working on the battery partnership announced in 2017 and declined to comment further. Panasonic made the same comment in a statement. The two companies may announce the joint venture plan as early as this week, according to the source. The battery joint venture will help Toyota achieve an annual sales target of around 1 million zero-emission battery EVs and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) by 2030. It will also give Panasonic cost and scale advantages in battery production at a time when China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (300750.SZ) has grown to be on par with the long-time industry leader on the back of the rapidly growing home market. Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) current production models, could also reduce its heavy reliance on the U.S. EV maker whose production delays  previously weighed on the Japanese company’s earnings. Panasonic is set to lose its exclusivity as Tesla plans to source cell production locally at a new auto plant in Shanghai, “most likely from several companies” including Panasonic, Elon Musk, Tesla chief executive, tweeted in November. The reported joint venture plan boosted shares of Panasonic by as much as 4 percent on Monday, whereas Toyota shares were almost flat. Under the planned joint venture, Panasonic would shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for Tesla will remain under the company, the source said. Panasonic already makes prismatic batteries for Toyota, whereas for Tesla it makes cylindrical batteries of a type similar to those used in laptops. It’s not clear yet how Panasonic would supply its prismatic batteries to other automotive clients, which include Honda Motor (7267.T) and Ford Motor (F.N).

13667," (This Jan 18 story was refiled to delete extraneous wording in paragraph 15) By Michael Martina and Chris Prentice BEIJING/WASHINGTON   - The United States is pushing for regular reviews of China’s progress on pledged trade reforms as a condition for a trade deal - and could again resort to tariffs if it deems Beijing has violated the agreement, according to sources briefed on negotiations to end the trade war between the two nations. A continuing threat of tariffs hanging over commerce between the world’s two largest economies would mean a deal would not end the risk of investing in businesses or assets that have been impacted by the trade war. “The threat of tariffs is not going away, even if there is a deal,” said one of three sources briefed on the talks who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity. Chinese negotiators were not keen on the idea of regular compliance checks, the source said, but the U.S. proposal “didn’t derail negotiations.” A Chinese source said the United States wants “periodic assessments” but it’s not yet clear how often. “It looks like humiliation,” the source said. “But perhaps the two sides could find a way to save face for the Chinese government.” The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed import tariffs on Chinese goods to put pressure on Beijing to meet a long list of demands that would rewrite the terms of trade between the two countries.  The demands include changes to China’s policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers. An enforcement and verification process is unusual for trade deals and is akin to the process around punitive economic sanctions such as those imposed on North Korea and Iran. Disputes over trade are more typically dealt with through courts, the World Trade Organization (WTO) or through arbitration panels and other dispute settlement mechanisms built into trade agreements. Trump’s team has criticized the WTO for failing to hold China accountable for not executing on promised market reforms. The U.S. has also criticized the WTO’s dispute settlement process and is seeking reforms at the organization. (For an explainer on how the U.S.-China talks differ from any other trade negotiation, see: ) Regular reviews would be one potential solution to address a demand from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for ongoing verification of any trade pact between the two countries, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. The threat of tariffs would be used to keep reform on track, the sources said. Lighthizer is leading negotiations with China. A USTR spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of regular assessments. The idea of quarterly reviews was part of a U.S. negotiating document leaked after talks in May 2018, before the United States had slapped its first round of duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. The renewed focus on regular reviews in current negotiations - this time carrying the threat of tariffs - underscores the growing distrust between the two countries. The extra scrutiny is needed and should be based on clear benchmarks - with consequence for failing to meet them, said Erin Ennis, Senior Vice President of the U.S.-China Business Council, a trade group representing American companies doing business in China. “It needs to be tied to removing or reducing the tariffs,” Ennis said. “If China can show compliance through a process like this, it would also be a trust-building measure for both sides.”  Trump’s administration has accused China of repeatedly failing to follow through on previous pledges to implement reforms sought by the United States. Washington often cites as an example the difficulties still faced by foreign payment card operators in entering China’s market despite a 2012 WTO ruling that Beijing was discriminating against them. A separate industry source said it is likely that different agreement on separate issues - forced technology transfer, intellectual property, changes to China’s legal system - would require separate verification processes, all of which will need to be hammered out by negotiators. “The challenge of verification and enforcement stems from the fact that China has made promises it hasn’t kept,” the source said. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce in the trade war in December to give their teams time to negotiate a deal. Nearly 50 days later, there is little sign that China will make the concessions the U.S. is seeking.

13706,"NEW YORK   - World stock indexes jumped on Friday, with Wall Street posting a fourth straight week of gains, and the dollar had its first positive week since mid-December as optimism increased that an end is in sight to the U.S.-China trade conflict. Stocks were boosted by a Bloomberg report that said China sought to raise its annual goods imports from the United States by more than $1 trillion in order to reduce its trade surplus to zero by 2024. That followed a report on Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was considering lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. The Treasury denied Mnuchin had made any such recommendation. While the equity rally lifted all major sectors, trade-sensitive industrials .SPLRCI posted among the biggest S&P 500 sector gains, up 1.9 percent on the day. The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index .SOX rose more than 2 percent and Germany's exporter-heavy DAX .GDAXI was up 2.6 percent. “There seems to be some progress going in the trade negotiations,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. While that was the biggest influence, “we’ve still got momentum since the first of the year,” he said. “Some of the money that came out of the market at year-end, whether it was high frequency traders or tax-loss selling, is coming back in.” Adding to strength in equities and supporting U.S. Treasury yields was data that showed U.S. manufacturing output increased the most in 10 months in December.  Some strategists said relatively light equity trading volume this week indicated that some investors were still waiting on the sidelines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 336.25 points, or 1.38 percent, to 24,706.35, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 34.75 points, or 1.32 percent, to 2,670.71 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 72.77 points, or 1.03 percent, to 7,157.23. The S&P 500 registered its biggest four-week percentage gain since October 2011. The index is now 8.9 percent below its Sept. 20 record close after dropping 19.8 percent below that level - near the 20-percent threshold commonly considered to confirm a bear market - on Christmas Eve. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 1.80 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 1.23 percent. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for another round of talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies. Recent indicators show signs that the Chinese economy is losing momentum. The trade optimism boosted the dollar against other major currencies. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.31 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.26 percent to $1.1365. U.S. Treasury yields rose to three-week highs as investors piled back into Wall Street. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.7878 percent, compared with 2.747 percent late on Thursday. Oil prices jumped about 3 percent, rising after OPEC detailed specifics on its production-cut activity to ease global oversupply.

13762,"  - The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s acting director on Tuesday said that he will be leaving his post, two months after he criticized Republican President Donald Trump for telling law enforcement officers not to be “too nice” to suspects. Acting Director Chuck Rosenberg, a holdover from Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, told the agency’s staff in an internal email that he will be leaving his position effective Oct. 1. “This is a remarkable agency - full of remarkable people - and I am honored to have been a small part of it,” Rosenberg said in the message, which was reviewed by Reuters. It was unclear who would replace Rosenberg. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.  A spokesman for the DEA confirmed Rosenberg’s resignation. Rosenberg had been leading the DEA in an acting capacity since 2015. Before joining the agency, he served as chief of staff to former FBI director James Comey, who Trump fired in May.  Rosenberg generated headlines earlier this year after he wrote an agency-wide email in late July challenging comments by Trump suggesting officers do away with practices like protecting the head of a suspect being put into a patrol car. Citing “an obligation to speak out when something is wrong,” Rosenberg said Trump’s remarks, delivered in New York the previous day, “condoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement.” He leaves the agency at a time when the DEA is grappling with the ongoing opioid drug epidemic, which has become a major law enforcement focus of the U.S. Justice Department. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Opioids such as heroin and fentanyl - and diverted prescription pain pills - are killing people in this country at a horrifying rate,” Rosenberg said in December. “We face a public health crisis of historic proportions.” ",U.S. drug enforcement chief to step down from agency,"September 26, 2017 /  10:54 PM ", the u s drug enforcement administration s acting director on tuesday said that he will be leaving his post two months after he criticized republican president donald trump for telling law enforcement officers not to be too nice to suspects acting director chuck rosenberg a holdover from democratic president barack obama s administration told the agency s staff in an internal email that he will be leaving his position effective oct  this is a remarkable agency full of remarkable people and i am honored to have been a small part of it rosenberg said in the message which was reviewed by  it was unclear who would replace rosenberg the news was first reported by the washington post a spokesman for the dea confirmed rosenberg s resignation rosenberg had been leading the dea in an acting capacity since  before joining the agency he served as chief of staff to former fbi director james comey who trump fired in may rosenberg generated headlines earlier this year after he wrote an agency wide email in late july challenging comments by trump suggesting officers do away with practices like protecting the head of a suspect being put into a patrol car citing an obligation to speak out when something is wrong rosenberg said trump s remarks delivered in new york the previous day condoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement he leaves the agency at a time when the dea is grappling with the ongoing opioid drug epidemic which has become a major law enforcement focus of the u s justice department opioids including prescription painkillers and heroin killed more than   people in the united states in  more than any year on record according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention opioids such as heroin and fentanyl and diverted prescription pain pills are killing people in this country at a horrifying rate rosenberg said in december we face a public health crisis of historic proportions ,US China Trade War,0.28055939078330994
13800,"BUENOS AIRES   - Like many Argentine businessmen, Marco Meloni is doing everything he can to avoid laying off staff at his textile factory despite a slump in sales, more than 70 percent interest rates and soaring utility bills. The reason? He doesn’t have the money to fire anyone. A little-reported and unusual feature of the economic crisis gripping Latin America’s third-largest economy is the absence of many workers losing their jobs. Small businesses, the biggest employer in Argentina, have been hardest hit by inflation that is nearly 48 percent, a tumbling peso, and major cuts to subsidies for public utilities that have sharply increased companies’ operating costs. But the unemployment rate has barely budged from 9 percent. Reuters interviews with business owners in textile, plastic, clothing and paint industries, government officials and union leaders show that many firms are adopting different strategies to try to survive until the economy begins to recover, which the International Monetary Fund expects to begin in the second quarter. Firms are reducing working hours, halting production on some days, cutting shifts and making workers take their vacations now in anticipation of more customer demand once the economy lifts.  The workforce contracted by just 120,000 registered workers between October 2017 and October 2018, the latest government data reviewed by Reuters shows. That represents about 1 percent of the 12 million-strong labor force. In contrast, the United States lost about 6 percent, or some 8.7 million people, of its workforce during the two years of the 2007/08 Great Recession as companies laid off workers to stay afloat. Argentina has some of the world’s most generous labor laws and they are making it more difficult for small business owners like Meloni to adapt to an economy now in recession. Typically in a tough economic climate a company might be expected to reduce its workforce to cut costs. But in Argentina taking that step could dramatically increase costs and potentially push a company into bankruptcy. Introduced by successive populist Peronist governments since the 1940s, the labor laws make the country one of the most expensive in Latin America to employ, or fire, a worker. Argentine companies are required to pay workers laid off a month for every year of service plus at least one additional month simply for informing them they are being fired. And crucially, there is no cap on how much a company needs to pay.  In contrast, neighboring Chile has a cap on severance pay. Layoff costs in Argentina are among the highest in the world, according to the World Bank’s Doing Business project, which measures business regulations in 190 economies. The Argentine labor laws have helped to contain what could have been a big increase in the unemployment rate. In addition, President Mauricio Macri, a free marketer who wants to reform the country’s rigid labor system to encourage foreign investment, is taking steps to dissuade companies from firing workers. He announced on Nov. 13 that companies must give 10 days’ notice of any plans to lay off workers so that the government can help find ways to keep them employed. Macri wants to expand an existing program that helps to subsidize salaries of workers at companies that can show they are in financial straits. The government has not yet issued any regulations to enforce its announcement, so it is not clear whether companies are informing them of pending dismissals.    Like many small businessmen, Meloni has found himself caught in a vice. Sales from his plant in the town of Quilmes, 30 km (19 miles) outside the capital Buenos Aires, shrank by just over one third last year as Argentina’s economy sank deep into recession. “It was not a storm,” said Meloni, a reference to how the country’s president has described the economic crisis. “It was a tsunami. The tsunami kills.”  Meloni said the plant, which makes fabrics, used to operate 24 hours a day from Monday to Saturday but now just operates 16 hours a day, five days a week. Like many other businesses, Meloni advanced the holidays to his roughly 100 employees with the hope that once summer ends in March, demand will pick up. Daniel Funes de Rioja, the head of one of Argentina’s biggest labor law firms, said a major issue for companies was the seniority of many workers. Many, especially in low-skilled industries, stay in the same job for years, so paying them severance becomes very expensive. “There’s a cultural custom for Argentines to remain in their jobs but also, as it has been always very expensive to fire people, that has extended the length of service of the workers in the companies,” explained economist Camilo Tiscornia, from Buenos Aires-based C&T consultancy.  Production Minister Dante Sica said companies were also reluctant to fire workers because of forecasts showing an economic recovery around the corner.  “They prefer to suspend and not fire because of the cost of layoffs, plus the cost of hiring is costly,” Sica said in an interview. The unemployment rate in Argentina fell to 9 percent in the third quarter from 9.6 percent in the second quarter. Year on year, it increased only 0.7 basis points from the third quarter of 2017, when the economy was growing at an annual rate of 3.8 percent. While workers are staying in their jobs they are earning less because of the shorter hours and fewer shifts. Some have resorted to taking second jobs, working for Uber, the ride hailing app, for example, according to anecdotal reports. “We are not happy with these measures at all (fewer shifts, shorter hours), but the last thing we want is layoffs,” said Jose Minaberrigaray, head of Setia, a textile workers union that represents 25,000 workers. “But we have to choose what is bad and what is worse,” he told Reuters. Macri has pushed for labor reforms to make it easier for companies to hire and fire, but his government has delayed implementing them after protests in December 2017. Sica, the production minister, has said they will try again in 2019 but it will be difficult to get political support for the reforms in an election year. Tiscornia, the economist, said the difficulty in firing workers ultimately hurt the competitiveness of Argentine companies. “Making it easier to fire people or to reduce salaries improves the economy efficiency and the companies’ capacity to adjust to different situations,” he said. “In the U.S. it’s tremendously easy to fire but at the same time they are at the lowest historic jobless rate because that market has very strong flexibility. That favors the creation of new companies. Here if you start a business and it doesn’t work, you are stuck with the employees, so you don’t even try.”  At the metallurgical company where Pablo Mansur, 31, works, production has fallen 30 percent over the last 12 months. To keep busy, workers are painting, cleaning and doing repairs, Mansur said. Workers were also told to take their vacations in December, a period when production would be low any way because of public holidays. He said workers agreed to this because “we are aware of the reality. It is not a whim,” he said. Jorge Göttert, president of Göttert, a 75-year-old company that makes production line systems for the wood and auto sectors, says he has tried not to lay off workers because of his memories of what happened during the country’s worst financial crisis in 2001. Then, the company laid off half of its staff to try to survive. When the economy rebounded, however, it “became very difficult for us” as it took time to rebuild its workforce, training new workers to operate the specialized machinery. “We think this crisis will be shorter this time.” ","In Argentina crisis, firms do everything to cut costs - except fire workers","January 17, 2019 /  12:29 PM ",buenos aires like many argentine businessmen marco meloni is

13817,"TAIPEI/SHANGHAI   - One of China’s top government-linked think tanks has called out Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and other foreign companies for not referring to Hong Kong and Taiwan as part of China in a report that provoked a stern reaction from Taipei. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) said in a report this month that 66 of the world’s 500 largest companies had used “incorrect labels” for Taiwan and 53 had errors in the way they referred to Hong Kong, according to China’s Legal Daily newspaper. It said 45 had referred to both territories incorrectly. Beijing considers self-ruled Taiwan a wayward province of China and the former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and operates as a semi-autonomous territory. China last year ramped up pressure on foreign companies including Marriott International and Qantas for referring to Taiwan and Hong Kong as separate from China in drop down menus or other material. The report was co-written by CASS and the Internet Development Research Institution of Peking University. An official at the Internet Development Research Institution told Reuters that it had not yet been published to the public and declined to provide a copy. A spokesman for Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan would not bow to Chinese pressure.   “As for China’s related out-of-control actions, we need to remind the international community to face this squarely and to unite efforts to reduce and contain these actions,” Alex Huang told reporters in Taipei. Beijing has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since Tsai, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016.  That has included rising Chinese scrutiny over how companies from airlines, such as Air Canada, to retailers, such as Gap, refer to the democratic island in recent months. Nike Inc, Siemens AG, ABB, Subaru and others were also on the list. Apple, Amazon, ABB, Siemens, Subaru and Nike did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.

13822,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to move ahead with tariffs on imported vehicles, a move that could prompt the European Union to agree a new trade deal, said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley on Wednesday. “I think the president’s inclined to do it,” the Republican senator told reporters. “I think Europe (is) very very concerned about those tariffs ... It may be the instrument that gets Europe to negotiate.” U.S. Commerce Department recommendations into whether Trump should impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts on national security grounds are due by mid-February. A Commerce Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Grassley, who has had regular talks with Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on trade issues, said he did not like new tariffs but “they are a fact of life when Trump is in the White House.” He said they may have been an “effective tool” in getting China, Canada, Mexico and others to negotiate on trade. Iowa senator Grassley also wants the EU to agree to include agricultural issues in trade talks, although EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström said last week the 28-country bloc could not negotiate on agriculture. The White House has pledged not to move forward with imposing tariffs on the European Union or Japan as long as it is making constructive progress in bilateral trade talks. Trump has urged the EU to drop its 10 percent tariff on imported vehicles. The U.S. passenger car tariff is 2.5 percent, while it imposes 25 percent tariffs on pickup trucks. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose new auto tariffs. “Cars is the big one,” Trump said last year. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office last week published its objectives for EU talks, including seeking comprehensive agriculture access. The prospect of 25 percent tariffs sent shockwaves through the auto industry, with U.S. and foreign-brand producers lobbying against it. German automakers met with Trump in December to urge him not to impose tariffs. On Monday, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) said it would invest $800 million in its Chattanooga, Tennessee operations and add 1,000 jobs to build electric vehicles. That drew praise from Trump.  Automakers say imposing 25 percent tariffs would raise cumulative prices for U.S. vehicles by $83 billion annually and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. They argue there is no evidence auto imports pose a national security risk. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose members include General Motors Co <GM.N)>, VW and Toyota Motor Corp, warned tariffs would boost imported car prices by nearly $6,000 on average. Earlier this week, Senators Doug Jones and Lamar Alexander re-introduced legislation to delay any 25 percent auto tariff and require the International Trade Commission to conduct a comprehensive study before tariffs could be applied.

13823,"WASHINGTON   - Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and affiliate Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS) said on Wednesday they will recall about 168,000 U.S. vehicles at risk of fuel leaks, after recalling them in 2017 for engine fire risks, and will offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles. A high-pressure fuel pipe may have been damaged or improperly installed as part of an engine replacement during the prior recall, and that installation could increase the risk of fire, the companies said.  The Korean automakers said the software update aims to protect the vehicles from internal damage, and they will also offer new extended warranties for engine issues. The “knock sensor” software detects vibrations indicating the onset of excessive wear on the connecting rod bearing. Kia said that 20 percent of the vehicles involved have already received the update. The new recall covers 68,000 various Kia Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles from the 2011 through 2014 model years, while Hyundai said it affects 100,000 2011-2014 Hyundai Sonata and 2013-2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport vehicles. Kia said six fires are linked to the new recall but no reports of injuries, while Hyundai said it had no reports of fires linked to the new recall. In May 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the recalls of nearly 1.7 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over engine defects. In November 2018, Reuters reported that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Korean auto affiliates Hyundai and Kia reut.rs/2VVMwYm to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects were conducted properly, citing a person with knowledge of the matter and documents. The companies declined to comment. A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three U.S. recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles. In 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 U.S. Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash. At the time, Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same “Theta II” engines. In March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with “Theta II” engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris. On the same day, Kia also recalled 618,000 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles, all of which use the same engine. The recall, which was also conducted in Canada and South Korea, cost the automakers an estimated 360 billion won ($319.3 million). The nonprofit Center for Auto Safety in October called for the immediate recall of another 2.9 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over engine fire risks. A NHTSA spokeswoman declined to comment because of the partial U.S. government shutdown. The auto safety agency is not reviewing recall submissions or posting new recall campaigns on its website.

13841,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump is considering a new order to replace his soon-to-expire travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries that would be tailored on a country-by-country basis to protect the United States from attacks, U.S. officials said on Friday. With the current ban on people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen due to expire on Sunday, Trump was given recommendations by Elaine Duke, the acting homeland security secretary, but has not yet made a decision on the details of any new order, the officials told reporters. Miles Taylor, counselor to Duke, said she recommended to Trump “actions that are tough and that are tailored, including travel restrictions and enhanced screening for certain countries.” Taylor declined to say which or how many countries would be targeted, including the status of the six countries covered by the current ban. White House spokesman Raj Shah said that while “we can’t get into decision-making,” the next step will be a presidential proclamation setting out the new policy. He declined to say when that would come, including whether Trump would act before the existing ban expires. The American Civil Liberties Union, the rights group that mounted one of the legal challenges to the March order, expressed skepticism about Trump’s forthcoming action. “This looks to be the Trump administration’s third try to make good on an unconstitutional campaign promise to ban Muslims from the United States,” ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said. Trump’s six-nation travel ban was laid out in a March 6 executive order that was blocked by federal courts before being allowed to go into effect with some limits by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. Under the recommendations Trump is weighing, there would be restrictions on U.S. entry that differ by nation, based on cooperation with American security mandates, the threat the United States believes each country presents and other variables, Taylor said. He did not specify the nature of the restrictions, but said that after being imposed they could be lifted “if conditions change.” The legal question of whether the existing ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution, as lower courts previously ruled, will be argued before the Supreme Court on Oct. 10. Officials declined to say how the proposed change in policy could affect the upcoming Supreme Court case.  The March travel ban and an earlier January one that targeted the same six countries as well as Iraq are some of the most controversial actions taken by Trump since assuming office in January. Critics have called the policy an unlawful “Muslim ban,” accusing the Republican president of discriminating against Muslims in violation of constitutional guarantees of religious liberty and equal protection under the law, breaking existing U.S. immigration law, and stoking religious hatred. Trump, who has promised that “radical Islamic terrorism” will be “eradicated,” wrote on Twitter on Sept. 15: “The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!” The expiring ban blocked entry into the United States by people from the six countries for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days to give Trump’s administration time to conduct a worldwide review of U.S. vetting procedures for foreign visitors. The existing refugee ban expires on Oct. 24. Taylor said American officials in July notified every foreign government of requirements for the minimum cooperation the United States needs to validate traveler identities to ensure they do not represent a national security threat. Those countries were given 50 days to respond. People from countries that did not meet the requirements may not be allowed to enter the United States or may face other travel restrictions, Taylor said. Most countries met those requirements or agreed to work toward meeting them, Taylor added. “At the end of the day, some countries were still unable or, worse yet, deliberately unwilling to comply with the new baseline that we laid out,” Taylor said. Trump, who promised as a candidate to impose “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” has said the soon-to-expire ban was needed to protect the United States from terrorism. “We need to know who is coming into our country,” Taylor said. “We should be able to validate their identities and we should be able to confirm that our foreign partners do not have information suggesting such individuals may represent a threat to the United States.” While Trump’s January and March orders were quickly blocked by federal courts, the expected new restrictions might be harder to challenge because they are the product of a worldwide review process examining vetting procedures of foreign countries, legal experts said.

13896,"PARIS   - The French government is moving to dismiss Renault’s (RENA.PA) scandal-hit Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn and has requested a board meeting to consider candidates to replace him, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. France, Renault’s biggest shareholder, had until now supported the company’s decision to keep Ghosn in office while he awaits trial in Japan for alleged misconduct at Nissan (7201.T), the French carmaker’s alliance partner he also chaired until his dismissal in November.  But the government, which commands a 15 percent Renault stake and two board seats, has asked the company to convene its nominations committee followed by a full board meeting on Jan. 20 to begin the process of appointing one or more successors to Ghosn, according to three people briefed on the process. A spokesman for Renault and a French finance ministry official both said they had no knowledge of plans for a weekend board meeting. Ghosn’s Nov. 19 arrest in Japan and swift firing by Nissan have deepened tensions with Renault, which owns a 43.4 percent stake in the Japanese carmaker. The French move to replace Ghosn follows a decision by the Tokyo District Court earlier on Tuesday to deny the ousted chairman’s request for release on bail. Ghosn has been charged over allegations he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the company itself have also been indicted. Both men deny the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure, while former alliance boss Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008. Jean-Dominique Senard, who is soon to step down as CEO of tyre maker Michelin, is likely to replace Ghosn as Renault chairman, according to two sources. The French state and its advisers are also considering candidates for the Renault CEO role currently occupied on an interim basis by Ghosn’s deputy Thierry Bollore. Bollore is among contenders for the permanent CEO appointment. Others under consideration include senior Toyota (7203.T) executive Didier Leroy, Elior (ELIOR.PA) boss Philippe Guillemot and one other potential candidate, a source involved in the discussions said. “Philippe Guillemot denies being a candidate for Ghosn’s succession,” said a spokesman for food services group Elior. “It’s possible that people considered him, but no more than that.” Senard could alternatively be appointed chairman and CEO, taking over both of Ghosn’s current roles, the source said. “All these options are on the table.” Leroy declined to comment, and attempts by Reuters to reach Senard at Michelin were unsuccessful. Headhunting firms Korn Ferry and Emeric Lepoutre & Partners, which are involved in the executive search, could not be reached after hours. French officials had said Ghosn should be kept in office unless it became clear he would remain “incapacitated” for much longer, also hinting that Tuesday’s court decision would be an “important development”. Two senior French finance ministry officials were traveling to Tokyo on Tuesday for talks with Nissan stakeholders aimed at stabilizing the alliance with Renault, daily Le Figaro reported. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said in a Monday interview he expected Renault to back the Japanese carmaker’s ouster of Ghosn when its board of directors were finally given full access to the findings of its internal investigation.

13954,"  - PG&E Corp (PCG.N), owner of the biggest U.S. power utility by customers, said on Monday it is preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as soon as this month amid pressure from potentially crushing liabilities linked to California’s catastrophic wildfires in 2017 and 2018. PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion due to the fires, the company said. The most recent fire last November killed at least 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive blaze in California history.  Its shares plunged 52 percent on Monday to $8.38, giving it a market capitalization of less than $4.5 billion. The stock is down more than 80 percent from late 2017, before wildfires devastated PG&E’s service areas. Bond prices also fell sharply on Monday. PG&E’s chief executive officer was replaced on Sunday by General Counsel John Simon on an interim basis. San Francisco-based PG&E is working on lining up roughly $5.5 billion in so-called debtor-in-possession financing to help operations during bankruptcy proceedings.  The utility said the bankruptcy process would not affect electric or natural gas services for customers. Company advisers expect that it may take up to two years to emerge from bankruptcy. In theory, California politicians could avert PG&E’s bankruptcy with legislative action. Last year, the state approved a law helping utilities recoup costs from fires in 2017, but not blazes in 2018.  Lawmakers and regulators may both be constrained in how much more they can help PG&E, at least by allowing it to further raise electricity rates. California’s average rate is 16 cents per kilowatt hour, while those in neighboring Oregon and in Washington state are about half as much, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration provided by energy consulting firm McCullough Research. The U.S. average is 10 cents per kilowatt hour. PG&E said in a securities filing it could potentially raise more money and avoid seeking bankruptcy protection, but argued such a move would be complex, uncertain and expensive. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s recently cut PG&E’s credit rating into junk territory, citing concerns about wildfire liabilities.   On Monday, Moody’s and S&P cut PG&E’s ratings again and Fitch downgraded the California power company and its Pacific Power & Gas Co unit to junk. A bankruptcy filing could help the company deal with such fundamental problems as the prospect of continually being exposed to financial fallout from future wildfires, the company said. Many PG&E customers live near dry forests where rain has become increasingly rare - conditions for potential future blazes.  PG&E’s regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission, began in late December to investigate whether the company should make significant structural changes, including becoming owned by the state or splitting up its businesses.  The company said it was looking for new members for its board of directors with safety experience. PG&E said it could face “significant liability” in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused the Camp Fire that swept through the California mountain community of Paradise last November.   PG&E’s liabilities from that fire could be catastrophic if authorities determine its equipment caused the blazes. Under California law, utilities are exposed to liability from wildfires regardless of their negligence. The company decided to prepare to file for bankruptcy in part to address that issue, known as “inverse condemnation.” In a regulatory filing, it questioned whether it could continue to operate in the years ahead as a so-called investor-owned utility by being exposed to that risk. Investors might avoid the company if questions around that risk remain unanswered.  A federal judge last week proposed restricting PG&E from using power lines deemed unsafe during high winds in this year’s fire season.  Energy companies that supply PG&E could be hit by its bankruptcy. One of the most exposed is Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), the second-largest North American pipeline operator, analysts said. PG&E plans to seek court protection from creditors around Jan. 29, the company said. It alerted employees on Monday in order to comply with California law. The company’s board ousted CEO Geisha Williams and decided to undergo a restructuring at a meeting over the weekend in San Francisco, according to a source familiar with the matter. Williams had served as CEO since March 2017, before the fatal blazes. PG&E, which drew down remaining amounts on credit lines totaling $3.3 billion in November, had about $1.5 billion of liquidity as of Friday.

14009,"WASHINGTON   - The United States on Thursday extended some sanctions relief for Iran under the 2015 nuclear deal but said it has yet to decide whether to preserve the deal itself, the State Department said. President Donald Trump, who must make a decision by mid-October that could undermine the agreement, said Iran is violating “the spirit” of the 2015 deal under which Iran got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program. In a sign of Trump’s desire to put pressure on Iran, which denies violating the deal, the U.S. Treasury announced new cyber-related and other sanctions on seven Iranian individuals, two Iranian entities and two Ukraine-based entities. “We are not going to stand for what they are doing,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. But he stopped short of saying whether he will refuse to recertify the agreement. Trump must decide in October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. The prospect of Washington reneging on the agreement has worried some of the key U.S. allies that helped negotiate the deal, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and wrote the law giving Congress the right to review the Iran deal, said he and the White House were preparing in case of a change in policy. He also said he recognized the need to work with allies. “I think it’s important that ... we take steps that, to the extent we can, we keep all of our allies together,” Corker told Reuters. “What you don’t want to do is self-create a crisis for no reason. You want to make sure that you have an outcome here that is a good outcome for the United States and our interest.” Asked if it made sense to abandon the Iran nuclear deal given concerns about North Korea, Corker said, “I don’t think you should prejudge what they’re (the administration) going to do.” Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argued that the United States must consider the full threat it says Iran poses to the Middle East when formulating its new policy toward Tehran, saying Iran had breached the spirit of the deal. “We have to consider the totality of Iran’s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement,” he told a news conference in London. Citing the preface to the 2015 agreement, Tillerson said “in our view, Iran is clearly in default of these expectations.” He cited Iranian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its development of ballistic missiles and “cyber activities.” The deal’s preface does not oblige Iran to promote global peace. Rather, it says the nations involved “anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security.” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters the administration had approved waivers of some sanctions on Iran to “maintain some flexibility” as it develops its Iran policy. She did not specify which sanctions were waived. Earlier, sources said the United States will renew a waiver of the most punitive sanctions on Iran. Tucked into Section 1245 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, Washington threatened to sanction the banks of Iran’s main oil customers if they did not significantly cut their purchases of Iranian crude. Under the law, these sanctions can be waived for a maximum of 120 days, forcing the U.S. government to revisit the issue every four months. Even as the administration waived the oil-related sanctions, the Treasury Department announced it had sanctioned 11 entities and individuals for “engaging in support of designated Iranian actors or malicious cyber-enabled activity.” Of the 11, seven were Iranian individuals, two were Iranian entities and two were entities based in Ukraine. The Treasury alleged they either supported Iran’s ballistic missile program or its Quds Force, or engaged in cyber attacks against the U.S. financial system. The action freezes any assets they may hold in the United States and generally prohibits U.S. individuals from doing business with them.

14010,"WASHINGTON   - The top Republican tax law writer in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Thursday that he does not expect an upcoming tax reform framework to contain specific numbers on income tax rates for corporations and individuals. “Probably not that specificity,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said at a policy forum when asked if the plan due for release on Sept. 25 would include target tax rates for individuals and U.S. corporations. “You’re going to see clear approaches on where we want to go on business rates,” Brady added. “You’ll see where we’re going on individual rates.” Asked later about his remarks, the Republican told reporters that House leaders are still in discussions with their counterparts in the White House and Senate to determine what details would be included. “My point is that it won’t have specifics through every region of the tax code that everyone is interested in,” Brady said.

14029,"  - One of Nissan Motor Co’s (7201.T) top executives has resigned, further rattling the Japanese automaker’s management team as it broadens an investigation into ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn’s alleged financial misconduct.  Jose Munoz, widely considered as a close ally to Ghosn and a possible successor to lead the automaking partnership between Nissan and France’s Renault SA, had been a “person of interest” in Nissan’s widening internal investigation. The 53-year-old, who was Nissan’s chief performance officer and head of its China operations, made the announcement in a LinkedIn post on Friday. In a statement, Nissan said that Munoz had “elected to resign” from the company, effective immediately. It declined to offer details.  He becomes the latest executive casualty since Nissan in November removed Ghosn as chairman and fired representative director Greg Kelly. The resignation deals another blow to the Japanese automaker which is grappling with the scandal at a time when it is struggling to shore up profitability in the United States and expand aggressively in China. Reuters had reported earlier on Friday that the Japanese automaker was looking into decisions made in the United States by Munoz who led Nissan’s North American operations from 2016 to 2018. “Unfortunately, Nissan is currently involved in matters that have and will continue to divert its focus,” Munoz said in his post. “As I have repeatedly and recently made clear to the company, I look forward to continuing to assist Nissan in its investigations.” People with knowledge of the issue have said that Munoz, who had been placed on a leave of absence earlier in the month, had not been co-operating with the internal investigation. Ghosn, once the most celebrated executives in the auto industry and the anchor of Nissan’s alliance with Renault, remains in custody in a Tokyo detention center since his initial arrest in late November. Ghosn has been indicted on two counts of under-reporting his income, and aggravated breach of trust for temporarily shifting personal investment losses worth 1.85 billion yen ($17 million) to Nissan.         The scandal has sent shockwaves through the automotive industry and has escalated tensions between Nissan and Renault, where Ghosn remains CEO and chairman.  Munoz joined the automaker in 2004 in Europe and led its significant expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. Since then, Nissan has succeeded in raising its market share in the United States and posted record sales.  Earlier this year, Nissan tapped Munoz to oversee its operations in China where it plans to ramp up sales over the next few years.  Since then, the world’s largest auto market has been showing signs of a slowdown, prompting the automaker to cut local production plans in the coming months.

14095,"  - A federal judge in Minnesota ruled this week that Dairy Queen, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, may pursue its lawsuit to stop W.B. Mason Co from selling “Blizzard” bottled spring water, the name it uses for a popular ice cream product. U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson rejected W.B. Mason’s request to dismiss the trademark infringement case or move it to Massachusetts, where the office supplies distributor is based, because it sold no Blizzard water in Minnesota and lacked enough ties to the state. The St. Paul-based judge wrote on Jan. 8 that a 1990 legal precedent gave her jurisdiction because W.B. Mason had registered with Minnesota authorities, despite recent Supreme Court decisions suggesting that greater ties might be needed. Jason Kravitz, a lawyer for W.B. Mason, said on Thursday it was disappointed with the outcome and considered the 1990 precedent “no longer good law.” He said the company will review its legal options. Sheldon Klein, a lawyer for Dairy Queen, declined to comment. Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has since 1998 owned Dairy Queen, whose full name is American Dairy Queen Corp. Dairy Queen’s Blizzard contains soft-serve ice cream that can be blended with fruit, nuts, M&Ms, Oreos and other mix-ins. The Minneapolis-based company began using the Blizzard name in 1946, and has five Blizzard trademarks. It claimed in its lawsuit last March 12 that the sale of Blizzard water, which began in 2010, threatened irreparable harm and customer confusion because many Dairy Queen stores also sold bottled water. W.B. Mason sued three days later in Boston for a court order that there was no infringement. That case was later put on hold, and it is not immediately clear what will happen to it. Known for eating habits that might give doctors heartburn, Buffett, 88, told Yahoo Finance in 2016 that at Dairy Queen he usually orders a small sundae for the ice cream, an extra large sundae for the topping, and combines them. The case is American Dairy Queen Corp v. W.B. Mason Co, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, No. 18-00693. ",U.S. judge lets Buffett's Dairy Queen sue W.B.

14110,"SAO PAULO/BRASILIA   - The Brazilian government on Thursday said it would allow a proposed tie-up between planemakers Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) and Boeing Co (BA.N) to go forward, capping weeks of uncertainty in which President Jair Bolsonaro expressed hesitation. The approval maintains the terms of the deal as previously proposed, with Embraer selling 80 percent of its commercial plane division, its most profitable, for $4.2 billion to Boeing, which will have total control of the new venture.  But one thing was new: the government said in a press release that the two planemakers would “maintain the current jobs in Brazil,” a move that might appease union workers and politicians who had raised concerns that, if the deal went through, Boeing would then try to slash jobs. The companies had previously been noncommittal on the issue.  The tie-up between Embraer and Boeing is seen as part of a reshaping of the global aviation market for mid-sized planes. It follows a similar deal by Boeing’s rival Airbus (AIR.PA) which bought Bombardier Inc’s (BBDb.TO) commercial plane division that competed with Embraer.  The deal still must now be voted on by Embraer’s private shareholders within the next 30 days, but winning the backing of Brazil’s government was its biggest hurdle. If approved by shareholders, the companies will then have to seek regulatory approval in several countries.  The deal also faces legal challenges in Brazil. Workers and left-wing politicians obtained court orders blocking the deal in December, but the injunctions were quickly reversed. The tie-up could face future injunctions as the cases remain pending. Minority shareholders have also filed legal complaints that have yet to be resolved. Embraer and Boeing said in a statement they expect the deal to obtain final approvals before the end of 2019.  Boeing shares closed up 2.6 percent on Thursday and were flat in after-hours trade following the deal approval. Embraer shares on the New York Stock Exchange were up 0.4 percent after the close. Shortly after assuming the presidency on Jan. 1, Bolsonaro, a former army captain, had expressed concern that Boeing might end up owning all of Embraer if the deal was approved under the terms proposed.  But on Thursday, a statement from his office said his government had analyzed the proposal and found that it “preserves (Brazil’s) sovereignty and the national interests.” ",Brazil approves Boeing-Embraer tie-up with new commitment to keep local jobs,"January 10, 2019 /  9:27 PM ",sao paulo brasilia the brazilian government on thursday said it would allow a proposed tie up between planemakers embraer sa embr sa and boeing co ba n to go forward capping weeks of uncertainty in which president jair bolsonaro expressed hesitation the approval maintains the terms of the deal as previously proposed with embraer selling  percent of its commercial plane division its most profitable for   billion to boeing which will have total control of the new venture but one thing was new the government said in a press release that the two planemakers would maintain the current jobs in brazil a move that might appease union workers and politicians who had raised concerns that if the deal went through boeing would then try to slash jobs the companies had previously been noncommittal on the issue the tie up between embraer and boeing is seen as part of a reshaping of the global aviation market for mid sized planes it follows a similar deal by boeing s rival airbus air pa which bought bombardier inc s bbdb to commercial plane division that competed with embraer the deal still must now be voted on by embraer s private shareholders within the next  days but winning the backing of brazil s government was its biggest hurdle if approved by shareholders the companies will then have to seek regulatory approval in several countries the deal also faces legal challenges in brazil workers and left wing politicians obtained court orders blocking the deal in december but the injunctions were quickly reversed the tie up could face future injunctions as the cases remain pending minority shareholders have also filed legal complaints that have yet to be resolved embraer and boeing said in a statement they expect the deal to obtain final approvals before the end of  boeing shares closed up   percent on thursday and were flat in after hours trade following the deal approval embraer shares on the new york stock exchange were up   percent after the close shortly after assuming the presidency on jan  bolsonaro a former army captain had expressed concern that boeing might end up owning all of embraer if the deal was approved under the terms proposed but on thursday a statement from his office said his government had analyzed the proposal and found that it preserves brazil s sovereignty and the national interests ,US China Trade War,0.2436278611421585
14114,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump signed a bill on Friday extending the government debt limit for three months and providing about $15 billion in hurricane-related aid, bringing his surprising deal with Democratic congressional leaders this week to completion. The bill, approved in a 316-90 vote by the U.S. House of Representatives, had drawn criticism from some  conservative members of Congress. But the Senate passed it on Thursday and the Republican president signed it soon after arriving at Camp David, Maryland, for the weekend. Despite controversy, lawmakers had rushed to approve the legislation, which provides $15.25 billion for emergency disaster aid, before government aid ran out at week’s end as Americans deal with two deadly hurricanes including Irma, a potentially catastrophic storm poised to strike Florida on Sunday. Hurricane Harvey, which came ashore on Aug. 25 as the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in more than 50 years, killed about 60 people, displaced more than 1 million, and the state governor has said it caused up to $180 billion in damage. The bill raised questions about the relationship between Trump, a political outsider who took office in January, and Republican Party regulars. He has frequently criticized Senate leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, and his deal on Wednesday with Democratic congressional leaders Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi was an especially troublesome shock for conservative members. Conservatives’ souring relations with the administration are likely to remain a factor as Congress and the White House now face a Dec. 8 deadline on the debt limit and government spending. Asked about Trump working so closely with Democrats on the legislation, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said:     “I think that the president’s focus was doing what was best for the American people. I think the last thing we want to do is play partisan politics when we have people in places like Texas and Louisiana that need financial support through the federal government.” A White House statement issued after Trump signed the bill said: “The President appreciates Congress putting aside partisan politics and acting quickly to ensure that first responders, local officials, and Federal emergency management personnel have the resources they need.”  Before the vote, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney had pleaded the White House’s case to Republican lawmakers at a Friday morning meeting. It was not well received by some. “There’s a lot of disappointment in the decision the president made and the way our leadership was treated,” said House Republican Representative Hal Rogers, describing a sense of “animosity” at the meeting. “That’s a sore spot. It’s not a happy camp.” “There was some hissing and I don’t know if there was some booing, but there were some groans,” Republican Representative Mark Walker said. Mulvaney told the representatives now was not the time to discuss Washington fiscal problems because of the hurricanes. Conservatives reminded him that during his days as one of the most conservative members of Congress, he had been a strong advocate for threatening government shutdowns in order to win concessions on spending. “It got a little warm for him a few times,” Walker said. More moderate Republicans welcomed the bipartisan approach. “If we can reach across the aisle, we can get things done and not be held hostage by 30 or 40 people,” said Representative Peter King. “You can’t just have one party govern.”     The bill’s $15.25 billion in emergency funding includes $7.4 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, $450 million for the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program and $7.4 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Some conservative groups had objected to coupling a debt-limit increase with the emergency funds, but McConnell moved ahead at Trump’s urging. Walker said Mnuchin gave conservatives little hope that the Trump administration would fight to include the spending restrictions they want to see in the next debt ceiling increase in December. In Wednesday’s meeting with congressional leaders, Trump had sought to work out a deal to attach to the disaster funding two short-term, three-month measures to fund the federal government at current levels and extended its borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling.  Current government funding was set to expire at the end of the month, with a possible government shutdown looming, and the U.S. Treasury had asked Congress to raise the debt limit immediately. Some House Republicans balked at attaching the two crucial fiscal measures to the bill and called it a win for Democrats. Republicans had wanted to raise the debt ceiling for a longer period that would have extended past the 2018 midterm elections. Republican Senator Ben Sasse said on Thursday the deal makes Schumer “the most powerful man in America for the month of December.” The three-month term of the debt limit and spending deal could give Democrats a better chance of winning higher government spending levels in December. Republicans fear that having to deal with spending and debt again so soon will distract them from other issues, such as tax reform.

14115,"WASHINGTON   - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has agreed to a settlement worth about $800 million to resolve claims from the U.S. Justice Department and state of California that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests, but still faces an ongoing criminal probe. The hefty penalty is the latest fallout from the U.S. government’s stepped-up enforcement of vehicle emissions rules after Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in September 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules. The Fiat Chrysler settlement includes $311 million in total civil penalties to U.S. and California regulators, up to $280 million to resolve claims from diesel owners, and extended warranties worth $105 million. It covers 104,000 Fiat Chrysler 2014-16 Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee diesels, the Justice Department said. Regulators said Fiat Chrysler used “defeat devices” to cheat emissions tests in real-world driving.  Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that “the settlements do not change the Company’s position that it did not engage in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat emissions tests.” The company did not admit liability. “You wouldn’t pay $311 million total dollars to the federal government in civil penalties if there were not a serious problem,” U.S. assistant attorney general Jeff Clark told a news conference. The settlement also includes $72.5 million for state civil penalties, and $33.5 million in payments to California to offset excess emissions and consumer claims. German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], which provided the emissions control software for the vehicles, also agreed to pay $27.5 million to resolve claims from diesel owners. Owners will receive an average of $2,800 to obtain software updates as part of the emissions recall, Fiat Chrysler said. Elizabeth Cabraser, a lawyer for the owners, said the “substantial cash compensation” will ensure that consumers get the recall fix.  Bosch, which also provided diesel emissions software to Volkswagen, also agreed to pay $103.5 million to settle claims with 47 U.S. states that said the supplier “enabled” the cheating and should have known its customers would use the software improperly, the New York Attorney General’s Office said. Bosch said in a statement it did not accept liability or admit to the factual allegations, but that the settlement reflects “Bosch’s desire to move forward and to spare the company the very substantial costs and the burden on the company’s resources that would be required to litigate these issues.” The Justice Department said the settlement does not resolve an ongoing criminal investigation into Fiat Chrysler’s conduct, but officials declined to discuss the status. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating. U.S. regulators are also investigating Daimler AG for alleged excess emissions in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, but the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the status of the probe - and would not say if any other automakers are under scrutiny. Daimler declined to comment Thursday but has acknowledged it faces investigations in Germany and the United States. In October, Daimler said operating profit would fall by more than 10 percent, blaming “government proceedings and measures in various regions” in referencing diesel emissions issues. U.S. regulators said the industry was getting a tough message. “Fiat Chrysler deceived consumers and the federal government by installing defeat devices on these vehicles that undermined important clean air protections,” said Andrew Wheeler, acting administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “Today’s settlement sends a clear and strong signal to manufacturers and consumers alike - the Trump administration will vigorously enforce the nation’s laws designed to protect the environment and public health.” Wheeler said the settlement message is simple to automakers: “Don’t cheat.” The case dragged on after the Justice Department filed suit in May 2017 and the sides remained far part. At one point, the Justice Department sought $1.4 billion in civil penalties from Fiat Chrysler - or about a $1 billion more than the company ultimately paid, two people briefed on the matter said. The Justice Department said Fiat Chrysler must work with one or more vendors of aftermarket catalytic converters to improve the efficiency of 200,000 converters that will be sold in the 47 U.S. states that do not already require the use of the California-mandated high-efficiency gasoline vehicle catalysts. That is estimated at $50 million to $70 million, officials said. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement, “Fiat Chrysler tried to evade these standards by installing software to cheat emissions testing. The company not only violated the law and our trust, but did so at the expense of our environment.” U.S. Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio said at a news conference that automakers were on notice: “If you cheat our emissions tests you are going to get caught.” Fiat Chrysler has agreed to an enhanced whistleblower program and the company must implement corporate governance, organization and technical process reforms to minimize the likelihood of future Clean Air Act violations and must hire a compliance auditor to oversee and assess the reforms. With the Fiat Chrysler settlement, the U.S. Justice Department’s total civil fines for both Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen are now valued at around $2,500 per vehicle. In total, Volkswagen agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, including spending as much as $15 billion to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The company pleaded guilty to three felony counts to resolve the criminal probe. Fiat Chrysler shares were up 1.6 percent at $16.03 late on Thursday in New York. The settlement will be open for public comment for 30 days before a federal judge decides whether to approve the agreements.

14122,"BERLIN   - A German court ruled on Thursday that Amazon’s thumb-sized ordering devices known as “Dash” buttons do not give sufficient information about the product ordered or its price, breaking consumer protection legislation.  The ruling came after a regional consumer protection watchdog brought a case against Amazon, arguing that the Dash buttons violate laws that say shoppers should know what they are paying at the time of any transaction. “We are always open to innovation. But if innovation means that the consumer is put at a disadvantage and price comparisons are made difficult then we fight that,” Wolfgang Schuldzinski, head of the consumer body, said in a statement. The online retailer launched its thumb-sized Dash button in 2015, allowing members of its Prime membership scheme to re-order products such as laundry detergent, coffee and dishwasher tablets by pushing a wifi-connected button. An Amazon spokesman said the company was convinced the Dash button complied with German law and it would fight the ruling through other legal channels, even though the consumer body said the court would not grant an appeal. “Today’s ruling is not only hostile to innovation. It also stops customers from making an informed decision about whether a service like the Dash button gives them a convenient shopping experience,” he said. Separately, Amazon is under investigation by Germany’s anti-trust authority, which is looking into whether the company is exploiting its market dominance in its relations with third-party retailers who use its website as a marketplace. Germany is Amazon’s second biggest market. It has faced a long-running battle with unions in the country over pay and conditions for logistics workers.

14124,"COPENHAGEN   - Bill Browder, founder and CEO of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, said on Thursday he had asked French authorities to investigate Danske Bank over alleged money laundering, rather than treating it as a witness. Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO) is already under investigation by authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($229 billion) made through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. A Paris court began investigating Danske Bank in October 2017 after Browder said he had provided details of the Danish lender’s involvement in money laundering relating to a tax fraud which had been exposed by Sergei Magnitsky in Moscow, a lawyer who died in a Russian prison in 2009. Browder, once the biggest foreign money manager in Russia who now campaigns to expose corruption, has lobbied the European Union to bring in a “Magnitsky Act”, the law adopted in the United States which targets human rights offenders. Danske Bank was initially placed under investigation by a Paris court in related to suspicions of money laundering concerning transactions at its Estonian branch between 2008 and 2011, but in January last year the court changed its status to that of “assisted witness,” a Danske spokesman said.  “We do not believe that we have provided incorrect information to the French authorities,” the Danske spokesman said in response to an allegation that it did so made by Browder during a press conference in Copenhagen on Thursday. “On the contrary, it is clearly in our interest to obtain as accurate a picture of what happened in Estonia as possible,” the spokesman said in a statement, adding that the bank has an ongoing dialogue with the French authorities. Browder, who in September asked the U.S. Treasury to investigate Danske Bank and to undertake steps to consider designating it for special measures under the USA Patriot Act, said he expected the French authorities to take action. “The indication is that they are going to act on it.”  Reuters was not immediately able to contact the French national financial prosecutor about the case. On Wednesday, Danske Bank and four former top executives were sued by a U.S. shareholder alleging it defrauded investors and inflated its share price by hiding and failing to stop the money laundering in Estonia.  Danske Bank said it was aware that a lawsuit has been filed in the United States. “It is public knowledge that several U.S. law firms have indicated that similar lawsuits are on the way, so it does not come as a surprise to us,” the spokesman said. “We will consider the lawsuit and the further process in consultation with our legal counsel. At the present time, we have no further comments,” he added.

14138,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO   - U.S. legislation may be needed to require social media companies to disclose more about how their platforms are used for political advertising, a senior Democratic lawmaker said on Thursday, after new signs of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. Facebook Inc said on Wednesday that an operation likely based in Russia had placed thousands of U.S. ads with polarizing views on topics such as immigration, race and gay rights on the site during a two-year period through May 2017.  The world’s largest social network was already under fire for how little transparency it provides about digital political ads. Voters, researchers and journalists cannot see many of the ads politicians and interest groups run on Facebook to target certain groups, nor can they discover who paid for them. Senator Mark Warner said Congress may need to update laws in order to make them consistent with rules governing television advertising. “An American can still figure out what the content is being used in TV advertising. You can go look at the ad,” Warner, of Virginia, said at a security conference.  “But in social media there is no such requirement. So, you know, we may need a legislative solution,” he said. A second Democratic senator, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, said on Thursday that he supported regulating social media ads like TV ads.  U.S. intelligence agencies say there was an extensive Russian cyber-influence operation during the 2016 election campaign aimed at helping Donald Trump, a Republican, defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations. Watchdog group Common Cause on Thursday filed a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission alleging that unknown foreign nationals made expenditures during the election in violation of American election law.  Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he believed what Facebook disclosed was “the tip of the iceberg” and that Twitter Inc and other tech companies should also examine the issue. Twitter declined to comment. Google, the search engine which also owns video-sharing website YouTube, said on Thursday it had seen no evidence of an ad campaign like the one Facebook disclosed.  Warner’s committee is among those investigating alleged Russian meddling and whether members of Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. Facebook’s disclosure about Russian advertising created more questions than it answered, such as which candidates the ads supported and how savvy the targeting was, said David Lazer, a Northeastern University political scientist.  “Does it reflect sophistication and coordination, or did they throw $100,000 at this just to try a bunch of stuff?” he said.  U.S. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, although non-citizens may advertise on issues. Other ads fall into a legal gray area.  Television has been the backbone of political advertising for decades, and local U.S. broadcasters are required to disclose a wealth of details about the cost and schedules of commercials. The ads can be seen by anyone with a television provided they are aired in their markets. Online advertising offered by Facebook and other platforms such as Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s Google, though, often targets narrow, carefully constructed audiences based on factors such as age, political preference or interests. Facebook is especially valued by advertisers due to its targeting capabilities. Facebook and Google have, so far, declined to make political ads more transparent. They said on Thursday they were both open to reviewing specific congressional proposals.  Facebook also said it was continuing its investigation into possible nefarious activity.  Facebook briefed U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday and turned over information about the ads to Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading his own investigation into alleged Russian interference, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said after the November election that it was a “pretty crazy idea” to think false news stories on the network tilted the election.  Since then, though, the company and other tech firms have taken a series of steps to address deliberately false stories or manipulation of traffic by bots. Facebook in April released a report on “information operations” on the site, including some aimed at influencing the French election this past spring. The report on Wednesday expands on that and, for the first time, shows how paid advertising may have played a role in Russian influence efforts in the United States.   Much of the advertising on Facebook and Google is self-serve and can be easily ordered up through their websites. “You can, from anywhere in the world, advertise to the entire world through the platform,” said Nathan Persily, a Stanford University law professor. “It’s incredibly empowering, but it doesn’t have all the regulatory trappings that a medium like television has.” ",U.S. may need

14148,"  - Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which slashed its quarterly sales forecast last week, has reduced planned production for its three new iPhone models by about 10 percent for the January-March quarter, the Nikkei Asian Review reported on Wednesday. That rare forecast cut exposed weakening iPhone demand in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, where a slowing economy has also been buffeted by a trade war with the United States. Many analysts and consumers have said the new iPhones are overpriced. Apple asked its suppliers late last month to produce fewer-than-planned units of its XS, XS Max and XR models, the Nikkei reported, citing sources with knowledge of the request.  The request was made before Apple announced its forecast cut, the Nikkei said. The bleaker sales outlook, which Apple attributed to weak China demand, triggered a broad sell-off in global stock markets. Market research firm Canalys estimates shipments fell 12 percent in China last year and expects smartphone shipments in 2019 to dip another 3 percent, to below 400 million for the first time since 2014. Overall planned production volume of both old and new iPhones is likely to be cut to a range of 40 million to 43 million units for January-March period, from an earlier projection of 47 million to 48 million units, the Nikkei reported, citing one source familiar with the situation. Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The report comes after chip suppliers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS.O) flagged weak first-quarter chip demand for smartphones. Samsung surprised the market on Tuesday with an estimated 29 percent drop in quarterly profit, blaming weak chip demand in a rare commentary issued to “ease confusion” among investors already fretting about a global tech slowdown. Apple’s iPhone suppliers include Taiwanese assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (2317.TW) and Pegatron Corp (4938.TW). Pegatron declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters, while Foxconn did not reply to a request for comment. There was little reaction to the report among shares of major Apple suppliers, as the market has already digested production cuts after the iPhone maker’s forecast cut, analysts said. Shares of Foxconn, the world’s biggest electronics contract manufacturer, closed up 1.6 percent, while Pegatron closed up 1.3 percent. Apple shares were up 1.3 percent at $152.70 in early trading on Wednesday. Among iPhone component suppliers in Asia, South Korea’s LG Display Co Ltd (034220.KS) closed up 0.5 percent, while Japan Display Inc (6740.T) was flat. “The Street is already well aware of a soft March guide so this latest report is not a new worry, as investors are starting to look ahead 6-9 months down the road for Apple and gauge how the company emerges from this dark chapter of soft demand,” Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said. As Chinese demand has faltered, Apple has increased focus on India, which recently overtook the United States as the world’s second-largest smartphone market. Chief Executive Tim Cook reiterated in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that India was a major focus for Apple. Reuters reported last month that Apple will begin assembling its top-end iPhones in India this year through the local unit of Foxconn, citing a person familiar with the matter.

14164,"WASHINGTON   - Comprehensive reform of the U.S. tax code is still likely to pass by the end of 2017 despite the government spending deal President Donald Trump struck with Democrats, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday.  In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said he was not worried about the plan going off track because of either  Democrats, who won the surprise deal on Wednesday with the Republican president, or more conservative Republicans making their own demands.  “It’s still very viable to get it done this year,” Mnuchin said. “We have a path to get this done this year, and we’re still very hopeful that we can get it done,” he added, saying it was his and Trump’s top priority.  Asked whether he was concerned, however, that Democrats could use the funding deal struck Wednesday to make demands such as rejecting any tax cut for the wealthy or pushing for a cut for middle income earners, Mnuchin said no.  Instead, he said Wednesday’s deal “cleared the decks 90 days to have more room to focus on taxes. I think that was a big win,” adding that he expected some Democrats to back the final plan. Separately, Axios reported that the Freedom Caucus, a more conservative faction of House Republicans, is planning to unveil their own tax plan that would cut the corporate tax rate from the current 35 percent to 16 percent.  It would also double the standard, abandon the idea of revenue neutrality and push some kind of welfare reform, Axios said, citing people familiar with the matter. Asked about the report, Mnuchin told Fox Business Network: “I’m not worried about any GOP revolt at all,” adding that lawmakers could push their ideas with leadership as part of a regular legislative process. Mnuchin did not give any more details about the administration’s tax proposal. On Wednesday, Trump said he would offer more details about his tax reform plan in about two weeks.

14175,"NEW YORK   - Sears Holdings Corp Chairman Eddie Lampert submitted a revised roughly $5 billion takeover bid for the company on Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said, boosting the chances that the U.S. department store operator will escape liquidation. In a concession, Lampert agreed to assume tax and vendor bills Sears has incurred since filing for bankruptcy protection in October, the sources said. The billionaire’s revised bid was submitted through an affiliate of his hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, on Wednesday afternoon along with a $120 million deposit, the sources added.  Lampert’s previous bid, which Sears had rejected, was valued at $4.4 billion. The new bid, which Sears will consider during a Jan. 14 bankruptcy auction, proposes assuming up to about $300 million of tax and merchandise expenses the 126-year-old company has racked up since its Oct. 15 bankruptcy filing, the sources said. The offer, which aims to preserve up to 50,000 jobs, also would assume up to roughly $350 million in additional Sears bankruptcy expenses, severance benefits for employees and other liabilities, one of the sources added. Sears employed about 68,000 people when it filed for bankruptcy.   Ensuring Sears can pay its expenses, which include bills for legal and financial advisers and are known as administrative claims, was a main point of contention as the company negotiated the deal with Lampert.      Lampert’s previous bid had proposed acquiring 425 Sears stores.  The sources asked not to be identified because the details of Lampert’s new bid are not yet public.  Sears and ESL declined to comment. Lampert’s revised bid is the only one that envisions keeping Sears alive, albeit in a smaller form, and came after a last-minute deal he reached with the retailer on Tuesday as the company was preparing to liquidate. Other offers submitted over the past several weeks were for pieces of Sears or liquidation proposals to close its doors.  The breakthrough occurred hours before a scheduled bankruptcy court hearing on Tuesday. A Sears lawyer disclosed the agreement during the hearing, telling a judge it materialized after what he described as round-the-clock negotiations.  The agreement required Lampert to make a $120 million deposit, more than $17 million of which he will forfeit to Sears creditors unless his bid prevails in next week’s bankruptcy auction.  Sears will now weigh Lampert’s offer against a liquidation that would shut down the retail chain for good and put tens of thousands of people out of work. Sears has lined up a liquidator to sell off the chain’s vast inventories of tools, appliances and store fixtures if necessary.  Sears dates back to the late 1800s and eventually became known for its mail-order catalogs. By the 1960s, it was the largest retailer in the world and a fixture in malls across the United States, selling everything from appliances to auto parts to toys.   But the retailer failed to adapt to the modern era of online shopping and was overtaken by the likes of Amazon.com Inc, which earlier this week became the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalization of close to $800 billion.  Sears in October became the latest retailer to be swept up in a wave of bankruptcies amid the modern competitive landscape and is now trying to avoid the fate of other chains that failed to survive their court filings. Toys ‘R’ Us Inc and Bon-Ton Stores Inc were unable to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings and forced to liquidate last year. Lampert formed the modern Sears through an $11 billion merger in 2005 that combined Sears Roebuck and Kmart. He envisioned returning the retailer to its glory days, when it owned the tallest building in the world, a radio station and Allstate insurance.  Critics, including some Sears creditors, contend he let Sears deteriorate even as he invested in the retailer and loaned it money.  Lampert’s current bid for Sears still faces hurdles that have been tabled for now but could eventually threaten his attempt to acquire the chain. His previous offers requested a legal release that would clear him from exposure to litigation over transactions he engaged in with Sears before it filed for bankruptcy protection.  Unsecured creditors, including landlords and bondholders, have argued there are viable claims against Lampert regarding the deals, which Lampert maintains were proper. The transactions helped him become the company’s largest creditor in addition to its biggest shareholder.  Lampert has also proposed forgiving $1.3 billion of debt he holds in exchange for ownership of a restructured Sears, a bankruptcy maneuver known as a credit bid. Unsecured creditors have previously argued the move should not be allowed. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain plans to review the credit bid after next week’s auction.

14177,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., will testify privately to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday as it investigates allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump Jr. had been invited to testify in public in a hearing in July, but reached an agreement to speak privately with committee staff. “We look forward to a professional and productive meeting and appreciate the opportunity to assist the committee,” Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr., said in a statement on Wednesday. Russia has loomed large over the first seven months of the Trump presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia worked to tilt last year’s presidential election in favor of Trump, the Republican candidate. Special counsel Robert Mueller is leading an investigation examining potential collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign. Several congressional committees are also looking into the matter, with the Senate and House intelligence committees conducting the main congressional investigations. Trump Jr. is expected to testify before Senate Intelligence sometime later this year. “I’m not interesting in talking to principal witnesses until I’ve talked to everybody else that was in the room,” Senator Richard Burr, the panel’s Republican chairman, told reporters. Congressional investigators have focused on a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower whose attendees included a Russian lawyer and lobbyist and Trump associates including his son, and what came out of it, if anything, in terms of the relationship between Russians and the Trump campaign or Trump business interests. Separately, Susan Rice, who was national security adviser for former President Barack Obama, testified on Tuesday before the House Intelligence Committee for about four hours. Erin Pelton, a spokeswoman for Rice, said she had met voluntarily with the committee as part of its investigation. “Ambassador Rice remains fully supportive of bipartisan efforts to determine the extent and scope of Russia’s outrageous efforts to interfere in the 2016 election,” she said in a statement. Rice had been subpoenaed by the committee as it looked into Republican concerns about whether anyone from the administration of Obama, a Democrat, had asked to “unmask” names of Trump campaign advisers picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts. Several U.S. officials have told Reuters that all such requests by Obama administration officials were properly scrutinized and appropriate. Moscow has denied any meddling. Trump denies collusion by his campaign.

14196,"BOSTON   - The former chief executive of Insys Therapeutics Inc INSY.O pleaded guilty on Wednesday to participating in a nationwide scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe an addictive opioid medication and has agreed to become a government witness. Michael Babich, who resigned as the Arizona-based drugmaker’s CEO in 2015, pleaded guilty in federal court in Boston to conspiracy and mail fraud charges after entering into a cooperation deal with prosecutors. His plea comes less than three weeks before five former Insys executives and managers including John Kapoor, its onetime billionaire founder and former chairman, face trial after being charged with participating in the scheme. Babich, 42, faces up to 25 years in prison. But the Arizona resident could receive a more lenient sentence by testifying at Kapoor’s Jan. 28 trial. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak in court said Babich committed his crimes at Kapoor’s direction. Kapoor and his co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy. Beth Wilkinson, Kapoor’s lawyer, had no comment after attending Wednesday’s hearing.  Prosecutors allege that from 2012 to 2015, Kapoor, Babich and others conspired to pay doctors bribes in exchange for prescribing Subsys, an under-the-tongue fentanyl spray for managing severe pain in cancer patients. Fentanyl is an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine. Prosecutors said Insys paid doctors kickbacks in the form of fees to participate in speaker programs ostensibly meant to educate medical professionals about Subsys that were actually sham events. Prior to working at Insys, Babich had worked at Kapoor’s venture capital firm. Insys in August said it had agreed to pay at least $150 million as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. The company has said it has taken steps to ensure it operates legally going forward.  Prosecutors called the case a major example of their efforts to combat the nation’s opioid epidemic. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017. Babich’s plea comes after Alec Burlakoff, Insys’ former vice president of sales, pleaded guilty in November and agreed to testify as a government witness. Babich is married to a former Insys sales representative, Natalie Babich, who in 2017 pleaded guilty to conspiring to pay kickbacks. She testified last month at the trial of Christopher Clough, a former physician assistant in New Hampshire accused of accepting kickbacks from Insys. A federal jury in Concord, New Hampshire, convicted Clough on Dec. 18.

14199,"  - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) has responded to comments made by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook in an interview, in which he said there had been no recent settlement talks between the iPhone maker and chip supplier in their global legal battle, calling Cook’s remarks “misleading.” Apple on Wednesday said it stood by Cook’s comments. The two companies are disputing comments their respective CEOs have made over settlement talks. Apple’s chief on Tuesday said any talks ended in September 2018. Qualcomm’s Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf in November made comments about the supplier’s efforts to resolve the dispute. But Qualcomm on Tuesday said Cook had miscast Mollenkopf’s remarks, which did not mention a settlement and which Qualcomm maintains are accurate. The war of words is unlikely to play a major role in the outcome of the legal fight between the two firms. But it signals the high stakes and deeply entrenched positions of each side, with Apple arguing in court that Qualcomm charges an unfair “tax” on its phones while Qualcomm fights to protect a patent licensing model it argues has helped bring connectivity to billions of new users through wireless networks. In a television interview on CNBC earlier on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question from host Jim Cramer about whether Apple would settle with Qualcomm after Qualcomm had announced legal victories against Apple in patent cases in China and Germany. “Look, the truth is, we haven’t been in any settlement discussions with them since the third calendar quarter of last year. That is the truth. So I’m not sure where that thinking is coming from,” Cook said. Cook’s comments contrasted with those Mollenkopf made in November on CNBC. “We do talk as companies, and I think what you’re seeing, really, are activities consistent, really, with the fourth quarter of the game, and not the first quarter,” Mollenkopf told CNBC then. “We always talk about - and I’ve been very consistent  that this second half of (2018) and into (2019), is when we’re really on the doorstep of finding a resolution.” In a statement, Qualcomm said the company stands by Mollenkopf’s remarks. “We have been consistent for the last 18 months in making clear that we have, at various times, been in discussions with Apple about a possible resolution to our licensing dispute,” a Qualcomm spokesperson said in a statement. “We have also stated clearly on several occasions that we believe it will be resolved, one way or the other, in the near future, either through a settlement or court decisions.” Apple on Wednesday said Cook’s comments were accurate. “Qualcomm is desperate to obfuscate the tales it has been telling its investors. Their accusations are a red herring,” Apple said in a statement to Reuters.  Apple has accused Qualcomm of engaging in illegal patent licensing practices to preserve a dominant market position in so-called modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has argued that its practices followed decades-long tech industry norms and that Apple has not compensated it fairly for its intellectual property. The primary case in Apple and Qualcomm’s legal battle goes to trial in April.

14253,"DETROIT   - The head of Canada’s auto union blasted General Motors Co on Tuesday for pushing ahead with plans to phase out work at its Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant despite calls by workers and politicians in Canada to find a new vehicle to build there. Unifor, the union that represents workers at the plant, has vowed to block its closure. “They’re moving ahead with their plan. We’re going to continue to have discussions with them about solutions,” Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor, the union that represents workers at the plant, told Reuters after a meeting he had with GM officials at the No. 1 U.S. automaker’s Detroit headquarters. “I’m furious right now,” Dias added. “The reality is that GM can reverse its decision. The question is do they have the political will to do so.”   GM said in a letter to Dias that it had already considered several proposals including those the union raised at the meeting. “Unfortunately, all Unifor’s proposals would involve substantial incremental costs and a further deterioration of GM’s competitive position,” GM said, adding that “it cannot pursue them” because of the weakening market in North America. GM confirmed it has no plans to build vehicles in the Oshawa plant after the end of 2019, which is part of a broad restructuring announced in November. GM also has not allocated new products for four U.S. plants, raising the possibility of their closure and the elimination of a total of about 15,000 jobs in North America.     Dias previously promised “one hell of a fight” to prevent the Oshawa plant’s closure. Going into the Tuesday meeting, he has voiced optimism a solution could be found. Dias also previously said one option would be to extend operations for nine months, when regular contract talks are scheduled to begin, allowing more time for a long-term solution.     The union has said the decision is contrary to commitments made by GM in contract negotiations with Unifor in 2016. Unifor said the deal stipulates there will be no plant closures before Sept. 21, 2020. After he returned from the meeting with GM, Dias told reporters in a press conference in Windsor, Ontario, that the union was looking at its legal options regarding whether the Detroit company violated the labor contract. GM officials have said the fate of the U.S. plants is subject to talks with the United Auto Workers union, which represents the U.S. workers at those plants. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra promised in early December to keep an “open mind” about another affected plant, Ohio’s Lordstown Assembly. Hundreds of workers walked off the job at the Oshawa plant in protest on the day GM announced its plans. GM has said the Oshawa closure affects 2,973 assembly line jobs. The company employs 8,150 in Canada.

14267,"  - American Express Co (AXP.N) suspended a director in its foreign-exchange department as part of an ongoing investigation into pricing practices in the division, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The department was informed about director Taylor Simonin’s suspension last month on a company call, sources told the Journal. The credit card issuer received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice late October and is also being investigated by other federal agencies for pricing practices at its foreign exchange international payments (FXIP) unit. The unit offers cross-border payments services mainly to small and middle market business customers in five countries, including the United States. FXIP accounts for less than 1 percent of AmEx’s total revenue and the company does not expect the investigation to hurt overall operations or results. A spokesperson for AmEx declined to comment on the matter, saying “this is an ongoing review, we do not comment on any personnel issues, whether related to FXIP or not”.

14287,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI   - China’s indebted HNA Group met bankers on Tuesday to tout the latest assets that the sprawling conglomerate is putting on the block as it looks to raise funds and stave off an intensifying cash crunch. The range of assets, spanning a hotel project in frozen Harbin and stakes in struggling online lender Dianrong, insurer Bohai Life and brokerage HNA Futures, underscores how the group is shedding almost all non-core businesses as it pares back an empire that once spread from Deutsche Bank to Hilton Worldwide. The finance-to-aviation group [HNAIRC.UL] has been ramping up asset sales over the past year. However the possible sale of many on the list of at least 20 assets presented to bankers and seen by Reuters has not been previously reported. HNA did not respond to requests for comment. The embattled group is more than a year into the process of unwinding a $50 billion acquisition spree that at its peak netted the company stakes in banks, fund managers, hotels, property and airlines, among other assets. But faced with soaring debt and increased government scrutiny of aggressive deal-making, HNA has pushed ahead with asset sales that have so far included real estate and stakes in hotels groups, and discussions on key overseas units such as Ingram Micro and its luxury $300 million-plus corporate “Dream Jet”. Reuters reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter, that China Development Bank [CHDB.UL] was leading a team to supervise asset disposals as the group looks to scale back operations to just core assets. The document from the meeting at a Beijing hotel on Tuesday indicated HNA was looking to sell eight hotel and other property projects, including a luxury Renaissance hotel in Shanghai and a commercial complex in the western city of Chengdu. Also on the list was a section including eight financial projects and a separate section with four stakes in leasing, insurance and banking firms. Those stakes included 20 percent of Bohai Life, 6.18 percent of peer-to-peer lender Dianrong and more than 40 percent of financial services firm Sino Guarantee. The entirety of wholly owned brokerage unit HNA Futures was also up for sale. Bohai, Dianrong and Sino Guarantee did not respond to requests for comment. The document, shared by a person with direct knowledge of the matter, listed the assets with boxes for potential investors to tick to indicate which ones they might be interested in - a relatively unorthodox fund raising process. When Reuters visited the hotel on Tuesday the investor meeting had finished, but two further people at the hotel confirmed it had taken place, asking not be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media. In October last year, Reuters reported, citing documents, that HNA had put up for sale property assets worth at least $11 billion. The documents listed more than 80 assets that HNA has either put up for sale or intends to sell. A few of those properties also appeared on HNA’s list on Tuesday, which did not detail the value of any assets.

14313,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Fiat Chrysler’s appeal in a class action lawsuit over allegations that its Jeeps and other trucks are vulnerable to hacking, one of the first legal cases involving automotive cyber security risks. The court’s action paves the way for an October trial in the litigation centering on the question of whether truck buyers can sue over hypothetical future injuries without having been actual victims of cyber security attacks on their vehicles. Fiat Chrysler has received widespread support from industry groups in the dispute. Three car owners from Illinois, Michigan and Missouri in 2015 sued the U.S. subsidiary of the Italian-controlled carmaker and Harman International Industries, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co that manufactures the Uconnect infotainment system installed in various Ram, Dodge, Jeep and Chrysler trucks.     According to the lawsuit, cyber criminals are able to gain access to the infotainment system, allowing them to take over safety-critical functions such as acceleration, braking, steering and ignition.     The plaintiffs allege that both companies knew about the defects for years, saying cyber security researchers revealed the vulnerabilities as early as 2011. The issue received attention when a 2015 article by technology magazine Wired showed researchers hacking a Jeep Cherokee while it was driving.     The consumers have said that, had the defects been disclosed, they never would have purchased the vehicles in the first place or paid less for them. They also said the defects reduce their vehicles’ resale value.     Fiat Chrysler and Harman have denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit meritless and saying the plaintiffs lack the necessary legal standing to bring the case. Fiat Chrysler in a statement said it looked forward to presenting its case at trial. “None of the more than 200,000 class members in this lawsuit have ever had their vehicles hacked, and the federal safety regulators at NHTSA (the U.S. National Highway Safety Administration) have determined that FCA US has fully corrected the issues raised by the plaintiffs,” the company said.     The vulnerabilities were fixed in a 2015 recall, when Fiat Chrysler issued free software updates for the roughly 1.4 million affected trucks. The NHTSA determined the issue to have been fully addressed.     But U.S. District Judge Michael Reagan in East St. Louis, Illinois, who oversees the litigation, in 2017 denied the companies’ request to dismiss the lawsuits.     Reagan certified classes of consumers for claims of fraudulent concealment, unjust enrichment and violation of various state and federal consumer protection laws. Reagan originally scheduled a jury trial for March, but due to scheduling conflicts on Monday moved the trial to October.
